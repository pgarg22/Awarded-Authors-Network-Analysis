'''Walter Whitman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ɪ|t|m|ə|n}}; May 31, 1819&nbsp;– March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist and journalist. A [[humanism|humanist]], he was a part of the transition between [[transcendentalism]] and [[literary realism|realism]], incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of [[free verse]].<ref name=Reynolds314/> His work was controversial in its time, particularly his 1855 poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', which was described as obscene for its overt sensuality. Whitman's own life came under scrutiny for his presumed homosexuality.

Born in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]] on [[Long Island]], as a child and through much of his career he resided in [[Brooklyn]]. At age 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. Later, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, and a government clerk.  Whitman's major poetry collection, ''Leaves of Grass'', was first published in 1855 with his own money and became well known. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American [[epic poetry|epic]]. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. During the [[American Civil War]], he went to Washington, D.C. and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded. His poetry often focused on both loss and healing. On the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom [[Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln|Whitman greatly admired]], he wrote his well known poems, "[[O Captain! My Captain!]]" and "[[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd]]", and [[Walt Whitman's lectures on Abraham Lincoln|gave a series of lectures]]. After a stroke towards the end of his life, Whitman moved to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral was a public event.<ref name=Loving480/><ref name=Reynolds589>Reynolds, 589.</ref>

Whitman's influence on poetry remains strong. [[Mary Berenson|Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe]] argued: "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without ''Leaves of Grass'' ... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him."<ref name="Reynolds, 4">Reynolds, 4.</ref> [[Modernism|Modernist]] poet [[Ezra Pound]] called Whitman "America's poet ... He ''is'' America."<ref name="ReferenceA">Pound, Ezra. "Walt Whitman", ''Whitman'', Roy Harvey Pearce, ed. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1962: 8.</ref>

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Walter Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in [[West Hills, New York|West Hills]], [[Huntington, New York|Town of Huntington]], [[Long Island]], to parents with interests in [[Quaker]] thought, Walter (1789–1855) and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873). The second of nine children,<ref>Miller, 17.</ref> he was immediately nicknamed "Walt" to distinguish him from his father.<ref name=Loving29>Loving, 29.</ref> Walter Whitman Sr. named three of his seven sons after American leaders: [[Andrew Jackson]], [[George Washington]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed at the age of six months. The couple's sixth son, the youngest, was named Edward.<ref name=Loving29/> At age four, Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to [[Brooklyn]], living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments.<ref>Loving, 30.</ref> Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status.<ref>Reynolds, 24.</ref> One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825.<ref>Reynolds, 33–34.</ref>

At age eleven Whitman concluded formal schooling.<ref>Loving, 32.</ref> He then sought employment for further income for his family; he was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] and [[printer's devil]] for the weekly Long Island newspaper the ''Patriot'', edited by Samuel E. Clements.<ref>Reynolds, 44.</ref> There, Whitman learned about the printing press and [[typesetting]].<ref>Kaplan, 74.</ref> He may have written "sentimental bits" of filler material for occasional issues.<ref>Callow, 30.</ref> Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of the [[Quaker]] minister [[Elias Hicks]] to create a plaster mold of his head.<ref>Callow, 29.</ref> Clements left the ''Patriot'' shortly afterward, possibly as a result of the controversy.<ref>Loving, 34.</ref>

===Early career===
[[File:Walt Whitman, age 28, 1848.png|thumb|upright|Whitman at age 28]]
The following summer Whitman worked for another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn.<ref name=Reynolds45>Reynolds, 45.</ref> His family moved back to West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] weekly newspaper the ''Long-Island Star''.<ref name=Reynolds45/> While at the ''Star'', Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances,<ref>Callow, 32.</ref> and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the ''[[New-York Mirror]]''.<ref>Kaplan, 79.</ref> At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the ''Star'' and Brooklyn.<ref>Kaplan, 77.</ref> He moved to New York City to work as a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]<ref>Callow, 35.</ref> though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where.<ref name=Kaplan81>Kaplan, 81.</ref> He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district,<ref name=Kaplan81/> and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the [[Panic of 1837]].<ref>Loving, 36.</ref> In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]].<ref>Callow, 36.</ref> Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.<ref>Loving, 37.</ref>

After his teaching attempts, Whitman went back to Huntington, New York, to found his own newspaper, the ''[[Long Islander News|Long-Islander]]''. Whitman served as publisher, editor, pressman, and distributor and even provided home delivery. After ten months, he sold the publication to E. O. Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839.<ref name=Reynolds60>Reynolds, 60.</ref> There are no known surviving copies of the ''Long-Islander'' published under Whitman.<ref>Loving, 38.</ref> By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in [[Jamaica, Queens]], with the ''Long Island Democrat'', edited by James J. Brenton.<ref name=Reynolds60/> He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841.<ref>Kaplan, 93–94.</ref> One story, possibly [[wiktionary:apocryphal|apocryphal]], tells of Whitman's being chased away from a teaching job in [[Southold, New York]], in 1840. After a local preacher called him a "[[Sodomy|Sodomite]]", Whitman was allegedly [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]]. Biographer [[Justin Kaplan]] notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter.<ref>Kaplan, 87.</ref> Biographer [[Jerome Loving]] calls the incident a "myth".<ref>Loving, 514.</ref> During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called "Sun-Down Papers—From the Desk of a Schoolmaster", in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841. In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career.<ref>Stacy, 25.</ref>

Whitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the ''New World'', working under [[Park Benjamin Sr.]] and [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]].<ref>Callow, 56.</ref> He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the ''[[The New York Aurora|Aurora]]'' and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''.<ref>Stacy, 6.</ref> While working for the latter institution, many of his publications were in the area of music criticism, and it is during this time that he became a devoted lover of Italian opera through reviewing performances of works by [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Donizetti]], and [[Verdi]]. This new interest had an impact on his writing in free verse. He later said, "But for the opera, I could never have written ''Leaves of Grass''".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Walt Whitman's Conversion To Opera|author=Brasher, Thomas L.|editor=Judith Tick, Paul E. Beaudoin|journal=Music in the USA: A Documentary Companion|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|page=207}}</ref>

Throughout the 1840s he contributed freelance fiction and poetry to various periodicals,<ref>Reynolds, 83–84.</ref> including ''[[Brother Jonathan (newspaper)|Brother Jonathan]]'' magazine edited by [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Merlob | first = Maya | editor2-last = Carlson | editor2-first = David J. | editor1-last = Watts | editor1-first = Edward | chapter = Chapter 5: Celebrated Rubbish: John Neal and the Commercialization of Early American Romanticism | title = John Neal and Nineteenth Century American Literature and Culture | publisher = Bucknell University Press | location = Lewisburg, Pennsylvania | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-61148-420-5 | page = 119n18}}</ref> Whitman lost his position at the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' in 1848 after siding with the free-soil "[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburner]]" wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper's owner, [[Isaac Van Anden]], who belonged to the conservative, or "[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Hunker]]", wing of the party.<ref>Stacy, 87–91.</ref> Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the [[Free Soil Party]], which was concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly colonised western territories. Abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] derided the party philosophy as "white manism".<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Louisa May Alcott on Race, Sex, and Slavery|author1=Alcott, L.M.|author2=Elbert, S.|date=1997|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555533076|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6g6kwxBDzxoC}}</ref>

===''Leaves of Grass''===
{{Main|Leaves of Grass}}
Whitman claimed that after years of competing for "the usual rewards", he determined to become a poet.<ref>Kaplan, 185.</ref> He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period.<ref>Reynolds, 85.</ref> As early as 1850, he began writing what would become ''Leaves of Grass'',<ref>Loving, 154.</ref> a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death.<ref>Miller, 55.</ref> Whitman intended to write a distinctly American [[epic poetry|epic]]<ref>Miller, 155.</ref> and used [[free verse]] with a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] based on the Bible.<ref>Kaplan, 187.</ref> At the end of June 1855, Whitman surprised his brothers with the already-printed first edition of ''Leaves of Grass''. George "didn't think it worth reading".<ref name=Callow226>Callow, 226.</ref>
[[File:Walt Whitman, steel engraving, July 1854.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Walt Whitman, age 35, from the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', Fulton St., Brooklyn, N.Y., steel engraving by Samuel Hollyer from a lost [[daguerreotype]] by [[Gabriel Harrison]]]]

Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' himself<ref name=Callow226/> and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs.<ref>Loving, 178.</ref> A total of 795 copies were printed.<ref>Kaplan, 198.</ref> No name is given as author; instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer,<ref>Callow, 227.</ref> but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself "Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1855/anc.00019.html|title=Review of ''Leaves of Grass'' (1855)|publisher=The Walt Whitman Archive}}</ref> The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines. The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines—1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called "[[Song of Myself]]". The book received its strongest praise from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends.<ref>Kaplan, 203.</ref> The first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest,<ref>Reynolds, 340.</ref> in part due to Emerson's approval,<ref>Callow, 232.</ref> but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly "obscene" nature of the poetry.<ref>Loving, 414.</ref> Geologist [[Peter Lesley]] wrote to Emerson, calling the book "trashy, profane & obscene" and the author "a pretentious ass".<ref>Kaplan, 211.</ref> Whitman embossed a quote from Emerson's letter, "I greet you at the beginning of a great career", in gold leaf on the spine of the second edition, effectively inventing the modern book [[blurb]]. [[Laura Dassow Walls]], Professor of English at the [[University of Notre Dame]], wrote, "In one stroke, Whitman had given birth to the modern cover blurb, quite without Emerson's permission."<ref>[[Laura Dassow Walls|Walls, Laura Dassow]] ''Henry David Thoreau - A Life'', 394. Chicago and London: [[The University of Chicago Press]], 2017. {{ISBN|978-0-226-59937-3}}</ref>

On July 11, 1855, a few days after ''Leaves of Grass'' was published, Whitman's father died at the age of 65.<ref>Kaplan, 229.</ref> In the months following the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it.<ref>Reynolds, 348.</ref> In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems,<ref>Callow, 238.</ref> in August 1856.<ref>Kaplan, 207.</ref> ''Leaves of Grass'' was revised and re-released in 1860,<ref>Loving, 238.</ref> again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>Reynolds, 363.</ref>

During the first publications of ''Leaves of Grass'', Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's ''Daily Times'' starting in May 1857.<ref>Callow, 225.</ref> As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials.<ref>Reynolds, 368.</ref> He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave.<ref>Loving, 228.</ref> Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.<ref>Reynolds, 375.</ref>

===Civil War years===

[[File:Manuscript Whitman Broadway 1861.jpg|thumb|Walt Whitman's handwritten manuscript for "Broadway, 1861"]]
As the [[American Civil War]] was beginning, Whitman published his poem "[[s:Leaves of Grass/Book XXI#Beat! Beat! Drums!|Beat! Beat! Drums!]]" as a patriotic rally call for the North.<ref>Callow, 283.</ref> Whitman's brother George had joined the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front.<ref>Reynolds, 410.</ref> On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' included "First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore", which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George.<ref name=Kaplan268>Kaplan, 268.</ref> He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way.<ref name=Reynolds411>Reynolds, 411.</ref> "Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people", Whitman later wrote,<ref>Callow, 286.</ref> he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound on his cheek.<ref name=Kaplan268/> Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington on December 28, 1862, with the intention of never returning to New York.<ref name=Reynolds411/>

In Washington, D.C., Whitman's friend Charley Eldridge helped him obtain part-time work in the army paymaster's office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals.<ref>Callow, 293.</ref> He would write of this experience in "The Great Army of the Sick", published in a New York newspaper in 1863<ref>Kaplan, 273.</ref> and, 12&nbsp;years later, in a book called ''Memoranda During the War''.<ref>Callow, 297.</ref> He then contacted Emerson, this time to ask for help in obtaining a government post.<ref name=Reynolds411/> Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to [[Salmon P. Chase]], Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref>Callow, 295.</ref>

The Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia,<ref>Loving, 281.</ref> and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of [[tuberculosis]] compounded by alcoholism on December 3.<ref>Kaplan, 293–294.</ref> That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum.<ref>Reynolds, 454.</ref> Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in the [[Department of the Interior]], thanks to his friend [[William Douglas O'Connor]]. O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', had written to [[William Tod Otto]], Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], on Whitman's behalf.<ref name=Loving283>Loving, 283.</ref> Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200.<ref name=Reynolds455>Reynolds, 455.</ref> A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a [[furlough]] because of his poor health.<ref name=Loving283/> By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship<ref name=Reynolds455/> and published ''Drum-Taps''.<ref name=Loving290>Loving, 290.</ref>

Effective June 30, 1865, however, Whitman was fired from his job.<ref name=Loving290/> His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior, former [[Iowa]] Senator [[James Harlan (senator)|James Harlan]].<ref name=Reynolds455/> Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who "were seldom at their respective desks", he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref>Loving, 291.</ref> O'Connor protested until J. Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General's office on July 1.<ref>Kaplan, 304.</ref> O'Connor, though, was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study, ''The Good Gray Poet'', in January 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Connor|first=William Douglas|url=https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html|title=The Good Gray Poet|publisher=Bunce and Huntington (The Walt Whitman Archive)|year=1866|location=New York}}</ref> The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet's nickname and increased his popularity.<ref>Reynolds, 456–457.</ref> Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of "[[O Captain! My Captain!]]", a relatively conventional poem on the [[death of Abraham Lincoln]], the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman's lifetime.<ref>Kaplan, 309.</ref>

Part of Whitman's role at the Attorney General's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential [[pardon]]s. "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, "and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary."<ref>Loving, 293.</ref> In August 1866, he took a month off to prepare a new edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher.<ref>Kaplan, 318–319.</ref> He hoped it would be its last edition.<ref name="Loving, 314">Loving, 314.</ref> In February 1868, ''Poems of Walt Whitman'' was published in England thanks to the influence of [[William Michael Rossetti]],<ref>Callow, 326.</ref> with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved.<ref>Kaplan, 324.</ref> The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer [[Anne Gilchrist (writer)|Anne Gilchrist]].<ref>Callow, 329.</ref> Another edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident.<ref>Loving, 331.</ref> As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872.<ref>Reynolds, 464.</ref> He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother, who was now nearly eighty and struggling with [[arthritis]].<ref>Kaplan, 340.</ref> He also traveled and was invited to [[Dartmouth College]] to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.<ref>Loving, 341.</ref>

===Health decline and death===
[[File:WhitmanHouse-CamdenNJ1.jpg|thumb|left|Whitman spent his last years at his home in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. Today, it is open to the public as the [[Walt Whitman House]].]]
After suffering a paralytic stroke in early 1873, Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother—George Washington Whitman, an engineer—at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey. His mother, having fallen ill, was also there and died that same year in May. Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed. He remained at his brother's home until buying his own in 1884.<ref>Miller, 33.</ref> However, before purchasing his home, he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother's home on Stevens Street. While in residence there he was very productive, publishing three versions of ''Leaves of Grass'' among other works. He was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Thomas Eakins]]. His other brother, Edward, an "invalid" since birth, lived in the house.

When his brother and sister-in-law were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street [[Walt Whitman House|(now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard)]].<ref>Haas, Irvin. ''Historic Homes of American Authors''. Washington, D.C.: The Preservation Press, 1991: 141. {{ISBN|0-89133-180-8}}.</ref> First taken care of by tenants, he was completely bedridden for most of his time in Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street.<ref>Loving, 432.</ref> She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals.<ref>Reynolds, 548.</ref> During this time, Whitman produced further editions of ''Leaves of Grass'' in 1876, 1881, and 1889.

While in [[Southern New Jersey]], Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of [[Laurel Springs, New Jersey|Laurel Springs]], between 1876 and 1884, converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home. The restored summer home has been preserved as a museum by the local historical society. Part of his ''Leaves of Grass'' was written here, and in his ''Specimen Days'' he wrote of the spring, creek and lake. To him, Laurel Lake was "the prettiest lake in: either America or Europe".<ref>{{cite web

As the end of 1891 approached, he prepared a final edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', a version that has been nicknamed the "Deathbed Edition". He wrote, "L. of G.

Whitman died on March 26, 1892.<ref>Callow, 363.</ref> An [[autopsy]] revealed his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal breathing capacity, a result of bronchial pneumonia,<ref name=Loving479/> and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The cause of death was officially listed as "[[pleurisy]] of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general [[miliary tuberculosis]] and parenchymatous nephritis".<ref name="Reynolds, 588">Reynolds, 588.</ref> A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; over 1,000 people visited in three hours.<ref name=Loving480>Loving, 480.</ref> Whitman's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him.<ref name="Reynolds, 588"/> Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at [[Harleigh Cemetery, Camden|Harleigh Cemetery]] in Camden.<ref name=Loving480/> Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments.<ref name=Reynolds589/> Whitman's friend, the orator [[Robert G.

Whitman's work breaks the boundaries of poetic form and is generally prose-like.<ref name=Reynolds314>Reynolds, 314.</ref> He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris.<ref>Kaplan, 233.</ref> He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution.<ref name="Loving, 314"/> He is often labeled as the father of [[free verse]], though he did not invent it.<ref name=Reynolds314/>

===Poetic theory===
Whitman wrote in the preface to the 1855 edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', "The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it." He believed there was a vital, [[wikt:symbiotic|symbiotic]] relationship between the poet and society.<ref>Reynolds, 5.</ref> This connection was emphasized especially in "[[Song of Myself]]" by using an all-powerful first-person narration.<ref>Reynolds, 324.</ref> As an American epic, it deviated from the historic use of an elevated hero and instead assumed the identity of the common people.<ref>Miller, 78.</ref> ''Leaves of Grass'' also responded to the impact that recent [[urbanization in the United States]] had on the masses.<ref>Reynolds, 332.</ref>

==Lifestyle and beliefs==
[[File:Whitman at about fifty.jpg|thumb|upright|Walt Whitman]]

===Alcohol===
Whitman was a vocal proponent of [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] and in his youth rarely drank alcohol. He once stated he did not taste "strong liquor" until he was 30<ref>Loving, 71.</ref> and occasionally argued for [[prohibition of alcohol|prohibition]].<ref>Callow, 75.</ref> One of his earliest long fiction works, the novel ''Franklin Evans; or, The Inebriate'', first published November 23, 1842, is a temperance novel.<ref>Loving, 74.</ref> Whitman wrote the novel at the height of popularity of the [[Washingtonian movement]], though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions, as was ''Franklin Evans''.<ref>Reynolds, 95.</ref> Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book<ref>Reynolds, 91.</ref> and called it "damned rot".<ref>Loving, 75.</ref> He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself.<ref>Reynolds, 97.</ref> Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including ''The Madman'' and a short story "Reuben's Last Wish".<ref>Loving, 72.</ref> Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol, enjoying local wines and champagne.<ref name="Binns">{{cite book |last1=Binns |first1=Henry Bryan |title=A life of Walt Whitman |date=1905 |publisher=Methuen & Co. |location=London |page=315 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/56536/56536-h/56536-h.htm#Page_315 |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Religion===
Whitman was deeply influenced by [[deism]]. He denied any one faith was more important than another, and embraced all religions equally.<ref name=Reynolds237>Reynolds, 237.</ref> In "Song of Myself", he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem "With Antecedents", affirming: "I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception".<ref name=Reynolds237/> In 1874, he was invited to write a poem about the [[Spiritualism]] movement, to which he responded, "It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude [[wikt:humbug|humbug]]."<ref>Loving, 353.</ref> Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none.<ref name=Reynolds237/> God, to Whitman, was both [[immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development.<ref name="Kuebrich">{{cite book|author-first=David|author-last=Kuebrich|chapter=Religion and the poet-prophet |editor-first=Donald D.|editor-last=Kummings|title=A Companion to Walt Whitman|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uTCiN347lMC&pg=PA211|access-date=August 13, 2010|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9551-5|pages=211–}}</ref> ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."<ref>{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |url = https://archive.org/details/americanphil_xxxx_2008_000_9069252 |url-access = registration |editor-first1= John |editor-last1= Lachs |editor-first2= Robert|editor-last2= Talisse |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0415939263 |page = [https://archive.org/details/americanphil_xxxx_2008_000_9069252/page/n335 310]}}</ref>

===Sexuality===
[[File:Whitman, Walt (1819-1892) and Doyle.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Whitman and [[Peter Doyle (transit worker)|Peter Doyle]], one of the men with whom Whitman was believed to have had an [[intimate relationship]]]]

Though biographers continue to debate Whitman's sexuality, he is usually described as either homosexual or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] in his feelings and attractions. Whitman's sexual orientation is generally assumed on the basis of his poetry, though this assumption has been disputed. His poetry depicts love and sexuality in a more earthy, individualistic way common in American culture before the [[medicalization]] of sexuality in the late 19th century.<ref>D'Emilio, John and Estelle B. Freeman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America''. University of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-14264-7}}</ref><ref name="Fone">{{cite book |last1=Fone |first1=Byrne R.

Whitman had intense friendships with many men and boys throughout his life. Some biographers have suggested that he did not actually engage in sexual relationships with males,<ref name="Loving19">Loving, 19.</ref> while others cite letters, journal entries, and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature of some of his relationships.<ref>Norton, Rictor "[http://rictornorton.co.uk/whitman.htm Walt Whitman, Prophet of Gay Liberation]" from ''The Great Queens of History'', updated November 18, 1999.</ref> English poet and critic [[John Addington Symonds]] spent 20 years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him.<ref name=robinson>Robinson, Michael.

In reply, Whitman denied that his work had any such implication, asserting "[T]hat the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely undream'd & unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd by me and seem damnable", and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children.

[[File:Walt Whitman and Bill Duckett.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Walt Whitman and Bill Duckett]]

Another possible lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=Henry  |title=Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780190288877 |page=289}}</ref> Their photograph (left) is described as "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire.<ref name="Bohan">{{cite book |last1=Bohan |first1=Ruth L. |title=Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920 |date=April 26, 2006 |publisher=Penn State University Press |location=University Park, PA |page=136 |edition=1st}}</ref> Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876.

There is also some evidence that Whitman had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, in the spring of 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual. He still had a photograph of her decades later, when he moved to Camden, and he called her "an old sweetheart of mine".<ref>Callow, 278.</ref> In a letter, dated August 21, 1890, he claimed, "I have had six children—two are dead". This claim has never been corroborated.<ref>Loving, 123.</ref> Toward the end of his life, he often told stories of previous girlfriends and sweethearts and denied an allegation from the ''[[New York Herald]]'' that he had "never had a love affair".<ref>Reynolds, 490.</ref> As Whitman biographer Jerome Loving wrote, "the discussion of Whitman's sexual orientation will probably continue in spite of whatever evidence emerges."<ref name=Loving19/>

===Sunbathing and swimming===

Whitman reportedly enjoyed bathing naked and sunbathing nude.<ref name="ErkkilaGrossman1996">{{cite book|editor1=Betsy Erkkila|editor2=Jay Grossman|first=Ed|last=Folsom|chapter=Whitman's Calamus Photographs|title=Breaking Bounds: Whitman and American Cultural Studies|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm9hQfVAxqYC&pg=PA213|year= 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976228-6|page=213}}</ref> In his work ''Manly Health and Training'', written under the pseudonym Mose Velsor, he advised men to swim naked.<ref name="Velsor2016">{{cite journal|last1=Velsor|first1=Mose|title=Manly Health and Training, With Off-Hand Hints Toward Their Conditions |url=https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/wwqr/article/25584/galley/133952/view/ |format=PDF |journal=Walt Whitman Quarterly Review |volume=33 |issue=3|year=2016 |pages=184–310 |issn=0737-0679 |doi=10.13008/0737-0679.2206 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In ''A Sun-bathed Nakedness'', he wrote,

{{Quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me ... Nature was naked, and I was also ... Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! – ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.}}

===Shakespeare authorship===
Whitman was an adherent of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]], refusing to believe in the historical attribution of the works to [[William Shakespeare]] of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. Whitman comments in his ''November Boughs'' (1888) regarding Shakespeare's historical plays:

{{Quote|Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism—personifying in unparalleled ways the medieval aristocracy, its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance (no mere imitation)—only one of the "wolfish earls" so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works—works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature.<ref>Nelson, Paul A.

===Slavery===
Like many in the [[Free Soil Party]] who were concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen exploiting the newly colonized western territories,<ref name="Klammer">{{cite book |last1=Klammer |first1=Martin |chapter=Free Soil Party |editor-last1=LeMaster |editor-first1=J.R. |editor-last2=Kummings |editor-first2=Donald D. |title=Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia| date=1998 |publisher=Garland Publishing |location=New York |url=https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_461.html |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref> Whitman opposed the extension of slavery in the United States and supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]].<ref name=Reynolds117>Reynolds, 117.</ref> At first he was opposed to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], believing the movement did more harm than good. In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their "[[wikt:ultraism|ultraism]] and officiousness".<ref>Loving, 110.</ref> His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own.<ref name=Reynolds117/> In 1856, in his unpublished ''The Eighteenth Presidency'', addressing the men of the South, he wrote "you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you". Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote<ref name=Reynolds473>Reynolds, 473.</ref> and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature; as [[David S. Reynolds|David Reynolds]] notes, Whitman wrote in prejudiced terms of these new voters and politicians, calling them "blacks, with about as much intellect and calibre (in the mass) as so many baboons."<ref>Reynolds, 470.</ref> [[George B. Hutchinson|George Hutchinson]] and David Drews have argued, without providing textual evidence from Whitman's own early writings or other sources, that what little that "is known about the early development of Whitman's racial awareness suggests that he imbibed the prevailing white prejudices of his time and place, thinking of black people as servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing, although he would remember individual blacks of his youth in positive terms".<ref name="Racial Attitudes">{{cite book |last1=Hutchinson |first1=George |last2=Drews |first2=David |chapter=Racial Attitudes |editor-last1=LeMaster |editor-first1=J.R. |editor-last2=Kummings |editor-first2=Donald D. |title=Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia| date=1998 |publisher=Garland Publishing |location=New York |url=http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_44.html |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Nationalism===
Whitman is often described as America's national poet, creating an image of the United States for itself. "Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, and the rest of the world in a subordinate position."<ref name="ijas.iaas.ie">Nathanael O'Reilly, "[http://ijas.iaas.ie/index.php/imagined-america-walt-whitmans-nationalism-in-the-first-edition-of-leaves-of-grass/ Imagined America: Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of 'Leaves of Grass{{'-}}]", ''Irish Journal of American Studies''.</ref><ref name="O'Reilly">{{cite journal |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Nathanael |title=Imagined America: Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of Leaves of Grass |journal=Irish Journal of American Studies |date=2009 |volume=1 |pages=1–9 |url=http://ijas.iaas.ie/imagined-america-walt-whitmans-nationalism-in-the-first-edition-of-leaves-of-grass/ |access-date=October 11, 2020}}</ref> In his study, "The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should look again at Whitman's nationalism: "Whitman's seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States ... [are] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away" (xv–xvi). Nathanael O'Reilly in an essay on "Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of ''Leaves of Grass''" claims that "Whitman's imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights."<ref name="ijas.iaas.ie"/> Whitman's nationalism avoided issues concerning the treatment of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay "Racial attitudes", "Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche." The authors concluded their essay with:<ref name="Racial Attitudes"/>
{{Quote|Because of the radically democratic and [[egalitarian]] aspects of his poetry, readers generally expect, and desire for, Whitman to be among the literary heroes that transcended the racist pressures that abounded in all spheres of public discourse during the nineteenth century. He did not, at least not consistently; nonetheless his poetry has been a model for democratic poets of all nations and races, right up to our own day. How Whitman could have been so prejudiced, and yet so effective in conveying an egalitarian and antiracist sensibility in his poetry, is a puzzle yet to be adequately addressed.}}

In reference to the [[Mexican-American War]], Whitman wrote in 1864 that Mexico was "the only [country] to whom we have ever really done wrong."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kummings |first1=Donald D. |last2=LeMaster |first2=J. R. |title=Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia |date=1998 |publisher=Garland |page=427}}</ref> In 1883, celebrating the 333rd anniversary of Santa Fe, Whitman argued that the indigenous and Spanish-Indian elements would supply leading traits in the "composite American identity of the future."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levin |first1=Joanna |title=Walt Whitman in Context |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=314}}</ref>

{{Quote|As to our aboriginal or Indian population — the Aztec in the South, and many a tribe in the North and West — I know it seems to be agreed that they must gradually dwindle as time rolls on, and in a few generations more leave only a reminiscence, a blank. But I am not at all clear about that. As America, from its many far-back sources and current supplies, develops, adapts, entwines, faithfully identifies its own — are we to see it cheerfully accepting and using all the contributions of foreign lands from the whole outside globe — and then rejecting the only ones distinctively its own — the autochthonic ones? As to the Spanish stock of our Southwest, it is certain to me that we do not begin to appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its race element. Who knows but that element, like the course of some subterranean river, dipping invisibly for a hundred or two years, is now to emerge in broadest flow and permanent action?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Folsom |first1=Ed |title=Walt Whitman's Native Representations |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=95–96}}</ref>}}

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Walt Whitman, 1940.JPG|thumb|Whitman was honored on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|'Famous Americans Series']] Postal issue, in 1940.]]
Walt Whitman has been claimed as the first "poet of democracy" in the United States, a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character. An American-British friend of Walt Whitman, [[Mary Berenson|Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe]], wrote: "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without ''Leaves of Grass'' ... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him."<ref name="Reynolds, 4"/>  [[Andrew Carnegie]] called him "the great poet of America so far".<ref>Kaplan, 22.</ref> Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry.<ref>Callow, 83.</ref> Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that "people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ".<ref>Loving, 475.</ref>

Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote, as the introduction for the 150th anniversary of ''Leaves of Grass'':
{{Quote|If you are American, then Walt Whitman is your imaginative father and mother, even if, like myself, you have never composed a line of verse. You can nominate a fair number of literary works as candidates for the secular Scripture of the United States. They might include [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Mark Twain|Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', and Emerson's two series of ''Essays'' and ''[[The Conduct of Life]]''. None of those, not even Emerson's, are as central as the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref>Bloom, Harold. Introduction to ''Leaves of Grass''. Penguin Classics, 2005.</ref>}}

In his own time, Whitman attracted an influential coterie of disciples and admirers. Other admirers included the [[Eagle Street College]], an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street, [[Bolton]], to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual "Whitman Day" celebration around the poet's birthday.<ref name="WWC">{{Citation |title=C.F.

=== Latin American poets ===
Whitman's poetry influenced Latin American and Caribbean poets in the 19th and 20th centuries, starting with Cuban poet, philosopher, and nationalist leader [[José Martí]] who published essays in Spanish on Whitman's writings in 1887.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Mary Edgar|title=Walt Whitman's Popularity among Latin-American Poets|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/977855|journal=The Americas|year=1952|volume=9|issue=1|pages=3–15|doi=10.2307/977855|jstor=977855|issn=0003-1615|quote=Modernism, it has been said, spread the name of Whitman in Hispanic America.

=== European authors ===
Some, like [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Edward Carpenter]], viewed Whitman both as a prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly [[socialism]].<ref>Robinson, Michael. ''Worshipping Walt''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010: 143–145. {{ISBN|0691146314}}</ref> Whitman also influenced [[Bram Stoker]], author of ''[[Dracula]]'', and was a model for the character of [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]. Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death.<ref>Nuzum, Eric.

===Film and television===
Whitman's life and verse have been referenced in a substantial number of works of film and video. In the movie ''[[Beautiful Dreamers]]'' (Hemdale Films, 1992) Whitman was portrayed by [[Rip Torn]]. Whitman visits an insane asylum in [[London, Ontario]], where some of his ideas are adopted as part of an [[occupational therapy]] program.<ref name="Britton">{{cite book |last1=Britton |first1=Wesley A. |editor-last1=LeMaster |editor-first1=J.R. |editor-last2=Kummings |editor-first2=Donald D. |title=Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia|chapter=Media Interpretations of Whitman's Life and Works |date=1998 |publisher=Garland Publishing |location=New York |url=https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_537.html |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

Whitman's poem "I Sing the Body Electric" (1855) was used by [[Ray Bradbury]] as the title of a short story and a short story collection.
