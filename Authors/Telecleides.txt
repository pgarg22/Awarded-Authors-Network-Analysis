'''Telecleides''' ({{lang-grc|Τηλεκλείδης}}) was an Athenian [[Old Comedy|Old Comic]] poet, and dates to the 440s and 430s BCE. Only six titles and a few fragments of his plays survive. One of his plays was ''[[The Amphictyons]]'', in which Telecleides presented a [[Golden Age]] of impossibly effortless plenty.  His other known plays are ''Apseudeis'', ''Eumenides'', ''Hesiodoi'', ''Prytanes'', and ''Sterrhoi''.

The standard edition of the fragments is Rudolf Kassel and Colin Austin (eds.), Poetae Comici Graeci.
