'''Sylvia Townsend Warner''' (6 December 1893 – 1 May 1978) was an [[England|English]] [[novelist]], [[poet]] and musicologist, known for works such as ''[[Lolly Willowes]]'', ''Whether a Dove or a Seagull'', and ''After the Death of Don Juan''.

==Life==
'''Sylvia Nora Townsend Warner''' was born at [[Harrow on the Hill]], [[Middlesex]], the only child of George Townsend Warner and his wife Eleanor "Nora" Mary (née Hudleston). Her father was a house-master at [[Harrow School]] and was, for many years, associated with the prestigious [[Harrow History Prize]] which was renamed the [[Townsend warner history prize|Townsend Warner History Prize]] following his death in 1916. As a child, Townsend Warner was [[Homeschooling|home-schooled]] by her father after being kicked out of kindergarten for mimicking the teachers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ellmann|first=Maud|title=Virginia Woolf: Writing the World|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2015|pages=77–78}}</ref> She was musically inclined, and, before World War I, planned to study in Vienna under [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]. She enjoyed a seemingly idyllic childhood in rural Devonshire, but was strongly affected by her father's death. She moved to London and worked in a munitions factory at the outbreak of [[World War I]].

In 1923, she met [[T. F. Powys]], whose writing influenced her own and whose work she in turn encouraged.<ref>Harman, Claire. [https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31804 'Warner, (Nora) Sylvia Townsend'] in ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> The two became friends, and her debut novel, ''[[Lolly Willowes]],'' was published shortly after in 1926. From her first work, it was clear that Warner's focus was on subverting societal norms; she would later heavily use the themes of rejecting the Church, a need for female empowerment, and independence in her works. It was at Powys' home that Warner first met [[Valentine Ackland]], a young poet; the two women fell in love, moving in together in 1930 and eventually settling at [[Frome Vauchurch|Frome Vauchurch, Dorset]], in 1937.<ref name="townsendwarner.com">{{Cite web|title=A short biography – The Sylvia Townsend Warner Society|url=http://townsendwarner.com/about-sylvia-townsend-warner/biography|access-date=2021-10-21|language=en-GB}}</ref> Her relationship with Ackland inspired many of Warner's works, and the couple collaborated on a collection of poems, ''Whether a Dove or a Seagull'', published in 1933.<ref name="townsendwarner.com"/> Warner and Ackland's relationship was tumultuous in part due to Ackland's infidelity, which included an affair with fellow writer [[Elizabeth Wade White]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last3=Granne|first3=Ailsa|last4=Judd|first4=Peter Haring|date=2020-04-15|title='The End of the Affair': A Correspondence between Valentine Ackland and Elizabeth Wade White, with an Introduction by Ailsa Granne and Peter Haring Judd|url=https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.14324/111.444.stw.2020.08|journal=The Journal of the Sylvia Townsend Warner Society|volume=19|pages=29–52|doi=10.14324/111.444.stw.2020.08|s2cid=218811995|issn=|via=ScienceOpen}}</ref> Alarmed by the growing threat of fascism, they were active in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]], and Marxist ideals found their way into Warner's works. Warner participated in the II International Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture, held in [[Valencia]] between 4 and 17 July 1937, while serving in the Red Cross during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. After the war, Warner and Ackland permanently returned to England, living together until Ackland's death in 1969. In 1950 and 1951 they rented [[Randall's Folly|Great Eye Folly]] at [[Salthouse]], where Warner wrote her final novel, ''The Flint Anchor'' (published 1954).<ref name="LN">{{cite web |title=Salthouse |url=https://www.literarynorfolk.co.uk/salthouse.htm |website=Literary Norfolk |access-date=23 May 2021}}</ref>

After Warner's death in 1978, her ashes were buried with Ackland's at St Nicholas, [[Chaldon Herring]], Dorset.<ref>{{Cite web|title=At home in Dorset – The Sylvia Townsend Warner Society|url=http://townsendwarner.com/about-sylvia-townsend-warner/dorset|access-date=2021-10-21|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Work==
Early in her career Warner researched 15th and 16th century music. From 1917 she was in regular employment as one of the editors of ''Tudor Church Music'',<ref name="Society">{{cite web | url=http://townsendwarner.com/biography.php | title=Biography | publisher=Sylvia Townsend Warner Society | date=2015 | accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref> ten volumes published by Oxford University Press in the 1920s with the support of the [[Carnegie UK Trust]].<ref name="observer">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/11/stile-antico-phoenix-rising-review | title=The phoenix rising | publisher=(www.theguardian.com) | work=[[The Observer|Observer]] | date=August 2013 | accessdate=10 August 2014 | author=Maddocks, Fiona}}</ref> The lead editor was initially Sir [[Richard Terry (musicologist)|Richard Terry]], who as the Master of Music at [[Westminster Cathedral]], had been a pioneer in the revival of Tudor vocal repertoire.

Warner was involved in travelling to study source material and in transcribing the music into modern [[musical notation]] for publication. Warner wrote a section on musical notation for the ''[[Oxford History of Western Music|Oxford History of Music]]'' (it appeared in the introductory volume of 1929).<ref>Buck, P. ed. Oxford History of Music, Introductory Volume. London: Oxford University Press, 1929.</ref>

Her first published book was the 1925 poetry collection ''The Espalier'', which was praised by [[A E Housman]] and [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]].<ref name=guard>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview35 Harman, Claire. 'Lightning from skies', in ''The Guardian'', 29 March 2008]</ref> She was encouraged to write fiction by [[David Garnett]].<ref name="jd">Jane Dowson.

These include a rejection of Christianity (in ''Mr Fortune's Maggot'', and in ''Lolly Willowes'', where the protagonist becomes a witch); the position of women in patriarchal societies (''Lolly Willowes'', ''Summer Will Show'', ''The Corner that Held Them''); ambiguous sexuality, or bisexuality (''Lolly Willowes'', ''Mr Fortune's Maggot'', ''Summer Will Show''); and lyrical descriptions of landscape.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} ''Mr Fortune's Maggot'', about a missionary in the Pacific Islands, has been described as a "satirical, anti-imperialist novel".<ref>Emily M.

Warner's short stories include the collections ''A Moral Ending and Other Stories'', ''The Salutation'', ''More Joy in Heaven'', ''The Cat's Cradle Book'', ''A Garland of Straw'', ''The Museum of Cheats''. ''Winter in the Air'', ''A Spirit Rises'', ''A Stranger with a Bag'', ''The Innocent and the Guilty'', and ''One Thing Leading to Another''. Her final work was a series of linked short stories set in the supernatural ''[[Kingdoms of Elfin]]''.<ref name="ds"/> Many of these stories were published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name="nyt">Dinnage, Rosemary. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/07/reviews/990307.07dinnagt.html ''An Affair to Remember''] (review of ''I'll Stand by You: Selected Letters of Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland'').

After the death of the novelist [[T. H. White]], Warner was given access to his papers.  She published a biography which ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared "a small masterpiece which may well be read long after the writings of its subject have been forgotten."<ref name="nybio">Allen, Walter. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F16F93F5F127A93C3AB178FD85F4C8685F9&scp=1&sq=%22lucky+in+art%22+AND+%22t.+h.+white%22&st=p "Lucky In Art Unlucky In Life"] (fee required), ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 April 1968; retrieved 10 February 2008.</ref> White's long-time friend and literary agent, David Higham, however, questioned Warner's work, suggesting a bias in her approach due to her own homosexuality: he gave Warner the address of one of White's lovers "so that she could get in touch with someone so important in Tim's story.  But she never, the girl told me, took that step.  So she was able to present Tim in such a light that a reviewer could call him a raging homosexual.  Perhaps a heterosexual affair would have made her blush."<ref>Higham, David. "Literary Gent", Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, Inc., New York, 1979, page 213</ref>

Warner produced several books of poetry, including ''Opus 7'', a book-length [[pastoral]] poem about an elderly female flower-seller.<ref name="mj" /> The critical and personal hostility that greeted the jointly authored ''Whether a Dove or a Seagull'' in 1933 effectively put an end to the public poetic careers of both Warner and Ackland. It was only with the posthumous publication of Warner's ''Collected Poems'' in 1982 that the extent and significance of her poetry became evident, with poems ranging in date from 1914 through to 1978. Ackland's selected poems, ''Journey from Winter'', were not published until 2008.<ref name=guard/>

Although Warner never wrote an autobiography, ''Scenes of Childhood'' was compiled after her death on 1 May 1978 at age 84, based on short reminiscences published over the years in the ''New Yorker''. She also translated ''[[Contre Sainte-Beuve]]'' by [[Marcel Proust]] from the original French into English.<ref name="mj" /> In the 1970s, she became known as a significant writer of feminist or lesbian sentiment,<ref name="mj" /> and her novels were among the earlier ones to be revived by [[Virago Press]]. Selected letters of Warner and [[Valentine Ackland]] have been published twice: [[Wendy Mulford]] edited a collection titled ''This Narrow Place'' in 1988, and ten years later Susanna Pinney published another selection, ''I’ll Stand by You''.
