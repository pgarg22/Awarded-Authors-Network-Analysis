'''Donald Alfred Davie''' (17 July 1922 – 18 September 1995)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/obituaries/donald-davie-73-poet-and-literary-critic-dies.html|title=Donald Davie, 73, Poet and Literary Critic, Dies|author=Sarah Lyall|date=23 September 1995|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=12}}</ref> was an English [[Movement (literature)|Movement]] poet, and literary critic. His poems in general are philosophical and abstract, but often evoke various landscapes.

==Biography==

Davie was born in [[Barnsley]], Yorkshire, a son of Baptist parents. He began his education at Barnsley Holgate Grammar School, and he later attended [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]]. His studies there were interrupted by service during the war in the Royal Navy in Arctic Russia, where he taught himself the language. In the last year of the war, in Devon, he married Doreen John.<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p. 727. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.</ref><ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''The Great Modern Poets'', p. 149. Quercus, 2006.</ref> He returned to Cambridge in 1946 and received his B.A., M.A. and PhD. In 1964 Davie was made the first Professor of English at the new [[University of Essex]]. He taught English there until 1968, when he moved to Stanford University, succeeding [[Yvor Winters]]. In 1978, he relocated to [[Vanderbilt University]], where he taught until his retirement in 1988.

He often wrote on the technique of poetry, both in books such as ''[[Purity of Diction in English Verse]]'', and in smaller articles such as "[[Donald Davie's Some Notes on Rhythm in Verse|Some Notes on Rhythm in Verse]]". Davie's criticism and poetry are both characterized by his interest in modernist and pre-modernist techniques. Davie argued that "there is no necessary connection between the poetic vocation on the one hand, and on the other exhibitionism, egoism, and licence".<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''The Great Modern Poets'', p. 149. Quercus, 2006.</ref> He writes eloquently and sympathetically about British modernist poetry in ''Under Briggflatts'', while in ''Thomas Hardy and British Poetry'' he defends a pre-modernist verse tradition. Much of Davie's poetry has been compared to that of the traditionalist [[Philip Larkin]], but other works are more influenced by [[Ezra Pound]]. He is featured in the ''[[Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse]]'' (1980).

Irish literary critic [[Denis Donoghue (academic)|Denis Donoghue]] described Davie's poetry as "an enforced choice between masturbation and happily wedded love" bereft of drama.<ref>Donoghue, Denis. "Ten Poets" (review of the 1985 collection ''Selected Poems'' by Donald Davie) in ''London Review of Books'' 7:19 (7 November 1985), 20–22.</ref>

Davie delivered the 1990 [[Thomas Warton#Warton Lectures|Warton Lecture on English Poetry]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Davie, Donald|title=Basil Bunting and his Masters|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|year=1991|volume=76|pages=225–236|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/2396/76p225.pdf}} (See [[Basil Bunting]].)</ref>

Writer Calvin Bedient discusses Davie's style in his book ''Eight Contemporary Poets''. He informs readers of Davie's specific thoughts by including quotes. According to Bedient, Davie said that "To make poetry out of moral commonplace, a poet has to make it clear that he speaks not in his own voice (that would be impertinent) but as the spokesman of a social tradition." It follows that Davie's voice is unique compared to the modern movement that was happening during his life.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}} His work does not epitomize contemporary poetry like that of many of his counterparts, but rather it calls upon a certain nostalgia for the past.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}} Davie's work is distinctly "English" sounding, as he uses English phrases and traditional language.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}} In particular, his work often reminds readers of the late Augustan poets, whose work is sophisticated and polished.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}} He writes in a similar style to [[Philip Larkin]] and [[Ted Hughes]], who were both alive during Davie's lifetime. In addition, Davie writes without fear of criticism. He uses a strong and confident voice to assert his thoughts and musings.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}
