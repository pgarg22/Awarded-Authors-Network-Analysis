==Biography==
Born in 1973 in [[Port of Spain]], Vahni Capildeo has lived in the United Kingdom since 1991.<ref name=Andrews />

They read English at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and were subsequently awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]]<ref>[http://www.rhodes-caribbean.com/register2.html Register of Caribbean Rhodes Scholars]. The Rhodes Trust.</ref> to pursue graduate work in [[Old Norse]] and translation theory, also at Christ Church/the Faculty of English Language and Literature, towards their DPhil, ''Reading Egils saga Skallagrímssonar: saga, paratext, translations'' (2001).<ref>[http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=OXVU1&docId=oxfaleph015291663 "Reading Egils saga Skallagrímssonar: saga, paratext, translations"], University of Oxford.</ref> 

They intermitted from a Research Fellowship at [[Girton College, Cambridge]], in 2000–04 to spend time in Trinidad and [[Jamaica]]. This produced ''No Traveller Returns'' (Salt, 2003),<ref>[http://www.saltpublishing.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=1876857889 "No Traveller Returns, Vahni Capildeo"], Salt Publishing.</ref> a book-length poem sequence characterised by a reviewer as "a discontinuous meditation on identity and self-awareness. These are merciless poems – mercilessly observant, mercilessly precise",<ref name=CaribbeanBeat66 /> and ''One Scattered Skeleton'', a non-fiction book on the palimpsestic nature of place, memory, and language that takes its title from a poem by the Guyanese poet [[Martin Carter]] and moves between the UK, [[the Caribbean]], and [[Iceland]]. Extracts from ''One Scattered Skeleton'' have appeared in ''London: City of Disappearances'' (ed. [[Iain Sinclair]]), ''Stand Magazine'', ''The Arts Journal'' (Guyana) and ''[[The Caribbean Review of Books]]''.<ref>[http://www.newsday.co.tt/features/0,134235.html "Issues of belonging in Capildeo’s ‘Houses’"], ''Trinidad and Tobago Newsday'', 7 January 2011.</ref>

''Person Animal Figure'', a set of 45 dramatic monologues in three voices, was published by Jeremy Noel-Tod's Landfill Press in 2005 (http://www.landfillpress.co.uk).

''Undraining Sea'' (completed 2005), a third poetry collection, was published in 2009.<ref>[http://www.eggboxpublishing.com/authors/show/vahni_capildeo "Vahni Capildeo..."] at Eggbox.</ref> Described in one review as "a wholly recommendable collection",<ref>Andrew Bailey, [http://toddswift.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/guest-review-bailey-on-capildeo.html "Guest Review: Bailey on Capildeo"], Eyewear Publishing, 19 May 2011.</ref> it is a three-section book that actively engages with [[William Carlos Williams]]'s ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''. This was followed in 2012 by ''Dark and Unaccustomed Words'' (completed 2008), which takes its title from [[George Puttenham]]'s 16th-century ''Arte of Poesie''. This was Puttenham's critical term for arcane or foreign imports into English. The collection was longlisted for the [[OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature]].<ref>[http://www.newsday.co.tt/features/print,0,174159.html "Three TT writers vie for literary award"], ''Trinidad and Tobago Newsday'', 28 February 2013.</ref> These poems demonstrate, for example, the feeling and scope of certain parts of speech (prepositions, adjectives), forms, voices, or attitudes.
Rights for both books (originally published by Eggbox) have reverted to the author.

A fifth book, ''Utter'', was published by [[Peepal Tree Press]] in 2013.<ref>[http://www.peepaltreepress.com/single_book_display.asp?isbn=9781845232139 Vahni Capildeo, ''Utter''], Peepal Tree Press.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p022k63w "Trinidad and Tobago: Vahni Capildeo – Utter"], ''Poetry Postcards'', BBC Radio, 10 July 2014.</ref> Reviewing the collection in ''The Caribbean Review of Books'', Vivek Narayanan wrote: "What we have here is not a set of conceits, or even concerns, but a system and a mythos entire, one that is delivered to us with such continuous and consistent lyrical intensity, both classical and contemporary, that it can appear as fissures of lightning on the page."<ref>[http://caribbeanreviewofbooks.com/crb-archive/reviews/turtles-all-the-way-down/ "Turtles all the way down"], ''Caribbean Review of Books'', November 2015.</ref> David Caddy in the magazine ''[[Tears in the Fence]]'' said: "Reading Vahni Capildeo’s ''Utter'' ... is an absolute joy, displaying the range and registers that the best of contemporary poetry should exhibit more fully. Capildeo is both Trinidadian and universal."<ref>[[David Caddy]], [http://tearsinthefence.com/2013/12/19/vahni-capildeos-utter/ "Vahni Capildeo’s Utter"], ''Tears in the Fence'', 19 December 2013.</ref>

''Simple Complex Shapes'', published by Tony Frazer's [[Shearsman Books]] in 2015, was written during Capildeo's time as the Judith E. Wilson Poetry Fellow in the Faculty of English, University of Cambridge. Jamie Osborn notes that this work " can be taken as a sequence of poems or one long poem describing a series of flights and falls from the moment of a touch in the dark through a day or days, a tangle of time, back into a dreaming sleep."<ref>Jamie Osborn, [http://themissingslate.com/2015/12/08/simple-complex-shapes-2/ "Simple Complex Shapes" (review)], ''The Missing Slate'', 8 December 2015.</ref>

==Awards==
In 2016, Capildeo became the third Caribbean poet in a row – after Jamaican-born poets [[Kei Miller]] and [[Claudia Rankine]] – to win the Forward Prize for best poetry collection, with ''Measures of Expatriation''.<ref>Sian Cain, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/20/trinidadian-poet-vahni-capildeo-wins-2016-forward-prize-poetry "Trinidadian poet Vahni Capildeo wins 2016 Forward prize for poetry"], ''The Guardian'', 20 September 2016.</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37428695 "Forward Prize: Capildeo leads poetry awards winners"], BBC News, 21 September 2016.</ref><ref>Tristram Fane Saunders, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/vahni-capildeo-wins-15000-forward-prize-for-poetry/ "Vahni Capildeo wins £15,000 Forward Prize for poetry"], ''The Telegraph'', 21 September 2016.</ref><ref>[[William Sieghart]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/22/why-vahni-capildeo-deserved-to-win-the-forward-prize-poetry "Why Vahni Capildeo deserved to win the Forward prize"], ''The Guardian'', 22 September 2016.</ref> The Chair of the Forward jury, [[Malika Booker]], said: "Vahni Capildeo’s Measure of Expatriation is a work that amazes. We found a vertiginous excitement in the way in which the book grasps its subject: the sense of never quite being at home. This is poetry that transforms. When people in the future seek to know what it's like to live between places, traditions, habits and cultures, they will read this. Here is the language for what expatriation feels like."<ref>Katherine Cowdrey, [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/vahni-capildeo-wins-forward-prize-best-collection-398371 "Trinidad's Capildeo wins Forward Prize for poetry"], ''[[The Bookseller]]'', 20 September 2016.</ref>
