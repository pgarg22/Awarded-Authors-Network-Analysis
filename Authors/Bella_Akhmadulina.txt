==Early life, education and works==
Bella Akhmadulina was born in Moscow on 10 April 1937, the only child of Akhat Valeevich Akhmadulin, a [[Volga Tatars|Tatar]] father and Nadezhda Makarovna Lazareva, a [[Russians|Russian]]-[[Italians|Italian]] mother.<ref name="The New York Times"/><ref name="ITAR-TASS"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Bella Akhmadulina|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0015262/bio|access-date=2020-12-16|website=IMDb}}</ref> They underwent evacuation to [[Kazan]] when [[World War II]] broke out.<ref name="The New York Times"/> 

Akhmadulina's literary career began when she was a school-girl working as a journalist at the Moscow newspaper, ''Metrostroevets'', and improving her poetic skills at a circle organized by the poet [[Yevgeny Vinokurov]]. Her first poems appeared in the magazine ''October'' after being approved by established Soviet poets. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} These first poems were published in 1955.<ref name="TODAY"/> Émigré critic [[Marc Slonim]] described her prospects as follows in 1964 (''Soviet Russian Literature''): "Her voice has such a purity of tone, such richness of timbre, such individuality of diction, that if her growth continues she will be able some day to succeed [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]]" as "the greatest living woman poet in Russia".<ref name="The New York Times"/>

After finishing school, Akhmadulina entered the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] from which she graduated in 1960. While studying at the institute, she published her poems and articles in different newspapers, both official and handwritten. She was the subject of criticism in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' in 1957.<ref name="ITAR-TASS"/> She was expelled in 1959 (but allowed re-entry as time progressed) as a result of her opposition to the persecution of [[Boris Pasternak]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/11144/|title=Great Russian Poetess Bella Akhmadulina Passes Away|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=29 November 2010|work=Russia-InfoCenter}}</ref> In 1962 the first collection of her poems, titled ''Struna'' (''The String''), was published<ref name="ITAR-TASS"/><ref name="Russia’s President and Prime Minister commiserate the death of Bella Akhmadulina"/> and was a resounding success.

===Translations===
The main themes of Akhmadulina's works are friendship, love, and relations between people. She wrote numerous essays about Russian poets and translators, some devoted to her close friend, [[Bulat Okudzhava]].

She translated into Russian poetry from France, Italy, Chechnya, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, and many others.

Akhmadulina wrote in a "resolutely [[apolitical]]" style.<ref name="The New York Times"/> She made use of imagery and humour in her work.<ref name="The New York Times"/> She used rhymed [[quatrain]]s in her early works, which discussed ordinary, yet imaginative occurrences from daily life in language that was full of both [[archaism]]s and [[neologism]]s.<ref name="The New York Times"/> Religion and philosophy became her themes as she aged and she wrote in longer forms.<ref name="The New York Times"/>
