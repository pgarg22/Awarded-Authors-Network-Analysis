'''Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea''' (''née'' '''Kingsmill'''; April 1661{{snd}}5 August 1720), was an English poet and [[courtier]]. Finch's works often express a desire for respect as a female poet, lamenting her difficult position as a woman in the literary establishment and the court, while writing of "political ideology, religious orientation, and aesthetic sensibility".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Anne Finch and her poetry: a critical biography|last=McGovern|first=Barbara|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0820314105|location=Athens|via=Google Books|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/annefinchherpoet00mcgo}}</ref> Her works also allude to other female authors of the time, such as [[Aphra Behn]] and [[Katherine Philips|Katherine Phillips]]. Through her commentary on the mental and spiritual equality of the genders and the importance of women fulfilling their potential as a moral duty to themselves and to society,<ref name=":0" /> she is regarded as one of the integral female poets of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration Era]]. Finch died in [[Westminster]] in 1720 and was buried at her home at [[Eastwell, Kent|Eastwell]], Kent.

== Biography ==
===Early years===
Finch was born Anne Kingsmill in April 1661 in [[Sydmonton]], Hampshire, in southern England. Her parents were Sir William Kingsmill and Anne Haslewood, both from old and powerful families. She was the youngest of three children, her siblings being William and Bridget Kingsmill. The young Anne never knew her father, as he died only five months after she was born. In his will, he specified that his daughters receive financial support equal to that of their brother for their education, which was an "unusually enlightened view for the times".<ref name=":0" />

Her mother remarried in 1662, to Sir Thomas Ogle, and later bore Anne Kingsmill's half-sister, Dorothy Ogle. Anne would remain close to Dorothy for most of their lives, inspiring poems such as "Some Reflections: In a Dialogue Between Teresa and Ardelia" and [http://poetrynook.com/poem/my-sister-ogle "To my Sister Ogle"].<ref name=":0" />

Finch's mother died in 1664. Shortly before her death she wrote a will giving control of her estate to her second husband. The will was successfully challenged in a [[Court of Chancery]] by Anne Kingsmill's uncle, William Haslewood. Subsequently, Anne and Bridget Kingsmill lived with their grandmother, Lady Kingsmill, in [[Charing Cross]], London, while their brother lived with his uncle William Haslewood.

In 1670, Lady Kingsmill filed her own Court of Chancery suit, demanding from William Haslewood a share in the educational and support monies for Anne and Bridget. The court split custody and financial support between Haslewood and Lady Kingsmill. When Lady Kingsmill died in 1672, Anne and Bridget rejoined their brother to be raised by Haslewood. The sisters received a comprehensive and progressive education, something that was uncommon for females at the time, and Anne Kingsmill learned about Greek and Roman mythology, the Bible, French and Italian languages, history, poetry, and drama.

=== At the court of Charles II ===
In 1682, Anne Kingsmill was sent to [[St James's Palace]] to become a [[maid of honour]] to [[Mary of Modena]] (wife of James, Duke of York, who later became King [[James II of England|James II]]). There she met the courtier [[Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea|Heneage Finch]], whom she married on 15 May 1684. It was a happy marriage and Anne wrote several love poems to her husband, most famous perhaps ''A Letter to Daphnis'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/50561|title=A Letter to Daphnis|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> though her most well-known works speak on her bouts of depression and her fervent belief in social justice for women.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The sisters remained in the Haslewood household until their uncle's death in 1682. 21 years old at the time, Anne Kingsmill then went to live at St James's Palace, joining the court of Charles II. She became one of six maids of honour to Mary of Modena, who was the wife of James, Duke of York, who would later become King James II.

Apparently, Anne's interest in poetry began at the palace, and she started writing her own verse. Her friends included [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]] and [[Anne Killigrew]], two other maids of honour who also shared poetic interests. However, when Anne Kingsmill witnessed the derision within the court that greeted Killigrew's poetic efforts (poetry was not a pursuit considered suitable for women), she decided to keep her own writing attempts to herself and her close friends. She remained secretive about her poetry until much later in her life, when she was encouraged to publish under her own name.

While residing at court, Anne Kingsmill met Colonel Heneage Finch, the man who would become her husband. A courtier as well as a soldier, Colonel Finch had been appointed [[Groom of the Bedchamber]] to James, Duke of York, in 1683. His family had strong Royalist connections, as well as a pronounced loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]], and [[Elizabeth Finch, 1st Countess of Winchilsea|his grandmother]] had become the Countess of Winchilsea in 1628. Finch met Kingsmill and fell in love with her, but she at first resisted his romantic overtures. However, Finch proved a persistent suitor, and the couple was finally married on 15 May 1684.

Upon her marriage, Anne Finch resigned her court position, but her husband retained his own appointment and would serve in various government positions. As such, the couple remained involved in court life. During the 1685 coronation of James II, Heneage Finch carried the canopy of the Queen, Mary of Modena, who had specifically requested his service.

The couple's marriage proved to be enduring and happy, in part due to the aspects of equality in their partnership. Indeed, part of the development of her poetic skills was brought about by expressing her joy in her love for her husband and the positive effects of his lack of patriarchal impingement on her artistic development. These early works, many written to her husband (such as "A Letter to [[Daphnis|Dafnis]]: April 2d 1685"), celebrated their relationship and ardent intimacy. In expressing herself in such a fashion, Anne Finch quietly defied contemporary social conventions. In other early works she aimed a satiric disapproval at prevailing misogynistic attitudes. Still, her husband strongly supported her writing activities.

Despite their court connections, Anne and Heneage Finch led a rather sedate life. At first they lived in Westminster; then, as Heneage Finch became more involved in public affairs, they moved to London. His involvement had increased when James II took the throne in 1685. The couple demonstrated great loyalty to the king in what turned out to be a brief reign.

=== Refusal to take Oath of Allegiance to King William ===
[[File:William and Mary.jpg|thumb|William and Mary]]
James II was deposed in 1688 during the "[[Bloodless Revolution]]". During his short reign, James fell under intense criticism for his autocratic manner of rule. Eventually, he fled England for exile in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]], France. As a result, the British Parliament offered [[William III of England|William of Orange]] the English crown. When the new monarchs, William and Mary, assumed the throne, [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oaths of allegiance]] became a requirement for both the public and the clergy. William and Mary were Protestants, and the Finches remained loyal to the Catholic Stuart court, refusing to take the oath. They also viewed their oaths to the previous monarchy as morally binding and constant. But such a stance invited trouble. Heneage Finch lost his government position and retreated from public life. As the loss of his position entailed a loss of income, the Finches were forced to live with friends in London for a period. However, while living in the city the couple faced harassment, fines and potential imprisonment.

In April 1690, Heneage Finch was arrested and charged with Jacobitism for attempting to join the exiled James II in France. It was a difficult time for Jacobites and [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjurors]] (those who had refused to take the oath of allegiance, such as the Finches), as their arrests and punishments were abusive. Because of his arrest, Heneage and Anne Finch remained separated from April until November of that year. The circumstances caused the couple a great deal of emotional turmoil. Living with friends in Kent while her husband prepared his defence in London, Anne Finch often succumbed to bouts of depression, something that afflicted her for most of her adult life. The poems that she wrote during this period, such as "Ardelia to [[Depression (mood)|Melancholy]]," reflected her mental state. Other poems involved political themes. All of her work was noticeably less playful and joyous than her earlier output.

=== Move to country estate ===
After Heneage Finch was released and his case dismissed, his nephew Charles Finch, the fourth Earl of Winchelsea, invited the couple to permanently move into the family's [[Eastwell Park]], Kent, estate. The Finches took up residence in late 1690 and found peace and security on the beautiful estate, where they would live for more than 25 years in the quiet countryside.

For Anne Finch, the estate provided a fertile and supportive environment for her literary efforts. Charles Finch was a [[patron of the arts]] and, along with Heneage Finch, he encouraged Anne's writing. Her husband's support was practical. He began collecting a portfolio of her 56 poems, writing them out by hand and making corrective changes. One significant change involved Anne's pen name, which Heneage changed from "Areta" to "Ardelia".

The peace and seclusion at Eastwell fostered the development of Finch's poetry, and the retirement in the country provided her with her most productive writing period. Her work revealed her growing knowledge of contemporary poetic conventions, and the themes she addressed included [[metaphysics]], the beauty of nature (as expressed in "A Nocturnal Reverie"), and the value of friendship (as in "The Petition for an Absolute Retreat").

=== Return to public life ===
[[File:Miscellany Poems on Several Occasions Title Page.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Title page of ''Miscellany Poems, on Several Occasions'', published in 1713.]]
By the early 18th century, the political climate in England had generally improved for the Finches. King William died in 1702, and his death was followed by the succession to the throne of Queen Anne, the daughter of James II, who had died in 1701. With these developments, the Finches felt ready to embrace a more public lifestyle. Heneage Finch ran for a parliamentary seat three times (in 1701, 1705, and 1710), but was never elected. Still, the Finches felt the time was right to leave the seclusion of the country life and move into a house in London.

In London, Anne Finch was encouraged to publish her poetry under her own name. Earlier, in 1691, she had anonymously published some of her poetry. In 1701 she published "The Spleen" anonymously. This well-received reflection on depression would prove to be the most popular of her poems in her lifetime. When the Finches returned to London, Anne acquired some important and influential friends, including renowned writers such as [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Alexander Pope]], who encouraged her to write and publish much more openly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

She was reluctant, as she felt the current social and political climate remained oppressive as far as women were concerned. (In her poem "The Introduction," which was privately circulated, she reflected on contemporary attitudes toward female poets.) When she published ''Miscellany Poems, on Several Occasions'' in 1713, the cover page of the first printing indicated that the collected works (which included 86 poems as well as a play) were "Written by a Lady." However, on subsequent printings, Finch (as Anne, Countess of Winchilsea) received credit as the author.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Lady Winchilsea ===
On 4 August 1712, [[Charles Finch, 4th Earl of Winchilsea]], died childless. This made Anne's husband, his uncle, the 5th [[Earl of Winchilsea]], and Anne, the Countess of Winchilsea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Anne Finch became Countess of Winchilsea upon the sudden and unexpected death of [[Charles Finch, 4th Earl of Winchilsea|Charles Finch]] on 4 August 1712. As Charles Finch had no children, his uncle Heneage Finch (died 1726) became the Earl of Winchilsea, making Anne the Countess. However, the titles came with a cost. The Finches had to assume Charles Finch's financial and legal burdens. The issues were eventually settled in the Finches' favour in 1720, but not before the couple had endured nearly seven years of emotional strain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

During this period, Heneage and Anne Finch faced renewed strains resulting from court politics. When Queen Anne died in 1714, she was succeeded by George I. Subsequently, a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] government, which was hostile to the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause, rose to power. The [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rebellion]], which took place in Scotland in 1715, further aggravated the tense political situation. The Finches became greatly concerned about their safety, especially after a friend, [[Matthew Prior]], who shared their political sympathies, was sent to prison.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Deteriorating health ===
All of her worries combined started to take a toll on Anne Finch's health, which began to seriously deteriorate. For years she had been vulnerable to depression, and in 1715 she became seriously ill. Her later poems reflected her turmoil. In particular, "A Suplication for the joys of Heaven" and "A Contemplation" expressed her concerns about her life and political and spiritual beliefs.

She died in Westminster, London, and her body was returned to Eastwell for burial, according to her previously stated wishes. Her husband produced an obituary that praised her talents as a writer and her virtues as an individual. A portion of it read, "To draw her Ladyship's just Character, requires a masterly Pen like her own (She being a fine Writer, and an excellent Poet); we shall only presume to say, she was the most faithful Servant to her Royall Mistresse, the best Wife to her Noble Lord, and in every other Relation, publick and private, so illustrious an Example of such extraordinary Endowments, both of Body and Mind, that the Court of England never bred a more accomplished Lady, nor the Church of England a better Christian."

=== Poetry rediscovered ===
The only major collection of Anne Finch's writings that appeared in her lifetime was ''Miscellany Poems, on Several Occasions''. Nearly a century after her death her poetic output had been largely forgotten, until the great English poet [[William Wordsworth]] praised her nature poetry in an essay included in his 1815 volume ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''.

A major collection titled ''The Poems of Anne, Countess of Winchilsea'', edited by [[Myra Reynolds]], was published in 1903. For many years, it was considered the definitive collection of her writings. It remains the only scholarly collection of Finch's poetry, and includes all of the poems from Miscellany Poems and poems retrieved from manuscripts. Further, Reynolds's impressive introduction did as much to re-establish Finch's reputation as Wordsworth's previous praise.

Later, The Wellesley Manuscript, which contained 53 unpublished poems, was released. Literary scholars have noted Finch's distinctive voice and her poems' intimacy, sincerity, and spirituality. They also expressed appreciation for her experimentation as well as her assured usage of Augustan diction and forms.

According to James Winn (The Review of English Studies, lix, 2008, pp 67–85), Anne Finch is the librettist of ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', with music by [[John Blow]]; the work is considered by some scholars to be the first true opera in the English language. In his critical edition of the opera for the [[Purcell Society]], Bruce Wood agrees with Winn.

In 1929, in her classic essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] both critiques Finch's writing and expresses great admiration for it. In Woolf's examination of the "female voice" and her search for the history of female writers, she argues that Finch's writing is "harassed and distracted with hates and grievances," pointing out that to Finch "men are hated and feared, because they have the power to bar her way to what she wants to do—which is to write." However, Woolf excuses the flaws she perceives in Finch's work by claiming that Finch surely had to "encourage herself to write by supposing that what she writes will never be published." She goes on to acknowledge that in Finch's work, "Now and again words issue of pure poetry…It was a thousand pities that the woman who could write like that, whose mind was turned to nature, and reflection, should have been forced to anger and bitterness." Woolf goes on in defence of her as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of women's writing. It is evident that Woolf sympathises deeply with Finch's plight as a female poet, and though she takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, she expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: "…when one comes to seek out the facts about Lady Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her." Woolf wishes to know more about "this melancholy lady, who loved wandering in the fields and thinking about unusual things and scorned, so rashly, so unwisely, 'the dull manage of a servile house.'"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woolf |first1=Virginia |title=A room of one's own ; Three guineas |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0192818392 |page=79}}</ref>

== Works ==
=== Themes ===
As a poet, Finch attained a modest amount of notoriety during her lifetime, which spanned the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In extension to her lyric poetry, odes, love poetry and prose poetry work, Finch's writing was considered to have fallen into the [[Augustan poetry|Augustan period]] (approximately 1660–1760). This is largely due to her work reflecting upon nature and finding both an emotional and religious relationship to it in her verse, consequentially commenting on the change in philosophical and political policy of the time. Later, literary critics recognized the diversity of her poetic output as well as its personal and intimate style. This style would earn greater attention after her death.

==== The Introduction ====
In her works, Finch drew upon her own observations and experiences, demonstrating an insightful awareness of the social mores and political climate of her era. But she also artfully recorded her private thoughts, which could be joyful or despairing, playful or despondent. The poems also revealed her highly developed spiritual side.

With these lines, written in the poem ''The Introduction'' by Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, readers are welcomed into a vibrant, emotional, and opinionated style. They are unapologetically let in on the distinctly female voice that is to come. Melancholy, full of wit, and socially conscious, Anne Finch wrote verse and dramatic literature with a talent that has caused her works to not only survive, but to flourish in an impressive poetic legacy throughout the centuries since her death.

==== The Spleen ====
Finch's range as a writer was vast.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} She experimented with the poetic traditions of her day, often straying from the fold through her use of rhyme, meter and content, which ranged from the simplistic to the metaphysical. Additionally, Finch wrote several satiric vignettes modeled after the short tales of French fabulist [[Jean de La Fontaine]]. She mocked La Fontaine's fables, offering social criticism through biting sarcasm. Finch's more melancholy fare, however, gained her wider acclaim. Her famous poems in this sullen vein include ''A Nocturnal Reverie'' and ''Ardelia to Melancholy,'' both depicting severe depression. Finch also skillfully employed the [[Pindar]]ic ode, exploring complex and irregular structures and rhyme schemes. Her most famous example of this technique is in ''The Spleen'' (first published in [[Charles Gildon]]'s ''Miscellany'' of 1701), a poetic expression of her first-hand experience of depression and its effects – a condition that was popularly [[Spleen#Society_and_culture|associated with the spleen]]:<ref name="Rogers1989">{{cite journal |last1=Rogers KM |title=Finch's "Candid Account" vs. Eighteenth–Century Theories of the Spleen |journal=Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature |date=1989 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=17–27 |jstor=24780450 |issn=0027-1276}}</ref>

What art thou, Spleen, which ev'ry thing dost ape?
Thou Proteus to abused mankind,

A calm of stupid discontent,
Then, dashing on the rocks wilt rage into a storm.
Trembling sometimes thou dost appear,
Dissolved into a panic fear;

This poem was first published anonymously, though it went on to become one of her most renowned pieces.  [[Virginia Woolf]] said of Finch, "a thousand pities that [her mind] should have been forced to [such] anger and bitterness" <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women|last=Gilbert|first=Sandra M.|publisher=Norton & Company|year=2007|location=New York, New York|pages=238}}</ref>

Despite her occasionally overtly melancholy outlook, as many prominent friends of hers pointed out, Anne Finch was a competent, effective writer and is known today as one of the most versatile and gifted poets of her generation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}
