Cato is also known for her work campaigning on environmental and conservation issues.<ref name= land>{{Harvnb|Land|2008| }}</ref>

==Life==

Cato was born in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] in South Australia, and was a fifth-generation Australian.  She studied English Literature and Italian at the [[University of Adelaide]], graduating in 1939, then completed a two-year course at the South Australian School of Arts. She was a cadet journalist on ''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'' from 1935 to 1941, and as an art critic from 1957 to 1958.<ref name= bio>{{Harvnb|ACT|2006| }}</ref>

Cato married [[Eldred De Bracton Norman]], and travelled extensively overseas with him.  They had one daughter and two sons.<ref name= land/> Dr Nancy Cato Norman died at Noosa Heads on 3 July 2000.

Cato's cousin was also named Nancy Cato and was host of children's TV show the ''[[Magic Circle Club]]'' in the mid-1960s.

==Literary career==

With [[Roland Robinson (poet)|Roland Robinson]] and [[Kevin Collopy]], in 1948 Cato was one of the founding members of the ''[[Lyre-Bird Writers]]'',<ref name= nsw>{{Harvnb|UNSW@ADFA|2007|Biographical Note}}</ref> an independent and cooperative group that formed to publish verse by Australian writers.  As a member of the [[Jindyworobak Movement]], Cato edited the 1950 ''Jindyworobak Anthology'',<ref name= land/> one of a series of anthologies produced to promote indigenous Australian ideas and customs, particularly in poetry.  She was actively involved in the [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]] and the [[Australian Society of Authors]] during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name= land/>

Cato's most famous work is her trilogy, known as ''[[All the Rivers Run]]''. It was originally published as three separate volumes: ''All the Rivers Run'' (1958), ''Time, Flow Softly'' (1959) and ''But Still the Stream'' (1962). However, since the 1970s it has been generally published as one large volume containing the three books. It was made into a TV mini-series ''[[All the Rivers Run]]'', which was broadcast in 1983.

Cato's other books include: ''Green Grows The Vine'', ''Brown Sugar'' and ''Mister Maloga'', which tells the story of Daniel Matthews and his [[Maloga Mission]] to Aboriginal people on the [[Murray River]] in Victoria.

Her book on unplanned development (environmental vandalism) in her home town of [[Noosa]] was first published in 1979. Three editions have been published to acclaim.

==Honours and recognition==

Cato became a local icon in the [[Noosa]] area of [[Queensland]], and has a park and restaurant named after her. The Noosa Parks Association made her a life member and an honorary park ranger for her work in conservation.<ref name= nsw/>

In 1984, she was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) for services to literature and the environment, and she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the [[University of Queensland]] in 1991.

In 2006 a new suburb of Franklin was proposed for [[Canberra]] with the streets named after Australian women writers.<ref name= act>{{Cite web |title= Public Place Names (Franklin) Determination 2006 (No 1) |publisher= Australian Capital Territory |url= http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/di/2006-215/current/pdf/2006-215.pdf |accessdate= 2008-04-07}}</ref> The suburb now includes ''Nancy Cato Street''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whereis.com/act/franklin-2913/nancy-cato-st |title=WhereIs.com |accessdate= 7 July 2016}}</ref>
