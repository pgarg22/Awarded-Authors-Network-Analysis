== Early life ==
Rabe was born in Dubuque, Iowa, the son of Ruth (McCormick), a department store worker, and William Rabe, a teacher and meat packer.{{Citation needed |date=August 2021}}

== Career ==
Rabe was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1965 and served in a medical unit during the [[Vietnam War]]. After leaving the Army in 1967, Rabe returned to [[Villanova University]], studying writing and earning an M.A. in 1968.{{Citation needed |date=November 2021}} During this time, he began work on the play ''Sticks and Bones'', in which the family represents the ugly underbelly of the [[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet|Nelson family]] when they are faced with their hopeless son [[David Nelson (actor)|David]] returning home from Vietnam as a blinded vet.

Rabe is known for his loose trilogy of plays drawing on his experiences as an Army draftee in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Sticks and Bones]]'' (1969), the [[Tony Award]]-winning ''[[The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel]]'' (1971), and ''[[Streamers (play)|Streamers]]'' (1976).  He has also written ''[[Hurlyburly]]'' (both the play and the screenplay for the film version), and the screenplays for the Vietnam War drama ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989) and the [[The Firm (1993 film)|film adaptation]] of [[John Grisham]]'s ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' (1993). Rabe also wrote a screenplay for ''[[First Blood]]'' with first [[Martin Bregman]] and then [[Mike Nichols]] interested in directing and the role of [[John Rambo]] written for [[Al Pacino]], but it was not filmed because Pacino found it too dark and declined to appear in it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=First Blood|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/56779-FIRST-BLOOD?sid=0506c692-2c7e-4866-aa90-000b66449e7e&sr=9.006926&cp=1&pos=0|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-11|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>
