'''Jacques Prévert''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒak pʁevɛʁ|lang}}; 4 February 1900 – 11 April 1977) was a French poet and screenwriter. His poems became and remain popular in the French-speaking world, particularly in schools. His best-regarded films formed part of the [[Poetic realism|poetic realist]] movement, and include ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' (1945). He published his first book in 1946.

==Life and education==
Prévert was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] and grew up in Paris. After receiving his ''Certificat d'études'' upon completing his primary education, he quit school and went to work in [[Le Bon Marché]], a major department store in Paris. In 1918, he was called up for military service in the [[First World War]]. After this, he was sent to the [[Near East]] to defend French interests there.

He died of lung cancer in [[Omonville-la-Petite]], on 11 April 1977. He had been working on the last scene of the animated movie ''[[Le Roi et l'Oiseau]]'' (''The King and the Mockingbird'') with his friend and collaborator [[Paul Grimault]]. When the film was released in 1980, it was dedicated to Prévert's memory, and on opening night, Grimault kept the seat next to him empty.

==Poetry==
When Prévert was attending primary school, he at first hated writing. Later, he participated actively in the Surrealist movement.<ref name=bio/> Together with the writers [[Raymond Queneau]] and [[Marcel Duhamel]], he was also a member of the Rue du Château group.<ref>[http://www.cine-zoom.com/theatre/2136-jacques-prevert-paris-la-belle.html?start=2 Jacques Prévert, PARIS THE BEAUTIFUL – The period of the Rue du Chateau]</ref> He was also a member of the [[agitprop]] theater company ''[[:fr:Groupe Octobre|Groupe Octobre]]'' where he helped craft a left-wing cinema in support of the causes of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Shaughnessy |first1=Martin |title=Jean Renoir |date=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=104}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blakeway |first1=Claire |title=Jacques Prévert: Popular French Theatre and Cinema |date=1990 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |page=140}}</ref> Prévert remained supportive of left-wing causes throughout his life.

{{French literature sidebar}}
Prévert's poems were collected and published in his books: ''Paroles'' (''Words'') (1946), ''Spectacle'' (1951), ''La Pluie et le beau temps'' (''Rain and Good Weather'') (1955), ''Histoires'' (''Stories'') (1963), ''Fatras'' (1971) and ''Choses et autres'' (''Things and Others'') (1973). His poems are often about life in Paris and life after the [[Second World War]]. They are widely taught in schools in France, and frequently appear in French language textbooks published worldwide. Some, such as "Déjeuner du Matin", are also often taught in American upper-level French classes, for the students to learn basics.

Some of Prévert's poems, such as "Les feuilles mortes" ("[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]"), "La grasse matinée" ("Sleeping in"), "Les bruits de la nuit" ("The sounds of the night") and "Chasse à l'enfant" ("The hunt for the child") were set to music by [[Joseph Kosma]]—and in some cases by [[Germaine Tailleferre]] of [[Les Six]], Christiane Verger, [[Marjo Tal]], and [[Hanns Eisler]]. They have been sung by prominent French vocalists, including [[Marianne Oswald]], [[Yves Montand]], and [[Édith Piaf]], as well as by the later American singers [[Joan Baez]] and [[Nat King Cole]]. In 1961, French singer-songwriter [[Serge Gainsbourg]] paid tribute to "Les feuilles mortes" in his own song "La chanson de Prévert".<ref name=cherries>[http://www.dutempsdescerisesauxfeuillesmortes.net/fiches_bio/oswald_marianne/oswald_marianne.htm The time of the cherry leaves, A site devoted to songs at the end of the Second Empire] (in French)</ref> "Les feuilles mortes" was also translated into German by the German Poet and [[Liedermacher]] [[Wolf Biermann]], titled "Welke Blätter", and was performed by him and others.

The British remix DJs [[Coldcut]] released their own version in 1993. Another German version has been published and covered by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser), which he named "Das welke Laub". "Les feuilles mortes" also bookends [[Iggy Pop]]'s 2009 album, ''[[Préliminaires]]''.

Prévert's poems are translated into many languages worldwide. Many translators have translated his poems into English. The poet and translator [[Suman Pokhrel]] has translated some of his poems into [[Nepali language|Nepali]].

==Film==
Prévert wrote a number of screenplays for the film director [[Marcel Carné]]. Among them were the scripts for ''[[Drôle de drame]]'' (''Bizarre, Bizarre'', 1937), ''[[Quai des brumes]]'' (''Port of Shadows'', 1938), ''[[Le Jour se lève]]'' (''Daybreak'', 1939), ''[[Les Visiteurs du soir]]'' (''The Night Visitors'', 1942) and ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' (''Les Enfants du Paradis'', 1945). The last of these regularly gains a high placing in [[List of films considered the best|lists of best films ever]] and earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.<ref name=bio>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Mi-So/Pr-vert-Jacques.html Encyclopedia of World Biography: Jacques Prévert]</ref><ref>[http://www.totalfilm.com/features/50-greatest-foreign-language-films/les-enfants-du-paradis-1945 50 Greatest Foreign Language Films] [[Total Film]], The modern guide to movies</ref>

His poems were the basis for a film by the director and documentarian [[Joris Ivens]], ''[[The Seine Meets Paris]]'' (''La Seine a rencontré Paris'', 1957), about the [[River Seine]]. The poem was read as narration during the film by singer [[Serge Reggiani]].<ref>[http://www.ivens.nl/film57.htm La Seine a rencontré Paris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414183825/http://www.ivens.nl/film57.htm |date=14 April 2012 }}</ref> In 2007, a filmed adaptation of Prévert's poem, "To Paint the Portrait of a Bird," was directed by Seamus McNally, featuring T.D. White and Antoine Ray- English translation by Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

Prévert had a long working relationship with [[Paul Grimault]], also a member of [[Groupe Octobre]]. Together they wrote the screenplays of a number of animated movies, starting with the short "The Little Soldier" ("Le Petit Soldat", 1947). They worked together until his death in 1977, when he was finishing ''[[Le Roi et l'oiseau|The King and the Mocking Bird]]'' (''Le Roi et l'Oiseau''), a second version of which was released in 1980. Prévert adapted several [[Hans Christian Andersen]] tales into animated or mixed live-action/animated movies, often in versions loosely connected to the original. Two of these were with Grimault, including ''The King and the Mocking Bird'', while another was with his brother [[Pierre Prévert]] ([[:fr:Pierre Prévert|fr]]).
