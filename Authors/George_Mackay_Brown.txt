'''George Mackay Brown''' (17 October 1921 – 13 April 1996) was a Scottish poet, author and dramatist with a distinctly [[Orkney|Orcadian]] character. He is seen as one of the great Scottish poets of the 20th century.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
George Mackay Brown was born on 17 October 1921,<ref>Maggie Fergusson, ''George Mackay Brown: The Life'', [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7195-5659-7}} p. 8.</ref> the youngest of six children. His parents were John Brown, a tailor and postman, and Mhairi Mackay, who had been brought up in Braal, a hamlet near [[Strathy]], Sutherland, as a native [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker.<ref>George Mackay Brown, ''For the Islands I Sing'', [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]], 1997, {{ISBN|0-7195-5628-7}} p. 25.</ref>

Except for periods as a mature student in mainland Scotland, Brown lived all his life in the town of [[Stromness]] in the [[Orkney]] islands. One of his Stromness neighbours was his friend the artist [[Sylvia Wishart]]. Due to illness his father was restricted in his work and received no pension. The family had a history of depression<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 22.</ref> and Mackay's uncle, Jimmy Brown, may have committed suicide: his body was found in Stromness harbour in 1935.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 36.</ref> George Mackay Brown's youth was spent in poverty.<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 16.</ref> During that period he contracted [[tuberculosis]]. 

Brown's illness kept him from entering the army at the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and afflicted him so badly he could not live a normal working life.<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 57.</ref> However, this gave him time and space in which to write. He started work in 1944 with ''[[The Orkney Herald]]'', writing on Stromness news,<ref>Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, ''Interrogation of Silence'', [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-7195-5929-4}} p. 13.</ref> and soon became a prolific journalist.<ref>Rowena Murray and Brian Murray p. 30.</ref> He was encouraged in writing poetry by [[Francis Scarfe]], who was billeted in the Browns' house for over a year from April 1944.<ref>Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, p. 39.</ref> After that he was helped in developing as a writer by [[Ernest Marwick]], whose criticism he valued, and by [[Robert Rendall]].<ref>Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, pp. 39 and 40.</ref>

In 1947, Stromness voted to allow pubs to open again, the town having been "dry" since the 1920s. When the first bar opened in 1948, Mackay Brown first tasted alcohol. He found alcoholic drinks "a revelation; they flushed my veins with happiness; they washed away all cares and shyness and worries. I remember thinking to myself 'If I could have two pints of beer every afternoon, life would be a great happiness'".<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 67.</ref><ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 89.</ref> Alcohol played a considerable part in his life, but he says, "I never became an alcoholic, mainly because my guts quickly stalled."<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 70.</ref>

===Higher education and beginnings as poet===
Brown was a mature student at [[Newbattle Abbey College]] in the 1951–1952 session,<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 100.</ref> where the poet [[Edwin Muir]], who had a great influence on his life as a writer, was warden.<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 92.</ref> His return for the following session was interrupted by recurrent [[tuberculosis]].<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 122.</ref>

Having had poems published in several periodicals, his first volume of them, ''The Storm'', appeared with the Orkney Press in 1954. Muir wrote in the foreword: "Grace is what I find in these poems.". Only three hundred copies were printed, and the imprint sold out within a fortnight. It was acclaimed in the local press.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 119 and 128.</ref>

Brown studied English literature at the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 114.</ref> After publication of poems in a literary magazine, with the help of Muir,<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 134.</ref> Brown had a second volume, ''Loaves and Fishes'', published by the [[Hogarth Press]] in 1959. It was warmly received.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 156.</ref>

During this period he met many of the Scottish poets of his time – [[Sydney Goodsir Smith]], [[Norman MacCaig]], [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Tom_Scott_(poet)|Tom Scott]] and others – with whom he often drank in [[Rose Street]], Edinburgh.<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 122.</ref> Here he also met [[Stella Cartwright]], described as "The Muse in Rose Street". Brown was briefly engaged to her and began a correspondence that continued until her death in 1985.<ref>George Mackay Brown, pp. 136 and 139.</ref>

In late 1960, Brown commenced teacher training at [[Moray House College of Education]], but ill health prevented him remaining in Edinburgh. On his recovery in 1961, he found he was not suited to teaching and returned late in the year to his mother's house in Stromness, unemployed.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 164 and 168.</ref> At this juncture he was received into the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], being [[baptised]] on 23 December and taking [[Eucharist|communion]] the next day. This followed about 25 years of pondering his religious beliefs. The conversion was not marked by any change in his daily habits, including his drinking.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 168 and 170.</ref>

===Maturity as poet===
After a period of unemployment and rejection of a volume of his poetry by the Hogarth Press,<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 170.</ref> Brown did a postgraduate study on [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], although such work was not to his taste.<ref>George Mackay Brown, p. 173.</ref> This provided some occupation and income until 1964, when a volume of poetry, ''The Year of the Whale'', was accepted.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 173 and 179.</ref>

Brown now found himself able to support himself financially for the first time, as he received new commissions.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 181.</ref> He received a bursary from the [[Scottish Arts Council]] in December 1965<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 184.</ref> as he was working on the volume of short stories, ''A Calendar of Love'', which was issued to critical acclaim in February 1967.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 185.</ref> He was still troubled by excessive drinking,<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 186.</ref> and that of Stella Cartwright.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 188.</ref> Later that year came the death of his mother, who had supported him despite disapproving of his drinking; she left an estate of £4.<ref>Ron Ferguson, ''George Mackay Brown: The Wound and the Gift'', [[Saint Andrew Press]], 2011, {{ISBN|978 0 7152 0935 6}} pp. 265–267.</ref>

Meanwhile he had been working on ''An Orkney Tapestry'', which includes essays on Orkney and more imaginative pieces, illustrated by Syvia Wishart.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 199 and 205.</ref> The year 1968 also saw his one visit to Ireland, on a bursary from the [[Society of Authors]]. He met [[Seamus Heaney]] there, although his nervous condition reduced his ability to enjoy the visit.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 201–203.</ref>

In 1969, his short-story collection ''A Time to Keep'' received a positive welcome. The poet [[Charles Causley]] said, "I don't know anyone writing in this particular genre today who comes within a thousand miles of him."<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 194.</ref> This was also the year in which he finished working on a six-part cycle of poems about [[Rackwick]], published in 1971 as ''Fishermen with Ploughs''.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 210.</ref> Meanwhile, ''An Orkney Tapestry'' was proving to be a commercial success.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 212.</ref>

By the late 1960s Brown's poetry was renowned internationally, so that the American poet [[Robert Lowell]], for example, came to Orkney expressly to meet him.<ref>S. R. Green, ''A Clamjamfray of Poets'', [[The Saltire Society]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85411-098-8}} p. 77–78.</ref>

During the summer of 1970, Brown met the musician [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] in Rackwick. Subsequently, Davies, who came to live in Rackwick, based a number of his works on the poetry and prose of George Mackay Brown.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 213–216, etc.</ref>

Brown was now working on his first novel ''Greenvoe'', the story of an imaginary Orkney community menaced by an undefined project called 'Operation Black Star'. The characters, with one exception, are not portrayed in any psychological depths.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 217.</ref> The exception is Mrs Mckee, mother of the (alcoholic) minister; Brown had intended her to be a minor character but he said of her, "I grew to love her more and more as the novel unfolded".<ref>Ron Ferguson, p. 297.</ref> ''The Dictionary of Literary Biography'' says that ''Greenvoe'' "ranks ... among the great prose poems of this century".<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 193.</ref> When the novel was published in May 1972 it appeared prophetic because of the oil exploration beginning in the Orkney area.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 221–222</ref> Brown found the resultant degree of celebrity a trial.<ref>Maggie Fergusson pp. 225–229.</ref>

The story of the life of [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney]] was one to which Brown frequently turned,<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 18.</ref> and it was the theme of his next novel, ''[[Magnus (novel)|Magnus]]'', published in 1973.<ref name="auto">Maggie Fergusson p. 229.</ref> The story of Magnus's life is told in the [[Orkneyinga saga]].<ref>Anonymous, ''Orkneyinga Saga'', [[Penguin (publisher)|Penguin]], 1978, p. 76-97.</ref> The novel examined the themes of sanctity and self-sacrifice.<ref name="auto"/> Brown takes the theme of sacrifice into the 20th century by inserting in journalistic language an account of the death of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]].<ref name="auto1">Ron Ferguson, p. 241.</ref> While some critics see the work as "disjointed",<ref name="auto1"/> Peter Maxwell Davies, for example, marks it as Brown's greatest achievement. Davies used it as the basis of his opera ''[[The Martyrdom of St Magnus]]''.<ref name="auto2">Maggie Fergusson, p. 232.</ref>

Brown was awarded an [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 1974 [[New Year Honours|New Year Honours List]]. The period after completing ''Magnus'', however, was marked by one of Brown's acute periods of mental distress.<ref name="auto2"/> Yet he maintained a stream of writing: poetry, children's stories, and a weekly column in the local newspaper, [[The Orcadian]], which ran from 1971 to the end of his life.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 234.</ref> A first selection of them appeared as ''Letter from Hamnavoe'' in 1975.<ref>Ron Ferguson, p. xvi.</ref>

In mid-1976, Brown met Nora Kennedy, a [[Vienna|Viennese]] woman [[jeweller]] and [[silversmith]] who was moving to [[South Ronaldsay]]. They had a brief affair and remained friends for the rest of his life. He said in early 1977 that this had been his most productive winter as a writer.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 238–242.</ref>

===Later life and death===
By early 1977, he was entering a period of depression which lasted intermittently for almost a decade, but maintained his working routine throughout.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 242-244</ref> He also suffered from severe [[bronchial]] problems, his condition becoming so serious that in early 1981 he was given the [[Last Rites|Last Sacraments]].<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 245.</ref>

These years saw him working on ''Time in a Red Coat'', a novel Brown called "more a sombre fable",<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 247–248.</ref> a meditation on the passage of time.<ref name="auto3">Ron Ferguson p. 36.</ref> It has been called "a novel in which the poet" – Brown as poet – "assumes an undoubted authority."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n12/stephen-bann/red. |title=London Review of Books}}</ref>

Two of the important women in Brown's life died about this time. [[Norah Smallwood]], who had worked for his publishers [[Chatto & Windus]] and helped and encouraged him over the years, died in 1984.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 251 and 268.</ref> The other was Stella Cartwright, who died the next year.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 257.</ref> It was after her death that Brown began ''For the Islands I Sing'', an autobiography not published until after his death.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 258,</ref> where Cartwright receives more space than any other individual,<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 259.</ref> although he did not attend her funeral.<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 298.</ref>

Brown later formed an intense, platonic attachment to Kenna Crawford, to whom he dedicated ''The Golden Bird: Two Orkney Stories'' and some poems in the volume ''The wreck of the Archangel''.<ref>Ron Ferguson, pp. 264 and 298.</ref> She bore a strong resemblance to Stella Cartwright.<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 283.</ref> ''The Golden Bird'' won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].<ref>Ron Ferguson, p. 298.</ref>

Between 1987 and 1989, Brown travelled to [[Nairn]], including a visit to [[Pluscarden Abbey]], to [[Shetland]] and to [[Oxford]], making it the longest time he had left Orkney since his earlier studies in Edinburgh. The Oxford visit coincided with the centenary of the death of Gerard Manley Hopkins.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 265, 271 and 273.</ref>

Shortly afterwards, Brown was diagnosed with [[bowel cancer]], which required two major operations in 1990 and a lengthy stay in [[Foresterhill]] Hospital, [[Aberdeen]].<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 275 and 276.</ref> In his final years Brown wrote two more novels, ''Vinland'' and ''Beside the Ocean of Time''.<ref name="auto4">Maggie Fergusson, pp. 278 and 280.</ref> ''Vinland'', which won Brown a £1,000 award from the [[Scottish Arts Council]],<ref>Ron Ferguson, p. 358.</ref> traces the life of Ranald Sigmundson, a fictional character from the Viking era. ''Beside the Ocean of Time'' covers over 800 years of Orkney history through the dreams of an Orkney schoolboy.<ref name="auto4"/> It meditates on the nature of time.<ref name="auto3"/> It won the [[Saltire Society Literary Awards|Saltire Scottish Book of the Year Award]] for 1994 and was listed for the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker prize for fiction]],<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 283.</ref> which caused Brown acute anxiety.<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 345.</ref>

During his last years Brown remained in his home, cared for by a network of friends, including Surinder Punjya<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 278.</ref> (later principal of [[The Nesbitt Centre]], Hong Kong), [[Gunnie Moberg]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gunnie-moberg-399132.html |title=Gunnie Moberg |date=6 November 2007 |website=The Independent}}</ref> and Renée Simm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/renee-simm-515782.html |title=Renee Simm |date=18 November 2005 |website=The Independent}}</ref> He continued working, writing the poems of ''Following a Lark'' and preparing the book for publication. The first copies were delivered to his home on the day he died,<ref>Maggie Fergusson, pp. 285 and 287.</ref> 13 April 1996, after a short illness.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-george-mackay-brown-1305027.html |title=Obituary: George Mackay Brown |date=15 April 1996 |website=The Independent}}</ref> He was buried on 16 April, the feast day of [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney|Saint Magnus]], with a funeral service at the [[Church of Scotland]]'s [[St Magnus Cathedral]], presided over by Father [[Mario Conti]], Father Michael Spencer, and his later biographer Ron Ferguson.<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 363.</ref> Peter Maxwell Davies played ''Farewell to Stromness''.<ref>Maggie Fergusson, p. 289.</ref> His gravestone quotes the last two lines of his 1996 poem, "A work for poets":<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 288.</ref>

In 2005, a memorial plaque to Brown was unveiled at the [[Writers' Museum]] in the Royal Mile, Edinburgh.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgemackaybrown.co.uk/Timeline.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008075841/http://www.georgemackaybrown.co.uk/Timeline.htm |url-status=dead |title=Timeline of George Mackay Brown |archive-date=8 October 2006}}</ref> It bears a quotation from his best-known poem, "[[Hamnavoe (poem)|Hamnavoe]]":
<poem>    In the fire of images
    Gladly I put my hand.′</poem>

==Work==
Brown's poetry and prose have been seen as characterised by "the absence of frills and decoration; the lean simplicity of description, colour, shape and action reduced to essentials, which heightens the reality of the thing observed,"<ref>S. R. Green, p. 84.</ref> while "his poems became informed by a unique voice that was his alone, controlled and dispassionate, which allowed every word to play its part in the narrative scheme of the unfolding poem."<ref>S. R. Green, p. 85.</ref>

Brown gained most inspiration from his native islands, for poems, stories and novels that ranged over time. He drew on the Icelandic ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', especially in his novel ''[[Magnus (novel)|Magnus]]''. Seamus Heaney said Brown's works transformed life by "passing everything through the eye of the needle of Orkney".<ref>Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, p. 168.</ref>

==Biographies==
His autobiography, ''For the Islands I Sing'', appeared shortly after his death.<ref>Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, p. 266.</ref> A literary biography, ''Interrogation of Silence'' by Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, ensued in 2004, ''George Mackay Brown: The Life'', a more personal biography by Maggie Fergusson, in 2006, and ''George Mackay Brown: The Wound and the Gift'' by Ron Ferguson, a study of Brown's spiritual journey including his controversial move from [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]], in 2011.
