{{short description|American poet}}
'''Peter Seaton''' (December 16, 1942 &ndash; May 18, 2010) was an [[American poet]] associated with the first wave of [[Language poetry]] in the 1970s. During the opening and middle years of Language poetry many of his long prose poems were published, widely read and influential.<ref name="fait accompli">[http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/2010/06/i-received-email-from-ron-silliman.html Fait Accompli: Wednesday June 23, 2010]</ref> Seaton was also a frequent contributor to [[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]], one of the influential magazines and theoretical venues for Language poetry, co-edited by [[Charles Bernstein]].<ref>[http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/daily/201006.php#24_15:30 In Memoriam: Peter Seaton (1942-2010] this was posted on the "PennSound Daily" site June 24, 2010</ref> In 1978, Bernstein published Seaton's first book of poetry, ''Agreement'', the same year that L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazine made its first appearance. Some of Seaton's work from this time has been reprinted in ''The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book'' (1984).

Seaton became an active participant in the thriving poetry scene in [[New York City]] during the 1960s. He shared this keen interest with [[Nick Piombino]] while both were attending [[City College of New York]] in the early-1960s, and they were to form a close friendship in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="fait accompli"/>  After graduation in 1964 both he and Piombino, who would himself become an important member of the Language poets, often attended "readings together at [[St. Mark's Poetry Project]], reading ''The World'' magazine and other poetry magazines and discussing them avidly".<ref name="fait accompli"/> They also did some writing collaborations and film experiments together in the late-1960s and early-1970s, heavily influenced by [[Stan Brakhage]] who would deeply influence the work of many of the poets involved in the ''Language'' movement.<ref name="fait accompli"/> Piombino and Seaton's friendship continued up through to the establishment of [[This (magazine)|This magazine]] in the early-1970s, and ''L=A-N=G=U=A=G=E'' magazine up to the early 80's.

Peter Seaton died in [[New York City]] on May 18, 2010  of an apparent heart attack.<ref>[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog/#06-25-10 Charles Bernstein Weblog: June 25, 2010]</ref>
