'''Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti''' ({{IPA-it|fiˈlippo tomˈmaːzo mariˈnetti|lang}}; 22 December 1876 – 2 December 1944) was an Italian poet, editor, art theorist, and founder of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement. He was associated with the [[utopian]] and [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] artistic and literary community [[Abbaye de Créteil]] between 1907 and 1908. Marinetti is best known as the author of the first ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', which was written and published in 1909, and as a co-author of the [[Fascist Manifesto]], in 1919.

==Childhood and adolescence==
Emilio Angelo Carlo Marinetti (some documents give his name as "Filippo Achille Emilio Marinetti") spent the first years of his life in [[Alexandria]], [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]], where his father (Enrico Marinetti) and his mother (Amalia Grolli) lived together ''more uxorio'' (as if married). Enrico was a lawyer from [[Piedmont]], and his mother was the daughter of a literary professor from [[Milan]]. They had come to Egypt in 1865, at the invitation of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]], to act as legal advisers for foreign companies that were taking part in his modernization program.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Berghaus, Günther|title=Filippo Tommaso Marinetti: Critical Writings|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=9780374706944|chapter=F.T. Marinetti (1876–1944): A Life Between Art and Politics|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-B9EJGYbAMC&pg=PT14}}</ref>

His love for literature developed during the school years. His mother was an avid reader of poetry, and introduced the young Marinetti to the Italian and European classics. At age seventeen he started his first school magazine, ''Papyrus'';<ref>{{Cite book|author=Somigli, Luca|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885–1915|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2003|isbn=9780802037619|pages=97–98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQnGUy57jSsC&pg=PA97}}</ref> the [[Jesuits]] threatened to expel him for publicizing [[Émile Zola]]'s scandalous novels in the school.

He first studied in Egypt then in Paris, obtaining a ''[[baccalauréat]]'' degree in 1894 at the Sorbonne,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FReQVFC6ZJUC&pg=PR17&lpg=PR17&dq=Enrico+Marinetti&source=bl&ots=sc9skuhwUL&sig=o8KD6j0S7WlD_mYfDH3x2sQiUZA&hl=en&ei=PsWJTs_2EKnV0QGRxIz_Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Enrico%20Marinetti&f=false Critical writings] / F.T. Marinetti ; edited by Günter Berghaus ; translated by Doug Thompson</ref> and in Italy, graduating in law at the [[University of Pavia]] in 1899.

He decided not to be a lawyer but to develop a literary career. He experimented with every type of literature (poetry, narrative, theatre, ''words in liberty''), signing everything "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti".

==Futurism==

Marinetti and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] were visitors of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] c. 1908 along with young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend [[Cubism]]), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux, who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye. The Abbaye de Créteil was a ''[[phalanstère]]'' community founded in the autumn of 1906 by the painter [[Albert Gleizes]], and the poets [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], [[Alexandre Mercereau]] and [[Charles Vildrac]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/lredudrameessa00barz#page/134/mode/2up Barzun, Henri-Martin, ''L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synthèse Poétique Moderne'', Figuière, 1912]</ref> The movement drew its inspiration from the ''Abbaye de Thélème,'' a fictional creation by [[Rabelais]] in his novel ''[[Gargantua]]''. It was closed down by its members early in 1908.<ref name="Robbins">[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/239 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881–1953, a Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website)]</ref>

Marinetti is known best as the author of the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', which he wrote in 1909. It was published in French on the front page of the most prestigious French daily newspaper, ''[[Le Figaro]]'', on 20 February 1909. In ''The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism'', Marinetti declared that "Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice." [[Georges Sorel]], who influenced the entire political spectrum from anarchism to Fascism, also argued for the importance of violence. Futurism had both anarchist and Fascist elements; Marinetti later became an active supporter of [[Benito Mussolini]].

Marinetti, who admired speed, had a minor car accident outside [[Milan]] in 1908 when he veered into a ditch to avoid two cyclists. He referred to the accident in the Futurist Manifesto: the Marinetti who was helped out of the ditch was a new man, determined to end the pretense and decadence of the prevailing [[Liberty style]]. He discussed a new and strongly revolutionary programme with his friends, in which they should end every artistic relationship with the past, "destroy the museums, the libraries, every type of academy". Together, he wrote, "We will glorify war—the world's only hygiene—[[militarism]], patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman".<ref>[http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/ The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Futurist Manifesto was read and debated all across Europe, but Marinetti's first 'Futurist' works were not as successful. In April, the opening night of his drama ''Le Roi bombance'' (The Feasting King), written in 1905, was interrupted by loud, derisive whistling by the audience... and by Marinetti himself, who thus introduced another element of Futurism, "the desire to be heckled." Marinetti did, however, fight a duel with a critic he considered too harsh.

His drama ''La donna è mobile'' (Poupées électriques), first presented in [[Turin]], was not successful either. Nowadays, the play is remembered through a later version, named ''Elettricità sessuale'' (Sexual Electricity), and mainly for the appearance onstage of humanoid automatons, ten years before the [[Czechs|Czech]] writer [[Karel Čapek]] invented the term ''[[robot]]''.

[[File:FilippoTommasoMarinetti.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]
In 1910 his first novel, ''Mafarka il futurista'', was cleared of all charges by an obscenity trial. That year, Marinetti discovered some allies in three young painters ([[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]]), who adopted the Futurist philosophy. Together with them (and with poets such as [[Aldo Palazzeschi]]), Marinetti began a series of Futurist Evenings, theatrical spectacles in which Futurists declaimed their manifestos in front of a crowd that in part attended the performances to throw vegetables at them.

The most successful "happening" of that period was the publicization of the "Manifesto Against Past-Loving [[Venice]]" in Venice. In the flier, Marinetti demands "fill(ing) the small, stinking canals with the rubble from the old, collapsing and leprous palaces" to "prepare for the birth of an industrial and militarized Venice, capable of dominating the great [[Adriatic]], a great Italian lake."

In 1911, the [[Italo-Turkish War]] began and Marinetti departed for [[Libya]] as war correspondent for a French newspaper. His articles were eventually collected and published in ''The Battle of Tripoli''. He then covered the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–13, witnessing the surprise success of Bulgarian troops against the Ottoman Empire in the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912–13)|Siege of Adrianople]]. In this period he also made a number of visits to London, which he considered 'the Futurist city par excellence', and where a number of exhibitions, lectures and demonstrations of Futurist music were staged. However, although a number of artists, including [[Wyndham Lewis]], were interested in the new movement, only one British convert was made, the young artist [[C.R.W. Nevinson]]. Nevertheless, Futurism was an important influence upon Lewis's [[Vorticist]] philosophy.<ref>Haycock, ''A Crisis of Brilliance'' (London: Old Street Publishing, 2009), 138–40, 142, 147, 187–8</ref>

About the same time Marinetti worked on a very anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and anti-[[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] verse-novel, ''Le monoplan du Pape'' (''The Pope's Aeroplane'', 1912) and edited an anthology of futurist poets. But his attempts to renew the style of poetry did not satisfy him. So much so that, in his foreword to the anthology, he declared a new revolution: it was time to be done with traditional syntax and to use "words in freedom"  (''parole in libertà''). His sound-poem ''[[Zang Tumb Tumb]]'', an account of the Battle of Adrianople,<ref>[http://blogs.guggenheim.org/checklist/words-in-freedom-the-unique-colors-of-our-changeable-i/ Valesio, Paolo; ''Words-in-Freedom—"The Unique Colors of our Changeable 'I'"'', Guggenheim website,  August 28, 2014]</ref> exemplifies words in freedom. Recordings can be heard of Marinetti reading some of his sound poems: ''Battaglia, Peso + Odore'' (1912);<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Battaglia.mp3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117160132/http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Battaglia.mp3 |archive-date=17 January 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Dune, parole in libertà'' (1914);<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117142522/http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Dune.mp3]</ref>  ''La Battaglia di Adrianopoli'' (1926) (recorded 1935).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/artist_tellus/Tellus-21-Artists_03_marinetti.mp3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060725193129/http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/artist_tellus/Tellus-21-Artists_03_marinetti.mp3 |archive-date=25 July 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Wartime==
Marinetti agitated for Italian involvement in [[World War I]], and once Italy was engaged, promptly volunteered for service. In the fall of 1915 he and several other Futurists who were members of the Lombard Volunteer Cyclists were stationed at [[Lake Garda]], in [[Trentino]] province, high in the mountains along the Italo-Austrian border. They endured several weeks of fighting in harsh conditions before the cyclists units, deemed inappropriate for mountain warfare, were disbanded.

Marinetti spent most of 1916 supporting Italy's war effort with speeches, journalism, and theatrical work, then returned to military service as a regular army officer in 1917.<ref>[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13532944.2013.806289 Daly, Selena ; ''The Futurist mountains: Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War'', Modern Italy, 2013]; retvd 8 24 15</ref> In May of that year he was seriously wounded while serving with an artillery battalion on the [[Soča|Isonzo]] front; he returned to service after a long recovery, and participated in the decisive Italian victory at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]] in October 1918.<ref>Berghaus, Günter (editor; introduction to) Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso; ''Critical Writings: New Edition''; Macmillan, 2007; {{ISBN|0374706948}}, 9780374706944</ref>

==Marriage==
After an extended courtship, in 1923 Marinetti married [[Benedetta Cappa]] (1897–1977), a writer and painter and a pupil of [[Giacomo Balla]].  Born in Rome, she had joined the Futurists in 1917.  They'd met in 1918, moved in together in Rome, and chose to marry only to avoid legal complications on a lecture tour of Brazil.<ref>Futurism: an anthology By Lawrence S. Rainey, Christine Poggi, Laura Wittman, page 30</ref>  They had three daughters:  Vittoria, Ala, and Luce.

Cappa and Marinetti collaborated on a genre of mixed-media assemblages in the mid-1920s they called ''tattilismo'' ("Tactilism"), and she was a strong proponent and practitioner of the [[aeropittura]] movement after its inception in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/archive/2/AC73F5BDEEF8DE5D6173.htm |title=WAC &#124; La Futurista: Benedetta Cappa Marinetti (1917–1945) |publisher=Walkerart.org |access-date=5 January 2014}}</ref> She also produced three experimental novels.  Cappa's major public work is likely a series of five murals at the Palermo Post Office (1926–1935) for the Fascist public-works architect [[Angiolo Mazzoni]].

==Marinetti and Fascism==
In early 1918 he founded the [[Futurist Political Party|''Partito Politico Futurista'']] or Futurist Political Party, which only a year later merged with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]''. Marinetti was one of the first affiliates of the [[Partito Nazionale Fascista|Italian Fascist Party]]. In 1919 he co-wrote with [[Alceste De Ambris]] the [[Fascist Manifesto]], the original manifesto of [[Italian Fascism]].<ref>Dahlia S. Elazar. The making of fascism: class, state, and counter-revolution, Italy 1919–1922. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Praeger Publishers, 2001, p.73</ref> He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, terming them "reactionary," and, after walking out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrew from politics for three years. However, he remained a notable force in developing the party philosophy throughout the regime's existence. For example, at the end of the ''Congress of Fascist Culture'' that was held in [[Bologna]] on 30 March 1925, [[Giovanni Gentile]] addressed [[Sergio Panunzio]] on the need to define Fascism more purposefully by way of Marinetti's opinion, stating, "Great spiritual movements make recourse to precision when their primitive inspirations—what F. T. Marinetti identified this morning as artistic, that is to say, the creative and truly innovative ideas, from which the movement derived its first and most potent impulse—have lost their force. We today find ourselves at the very beginning of a new life and we experience with joy this obscure need that fills our hearts—this need that is our inspiration, the genius that governs us and carries us with it."

As part of his campaign to overturn tradition, Marinetti also attacked traditional Italian food. His ''Manifesto of Futurist Cooking'' was published in the Turin ''[[Gazzetta del Popolo]]'' on 28 December 1930.<ref name="Scarpellini">{{cite book|last1=Scarpellini|first1=Emanuela|title=Food and Foodways in Italy from 1861 to the Present|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-56962-2|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI8YDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="Sorini">{{cite news|last1=Sorini|first1=Alex Revelli|last2=Cutini|first2=Susanna|title=Dining With Marinetti: the Manifesto of Futurist Cuisine|url=https://www.finedininglovers.com/stories/futurism-cuisine-manifesto-dining-marinetti/|access-date=21 June 2017|work=Fine Dining Lovers|date=15 February 2014}}</ref> Arguing that "People think, dress and act in accordance with what they drink and eat",<ref name="Gross">{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Food Fight|journal=Distillations|year=2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=22–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/food-fight|access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref> Marinetti proposed wide-ranging changes to diet.

It was also militaristic, seeking to stimulate men to be fighters.<ref name="Gross"/>

Marinetti also sought to increase creativity.  His attraction to whatever was new made scientific discoveries appealing to him, but his views on diet were not scientifically based. He was fascinated with the idea of processed food, predicting that someday pills would replace food as a source of energy, and calling for the creation of "plastic complexes" to replace natural foods.<ref name="Gross"/> Food, in turn, would become a matter of artistic expression. Many of the meals Marinetti described and ate resemble performance art, such as the "Tactile Dinner",<ref name="Theroux"/> recreated in 2014 for an exhibit at the [[Guggenheim Museum]]. Participants wore pajamas decorated with sponge, sandpaper, and aluminum, and ate salads without using cutlery.<ref name="Gross"/><ref name="Brickman">{{cite news|last1=Brickman|first1=Sophie|title=The Food of the Future|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/food-future|access-date=21 June 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=1 September 2014}}</ref>

During the Fascist regime Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Italy but failed to do so. Mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said: "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art. Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."<ref>Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref> Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], successfully promoted the rival Novecento Group, and even persuaded Marinetti to be part of its board.

In Fascist Italy, modern art was tolerated and even approved by the Fascist hierarchy. Towards the end of the 1930s, some Fascist ideologues (for example, the ex-Futurist [[Ardengo Soffici]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdyCiukUaf8C&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=Soffici+%2B%22degenerate+art%22&source=bl&ots=6_waDGcuJS&sig=TYcjaLVHNdYTH8rXsB7n6MjAyRk&hl=en&ei=OTNrTruUEYu3hAfy6Y2DDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Soffici%20%2B%22degenerate%20art%22&f=false Feinstein, Willy, ''The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy'', 2010, Associated University Presses]</ref>) wished to import the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned modernism, although their demands were ignored by the regime.<ref>[http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/lh/article/viewFile/5436/4631 Kay, Carolyn, "Review of Affron, Matthew and Antliff, Mark, ''Fascist Vision: Art and Ideology in France and Italy (1997)''" ''Left History'', 7.1, 191–193]</ref> In 1938, hearing that [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to include Futurism in a traveling exhibition of degenerate art, Marinetti persuaded Mussolini to refuse to let it enter Italy.

On 17 November 1938, Italy passed [[Italian Racial Laws|The Racial Laws]], discriminating against Italian Jews, much as the discrimination pronounced in the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. The antisemitic trend in Italy resulted in attacks against modern art, judged too foreign, too radical and anti-nationalist.<ref name="Guggenheim">[http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/futurism/timeline/ ''Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe''], Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2014</ref> In the 11 January 1939 issue of the Futurist journal, ''Artecrazia'' Marinetti expressed his condemnation of such attacks on modern art, noting Futurism is both Italian and nationalist, not foreign, and stating that there were no Jews in Futurism. Furthermore, he claimed Jews were not active in the development of modern art. Regardless, the Italian state shut down ''Artecrazia''.<ref name="Guggenheim" />

Marinetti made numerous attempts to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant garde with each attempt. He relocated from Milan to Rome. He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, saying, "It is important that Futurism be represented in the Academy."

He was an atheist,<ref>Mario Isnenghi, ''Il mito della grande guerra da Marinetti a Malaparte'', Laterza, 1970, p. 44.</ref> but by the mid 1930s he had come to accept the influence of the [[Catholic Church]] on Italian society.<ref>Günter Berghaus, ''Futurism and the Technological Imagination'', Rodopi, 2009, p. 341.</ref> In ''Gazzetta del Popolo'', 21 June 1931, Marinetti proclaimed that "Only Futurist artists...are able to express clearly...the simultaneous dogmas of the Catholic faith, such as the Holy Trinity, the Immaculate Conception and Christ's Calvary."<ref name="ItalianFuturism.org">{{cite web|author=ItalianFuturism.org |url=http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/manifesto-of-sacred-art-english/ |title=Manifesto of Futurist Sacred Art (English translation) |publisher=Italianfuturism.org |access-date=5 January 2014|date=25 August 2009 }}</ref> In his last works, written just before his death in 1944 ''L'aeropoema di Gesù'' ("The Aeropoem of Jesus") and ''Quarto d'ora di poesia per the X Mas'' ("A Fifteen Minutes' Poem of the X Mas"), Marinetti sought to reconcile his newfound love for God and his passion for the action that accompanied him throughout his life.<ref name="The Spirituality of Marinetti: Between Anticlericalism, Spiritism and Christianity ''(Italiano)''">{{cite web|author=Giovanni Balducci |url=https://www.centrostudilaruna.it/la-spiritualita-di-marinetti-fra-anticlericalismo-spiritismo-e-cristianesimo.html |title=La spiritualità di Marinetti: fra anticlericalismo, spiritismo e cristianesimo |date=13 May 2013 |publisher=Centro Studi La Runa |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref>

There were other contradictions in his character: despite his nationalism, he was international, educated in Egypt and France, writing his first poems in French, publishing the Futurist Manifesto in a French newspaper and traveling to promote his ideas.

Marinetti volunteered for active service in the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the [[Second World War]], serving on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for a few weeks in the Summer and Autumn of 1942 at the age of 65.<ref>Ialongo, Ernest; ''Filippo Tommaso Marinetti: The Artist and His Politics'', p.289; Rowman & Littlefield, 2015; {{ISBN|1611477573}}, 9781611477573</ref>

He died of cardiac arrest in [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]] on 2 December 1944 while working on a collection of poems praising the wartime achievements of the [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]].
