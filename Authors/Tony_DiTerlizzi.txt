== Influences ==
DiTerlizzi cites a variety of artists including [[Norman Rockwell]] and [[Dr. Seuss]] as major creative influences.<ref name="www.DiTerlizzi.com">[http://www.diterlizzi.com/ Tony DiTerlizzi's website]</ref> "Many good fantasy artists will tell you their influences are [[Frank Frazetta|Frazetta]] or [[Boris Vallejo]]. Realizing this, I went for more diverse influences, since it seemed to me that most current fantasy work has that same oil-painted feel."<ref name="Dragon #251" /> DiTerlizzi was influenced by artists such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to early 1900s magazine artists ([[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Heinrich Kley]]) to classic children's book illustrators ([[Arthur Rackham]], [[E. H. Shepard|Ernest Shepard]], [[John Tenniel]]) to offbeat modern fantasy artists ([[Brian Froud]], [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], [[William Stout]], [[Jim Henson]]).<ref name="Dragon #251" /> Another inspiration was [[David A. Trampier|David Trampier]], who illustrated much of ''<nowiki>AD&D'</nowiki>''s first ''[[Monster Manual]]'', which DiTerlizzi recalled as his favorite book as a child: "I would copy Trampier's drawings over and over."<ref name="Dragon #251" /> DiTerlizzi was a fan of role-playing game art long before entering the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackgate.com/2010/10/19/art-evolution-6-tony-diterlizzi/ |title=Blog Archive » Art Evolution 6: Tony DiTerlizzi |publisher=Black Gate |access-date=2014-02-17}}</ref>

DiTerlizzi is also a fan of the work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Charles Perrault]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Illustrators such as Arthur Rackham, [[Edmund Dulac]], [[Kay Nielsen]] and Ernest Shepard all had an impact, as well as author/illustrators like [[Maurice Sendak]], [[Shel Silverstein]] and [[Richard Scarry]].<ref name="Library of Congress">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bookfest/kids-teachers/authors/tony_diterlizzi |title=Tony DiTerlizzi &#124; National Book Festival - Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |access-date=2014-02-17}}</ref>

My entire goal was to 'blow away' the other artists. It helped me in getting the job for the [[Planescape]] setting."<ref name="Dragon #251"/>

DiTerlizzi worked on the 1994 ''[[Planescape Campaign Setting]]'' and its supplements, redesigning the look of the [[Outer Plane]]s, "Not only buildings but the people had to have a rusted, organic look. This seemed to come naturally in my art style. When I went to work on Planescape, I looked at [[anime]] and Japanese fantasy art like [[Yoshitaka Amano]]."<ref name="Dragon #251" /> According to Shannon Appelcline, the artist's work was the backbone of the setting.<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=26}}</ref>

His creatures have the charm of Henson or Rackham but they carry with them hints of their own ecosystem . . . Tony stands alone as a world creator and a weaver of tales, may you treasure these art pieces as much as I do,” quoted [[Guillermo del Toro]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Dark Horse and Kitchen Sink Present Realms: The Roleplaying Game Art of Tony Diterlizzi :: Blog :: Dark Horse Comics|url = https://www.darkhorse.com/Blog/1818/dark-horse-and-kitchen-sink-present-realms-rolepla|website = www.darkhorse.com|access-date = 2015-12-03}}</ref>
