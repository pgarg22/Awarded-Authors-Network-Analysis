==Writing==
Flora Annie Steel was interested in relating to all classes of [[Culture of India|Indian society]]. The birth of her daughter gave her a chance to interact with local women and learn their language. She encouraged the production of local handicrafts and collected folk-tales, a collection of which she published in 1894.

Her interest in schools and the education of women gave her insight into native life and character. A year before leaving India, she co-authored and published ''[[The Complete Indian Housekeeper and Cook]]'', which gave detailed directions to European women on all aspects of household management in India.

In 1889 the family moved back to Scotland, and she continued her writing there. Some of her best work, according to the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']], is contained in two collections of her short stories, ''From the Five Rivers'' and ''Tales of the Punjab''.

Steel's novel ''[[On the Face of the Waters]]'' (1896) describes incidents during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. She also wrote a popular history of India. John F. Riddick describes Steel's ''The Hosts of the Lord'' as one of the "three significant works" produced by [[Anglo-Indian]] writers on Indian missionaries, along with ''The Old Missionary'' (1895) by [[William Wilson Hunter]] and ''Idolatry'' (1909) by [[Alice Perrin]].<ref name="Riddick2006">{{Cite book |author=John F.
