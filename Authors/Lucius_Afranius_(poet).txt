==Life==
Afranius' comedies described Roman scenes and manners (the genre called ''comoediae togatae'') and the subjects were mostly taken from the life of the lower classes (''comoediae tabernariae'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name="Manuwald2011">{{cite book|author=Gesine Manuwald|title=Roman Republican Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-ug5st1b_8C&pg=PA263|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49974-3|pages=263–}}</ref> They were considered by some ancients to be frequently polluted with disgraceful amours, which, according to [[Quintilian]], were only a representation of the conduct of Afranius.<ref>[[Quintilian]], x. 1. § 100</ref> He depicted, however, Roman life with such accuracy that he is classed with [[Menander]], from whom indeed he borrowed largely.<ref>[[Horace]], ''[[Epodes (Horace)|Epodes]]'' ii.1.57</ref><ref>[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' vi.1</ref><ref>[[Cicero]], ''De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'' i.3</ref> He imitated the style of [[Gaius Titius]], and his language is praised by [[Cicero]].<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 45</ref> His comedies are spoken of in the highest terms by the ancient writers, and under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] they not only continued to be read, but were even acted, of which an example occurs in the time of [[Nero]].<ref>[[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius Paterculus]], i.17, ii.9</ref><ref>[[Aulus Gellius|Gellius]], xiii.8</ref><ref>[[Suetonius]], ''[[Nero]]'' 11</ref> They seem to have been well known even at the latter end of the 4th century AD.<ref>[[Ausonius]], ''Epigr''. 71</ref>

==Quintilian's judgement==
The Spanish-Roman teacher of rhetoric [[Quintilian]] wrote of Afranius's plays:<ref>Quintilian 10.100.</ref>

:''Togātīs excellit Afrānius: utinam non inquināsset argūmenta puerōrum foedīs amōribus, mōrēs suōs fassus.''
:("Afranius excelled in Roman-style comedies: if only he hadn't polluted his plots with unseemly sexual affairs with boys, confessing his own habits.")

Such is the generally accepted interpretation of this sentence.<ref>Cf. Fontaine, Michael (2009) ''Funny Words in Plautine Comedy'' (Oxford), p. 224</ref><ref>P.G.M. Brown, "Afranius, Lucius (1)", in ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'': "his plays included pederastic themes".</ref> An alternative view is proposed by Welsh (2010),<ref>Welsh, Jarrett T. (2010). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40984742 "Quintilian's Judgement of Afranius"]. ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 60, No. 1 (May 2010), pp. 118-126.)</ref> who, noting that there is no trace of pederasty or any lewdness in any of the quoted fragments of Afranius, proposed to translate the sentence "if only he hadn't polluted his plots with disreputable love affairs (conducted) by boys", something which Quintilian perhaps thought unsuited to the moralising tone of Roman comedies. A problem with this interpretation, as Welsh himself admits, is that in Roman literature the word ''pueri'' is usually used for the boys who are object of love affairs, not the young men who conduct them.
