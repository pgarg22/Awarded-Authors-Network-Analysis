'''Elizabeth Polack''' was an [[England|English]] playwright of the 1830s, notable for having been described by chroniclers of the period as England's first [[Jew]]ish woman [[melodrama]]tist.

==Life and works==
Few historical records survive which detail Elizabeth Polack's life.  Although neither the year nor place of her birth (or death) have been noted, documentation of her activity as a playwright active in [[London]] between 1830 and 1838 remains for posterity.  Contemporary records credit her with five plays, only two of which, ''Esther, the Royal Jewess; or The Death of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]'' and ''St. Clair of the Isles; or The Outlaw of [[Barra]]'', have survived. 
''Alberti, or, the Mines of India'' was performed at the Royal Pavilion on 10 May 1834 and then believed to be by Polack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Royal Pavilion Theatre|newspaper=Morning Advertiser|date=12 May 1834|page=3}}</ref>
''Esther'', with a story taken from the [[Old Testament]], a version of the tradtitonal Jewish ''[[Purim spiel|Purimshpil]]'' and considered in its time to be a type of an "Exotic East" melodrama, was successfully produced in 1835 at London's Royal [[Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel]] in the [[East End of London|East End]]<ref name=JIM>Conway (2012), p. 104</ref> (the Pavilion was later a centre for [[Yiddish theatre]] in London).<ref>{{cite news|title=We Understand|newspaper=Waterford Chronicle|date=26 December 1835|page=3 }}</ref>  ''St. Clair'' (1838), based on an 1803 novel by Elizabeth Helme, met, however, with a very modest reception. It is apparently the source of the melodramatic cliché, "Foiled again!".<ref name=JIM />

Polack's aunt, [[Maria Polack]], was one of the first Jewish women writers in England.<ref name=hartleybatchelor>{{cite book | last1=Hartley | first1=Lucy | last2=Batchelor | first2=Jennie | title=The History of British Women's Writing, 1830–1880 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-137-58465-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRRwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA204 | page=204}}</ref> Polack may have been a relation of [[Joel Samuel Polack]], the first Jewish settler of New Zealand.
