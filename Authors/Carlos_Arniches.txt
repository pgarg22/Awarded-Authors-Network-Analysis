'''Carlos Arniches''' (11 October 1866 &ndash; 16 April 1943)<ref name=Brit>"Arniches (y Barrera), Carlos" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 577.</ref> was a [[Spain|Spanish]] playwright, born in Alicante. His prolific work, drawing on the traditions of the [[género chico]], the [[zarzuela]] and the [[grotesque]], came to dominate the Spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century.

After starting his career as a novelist and journalist,<ref>Dowling 2011, para. 1 of 3</ref> Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, ''Casa editorial''. Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music.<ref>Dowling 2011, para. 3 of 3</ref>

Arniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by [[Federico García Lorca]], often a scathing critic of contemporary Spanish theatre, as 'more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment'.<ref>"Federico García Lorca y el teatro de hoy", interview with Nicolás González Deleito, in García Lorca 1997, p. 564</ref>

Following the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the [[Francoist Spain|new government]].<ref>Vilches de Frutos 1999, p. 513</ref>
