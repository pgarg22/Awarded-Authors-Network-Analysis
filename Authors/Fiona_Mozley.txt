==Work==
The name "Elmet" is taken from a Celtic kingdom that once covered Yorkshire. In the novel, Mozley "wanted to capture the ambiguity of local historical recollections; to say something about their double-edged thrall; to examine the desire to live in the past and the need to extricate oneself from it."<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Fc2DwAAQBAJ |title=Elmet |last=Mozley |first=F. |publisher=Algonquin Books |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-61620-844-8 |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/30/fiona-mozley-elmet-my-writing-day |title=Fiona Mozley: I'm on the Man Booker shortlist and top of my fantasy football league |last=Mozley |first=Fiona |date=2017-09-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/books/review-elmet-fiona-mozley.html |title='Elmet' Backs a Brawny Man Into a Dangerous Corner |date=2017-11-27 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-01-17 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/02/567465301/debut-author-channeled-her-darker-bits-into-a-man-booker-shortlist-novel |title=Debut Author Channeled Her 'Darker Bits' Into A Man Booker Shortlist Novel |work=NPR.org |access-date=17 January 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

The novel ''Elmet'' is concerned strongly with the idea of home, "the building of a house, the preparation of food; stolen glimpses of a woman's wardrobe."<ref name="LRB">J. Robert Lennon: "Scary Dad", ''London Review of Books'', 10 May 2018, pp. 35â€“37.</ref> This moves stealthily onto the fact that the 14-year-old narrator, Daniel, is not just domesticated, but must come to terms with being gay, or even transgender, while his older sister Cathy is a tomboy "raised in isolation by a man poorly suited to the job, and taught skills typically taken up by boys."<ref name="LRB"/> "Daddy" is kind to his two children, but otherwise known to be violent. The father's concern is for the land: "the wilderness tamed by man's benevolent but dictatorial hand... [that] provides fertile ground for the evil that men do."<ref name="LRB"/>
