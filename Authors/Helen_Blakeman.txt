'''Helen Blakeman''' (born 1971) is a British playwright and screenwriter from [[Liverpool]]. She has written three plays. ''Caravan'', her first, was written while she studied at [[Birmingham University]] and won her the [[George Devine award]]. Her second play, ''Normal'', was followed by an entrance into screenwriting. ''[[Pleasureland]]'' is a 2003 television film about teen sexuality, for which Blakeman was nominated for the [[British Academy Television Craft Awards]] for [[British Academy Television Craft Award for Best Emerging Talent: Fiction|Best New Writer]] in 2003, after which Blakeman wrote her third and most recent play, ''The Morris''. In 2008, she wrote the screenplay for the award-winning television film ''[[Dustbin Baby (film)|Dustbin Baby]]'', which was well received by critics, and for which she won the [[British Academy Children's Award]] for [[British Academy Children's Award#Best Writer|Best Writer]]. Helen is also the co-founder of Heroic Books LTD.

==Early life==
Blakeman became involved in [[Morris dance#North West|female morris dancing]] at age three. It was this dancing, combined with watching [[pantomimes]] and plays at [[Butlins]], which led to her going into a career in theatre. She then joined the [[National Youth Theatre]] and studied drama at [[John Moores University]]. It was at university that she began to write. Blakeman then took a [[Master's degree|Master's]] course at [[Birmingham University]] under [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]].<ref name="Key">{{cite news |title= A rare kind of dancing|author= Key, Phillip|newspaper= [[Liverpool Daily Post]]|date= 29 April 2005|url= http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/tm_headline=a-rare-kind-of-dancing%26method=full%26objectid=15459303%26page=1%26siteid=50061-name_page.html|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Dustbin Baby- April and Marion.jpg|thumb|right|Publicity still for ''[[Dustbin Baby (film)|Dustbin Baby]]'', written by Blakeman in 2008.]]
It was at Birmingham University that Blakeman wrote ''Caravan''. [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]] saw a performance of the play, and took a script to Mile Bradwell of [[Bush Theatre]]. The play was then shown at the Bush Theatre.<ref name="Key"/> The play tells the story of a mother and her two daughters staying in a caravan in north Wales,<ref name="Key"/> and Robert Butler of ''[[The Independent]]'' described the play as displaying "a lively gift for dramatising family disputes and representing young people's sex lives with a good-humoured frankness".<ref name="all dressed up">{{cite news |title= All dressed up but going nowhere|author= Butler, Robert|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 2 May 2000|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/all-dressed-up-but-going-nowhere-718380.html|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[black comedy]], David Benedict, also writing for ''The Independent'', criticised the plot as "contrived", saying that "The problem with this kind of writing on stage is that unlike a soap, it has to have theatrical shape, not least in that it has to end".<ref>{{cite news |title= Theatre Review: Join the caravan of love and war |author= Benedict, David|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 18 November 1997|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/theatre-review-join-the-caravan-of-love-and-war-1294738.html|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}</ref> The play won Blakeman the [[George Devine award]].<ref name="all dressed up"/> Blakeman's second play, ''Normal'', also opened at The Bush. ''Normal'' tells the story of a mother who lost two children in child birth and her surviving daughter, and the play alternates between a character's monologues in a police station and the events leading up to the incident which brought her to the station. Butler described this as "tougher going" than ''Caravan'', and said that "Blakeman's talent for unlikely scenes is largely on hold".<ref name="all dressed up"/>

Blakeman then entered television writing, writing ''[[Pleasureland]]'', a television film for [[Channel Four]] as part of their [[Adult at 14 season]]. ''Pleasureland'' tells the story of 14‑year-old Jo, a girl who commits herself to be accepted by her classmates by losing her virginity.<ref name="Segal">{{cite news |title= Victoria Segal finds a startling young acting talent in Katie Lyon|newspaper= [[The Times]]|date= 8 November 2003|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1008012.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' described ''Pleasureland'' as "raw and alarming", and claimed it "is loaded with scenes certain to cause outrage".<ref name="Segal"/> The show attracted controversy, with Michelle Elliott, from [[Kidscape]], describing scenes depicting 14‑year-olds engaging in sexual activity as "basically irresponsible and sick."<ref name="Barrett">{{cite news |title= Mersey TV drama is branded 'sick'|author= Barrett, Tony|newspaper= [[Liverpool Daily Post]]|date= 10 November 2003|url= http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/content_objectid=13608852_method=full_siteid=50061_headline=-Mersey-TV-drama-is-branded--sick--name_page.html}}</ref> Blakeman responded by claiming that she only approached the subject after learning that Britain had the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, claiming "sex was more of a rumour mill when I was at school – but there is more pressure now to partake in that activity".<ref name="Barrett"/> Despite this, Blakeman was nominated at the [[British Academy Television Craft Awards]] for [[British Academy Television Craft Award for Best Emerging Talent: Fiction|Best New Writer]] in 2003, but lost out to [[Rosemary Kay]], for her work on ''[[This Little Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bafta.org/awards/television-craft/nominations/?year=2003|title= Craft Nominations 2003|publisher= [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>

Blakeman's third play, ''The Morris'', follows a troupe of female morris dancers. Female morris dancing is a tradition in the north west of England which is only loosely related to [[Morris dance|traditional morris dancing]]. Blakeman had been a female morris dancer until she was 16, but the play "is as much about bickering, bonding and fierce rivalry between women". It was given a two out of five by [[Lynne Walker (critic)|Lynne Walker]], reviewing the play for ''[[The Independent]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title= The Morris, Everyman Theatre, Liverpool |author= Walker, Lynne|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 26 May 2005|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/the-morris-everyman-theatre-liverpool-492112.html}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= The lone male is in the kitchen, helping with the tea|author= Rees, Jasper|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date= 5 May 2005|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3641636/The-lone-male-is-in-the-kitchen-helping-with-the-tea.html}}</ref>

In 2008, Blakeman wrote the screenplay for ''[[Dustbin Baby (film)|Dustbin Baby]]'', a film based on the [[Jacqueline Wilson]] novel [[Dustbin Baby|of the same name]]. She said that when she had read a copy of the novel, she "knew it was something [she] had to write".<ref name="Helen">{{cite news |first= Joe|last= Riley|title= Helen's tale of woe|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/views/liverpool-columnists/echo-columnists/2008/12/19/helen-s-tale-of-woe-100252-22509772/|newspaper= [[Liverpool Echo]]|date= 19 December 2008|accessdate=21 December 2008 }}</ref> The film debuted on television in December of that year, and was received positively by critics.
