==Biography==
===Early life===
George Etherege was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in about 1636, to George Etherege and Mary Powney, as the eldest of their six children.<ref>H. F. B. Brett-Smith, ''The Dramatic Works of Sir George Etherege.'' Introduction. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1927. pp. xi-lxxxiiii.</ref> Educated at [[Lord Williams's School]], where a school building was later named after him, he was rumoured to have attended the [[University of Cambridge]],<ref name="Oldys">[[William Oldys]], ''[[Biographia Britannica]].'' Vol. III, 1750. p. 1841.</ref> although [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] states that to his certain knowledge Etherege understood neither Greek nor Latin,<ref name=EB1911/> thus raising doubts that he could have been there.<ref>John Dennis, [http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/dennisj/flutter.htm ''A Defence Of Sir Fopling Flutter, A Comedy'']. Pamphlet, London, 2 November 1722.</ref>

Etherege served as an apprentice to a lawyer and later studied law at Clement's Inn, London, one of the [[Inns of Chancery]].<ref name="Oldys"/> He probably travelled abroad to France with his father, who stayed with the exiled queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], and may have witnessed in [[Paris]] performances of some of [[Molière]]'s earliest comedies. An allusion in one of his plays suggests he may have been personally acquainted with [[Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy]].<ref name=EB1911/>

===Stage success===
Soon after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, Etherege wrote his comedy of ''The Comical Revenge or Love in a Tub'', which brought him to the attention of [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]], afterwards Earl of Dorset. This was performed at the Duke's Theatre in 1664 and a few copies were printed in the same year. It is partly in rhymed heroic verse, like the stilted tragedies of [[Robert Howard (playwright)|the Howards]] and [[Thomas Killigrew]], but it contains comic scenes that are notably bright and fresh. The sparring between Sir Frederick and the Widow introduced a style of wit hitherto unknown upon the English stage.<ref name=EB1911/>

The success of this play was very great, but Etherege waited four years before repeating the experiment. Meanwhile he gained a high reputation as a poetical beau and moved in the circle of [[Charles Sedley|Sir Charles Sedley]], [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Lord Rochester]] and other noble wits of the day. His temperament is best shown by the names his contemporaries gave him: "gentle George" and "easy Etheredge". In 1668 he brought out ''[[She Would If She Could]]'', a comedy of action, wit and spirit, although by some thought to be frivolous and immoral. Here Etherege first showed himself as a new power in literature. He presents an airy and fantastic world, where flirtation is the only serious business in life. Etherege himself was living a life no less frivolous and unprincipled.<ref name=EB1911/>

===''The Man of Mode''===
[[File:George Etherege The Man of Mode frontspiece 1676.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Frontispiece to ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676).]]
Between 1668 and 1671 Etherege went to [[Constantinople]] as secretary to the English Ambassador, Sir [[Daniel Harvey (diplomat)|Daniel Harvey]]. After a silence of eight years, he came forward with only one further play: ''[[The Man of Mode|The Man of Mode or, Sir Fopling Flutter]]'', widely considered the best comedy of manners written in England before the days of [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]]. It was acted and printed in 1676 and enjoyed success, which may be attributed to the belief that it satirises, or at least refers to well-known contemporaries in [[London]]. ''Sir Fopling Flutter'' was seen as a portrait of Beau Hewit, the reigning exquisite, Dorimant to be a reference to the [[Earl of Rochester]], and Medley a portrait of Etherege himself (or equally plausible, his fellow playwright and wit, Sir Charles Sedley). Even the drunken shoemaker was a real character, who made his fortune from being brought to public notice in this fashion.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Life after the theatre===
Etherege was part of the circle of [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|John Wilmot]]; both men had a daughter by the unmarried actress [[Elizabeth Barry]].<ref>Cambridge Guide to Literature in English</ref> (Recently all three have appeared as characters in the 2005 film ''[[The Libertine (2005 film)|The Libertine]]'', based on a play by [[Stephen Jeffreys]].)

After his success, Etheredge retired from literature, and a few years later lost much of his fortune to gambling. He was knighted at some time before 1679, and married a wealthy widow, Mary Sheppard Arnold. In March 1685, he was appointed resident minister to the Imperial German Court at [[Regensburg|Ratisbon]]. After three-and-a-half years' residence there, and after the [[Glorious Revolution]], he left for Paris to join [[James II of England|James II]] in exile. He died in Paris, probably in 1691,<ref name=EB1911/> as [[Narcissus Luttrell]] notes this as a recent event in February 1692, identifying Sir George Etherege as the late King James's Ambassador to [[Vienna]].<ref name=EB1911/>

Etherege's manuscript despatches are preserved in the [[British Museum]], where they were discovered and described by Gosse in 1881.<ref name=EB1911/> Later editions were produced by [[Sybil Rosenfeld]] (1928) and Frederic Bracher (1974).

===Legacy===
Etherege holds a distinguished place in English literature<ref name=EB1911/> as one of the "big five" in [[Restoration comedy]], who invented the comedy of manners and led the way to the achievements of Congreve and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]].

Etherege's portraits of fops and beaux are considered to be the best of their kind. He is noted for his delicate touches of dress, furniture and scene, and a vivid replication of the fine airs of London gentlemen and ladies which may even better Congreve's. His biography was first written in detail by [[Edmund Gosse]] in ''Seventeenth Century Studies'' (1883).<ref name=EB1911/>
