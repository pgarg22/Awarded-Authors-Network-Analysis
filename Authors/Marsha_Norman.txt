==Biography==

===Early years===
Norman was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the oldest of four children of Billie and Bertha Williams. As a child, she read and played the piano. She later began attending productions by the newly founded [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]]. She received a bachelor's degree from [[Agnes Scott College]] and a master's degree from the University of Louisville.<ref>Thompson, David S. [http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~dthompson/documents/I'm_Marsha_Norman.pdfShe "Marsha Norman"]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} agnesscott.edu, accessed August 2, 2013</ref> She worked as a [[journalist]] for ''[[The Louisville Times]]'' newspaper, and also wrote for Kentucky Educational Television. She taught young children and adolescents in mental institutions and hospitals. These were perhaps her biggest influence on her writing, especially a 13-year-old girl who influenced her play ''Getting Out''.<ref>[http://louisville.edu/artsandsciences/alumniandfriends/hallofhonor/inductees/norman.html "Marsha Norman"] louisville.edu, accessed August 2, 2013</ref> She also taught English at the J. Graham Brown School and Prestonia Elementary School in Louisville.

===Career===
Norman's first play ''[[Getting Out]]'' was produced at the Actors Theatre of Louisville and then [[Off-Broadway]] in 1979.<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=648 'Getting Out', 1979] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906161103/http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=648 |date=September 6, 2014 }} lortel.org, accessed August 2, 2013</ref> The play concerns a young woman just paroled after an eight-year prison sentence for robbery, kidnapping and [[manslaughter]].<ref>[http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/594/getting-out-norman 'Getting Out'] samuelfrench.com, accessed August 2, 2013</ref> It reflects Norman's experience working with disturbed adolescents at [[Kentucky]]'s Central State Hospital.

Norman's success with ''Getting Out'' led her to move to New York City where she continued to write for the Actors Theatre of Louisville. Her full-length play, ''Circus Valentine'' was produced at the [[Humana Festival]] in 1978. The play concerns a travelling circus and its star attraction, Siamese twins.<ref>Ullom, Jefrey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-2q7SrkeY_gC&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=%22Circus+Valentine%22+Humana+%22Marsha+Norman%22&source=bl&ots=Cnkq3AR-nQ&sig=rAOcPvdvdd3RNGdKEshFruqpO08&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_Y37UdWBGPeo4APRpYDoBw&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Circus%20Valentine%22%20Humana%20%22Marsha%20Norman%22&f=false ''The Humana Festival, The History of New Plays At Actors Theatre of Louisville''] books.google.com, SIU Press, June 19, 2008, {{ISBN|0809328496}}, , p.60 and Appendix</ref> Her next play, ''[['night, Mother]]'', became her best-known work, given its Broadway success and its star-powered film version. The play brought Norman a great deal of recognition, dealing frankly with the subject of [[suicide]], and won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Drama,<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama Drama, see 1983] pulitzer.org, accessed August 1, 2013</ref> the [[Susan Smith Blackburn Prize]],<ref>[http://www.blackburnprize.org/playsL-R.htm Plays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611084234/http://www.blackburnprize.org/playsL-R.htm |date=June 11, 2013 }} blackburnprize.org, accessed August 1, 2013</ref> the Hull-Warriner, the [[Drama Desk Award]], and the 1986 Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/}}</ref> However, her follow-up play, ''Traveller in the Dark'' received scathing reviews from the New York critics, some of whom were as blunt to say she could not have written it. According to an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Ms. Norman stayed away from the theater and turned to screenplays, including a [['night, Mother (film)|1986 movie adaptation]] of '''night, Mother'' that starred Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft and failed to impress critics. She was in high demand in Hollywood, though not always for films that she liked, or that studios would approve."<ref>Stanley, Alessandra.

Her work in musical theatre continued with the book and lyrics for the musical ''[[The Red Shoes (musical)|The Red Shoes]]'', which failed on Broadway in 1993. Her one-act play, ''Trudy Blue'', was produced off-Broadway in 1999. That play revolved around a woman who is mistakenly told that she has two months to live.<ref>Gutman, Les.
