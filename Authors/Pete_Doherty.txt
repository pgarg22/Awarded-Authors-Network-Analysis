==Career==

===The Libertines===
{{Main|The Libertines}}
Doherty and Barât formed a band called the Libertines in the late 1990s, although it was not until 2002, with the release of their debut album ''[[Up the Bracket]]'', that they began to achieve widespread mainstream success.

The group achieved critical and commercial success and gained a dedicated cult following, with Doherty, in particular, being praised by fans and critics alike as one of the most promising songwriters to emerge on the British music scene for some time. However, Doherty's increasing drug problems led to his estrangement from the band. In 2003, he was jailed for burgling Barât's flat.<ref name="BurglingCarl">{{cite news|title=Musician admits burgling bandmate's flat|date=12 August 2003|access-date=12 May 2007|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3142801.stm}}</ref><ref name="PrisonCarl">{{cite news|title=Libertines singer sent to prison|date=8 September 2003|access-date=12 May 2007|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3090862.stm}}</ref> The two initially fell out over this incident, but made amends whilst Doherty was in prison. He was originally sentenced to 6 months, but his sentence was cut to 2 months. Upon his release, Doherty immediately reunited with Barât and the rest of the band to play a gig in the Tap 'n' Tin pub in [[Chatham, Kent]]; known among Libertine fans as "The Freedom Gig".<ref name="RejoinLibsKent">{{cite news|title=Libertines reunite at freedom gig|date=9 October 2003|access-date=12 May 2007|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3178394.stm}}</ref>

Following his rejoining of the band, Doherty sought treatment for his drug addiction. He attended the alternative detox centre [[Wat Tham Krabok]], a temple in Thailand, famous for its rehabilitation programme for [[Crack cocaine|crack]] and heroin users. He left after three days and returned to England.<ref name="Rehab Fiasco">{{cite news|title=Annihilation beckons the dark star of rock|author=Smith, David|author2=Smith, Zoe|date=4 July 2004|access-date=12 May 2007|work=The Observer|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1253753,00.html|location=London, UK}}</ref><ref name="Pete Leaves Rehab">{{cite web|title=Pete Flees Rehab Again|date=14 June 2004|work=NME|url=https://www.nme.com/news/108813.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220023006/http://www.nme.com/news/108813.htm|archive-date=20 February 2006}}</ref> As a consequence of this, The Libertines cancelled appearances that they were due to make at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2004|Isle of Wight]] and [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] festivals.<ref name="FestCancelled">{{cite news|title=Libertines cancel festival dates|date=9 June 2004|access-date=12 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3792065.stm}}</ref>

However, while post-production work was taking place on the [[The Libertines (album)|second Libertines album]] in June 2004, Doherty was again asked to leave the band. The band cited Doherty's continuing drug addiction as the reason for his dismissal but emphasised their willingness to take him back once he had addressed his addiction. Although Barât had previously stated that The Libertines were merely on hiatus, pending Doherty's recovery, the group effectively disbanded with Doherty's departure at the end of 2004.<ref name="BoundTogether"/> The remaining members became involved in other projects (see [[Yeti (band)|Yeti]] and [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]]). On 12 April 2007, Pete Doherty and Carl Barât played 13 songs together at the second of Doherty's "An Evening with Pete Doherty" gigs at the [[Hackney Empire]], London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-libertines/27681|title=The Libertines reunite at Hackney gig|access-date=13 April 2007|date=12 April 2007|work=NME}}</ref>

In 2010 The Libertines reformed for appearances at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. They performed on 27 August at Leeds Festival and on 28 August at Reading Festival.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/aug/28/libertines-leeds-festival-2010|title=The Libertines rekindle the good old days at Leeds festival 2010|first=Sam|last=Wolfson|date=28 August 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 May 2011|location=London, UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=120&title=the_libertines_at_reading_festival_2010_&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1|title=The Libertines at Reading Festival 2010 – Review|first=David|last=Moynihan|date=29 August 2010|work=NME|access-date=29 May 2011}}</ref> The festival appearances were preluded by two gigs at the [[HMV Forum]] on 24 and 25 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/58078/The-Libertines-Make-Thrilling-Comeback-At-London-Gig|title=The Libertines Make Thrilling Comeback at London Gig |first=Jason|last=Gregory|date=25 August 2010|publisher=gigwise.com|access-date=29 May 2011}}</ref>
In November 2014 the band signed a record deal with Virgin EMI Records and released their third album, Anthems for Doomed Youth, on 11 September 2015.

The Libertines played an arena tour across the UK in January 2016, followed by a European tour and then dates in South America.

The Libertines toured Europe and the UK in November and December 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-24|title=The Boys In The Band return – The Libertines announce December 2019 UK and European tour {{!}} NME|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/boys-band-return-libertines-announce-december-2019-uk-tour-2513555|access-date=2020-11-16|website=NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs {{!}} NME.COM|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Doherty founded Babyshambles towards the end of his time with The Libertines. The group has released three studio albums: ''[[Down in Albion]]'', in November 2005, ''[[Shotter's Nation]]'', in October 2007, and ''[[Sequel to the Prequel]]'', in September 2013. The band's touring schedule and releases have occasionally been disrupted by Doherty's ongoing legal problems. The line-up of the band has changed several times: drummer [[Gemma Clarke]] left the band due to Doherty's drug problems and was replaced by [[Adam Ficek]], and guitarist and co-songwriter [[Patrick Walden]] has also left the band and was replaced by [[Mick Whitnall]]. In August 2006, Babyshambles signed up with major record label [[Parlophone]], on which they released ''[[The Blinding EP]]'' on 9 December 2006.<ref name="Parlophone">{{cite news|title=Babyshambles speak about new deal

On 12 July 2008, Doherty played a solo gig at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. It was his biggest solo show so far. The concert was originally scheduled for 26 April, but had to be rescheduled to a later date due to Doherty being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison for breaching probation on 8 April.<ref name="gdalb">{{cite news| url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/live/story/0,,2290716,00.html |work=The Guardian  | location=London | title=Pete Doherty | first=Betty | last=Clarke | date=14 July 2008 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> The solo show did not get the best ratings but was all in all still well received.

On 13 January 2009, NME.COM announced that Doherty's solo album, entitled ''[[Grace/Wastelands]]'' would be released on 16 March, preceded by a single, "[[Last of the English Roses]]", on 9 March. The website also revealed the track listing of the album and credits. In 2009 Doherty was made an honorary patron of the [[University Philosophical Society]].

Whilst performing a solo gig at the [[Grimsby]] Auditorium in March 2009, Doherty declared Grimsby a "shit-hole" midway through his set after being continuously pelted with coins and drinks by a harsh crowd.<ref>This is Grimsby.

On 15 May 2007, Doherty exhibited his paintings for the first time. The art exhibition took place at London's Bankrobber Gallery and was on show for one month.

He's using his blood to make them interesting, but when you look at them they're what any four-year-old can do."<ref name="indiatimes"/>

===Modelling===
Following in the footsteps of model and ex-fiancée [[Kate Moss]], Doherty became the face of [[Roberto Cavalli]]'s Fall 2007/2008 fashion advertising campaign. The photos gained praise for depicting a much cleaner and more handsome Doherty. The '50s-style photographs have been compared to images of [[Marlon Brando]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1555571/Doherty-becomes-fashion-contender-for-Moss.html|title=Doherty becomes fashion contender for Moss|last=Alexander|first=Hilary|date=27 June 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=29 June 2007|location=London|author-link=Hilary Alexander}}</ref>

}}</ref> He has also mentioned [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Tony Hancock]] as influences; Doherty and his father were once members of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society. Doherty mentions Hancock, and makes an allusion to his catchphrase 'Stone me!', in an early song entitled "You're My Waterloo". However, numerous literary and musical allusions occur throughout Doherty's ongoing ''Books of Albion''. He places particular importance on the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] and on existential philosophers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]]. Doherty has also alluded to work by the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]]. On the Babyshambles album ''[[Down in Albion]]'', there is a track entitled "À rebours", which is significantly influenced by [[À rebours|the novel of the same name]] by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].<ref name="MotherInterview">{{cite news|title=For Pete's sake|first=Janice|last=Turner|access-date=12 May 2007|date=19 August 2006|work=[[The Times|Times]] Saturday Magazine|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27869-2319045.html|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Emily Dickinson?

A frequent lyrical theme for Doherty is [[Albion]], the ancient name for Great Britain. Doherty also uses 'Albion' as the name of a ship sailing to a utopia called [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a place without rules or authority. Doherty and Barât shared a flat in London, at 112a Teesdale Street, [[Bethnal Green]], affectionately known as 'The Albion Rooms', despite being rather run down.

==Musical equipment==
Doherty prefers vintage equipment. Many of his vintage guitars and amplifiers have been destroyed in various domestic incidents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/pete-doherty-on-gear-203176?cpn=RSS&source=MRNEWS |title=Pete Doherty on gear... |first=Chris |last=Vinnicombe |date=14 April 2009 |publisher=Musicradar.com |access-date=30 April 2009}}</ref>

===Guitars===
*[[Epiphone Coronet]] – Doherty often used the rare one pick-up model ('New York Coronet' made in 1957) in the early years of the Libertines, as well as in some later gigs. It is affectionately known as 'heavy horse' also Doherty's username in online band related forums. His father held the guitar 'hostage' during 8 years of Doherty's chaos and carnage, allowing it to be used in recent Puta Madres album recording sessions. 
*[[Gibson ES-330]] – One of Doherty's first known guitars. Used throughout the early Libertines gigs.
*[[Epiphone Casino]] – Used with Babyshambles at recent concerts.
*[[Rickenbacker 360]] – Used a lot in Babyshambles, live and in the studio.
*[[Gibson ES-335]] – Used during the later years of the Libertines.
*Epiphone Olympic – Another rare one pick-up Epiphone. Seen on the cover of the "I Get Along" single (The Libertines).

===Interests===
Doherty is a [[socialist]], stating that "I do have utopian fantasies. A lot of them are more - I wouldn't say spiritual, but they relate more to the imagination and the individual. But for me socialism is a way of trying to put far-fetched ideas into everyday use, trying to find a way to bridge the gap between that fantasy and reality, and reaching out across that gap to the people who can actually do something to make the change."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/284/charming-man-interview-pete-doherty|title=This Charming Man: An Interview with Pete Doherty|year=2004}}</ref>

Doherty is also known to be a devoted follower of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers Football Club]]. As a youth (1995–96) he wrote a fanzine dedicated to the club, entitled "All Quiet on the [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]]".<ref name="MotherInterview"/>

===Drug use and legal problems===
Doherty has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences and offences arising from drug use, such as [[driving under the influence]], car theft,<ref name="spin2">{{cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-babyshambles|title=Grand Theft Auto: Babyshambles|work=Spin|access-date=7 May 2008|date=28 February 2006}}</ref> and driving with a suspended [[driving licence|licence]].<ref name="reutersuk1">{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL2015065120070820|title=Pete Doherty arrested after V Festival|agency=Reuters UK|access-date=7 May 2008|date=20 August 2007}}</ref><ref name="spin1">{{cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/pete-doherty-arrested-again|title=Pete Doherty Arrested, Again|work=Spin|access-date=7 May 2008|date=7 May 2007}}</ref> He has pleaded guilty to possession of [[crack cocaine]], heroin, cannabis and [[ketamine]].<ref name="reutersuk1"/> His addictions have resulted in jail time and multiple trips to rehabilitation facilities.<ref name="spin1"/> Drugs had been so important at some points in his life that in his younger days Doherty worked as a drug dealer to pay for his drug habit, as he admitted to author Peter Welsh in his biography.<ref>{{cite book|last=Welsh|first=Peter|title=Kids in the Riot: High and Low with the Libertines|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84449-716-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/kidsinriothighlo0000wels}}</ref> Doherty stated that he had been a [[rent boy]], and that during that time he robbed one of his male clients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/doherty-i-was-a-gay-rent-boy-and-drug-dealer|title=Pete Doherty: I was a gay rent boy and drug dealer|date=17 April 2005|publisher=contactmusic.com|access-date=9 May 2011}}</ref>

In 2003, while Doherty's first band [[The Libertines]] were performing in Japan without him, he broke into Carl Barât's flat and stole various items, including an old guitar and a laptop computer. On 7 September Doherty was sentenced by Judge Roger Davies to six months in prison; the sentence was eventually shortened to two months on appeal with the judge commenting, "We feel that a custodial sentence was justified in this case but sufficient credit was not given for his timely plea of guilty which it should have been. We have reduced his sentence to two months which will allow for his almost immediate release." Doherty was released from jail on 8 October 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3142801.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Musician admits burgling bandmate's flat|date=12 August 2003|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/libertines/15033|work=NME|title=Pete Libertine Goes to Jail|date=8 September 2003|access-date=28 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3149610.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Libertines singer's sentence cut|date=29 September 2003|access-date=6 January 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?b=news&id=13717|publisher=[[xfm]]|title=Libertine Reunited with Liberated Pete|date=9 October 2003|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref>

On 2 February 2005, Doherty was arrested after an altercation with documentary filmmaker [[Max Carlish]], who was making a [[rockumentary]] about the singer and sold photos of a heroin-smoking Doherty to the tabloids. Doherty and his friend Alan Wass had been charged with robbery and blackmail. On 7 February, he was released on bail after his record company [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] put up £150,000 in bonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?b=news&id=65780|title=Pete Doherty Gets Conditional Bail|date=4 February 2005|publisher=xfm|access-date=9 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/05/feb/item18.shtml|title=Pete Doherty Released From Jail|date=8 February 2005|publisher=antimusic.com|access-date=9 May 2011}}</ref> All charges against him were later dropped by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] due to a lack of evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/12/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Pete Doherty's charges dropped|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|date=12 April 2005|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in an edition of the [[BBC Two]] documentary series ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of him talking about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty explained in an interview with the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''Front Row'' that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7042330.stm|title=Doherty 'at drugs turning point'|access-date=2 November 2007|date=12 October 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Doherty's mother, Jacqueline, has published a book about Doherty and his drug problems entitled ''Pete Doherty: My Prodigal Son''.<ref name="MotherInterview"/>

In late 2007, a photo was published in several newspapers of Doherty allegedly forcing his pet cat to inhale from a crack pipe.<ref name="sfgate1">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=20100|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Doherty 'Forced Cat to Smoke Crack'|date=7 September 2007|access-date=11 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="huffpost1">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/07/pete-doherty-photographed_1_n_63409.html|work=The Huffington Post|title=Pete Doherty Photographed Allegedly Giving His Kitten Crack|date=9 September 2007|access-date=11 March 2010}}</ref>

Doherty made another attempt to fight his drug addiction in September 2007, when he underwent rehab for six weeks at [[Clouds House]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7023339.stm|title=Doherty gets chance to kick drugs|publisher=BBC News|access-date=7 September 2008|date=2 October 2007}}</ref> However, he relapsed in November 2007 following his appearance at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2007]] in Munich.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7082897.stm|title=Doherty owns up to drug relapse|publisher=BBC News|access-date=7 September 2008|date=7 November 2007}}</ref>

On 8 April 2008, Doherty was jailed for 14 weeks by a court for breaching a probation order after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offences. On 18 April, he was moved to a private area of [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs prison]] after learning that fellow inmates were planning to attack him. On 6 May, he was released after his sentence was cut in half and a further 18 days were remitted due to a government plan to reduce overcrowding. He also had another two days off for being in police custody (after serving just over 4 weeks of a 14-week sentence). He described prison life as "a lot of gangsters and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]" and showed a certificate confirming he had passed a [[drugs test]] while inside.<ref name="afp111">{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641315053|title=Rocker Pete Doherty Freed From Prison|access-date=9 May 2011|date=6 May 2008|publisher=Sky News}}</ref>

In June 2009, Doherty was arrested in [[Gloucester]] and charged with driving dangerously, while drunk, and in possession of heroin. He was released on a £50,000 bail<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Doherty-released-50K-bail/article-1073630-detail/article.html|title=Doherty released on £50K bail|first=Jenni|last=Silver|publisher=thisisgloucestershire.co.uk|access-date=21 December 2009|date=13 June 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213153319/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Doherty-released-50K-bail/article-1073630-detail/article.html|archive-date=13 December 2009}}</ref> and after 'guilty' pleas were entered, was asked to return to court on 21 December for sentencing. He was spared jail but was ordered to pay £2,050 in fines, and was banned from driving for 18 months, despite the court hearing Doherty had 21 previous drug offences and six motoring offences. Following his release from court, he was escorted by officers to the nearest police station and re-arrested for possession of a controlled substance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6964514.ece|title=Pete Doherty rearrested after being convicted of driving and drug offences|first=Simon de|last=Bruxelles|work=The Times|access-date=9 May 2011|date=22 December 2009|location=London}}</ref> later revealed to be heroin.<ref name="news.sky.com">{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Singer-Pete-Doherty-Charged-With-Possession-Of-Heroin-Following-His-Arrest-After-A-Court-Appearance/Article/200912415506340|first=Neal|last=Walker|publisher=Sky News Online|title=Doherty Drug Charge After Court Appearance|access-date=22 December 2009|date=22 December 2009}}</ref> The following day, 22 December, it emerged that Doherty could be charged with offences linked to a hit-and-run incident, which left a pedestrian in a critical condition.

In June 2010, Doherty was refused entry into the United States after spending 10 hours in detention in [[JFK Airport]], despite having a visa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peck|first=Derek|title=New York Minute {{!}} Irina Lazareanu: Just a Kid from Canada|url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/268/Irina_Lazareanu_Just_a_Kid_from_Canada|publisher=AnOther|access-date=11 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pete Doherty never made it out of the airport.|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/06/pete_doherty_ne.html|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|access-date=11 June 2010}}</ref>

In January 2015, it was announced that Doherty had successfully completed his rehab treatment.

In a 2019 interview, when asked whether he would like to be drug-free, Doherty responded: "Yes, a part of me would. Just so I can feel things. There are so many people in my life who deserve better. It really is a mental deficiency... I'd be a force to be reckoned with! I’d have money and self-respect and clean hands."<ref name=drugs>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/26/peter-doherty-if-i-was-drug-free-id-be-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with|title=Peter Doherty: 'If I was drug free, I'd be a force to be reckoned with'|first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=26 April 2019|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
