'''Borislav Pekić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Борислав Пекић}}, {{IPA-sh|bǒrislaʋ pěkitɕ|pron}}; 4 February 1930 – 2 July 1992) was a Serbian and Yugoslav writer and political activist.

He was born in 1930, to a prominent family in [[Montenegro]], at that time part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. From 1945 until his emigration to [[London]] in 1971, he lived in Belgrade. He was also one of the founding members of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] in Serbia.<ref name="politika.rs">{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Tema-nedelje/Porodicno-stablo-demokrata/Osnivachi-Demokratske-stranke.lt.html |title=Оснивачи демократске странке ("Политика", 23. март 2008) |publisher=Politika.rs |access-date=2013-07-07}}</ref> He is considered one of the most important Serbian literary figures of the 20th century.<ref name = "New York Times article">{{cite news |url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/FDP/nytimes210104_e.html |title=New York Times, January 2004 Feature: Quieting a 'Vampire' From an Author's Grave |publisher=mfa.gov.rs |access-date=2009-02-19 |archive-date=2012-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220122222/http://www.mfa.gov.rs/FDP/nytimes210104_e.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krug.rs/dok-hodam/knjige-za-citanje/1424-okean-pekic-previous-article-la-sans-pareille-ljubavni-roman-sa-dodacima-next-article-kraljevo-od-varosi-do-grada-typography-medium-default-reading-mode-share-this-ocena-korisnika-0-5zvezda-neaktivnazvezda-neaktivnazvezda-neaktivnazvezda-neaktivnazvezda-neaktivna-ocenite-ocenite-ureduje-dragan-bajovic-borislav-pekic-pisma-iz-tudine-teme-i-dileme-u-ovom-publicistickom-stivu-su-tipicno-pekicevske-gd.html|title=PORTAL KRUG - JEDNA ZABORAVLJENA GODIŠNJICA|website=www.krug.rs|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>

== Life and works ==
=== Early life and novels ===
Borislav Pekić spent his childhood in different cities of [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Croatia]]. He graduated from high school in 1945 in Belgrade and shortly afterward was arrested<ref name = prison>{{cite web|author=(published by Ljiljana Pekić) |url=http://borislavpekic.blogspot.com/2006/03/borislav-peki-interrogation-or-self.html |title=Borislav Pekic Blog, March 2006 Feature, Borislav Pekić: Interrogation or Self-Interrogation |publisher=Borislavpekic.blogspot.com |date=2006-03-22 |access-date=2013-07-07}}</ref> with the accusation of belonging to the secret association "Yugoslav Democratic Youth" and sentenced to fifteen years of prison. During the time in prison, he conceived many of the ideas later developed in his major novels. He was released after five years and in 1953 began studying experimental psychology at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]], although he never earned a degree.

In 1958 he married Ljiljana Glišić, the niece of [[Milan Stojadinović]], Prime Minister of Yugoslavia (1935–1939) and a year later their daughter Aleksandra was born, who was later married to a German aristocrat, Baron Victor von [[Maltzahn]]. 1958 marked also the year when Pekić wrote his first of over twenty original film scripts for the major film studios in [[Yugoslavia]], among which ''[[Dan četrnaesti]]'' ("The Fourteenth Day") represented Yugoslavia at the 1961 [[Cannes Film Festival]].

For years Pekić had been working on several novels and when the first of them, ''Vreme čuda'' (1965), came out, it caught the attention of a wide reading audience as well as the critics. In 1976 it was published in English by Brace Harcourt in New York as ''The Time of Miracles''. It was also translated into French in 1986, [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1986, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in 1987, Italian in 2004, and [[Greek language|Greek]] in 2007. Pekić's first novel clearly announced two of the most important characteristics of his work: sharp anti-dogmatism and constant skepticism regarding any possible 'progress' mankind has achieved over the course of history.

When Pekić authored an anthology of Children's poetry, [[Grigorije Vitez]] criticised him because, even though Serbian literature for children is de facto richer then Croatian, he should have included more poets from Croatia.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kukić Rukavina|first=Ivana|title=Nakladnički nizovi Grigora Viteza za djecu i mladež|publisher=University of Zagreb|year=2015|isbn=|location=Zagreb|pages=206|quote=No, usudio bih se staviti jednu primjedbu, smatrajući da je bolje da to ja učinim sada, nego drugi kasnije kad knjiga izađe. Primjećujem to bez straha da mi se predbaci nacionalna preosjetljivost, tim više što sam po narodnosti Srbin, a samo živim i rođen sam u Hrvatskoj. Kad god se radi o zajedničkim antologijama ili sličnim zajedničkim istupima, potrebno je još uvijek danas izbjeći eventualne prigovore o nesrazmjerima i nepravednostima prema ovoj ili onoj strani naše literature. Radi se o omjeru zastupljenosti srpske i hrvatske poezije. Činjenica je da je srpski dio književnosti bogatiji u dječjoj književnosti, ali omjer broja pjesama, čini mi se, i previše je na uštrb hrvatskih: od 66 pjesnika otprilike 24 pripadaju hrvatskom dijelu i to bi možda još išlo, ali ako se uzme broj pjesama, onda je razlika prevelika: na hrvatske otpada tek nešto preko jedne petine (65 pjesama od 303).}}</ref>

During the 1968–1969 period, Pekić was one of the editors of ''Književne novine'' literary magazine. In 1970 his second novel, ''Hodočašće Arsenija Njegovana'' (The Pilgrimage of Arsenije Njegovan) was published, in which an echo of the students protests of 1968 in Yugoslavia can be found. Despite his ideological distance from the mainstream opposition movements, the new political climate further complicated his relationship with the authorities, who refused him a passport for some time. The novel, nevertheless, won the [[NIN Prize|NIN award]] for the best Yugoslav novel of the year. An English translation ''The Houses of Belgrade'' appeared in 1978 and it was later published in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].

=== Exile and further work ===
[[File:26 - A9R17CA.jpg|thumb|Pekić with his wife Ljiljana holding their daughter in 1959.]]
Following Pekić's emigration to London in 1971,<ref>{{cite web|author=(published by Ljiljana Pekić) |url=http://borislavpekic.blogspot.com/2006/03/pekis-writings-in-london.html |title=Borislav Pekic Blog Mar 2006 Feature, Pekić's Writings in London |publisher=Borislavpekic.blogspot.com |date=2006-03-31 |access-date=2013-07-07}}</ref> the Yugoslav authorities still considered him ''persona non grata'' and for several years they prevented his books from being published in Yugoslavia. Finally, in 1975, ''Uspenje i sunovrat Ikara Gubelkijana'' ("The Rise and Fall of Icarus Gubelkian") appeared. It was later translated into [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1980, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in 1982, [[Czech language|Czech]] in 1985 and French in 1992.

In 1977 he sent the manuscript of ''Kako upokojiti Vampira'' ("How to Quiet a Vampire") to an anonymous literary competition. The Association of Yugoslav Publishers recognized it as the best novel of the year and promptly published it. ''Kako upokojiti Vampira'' was subsequently translated into [[Czech language|Czech]] in 1980, [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1985, and Italian in 1992, with an English translation finally appearing in 2005.  Based in part on Pekić's own prison experiences, this novel offers an insight into the methods, logic and psychology of a modern totalitarian regime.

''Odbrana i poslednji dani'' ("The Defense and the Last Days", 1977) was published in [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in 1982, [[Czech language|Czech]] in 1983, French in 1989 and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in 2003.  These three novels essentially dealt with contrasting types of collaboration in Yugoslavia at different levels during [[World War II]].

In 1978, after more than two decades of preparation, investigation and study, the first volume of ''Zlatno runo'' ("The Golden Fleece", 1978-1986) was published, fully establishing Pekić as one of the most important Serbian authors.  In 1987 he received Montenegrin ''Njegoš'' award for this work, marking it as one of the most important contemporary prose writings in Yugoslavia.  ''The Golden Fleece'' prompted comparison by international critics to [[James Joyce]]’s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and its narrative patterns of classical myths, to [[Thomas Mann|Thomas Mann's]] ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'' and its long family history and evolution of pre-war society, and to [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' and its inner tensions created through a maze of conflicting perspectives; yet ''The Golden Fleece'' was also hailed as unique.  One of the novel’s obvious distinctions is its enormous scope and thematic complexity. ''The Golden Fleece'' describes the wanderings of generations of the Njegovans, and through them explores the history of the [[Balkans]].  The first, second and third volumes were published in French in 2002, 2003 and 2004. The fourth volume was published in 2008.

During the 1980s Pekić created something entirely new.  He had been collecting material for a book about the lost island of [[Atlantis]], with the intention to give “a new, although poetical, explanation of the roots, development, and the end of our civilization”. Despite the classical sources that inspired his anthropological interests, Pekić decided to project his new vision into the future and thus avoid the restrictions of the ‘historical models’, which he had inevitably had to confront in his earlier remakes of ancient myths.  The result was three novels: ''[[Rabies (1983 novel)|Besnilo]]'' ("Rabies", 1983), ''Atlantida'' ("Atlantis", 1988) and ''1999'' (1984).  The novel ''Rabies'' together with ''The Golden Fleece'' and ''The Years the Locusts Have Devoured'', were selected by readers as the best novels in the years from 1982 to 1991.  All of them were reprinted numerous times in Serbia.  ''Rabies'' was published in Spanish in 1988, and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in 1994, and ''Atlantis'' in [[Czech language|Czech]] in 1989.  For ''Atlantis'' Pekić won the ‘[[Croatian Goran]]’ award in 1988. At the end of 1984 Pekić's twelve volume ''Selected Works'' appeared, winning him an award from the Union of Serbian Writers.

''Godine koje su pojeli skakavci'' ("The Years the Locusts Have Devoured", in three volumes) was published between 1987 and 1990.  Two parts of the 1st volume were translated into English and published in literary magazines.  These are Pekić’s memoirs with an account of the post-war days and the life and persecutions of the bourgeoisie under the communist rule.  The account is not purely autobiographical in the classical sense, since Pekić also deals with life in general in Yugoslavia after the [[Second World War]].  He depicts prison life as a unique civilization and the civilization of ‘freedom’ as a special kind of prison. This trilogy was selected as the best memoir and received the ‘[[Miloš Crnjanski]]’ award.

The gothic stories ''Novi Jerusalim'' ("The New Jerusalem") were published in 1989, and Pekić accepted the ''Majska Rukovanja'' award in Montenegro in 1990 for his literary and cultural achievements. Two stories from the book were published in French, English and Ukrainian in different anthologies. 'Covek koji je jeo smrt' ("The man who ate death") from ''Novi Jerusalim'' ("The New Jerusalem") was translated into French in 2005, and won the French "Book Of The Day" award the same year.

=== Film, theater and radio ===

Pekić distinguished himself in the 1970s as one of the best [[Serbian language|Serbian]] contemporary dramatists. He regularly wrote radio-plays for [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], [[Cologne]], as well as [[Süddeutscher Rundfunk]], [[Stuttgart]].  Of the 27 plays written and performed in Serbia, 17 had their first production in Germany. Many of them were transformed into theatre and/or TV plays, and received a number of awards. Sixteen were published in his ''Odabrana dela'' (Selected works, 1984) and his play ''Generali ili srodstvo po oruzju'' (The Generals or Kinship-In-Arms, 1969) can be found in any anthology of Serbian contemporary drama.  Pekić's theatre plays were widely acclaimed and popular, the most famous being ''Korešpondencija'' (Correspondence 1979), which was based on the fourth volume of ''the Golden Fleece'' and ran for 280 performances and 23 years at the [[Atelje 212 Theatre]] in Belgrade.

Throughout his career, Pekić worked on numerous films, writing more than twenty original screenplays and adapting some of his novels to the screen. ''The Time of Miracles'' was selected to represent Yugoslavia at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1991, where it won an award, and later at film festivals in [[Glasgow]] and [[Montreal]].  ''The Devils Heaven'' (The Summer of White Roses) won an award at the film festival in [[Tokyo]] in 1989 and was selected the same year to represent Yugoslavia at film festivals in [[Montpellier]] (France), [[Pula]] (Croatia), [[San Sebastián]] (Spain), and [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] (USA).

As a part-time commentator at the [[BBC World]] Service in London, (1986–1991) Pekić read his ‘Letters from London’ every week; these were subsequently printed in Yugoslavia as ''Pisma iz tuđine'', ''Nova pisma iz tuđine'', and ''Poslednja pisma iz tuđine'' (Letters From Abroad, 1, 2 &3, 1987-1991).  Each book was made up of 50 letters with witty and inventive observations about England and the English people.  The letters were also broadcast for listeners in Serbia, for whom Pekić particularly enjoyed making numerous humorous comparisons between the English and his fatherland’s governments, country and people. For these books he received the [[Jasa Ignjatovic|Jaša Ignjatović]] award (Hungary) in 1991.  Pekić also ran a series on the same program at the BBC about the history of Great Britain, which was published posthumously - ''Sentimentalna povest Britanskog carstva'' (A Sentimental History Of The British Empire, 1992), for which he received the Yearly ‘Bigz’ award.  It was published several times enjoying a huge success.

=== End of life and posthumous texts ===

In 1989 he became one of the founding members<ref name="politika.rs"/> of [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|The Democratic Party]] in Serbia and in 1990 he became its Vice President and one of the editors of the party's newspaper "Demokratija" ("Democracy"). Pekić was a member of the [[International PEN|P. E. N. Association]] in London and Belgrade, and became Vice President of the Serbian P. E. N. Association between 1990-1992.  He was elected to The [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1985, and was made a member of the Advisory Committee to [[Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia|The Royal Crown]] in 1992. Active both as an author and a public figure until his last day, Pekić died of lung cancer at his home in London on 2 July 1992. He was laid to rest at the famous [[Novo groblje|'Alley of Distinguished Citizens']] ('Aleja zaslužnih građana') in Belgrade together with other distinguished figures from the social, political and cultural echelons of society. Posthumously, in 1992, H.R.H. [[Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia]] awarded Pekić the Royal Order of the Two-headed White Eagle, being the highest honour bestowed by a Serbian monarch.

A large body of his work was, and continues to be, published posthumously:<ref name= pekicblog>{{cite web|author=(published by Ljiljana Pekić) |url=http://www.borislavpekic.blogspot.com |title=See for more details on the recently established Borislav Pekic Blog |publisher=Borislavpekic.blogspot.com |access-date=2013-07-07}}</ref> ''Vreme reči'' ("The Time of Words"), 1993; ''Odmor od istorije'' ("A Break from History"), 1993; ''Graditelji'' ("The Builders"), 1994; ''Rađanje Atlantide'' ("The Birth of Atlantis"), 1996; ''Skinuto sa trake'' ("Transferred from Tapes"), 1996; ''U traganju za Zlatnim runom'' ("In Search of the Golden Fleece"), 1997; ''Izabrana pisma iz tuđine'' ("Selected Letters from Abroad"), 2000; ''Političke sveske''  ("Political Notebooks"), 2001; ''Filosofske sveske'' ("Philosophical Notebooks"), 2001; ''Korespondencija  kao  život, 1&2'' ("Correspondence as a Life"), 2002-2003; ''Sabrana pisma iz tuđine'' ("Collection of letters from abroad"), 2004, {{lang|sr|Roboti i sablasti}} ("Robots and Wraiths", collection of unpublished plays), 2006, ''Izabrane drame'' ("Selected plays"), 2007, ''Izabrani eseji'' ("Selected essays"), 2007, ''Moral i demokratija'' ("Moral and democracy", a collection of interviews and essays), 2008, {{lang|sr|Marginalije i moralije}} (collected thoughts from published and unpublished work), 2008.

On 1 and 2 July 2000 the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in Belgrade held a symposium with the theme: ‘Literary work of Borislav Pekić on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of his birth’. The essays from that symposium were published in 2003.

In 2006, his wife Ljiljana, credited with the abovementioned posthumously published work, started the Borislav Pekic blog<ref name= pekicblog/> where one can find published as well as yet unpublished works of Pekic.

Pekić has left a vast corpus of high literary quality characterized by following traits: narrative structures of growing complexity that, in the case of ''The Golden Fleece'' cross the fuzzy bounds of the post-modern novel and can be best described by the author's sub-title "Phantasmagoria" (this mammoth work is more than 3,500 pages long); the presence of autobiographical thread one can detect in all major Pekić's works, but especially in his vivid and unsentimental memoirs on his years as a political prisoner and essayist books on life in Britain; obsession with the theme of personal freedom crushed by the impersonal mechanism of the totalitarian power.

== Views ==
Pekić never took [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] during his life in exile in the United Kingdom. He considered himself a Serb and a Serbian writer and wanted to stay that way for the rest of his life, with which his wife and daughter showed solidarity.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Седмица|first=Магазин-|date=2020-02-04|title=ЉИЉАНА ПЕКИЋ: Мој муж је најбоље дефинисао Србе!|url=http://www.sedmica.me/ljiljana-pekic-moj-muz-je-najbolje-definisao-srbe/|access-date=2021-04-17|website=Седмица|language=sr-RS}}</ref>

In correspondence with friends, he stated that "no one wants him in Serbia", as well as that Serbs blamed him for not being a Serb enough in public appearances and that Montenegrins blamed him for "not standing up for their fictional nation".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korespondencija kao život|last=Pekić|first=Borislav|publisher=Solaris|year=2002|location=Novi Sad|pages=156}}</ref>
