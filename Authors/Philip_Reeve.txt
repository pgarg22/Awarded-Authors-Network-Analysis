'''Philip Reeve''' (born 28 February 1966) is a British author and illustrator of children's books, primarily known for the 2001 book ''[[Mortal Engines]]'' and its sequels. His 2007 novel, ''[[Here Lies Arthur]]'', based on the legendary [[King Arthur]], won the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]], which sets out to choose the year's best children's book published in the UK.

==Biography==
Born on 28 February 1966 in [[Brighton]], Reeve studied illustration, first at Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (CCAT – now [[Anglia Ruskin University]]), where he contributed a comic strip to the Student Union magazine, and later at Brighton Polytechnic (now the [[University of Brighton]]). Before becoming an illustrator he worked at a [[bookshop]] in Brighton for several years. During his student years and for a few years afterwards he wrote for and performed in comedy sketch shows with a variety of collaborators under various group names, among them The Charles Atlas Sisters. He lives on [[Dartmoor]] with his wife Sarah and their son Sam.

With [[Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon|Brian Mitchell]], Reeve is the author of a 1998 dystopian comic musical,''[[The Ministry of Biscuits]]''. <blockquote>"Stop! Think before you eat that biscuit! Is it in any way fancy? If so, then you are a criminal! In Post-War London, The Ministry of Biscuits casts its sinister shadow over every tea-time and elevenses in the land. Established to 'control biscuits, and to control the idea of biscuits', it prohibits decadent sweetmeats, such as the Gypsy Cream."<ref name="Biscuits">[http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Musical/The-Ministry-of-Biscuits/S1609/ UK Theatre web listing for The Ministry of Biscuits]</ref></blockquote> This was performed at the Pavilion Theatre, Brighton, the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford,<ref name="Biscuits" /> and the 1999 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It underwent a revival in 2005 at the Sallis Benney, Brighton,<ref name="Biscuits" /> and began playing at Brighton's ''Lantern Theatre'' in November 2017.<ref name="Foundry">[http://www.foundrygroup.co.uk/?p=2757 Ministry of Biscuits listing on the Foundry Group website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307051056/http://www.foundrygroup.co.uk/?p=2757 |date=7 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lanterntheatrebrighton.co.uk/event/the-ministry-of-biscuits/?instance_id=603 |title=The Ministry of Biscuits (2017-12-22) |access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref> It has also toured to various other locations throughout the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foundrygroup.co.uk/?page_id=3060 |title=Tour Dates – 'The Ministry of Biscuits':: |access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref>

Reeve provided cartoons for books, including those in the ''[[Horrible Histories]]'' and ''[[Murderous Maths]]'' series. He wrote the [[Buster Bayliss series]] of books for young readers, which includes ''Night of the Living Veg'', ''The Big Freeze'', ''Day of the Hamster'', and ''Custardfinger''. He is the author and illustrator of a Dead Famous non-fiction book: ''Horatio Nelson and His Victory''.

Reeve's first book for older readers was ''[[Mortal Engines]]'', which won the [[Nestlé Smarties Book Prize]] in age category 9–11 years and made the [[Whitbread Book Award]] shortlist. ''Mortal Engines'' is the first book in a series sometimes called the [[Mortal Engines Quartet]] (2001–2006), which includes ''[[Predator's Gold]]'', ''[[Infernal Devices (Philip Reeve novel)|Infernal Devices]]'' and ''[[A Darkling Plain]]''.<ref name=isfdb/> The books feature two young adventurers, Tom Natsworthy and [[Hester Shaw]], living in a lawless [[post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by [[Traction City|moving cities]]. For the fourth volume, Reeve won the once-in-a-lifetime 2006 [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=prize2006/><ref name=relaunch/><ref>https://www.thebookseller.com/insight/start-engines-757936</ref>

Reeve spent more than ten years on ''Mortal Engines'', coming up with ideas in 1989 or 1990, leading to publication in 2001. He was working on it part-time between illustration jobs, but as he became sure he could complete such a project, he cut down his illustration work and devoted more time to writing.<ref name=reilly/>

The 2007 novel ''[[Here Lies Arthur]]'' is an alternative version of the [[Arthurian legend]]. Reeve and ''Arthur'' won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|British librarians]], recognizing the year's best children's book published in the UK.<ref name=medal2008/>

The [[Larklight trilogy|''Larklight'' trilogy]] (2006–2008)<ref name=isfdb/> is [[steampunk]] set in outer space. The first book ''[[Larklight]]'' was being developed as a film by the Indian director [[Shekhar Kapur]], but he is no longer involved. Reeve professes that when planning out a novel, "I see it as a film that I run in my head, and I just keep running alternative versions of it until I come up with a cut I like.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6386685.html |title=Brits in Space: In Philip Reeve's latest novel, the British empire stretches to Saturn and beyond |access-date=28 October 2008 |last=Margolis |first=Rick |date=11 January 2006 |work=School Library Journal}}</ref> The future of the film is now in the hands of the Swedish director [[Tomas Alfredson]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=29128 |title=Tomas Alfredson Catches The Larklight: Directing the adventure novel adaptation EmpireOnline.com|access-date=26 October 2010 |last=White |first=James |date=6 October 2010 |work=Empire (film magazine)}}</ref>

Reeve began a series of ''Mortal Engines'' prequels with ''[[Fever Crumb]]'' (Scholastic UK, 2009).<ref name=isfdb/> The first was one of eight finalists for the 2010 Carnegie Medal.<ref name=prCILIP/> In March 2020 Reeve said he did not intend to finish or publish a fourth book in the [[Fever Crumb (series)|Fever Crumb series]], as too much time had passed, thereby forgoing the world of ''Mortal Engines''.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Philip Reeve's tweet in response to @SevrinY |url= https://twitter.com/philipreeve1/status/1239683913427140608 |work=Philip Reeve |access-date=24 March 2020 |author=Philip Reeve |format=Tweet |date=17 March 2020}}</ref>

In 2013, Reeve had his first co-authored, highly illustrated book with British-American writer-illustrator [[Sarah McIntyre]] published by Oxford University Press: ''Oliver and the Seawigs''. This went on to win the UKLA Award.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jul/10/ukla-book-awards-2015-winners-announced |title=UKLA book awards 2015: winners announced theguardian.com |access-date=10 July 2015 |last=Walker |first=Phoebe |date=10 July 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Their third book, ''Pugs of the Frozen North'', won an Independent Bookshop Week children's book award.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jun/17/independent-bookshop-week-childrens-book-awards-2016 |title=Pugs and cats steal the Indie Bookshop Week children's book awards 2016 |access-date=17 June 2016 |last=Drabble |first=Emily |date=17 June 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> The pair have a contract with the same publisher for a series of four more books, beginning with ''The Legend of Kevin''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/legend-kevin-set-oup-childrens-653316 |title=The Legend of Kevin set for OUP Children's |access-date=12 October 2017 |date=12 October 2017 |publisher=The Bookseller}}</ref>

In 2018, Reeve praised the [[Mortal Engines (film)|2018 ''Mortal Engines'' film adaptation]], saying the director, [[Christian Rivers]], had "done a fantastic job – a huge, visually awesome action movie with perfect pace and a genuine emotional core.... There are many changes to the characters, world, and story, but it's still fundamentally the same thing."<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=philipreeve1 |number=1068155703926374400 |title=I watched #MortalEngines twice this week, and it's brilliant.

On November 18, 2020, upon asked whether ''[[Mortal Engines]]'' would be rebooted for the television screens, he responded that, while that would be nice, it seemed unlikely.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unboxedlifemag.com/why-hbo-should-reboot-philip-reeves-mortal-engines/|title= Why HBO Should Reboot Philip Reeve's Mortal Engines UnBoxed Life|last= Bujak |first= Gabrielle |date= 13 November 2020 |website= www.unboxedlifemag.com |publisher= UnBoxed Life |access-date= 2020-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/philipreeve1/status/1328836428432859137|title= Philip Reeve on Twitter|last= Reeve |first= Philip |date= 18 November 2020 |publisher= Twitter |access-date= 2020-01-17 |quote=I have no idea!

==Writing methods==
Reeve claims not to be a methodical writer. He plans nothing at all, usually starting with an opening image, a closing image, and a few vague notions for the things that happen in between. This leads to thousands of words of rough draft material being abandoned – even entire novels, such as with ''Fever Crumb'' and ''Mortal Engines''. However, he takes ideas from these abandoned drafts to build the final version. It usually takes him a year to move a novel from first idea to publication – six months actively writing it, the rest editing and thinking.<ref name=reilly/><ref name=jones>{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Rhys |title=An Interview with Philip Reeve |url=http://www.thirstforfiction.com/authors/philip-reeve/an-interview-with-philip-reeve |date=9 October 2010 |access-date=30 October 2010}}</ref>
