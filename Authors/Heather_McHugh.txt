'''Heather McHugh''' (born August 20, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[poet]] notable for the independent ranges of her aesthetic as a poet, and for her working devotion to teaching and translating literature.

==Life==
Heather McHugh, a poet, translator, educator and caregiver-respite provider, was born in [[San Diego, California]], to Canadian parents.  They raised McHugh in [[Gloucester Point, Virginia]]. There, her father directed the marine biological laboratory on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]]. She began writing poetry at age five and claims to have become an expert "eavesdropper" by the age of twelve.  At the age of seventeen, she entered [[Harvard University]].  One notable work was ''Hinge & Sign: Poems 1968-1993'', which won the Bingham Poetry Prize of the Boston Book Review and the Pollack-Harvard Review Prize, and which was named by ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' a ''Notable Book of the Year''.  Another was "Glottal Stop: Poems by Paul Celan" which, with [[Nikolai B. Popov]], she co-translated and introduced; the book won the Griffin International Poetry Prize.

McHugh was elected a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1999.  She taught for some 40 years at American colleges and universities, including the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle; and she still takes some students through the low-residency [[Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers]].

In 2009, she was awarded the [[MacArthur Foundation]] "[[MacArthur Fellows Program|Genius Grant]]" for her work.<ref name=lacitis>{{citation |last=Lacitis |first=Erik |title=2 from Seattle win $500,000 "genius grants" | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=September 22, 2009 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009915541_webgeniusgrants22m.html}}</ref> and in 2011-2012, she started the non-profit CAREGIFTED ( http://caregifted.org ) to provide respite and tribute to long-term caregivers of the severely disabled and chronically ill.  For her work there she received notice from Encore.org's Purpose Prizes.

== Biography ==

McHugh has published eight books of poetry, one collection of critical essays, and four books of translation. She has received numerous awards and critical recognition in all of these areas, including several [[Pushcart Prize]]s, the Griffin Prize in poetry, and many others. Her poems resist contemporary identity politics. She also rejects categorization as a confessional poet, although she studied with [[Robert Lowell]] during the time when that described his work.

Her primary education included parochial school, where she credits a nun's emphasis on grammar as an early influence. When McHugh was a student at [[Yorktown High School (Virginia)|Yorktown High School]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], a teacher advised McHugh against applying to [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]], making her determined to get in. She arrived in Cambridge at age 17 and graduated with honors, receiving her B.A. from Harvard in 1970. She was a Fellow at Cummington Community for the Arts in 1970, and entered graduate school at the [[University of Denver]] in 1971, having already published a poem in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. She began teaching there, and received an [[Academy of American Poets]] prize in 1972. After earning her M.A. in 1972, McHugh received [[MacDowell Colony]] fellowships in 1973, 1974, and 1976. In 1974, she also received her first of three [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grants in poetry. McHugh was the poet-in-residence at [[Stephens College]] in [[Missouri]] between 1974 and 1976; she worked as an associate professor of English at the State University of New York at Binghamton between 1976 and 1982.

At 29, she completed a manuscript of poems titled ''Dangers'' (1976), that was a winner of [[Houghton Mifflin]] Co.'s New Poetry Series Competition, and was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1977. After a [[Yaddo]] Colony fellowship in 1980, her second book, titled ''A World of Difference: Poems'' (1981), was published by Houghton Mifflin. McHugh was 33. During this time, she was a visiting professor at [[Warren Wilson College]] in the M.F.A. Program for Writers in [[North Carolina]]; at [[Columbia University]] in New York between 1980 and 1981; and at the [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1982. During 1987, she was the Holloway Lecturer at the [[University of California in Berkeley]]. While the top journals published her poetry, some poems were also anthologized in prestigious collections, and top critics called her observations astute and noteworthy as well as courageous.

That same year ''World of Difference'' came out, her first book of translations was published. Her poetry translation of [[Jean Follain]]'s French work is titled ''D'apr√®s tout: Poems by Jean Follain'' (1981) and was published by Princeton University Press in the Lockhart Poetry in Translation series. In 1984, she became the Milliman Writer-In-Residence at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. The residency was initiated that same year, and McHugh filled the position until 2011 when she was appointed Pollock Professor of Creative Writing. During the 1980s, McHugh worked a great deal on translation, partly due to her alliance with her co-translator and husband at that time, who also taught at the University of Washington. Her translation work includes well-known international poets like [[Jean Follain|Follain]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], as well as [[Romania]]n Jewish poet of the Holocaust Paul Antschel, who wrote under the pseudonym [[Paul Celan]].  This latter translation, entitled ''Glottal Stop: Poems by Paul Celan'', would win the Griffin International Poetry Prize. (See reference below.)

Her skill in translating literature by Slavic writers became even more evident with the publication of ''Because the Sea Is Black: Poems of Blaga Dimitrova'' (1989) featuring the work of a [[Bulgaria]]n poet and novelist. [[Blaga Dimitrova|Dimitrova]], one of the best-loved writers in her homeland, became the first democratically elected vice-president of her country after the fall of communism. McHugh translated Dimitrova's poems for ''Wesleyan Poetry in Translation'' (published by the [[Wesleyan University Press]]) with her husband, Nikolai Popov, a scholar whom she married in 1987. Popov, an expert in Bulgarian and knowledgeable in the German and French languages, also helped to translate Celan's poetry, which was written in German.

In 1986, McHugh received a Bellagio grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. She published two more books of poetry during the 1980s: ''To the Quick'' (1987) and ''Shades'' (1988). In the late '80s, she also participated in an art project with Tom Phillips, resulting in a collectible book ''WHERE ARE THEY NOW?: The Class of Forty-Seven'' (1990). It consists of thirty images by Phillips which are interpreted in poems by McHugh and then further modified by Phillips. One of Phillips's images, "A Humument: A Treated Victorian Novel," from the collaboration is appropriately used on the cover of McHugh's essay collection ''Broken English: Poetry and Partiality'' (1993).

In 1994, ''Hinge & Sign: Poems 1968-1993,'' a collection of 24 new poems and selected poems from her five earlier books, was published by the [[Wesleyan University Press]]. The book won both the Harvard Review/Daniel Pollock Prize in 1995 and Boston Book Review's Bingham Poetry Prize and was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]]. The New York Times Book Review chose this poetry collection as a "Notable Book of the Year." In 1996, after the book's publication, she received a Lila Wallace/Reader's Digest Writing Award.

In 1998 McHugh received the [[Folger Library]]'s O.B. Hardison Prize for a poet who excels in teaching. In 1999 she was elected a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] and received the PEN/Voelker Award. During this year, her poetry was anthologized in The New Bread Loaf Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry, alongside poets laureate like [[Rita Dove]] and [[Robert Pinsky]], and other contemporaries like [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]], [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], and [[Marilyn Hacker]]. McHugh also began to serve as a judge for numerous poetry competitions, including the National Poetry Series and the Laughlin Prize. She was a member of the Board of Directors for the Associated Writing Programs between 1981 and 1983. She served on the Literature Panel for the National Endowment for the Arts during 1983 and 1986. In 1991, she was the Coal-Royalty Chair at the [[University of Alabama]]. In 1992, McHugh was the Elliston Poet at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. In 1991, she was the visiting professor at the [[University of Iowa]] and, in 1994, at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].

She takes editing collections of younger poets seriously, and helped to select poems for ''Hammer and Blaze: a Gathering of Contemporary American Poets'' (2001), published by the University of Georgia Press, which she co-edited with Ellen Bryant Voigt. About her job guest editing ''Ploughshares'' in Spring 2001, McHugh writes, "The sheer syntactical elegance of many of these new poems suggests an instrumental refinement for which I'm grateful: I'm an old [[Richard Wilbur]]/[[Anthony Hecht]] fan, and have had reason now and then to regret, during my quarter century of teaching in M.F.A. programs, the relative unfashionability of rhetorical flourish."

At the end of 2001, McHugh's sixth collection of poetry, ''The Father of the Predicaments,'' was published by the Wesleyan University Press. That same year, McHugh, with Nikolai Popov, received the first International Griffin Poetry Prize in translation for ''Glottal Stop: 101 Poems by Paul Celan''. Her next poetry collection, ''Eyeshot,'' was published in (2003) by [[Wesleyan University Press]], and her latest collection, ''Upgraded to Serious,''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/upgraded-to-serious-by-heather-mchugh/|title=Copper Canyon Press: Upgraded to Serious by Heather McHugh|website=www.coppercanyonpress.org}}</ref> was released in 2009 both by [[Copper Canyon Press]] in the US and by Anansi in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/heather_mchugh|title=Heather McHugh - Poems, Biography, Quotes|website=famouspoetsandpoems.com}}</ref>
