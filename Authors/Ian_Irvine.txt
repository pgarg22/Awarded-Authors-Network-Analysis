Setting up his own environmental consulting firm in 1986, Irvine has worked in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including
Australia, [[Indonesia]], Singapore, [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Papua-New Guinea]], [[Mauritius]], [[Bali]], [[Fiji]] and [[Western Samoa]].

He was the principal author of Australia's National Environmental Assessment Guidelines for Dredging,<ref>http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/pollution/dumping/publications/guidelines.html</ref> 2009.

During 1987 Irvine began writing the first in his ''[[The View from the Mirror]]'' series. He continued working full-time as an environmental scientist and so wrote the series in his spare time. The first book in the series was published in 1998 and since this time Irvine has been a full-time author, although he still undertakes some environmental consulting work when he has time.

Irvine is married with four grown-up children and lives in the mountains of northern New South Wales.

'''Books for older readers'''

Irvine's most popular series is the Three Worlds fantasy series, comprising ''[[The View from the Mirror]]'', ''[[The Well of Echoes]]'' and ''[[The Song of the Tears]]'' and selling over a million copies worldwide. The series comprises eleven currently published books set on the three linked worlds of Santhenar, Aachan and Tallallame. The cycle details the struggle for survival between four human species: old humans, Aachim, Faellem and Charon. The View from the Mirror series has also been published in [[audiobook]] format.

Irvine's eco-thriller trilogy ''[[The Human Rites Trilogy]]'' explores a world undergoing catastrophic climate change. They are set a little way in Earth's future and shows the impact climate change is having on politics, the economy and life in general. The series was originally published between 2000 and 2003, and many of the events described in the books (such as the destruction of New Orleans by a huge hurricane) have since come true. A revised and updated edition of the Human Rites trilogy was published in Australia between 2008 and 2010.

Irvine has written two novellas. ''Poisoned Chalice'' was published in Mystery, Magic, Voodoo and the Holy Grail (2000), and ''Tribute to Hell'' was published in Legends of Australian Fantasy in 2010.

In addition to fantasy fiction Irvine has also written a number of other works including ''The Truth About Publishing'' and ''The Art and Science of Book Promotion'' which both 'tell it like it is' about being a successful author.

'''Books for children'''

Irvine published 11 books for adults before he began his first children's series, ''[[Runcible Jones]]'', in 2006. The series comprises four books for children aged 10 and up. His second children's series, ''[[The Sorcerer's Tower]]'', is a quartet of short books for younger readers (from around eight years and up) and was published in 2008 and illustrated in black and white by Australian artist and fantasy novelist [[D. M. Cornish]]. This was followed by the ''[[Grim and Grimmer]]'' quartet of humorous fantasy novels (2010 and 2011).

Many of Irvine's books (for both children and adults) are now available as [[ebooks]].

Irvine has also produced "book trailers" (similar to movie trailers) for a number of his children's and adults books and has placed them on YouTube.
