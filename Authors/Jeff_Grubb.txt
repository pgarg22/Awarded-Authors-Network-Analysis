As a [[freshman]], he attended the campus war-gaming club and was introduced to the role-playing game, ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref name="Dragon #111" /> Grubb said,
:"I walked up to a group of players to ask what they were doing. One turned to me, handed me three six-siders, and said, 'Roll these. We need a [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|cleric]].' It was all downhill from there."<ref name="Dragon #247" />
Within the year, Grubb attended [[Gen Con]], a table-top [[gaming convention]], for the first time. He also ran his own campaign set in [[Abeir-Toril|Toril]], his own game universe.<ref name="Dragon #111" />
