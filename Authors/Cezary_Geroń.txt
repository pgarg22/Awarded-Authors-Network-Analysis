Afterwards he moved to [[Kraków]], where he joined the Faculty of French Studies. He then moved to the [[Warsaw University]], from which he graduated. He started working as a journalist and correspondent for the ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''. At that time he started to translate Italian poetry, notably the works of [[Eugenio Montale]], [[Alfonso Gatto]], [[Mario Luzi]] and [[Umberto Saba]]. He was also active as a journalist, speaker and translator for the [[Polish Radio]] and the [[Polish Television]]. In 1991 he started working as a teacher of the history of music, Polish and Italian languages at the Warsaw-based 1st Community College ''Bednarska''.
