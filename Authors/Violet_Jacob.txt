'''Violet Jacob''' (1 September 1863 – 9 September 1946) was a Scottish writer known especially for her historical novel ''Flemington'' and for her poetry, mainly in [[Scots language|Scots]]. She was described by a fellow Scottish poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] as "the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets".

==Early life==
Jacob was born '''Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine''', at the [[House of Dun]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite ODNB |title=Jacob [née Kennedy-Erskine], Violet Augusta Mary Frederica |last=Anderson |first=Carol |date=25 May 2006 |doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/58422}}</ref> the daughter of William Henry Kennedy-Erskine (1 July 1828 – 15 September 1870) of [[Dun, Angus|Dun, Forfarshire]], a Captain in the [[17th Lancers]] and Catherine Jones (died 13 February 1914), the only daughter of William Jones of [[Henllys, Carmarthenshire|Henllys]], [[Carmarthenshire]]. Her father was the son of John Kennedy-Erskine (1802–1831) of [[House of Dun|Dun]] and [[Lady Augusta Gordon|Augusta FitzClarence]] (1803–1865), the illegitimate daughter of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] and [[Dorothea Jordan|Dorothy Jordan]]. She was a great-granddaughter of [[Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa]].

The area of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] where her family seat of [[House of Dun|Dun]] was situated was the setting for much of her fiction. She married, at St John's Episcopal Church, Princes Street, Edinburgh, on 27 October 1894, Arthur Otway Jacob (1867–1936),<ref name=":0" /> an Irish [[major]] in the [[British Army]], and accompanied him to India where he was serving. Her book ''Diaries and letters from India 1895–1900'' is about their stay in the Central Indian town of [[Mhow]]. The couple had one son, Harry, born in 1895, who died as a soldier at the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916. Arthur died in 1936, and Violet returned to live at [[Kirriemuir]], in Angus. She died of heart disease on 9 September 1946 and was buried beside her husband at the graveyard at Dun kirk.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|title=Jacob [née Kennedy-Erskine], Violet Augusta Mary Frederica (1863–1946), writer|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-58422|access-date=2021-01-25|year=2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/58422}}</ref>

==Scots poetry==
Violet Jacob was described by [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] as "by far the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Contemporary Scottish Studies |last=MacDiarmid |first=Hugh |year=1925 }}</ref> a view he did not rescind over a fifty-year period.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Lum Hat |last=Garden |first=Ronald |publisher=Aberdeen University Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-08-028449-3 }}</ref> She was particularly known for her poems in the Angus dialect. Her poetry was associated with that of Scots revivalists like [[Marion Angus]], [[Alexander Gray (poet)|Alexander Gray]] and [[Lewis Spence]], who drew their inspiration from early Scots poets such as [[Robert Henryson]] and [[William Dunbar]], rather than from [[Robert Burns]].<ref>Scottish renaissance (2000). In ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. Retrieved from [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupliteng/scottish_renaissance 17 December 2011.]</ref>

Jacob is commemorated in [[Makars' Court]], outside the [[Writers' Museum]], [[Lawnmarket]], Edinburgh. Selections for Makars' Court are made by the Writers' Museum, [[The Saltire Society]] and [[The Scottish Poetry Library]]. In 1936 she was awarded an honorary LLD degree by Edinburgh University.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=11 September 1946|title=Death of Violet Jacob: A Notable Scottish Poet 'Songs of Angus'|page=4|work=[[The Scotsman]]|url=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>

Oh, tell me what was on yer road, ye roarin' norlan wind

My feet they trayvel England, but I'm deein' for the north –

}}

''The Wild Geese'', which takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, is a sad poem of longing for home. It was set to music as ''Norlan' Wind'' and popularised by Angus singer and songmaker [[Jim Reid (folk musician)|Jim Reid]],<ref>[http://www.springthyme.co.uk/wildgeese/index.htm "Jim Reid: The Norland Wind/ The Wild Geese" at springthyme.co.uk]</ref> who also set to music other poems by Jacob and other Angus poets such as Marion Angus and Helen Cruikshank.<ref>[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4556786.asp "Norlan' Wind (The Wild Geese)" at educationscotland.gov.uk]</ref> Another version, sung by [[The Singing Kettle|Cilla Fisher and Artie Trezise]], appeared on their 1979 [[Topic Records]] album ''Cilla and Artie''. Traditional folk band [[Malinky]] are among many other artists who have released versions of ''Norland Wind''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://folking.com/tag/malinky/ |title=Malinky, Norlan'Wind/Wild Geese }}</ref>
