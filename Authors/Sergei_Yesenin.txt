==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:RybnoeDistrict 06-13 Konstantinovo village 09.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Yesenin's birth house in Konstantinovo]]
Sergei Yesenin was born in Konstantinovo in [[Ryazan Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] to a peasant family. His father was Alexander Nikitich Yesenin (1873–1931), his mother Tatyana Fyodorovna (nee Titova, 1875–1955).<ref name="chronology">[https://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/хронологическая-канва-жизни-и-творчества-с-а-есенина/ S.A.

Both his parents spent most of their time looking for work, father in Moscow, mother in Ryazan, so at age two Sergei was moved to the nearby village Matovo, to join Fyodor Alexeyevich and Natalya Yevtikhiyevna Titovs, his relatively well-off maternal grandparents, who essentially raised him.<ref name="1924_auto">[https://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/автобиографии/ 1924 autobiography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117072409/http://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/автобиографии |date=17 November 2016 }}.

The Titovs had three grown-up sons, and it was they who were Yesenin's early years' companions. "My uncles taught me horse-riding and swimming, one of them... even employed me as hound-dog, when going out to the ponds hunting ducks," he later remembered. He started to read aged five, and at nine began to write poetry, inspired originally by [[chastushka]]s and folklore,<ref name="1922_auto">[https://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/автобиографии/ 1922 Autobiography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117072409/http://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/автобиографии |date=17 November 2016 }} The Works by Sergey Yesenin in Three Volumes.

Москва, 1970</ref> He had two younger sisters, Yekaterina (1905–1977), and Alexandra (1911–1981).<ref name="chronology"/>

In 1904 Yesenin joined the Konstantinovo [[Zemstvo|zemstvo school]]. In 1909 he graduated it with an honorary certificate, and went on to study in the local secondary [[parochial school]] in [[Spas-Klepiki]]. From 1910 onwards, he started to write poetry systematically; eight poems dated that year were later included in his 1925 Collected Works.<ref name="chronology"/> In all, Yesenin wrote around thirty poems during his school years. He compiled them into what was supposed to be his first book which he titled "Bolnye Dumy" (Sick Thoughts) and tried to publish it in 1912 in Ryazan, but failed.<ref name="az_lib">Zakharov, A.I.

Биобиблиографический словарь. Том 1. А-Л. Под редакцией П. А. Николаева. М., "Просвещение", 1990</ref>

In 1912, with a teacher’s diploma, Yesenin moved to Moscow, where he supported himself working as a proofreader's assistant at the [[Ivan Sytin|Sytin]]'s printing company. The following year he enrolled in Chanyavsky University to study history and philology as an external student, but had to leave it after eighteen months due to lack of funds.<ref name="1923_auto"/> In the University he became friends with several aspiring poets, among them Dmitry Semyonovsky, Vasily Nasedkin, Nikolai Kolokolov and Ivan Filipchenko.<ref name="1924_auto"/> Yesenin’s first marriage (which lasted three years) was in 1913 to Anna Izryadnova, a co-worker from the publishing house, with whom he had a son, Yuri.<ref name="chronology_2">[https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/94327/115/Kunyaev_-_Sergeii_Esenin.html Sergey Yesenin Timeline]. – www.e-reading.club // Основные даты жизни и творчества С. А. Есенина</ref> 1913 saw Yesenin becoming increasingly interested in Christianity, biblical motives became frequent in his poems. "Grisha, what I am reading at the moment is the [[Gospel]] and find a lot of things which for me are new,"<ref>''Гриша, в настоящее время я читаю Евангелие и нахожу очень много для меня нового''</ref> he wrote to his close childhood friend G. Panfilov. That was also the year when he became involved with the Moscow revolutionary circles: for several months his flat was under secret police surveillance and in September 1913 it was raided and searched.<ref name="az_lib"/>

===Life and career===
[[File:Esenin1914.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Yesenin in 1914]]
In January 1914 Yesenin's first published poem "Beryoza" (The Birch Tree) appeared in the children's magazine ''Mirok'' (Small World). More appearances followed in minor magazines such as ''Protalinka'' and ''Mlechny Put''. In December 1914 Yesenin quit work "and gave himself to poetry, writing continually," according to his wife.<ref>Anna Izryadnova's Memoirs, 1965 // Изряднова А. Р. // Воспоминания о Сергее Есенине.-- М., 1965.-- С. 101</ref> Around this time he became a member of the Surikov Literary and Music circle.<ref name="chronology"/>

In 1915, exasperated with the lack of interest in his work in Moscow, Yesenin moved to [[Petrograd]]. He arrived at the city on 8 March and the next day met [[Alexander Blok]] at his home, to read him poetry. He received a warm welcome and soon became acquainted with fellow-poets [[Sergey Gorodetsky]], [[Nikolai Klyuev]] and [[Andrei Bely]] and well known in literary circles. Blok was especially helpful in promoting Yesenin's early literary career, describing him as "a gem of a peasant poet"<ref>Alexander Blok. Notebooks // Блок А. Записные книжки. 1901–1920. М., 1965. С. 567</ref> and his verse as "fresh, pure and resounding", even if "wordy".<ref>Alexander Blok. Collected Works in 8 Volumes. Vol.8, p. 441 // Блок А. Собр. соч.: В 8 т. – М.; Л., 1963. – Т. 8. – С. 441</ref> The same year he joined the Krasa (Beauty) group of peasant poets which included Klyuyev, Gorodetsky, [[Sergey Klychkov]] and Alexander Shiryayevets, among others.<ref name="az_lib"/> In his 1925 autobiography Yesenin said that Bely gave him the meaning of form while Blok and Klyuev taught him lyricism.<ref name="1925_auto">[https://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/автобиографии/ 1925 Autobiography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117072409/http://serge-esenin.jimdo.com/биография/автобиографии |date=17 November 2016 }}.

Москва, 1970</ref> It was Klyuyev who introduced Yesenin to the publisher Averyanov, who in early 1916 released his debut poetry collection ''Radunitsa'' which featured many of his early spiritual-themed verse. "I would have eagerly relinquished some of my religious poems, large and small, but they make sense as an illustration of poets' progress towards the revolution," he would later write.<ref name="az_lib"/> Yesenin and Klyuyev maintained close and intimate<ref>[https://iz.ru/news/330045  Между Лениным и Есениным] at Izvestia.ru</ref> friendship which lasted several years.<ref name="1922_auto"/><ref name="prokhushev">Prokhushev, Yuri [http://az.lib.ru/e/esenin_s_a/text_0460.shtml Sergey Yesenin].

In 1915 Yesenin became a co-founder of the Krasa literary group and published numerous poems in the Petrograd magazines ''[[Russkaya Mysl]]'', ''Ezhemesyachny Zhurnal'', ''[[Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh|Novy Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh]]'', ''Golos Zhizni'' and ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]''.<ref name="1923_auto"/> Among the authors he met later in the year were [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Nikolai Gumilyov]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]]; he also visited painter [[Ilya Repin]] in his Penaty.<ref name="chronology_2"/> Yesenin's rise to fame was meteoric; by the end of the year he became the star of St Petersburg's literary circles and salons. "The city took to him with the delight a gourmet reserves for strawberries in winter. A barrage of praise hit him, excessive and often insincere," [[Maxim Gorky]] wrote to [[Romain Rolland]].<ref>The Collected Works by Maxim Gorky in 30 volumes.

[[File:Eseninnikolaiklyeuv.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Yesenin and [[Nikolai Klyuev]], circa 1917]]

On 25 March 1916, Yesenin was drafted for military duty and in April joined a medical train based in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], under the command of colonel D.N. Loman. In 22 July 1916, at a special concert attended by [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna]] (the train's patron) and her daughters, Yesenin recited his poems "Rus" and "In Scarlet Fireglow".<ref name="1922_auto"/> "The Empress told me my poems were beautiful, but sad. I replied, the same could be said about Russia as a whole," he recalled later.<ref name="1923_auto"/> His relationships with Loman soon deteriorated. In October, Yesenin declined the colonel's offer to write (with Klyuyev) and have published a book of pro-monarchist verses, and spent twenty days under arrest as a consequence.<ref name="chronology_2"/>

In March 1917, Yesenin was sent to the Warrant Officers School but soon deserted the [[Kerensky]]'s army.<ref name="chronology_2"/> In August 1917 (having divorced Izryadnova a year earlier) Yesenin married for a second time, to [[Zinaida Raikh]] (later an actress and the wife of [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]). They had two children, a daughter [[Tatyana Yesenina|Tatyana]] and a son Konstantin.<ref name="chronology"/> The parents subsequently quarreled and lived separately for some time prior to their divorce in 1921. Tatyana became a writer and journalist and Konstantin Yesenin would become a well-known soccer statistician.

Yesenin supported the [[February Revolution]]. "If not for [it], I might have withered away on useless religious symbolism," he wrote later.<ref name="az_lib"/> He greeted the rise of the Bolsheviks too. "In the Revolution I was all on the side of the October, even if perceiving everything in my own peculiar way, from a peasant's standpoint," he remembered in his 1925 autobiography.<ref name="az_lib"/> Later he criticized the Bolshevik rule, in such poems as "The Stern October Has Deceived Me". "I feel very sad now, for we are going through such a period in [our] history when human individuality is being destroyed, and the approaching socialism is totally different from the one I was dreaming of," he wrote in an August 1920 letter to his friend Yevgeniya Livshits.<ref>The Works by Sergey Yesenin in Three Volumes. Moscow. Pravda Publishers. Vol. III, p.242</ref> "I never joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|RKP]], being further to the left than them," he maintained in his 1922 autobiography.<ref name="1922_auto"/>
[[File:Sergeieseninanatoljmariengof.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Yesenin (left) with Marienhof in 1915]]

Artistically, the revolutionary years were exciting time for Yesenin. Among the important poems he wrote in 1917–1918 were "Prishestviye" (The Advent), "Peobrazheniye" (Transformation, which gave the title to the 1918 collection), and "Inoniya". In February 1918, after the [[Sovnarkom]] issued the "[[Socialist Homeland is in Danger!]]" decree-appeal, he joined the [[esers]]' military unit. He actively participated in the magazine ''Nash Put'' (Our Way), as well as the almanacs Skify (Скифы) and Krasny Zvon (in February his large poem "Marfa Posadnitsa" appeared in one of the latter).<ref name="chronology"/> In September 1918 Yesenin co-founded (with Andrey Bely, Pyotr Oreshin, Lev Povitsky and Sergey Klychkov) the publishing house Трудовая Артель Художников Слова (the Labor Artel of the Artists of the Word) which reissued (in six books) all that he'd written by this time.<ref>[http://www.esenin.ru/o-esenine/vospominaniia/povitckii-l-o-sergee-esenine/lev-povitckii-drug-sergeia-esenina Лев Повицкий, друг Сергея Есенина] / Lev Povitsky, the Friend of Sergey Yesenin. – www.esenin.ru / Memoirs</ref><ref name="chronology_2"/>

In September 1918, Yesenin became friends with [[Anatoly Marienhof]], with whom he founded the Russian literary movement of [[imaginism]]. Describing their group's general appeal, he wrote in 1922: "Prostitutes and bandits are our fans. With them, we are pals. Bolsheviks do not like us due to some kind of misunderstanding."<ref name="1922_auto"/> In January 1919, Yesenin signed the Imaginists' Manifest. In February he, Marienhof and [[Vadim Shershenevich]], founded the Imaginists publishing house. Before that, Yesenin became a member of the Moscow Union of Professional Writers and several months later was elected a member of the All-Russian Union of Poets. Two of his books, ''Kobyliyu Korabli'' (Mare's Ships) and ''Klyuchi Marii'' (The Keys of Mary) came out later that year.<ref name="chronology_2"/>
[[File:Yesenin Dunkan.jpg|thumb|170px|Yesenin and [[Isadora Duncan|Duncan]] (1922)]]

In July–August 1920, Yesenin toured the Russian South, starting in [[Rostov-on-Don]] and ending in [[Tiflis]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In November 1920, he met Galina Benislavskaya, his future secretary and close friend. Following an anonymous report, he and two of his Imaginist friends, brothers Alexander and Ruben Kusikovs, were arrested by the [[Cheka]] in October but released a week later on the solicitation of his friend [[Yakov Blumkin]].<ref name="chronology_2"/> In the course of that year, the publication of three of Yesenin's books were refused by publishing house Goslitizdat. His ''Triptych'' collection came out through the Skify Publishers in [[Berlin]]. Next year saw the collections ''Confessions of a Hooligan'' (January) and ''Treryaditsa'' (February) published. The drama in verse ''Pygachov'' came out in December 1921, to much acclaim.<ref name="chronology"/>

In May 1921 he visited a friend, the poet Alexander Shiryaevets, in Tashkent, giving poetry readings and making a short trip to Samarkand. In the fall of 1921, while visiting the studio of painter Georgi Yakulov, Yesenin met the Paris-based American dancer [[Isadora Duncan]], a woman 18 years his senior. She knew only a dozen words in Russian, and he spoke no foreign languages. Nevertheless, they married on 2 May 1922. Yesenin accompanied his celebrity wife on a tour of Europe and the United States. His marriage to Duncan was brief and in May 1923, he returned to Moscow.<ref name="chronology"/> In his 1922 autobiography, Yesenin wrote: "Russia's recent nomadic past does not appeal to me, and I am all for civilization. But I dislike America intensely. America is a stinking place where not just art is being murdered, but with it, all the loftiest aspirations of humankind. If it's America that we are looking up to, as [a model for our] future, then I'd rather stay under our greyish skies... We do not have those skyscrapers that's managed to produce up to date nothing but Rockefeller and [[Robert R. McCormick|McCormick]], but here [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Dostoyevsky]], [[Pushkin]] and [[Lermontov]] were born."<ref name="1923_auto"/>

In 1923 Yesenin became romantically involved with the actress Augusta Miklashevskaya to whom he dedicated several poems, among them those of the ''Hooligan's Love'' cycle. In the same year, he had a son by the poet Nadezhda Volpina. [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]] grew up to become a poet and a prominent activist in the [[Soviet dissident]] movement of the 1960s.  Since 1972, till his death in 2016, he lived in the United States as a famous mathematician and teacher.
As Yesenin's popularity grew, stories began to circulate about his heavy drinking and consequent public outbursts. In autumn 1923, he was arrested in Moscow twice and underwent a series of enquiries from the [[OGPU]] secret police. Fellow poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], wrote that, after his return from America, Yesenin became more visible in newspaper police log sections than in poetry.<ref>V. Mayakovsky "How to Make Poems"</ref>

More serious were the accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] against Yesenin and three of his close friends, fellow poets, Sergey Klytchkov, Alexei Ganin and Pyotr Oreshin, made by [[Lev Sosnovsky]], a prominent journalist and close Trotsky associate. The foursome retorted with an open letter in ''[[Pravda]]'' and, in December, were cleared by the Writers' Union [[burlaw court]]. It was later suggested, though, that Yesenin's departure to the Caucasus in the summer of 1924 might have been a direct result of the harassment by the NKVD. Earlier that year, fourteen writers and poets, including his friend Ganin, were arrested as the alleged members of the (apparently fictitious) Order of the Russian Fascists, then tortured and executed in March without trial.<ref name="chronology"/>

In January–April 1924, Yesenin was arrested and interrogated four times. In February, he entered the Sheremetev hospital, then was moved into the Kremlin clinic in March. Nevertheless, he continued to make public recitals and released several books in the course of the year, including ''Moskva Kabatskaya''. In August 1924 Yesenin and fellow poet Ivan Gruzinov published a letter in ''Pravda'', announcing the end of the Imaginists.<ref name="chronology_2"/>

In early 1925 Yesenin met and married Sophia Andreyevna Tolstaya (1900–1957), a granddaughter of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In May what proved to be his final large poem ''Anna Snegina'' came out. During the year, he compiled and edited The Works by Yesenin in three volumes which was published by [[Gosizdat]] posthumously.<ref name="chronology_2"/>

===Death===
On 28 December 1925, Yesenin was found dead in his room in the [[Hotel Angleterre]] in Leningrad. His last poem ''Goodbye my friend, goodbye'' (''До свиданья, друг мой, до свиданья'') according to Wolf Ehrlich was written by him the day before he died. Yesenin complained that there was no ink in the room, and he was forced to write with his blood.
[[File:Esenin1925ondeathbed.jpg|thumb|Yesenin's corpse in his hotel room]]
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|

No saddened brows in remorse, –
To die, in this life, is not new,
And living’s no newer, of course.}}

According to his biographers, the poet was in a state of depression and committed suicide by hanging.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Royzman|first1=M.D|title=Сергей Есенин Всё, что помню о Есенине|date=1973|publisher=[[Sovetskaya Rossiya]]|location=Moscow|url=http://bibliotekar.ru/esenin-sergey/26.htm|language=ru|chapter=26.

After the funeral in Leningrad, Yesenin's body was transported by train to Moscow, where a farewell for relatives and friends of the deceased was also arranged. He was buried 31 December 1925, in Moscow's [[Vagankovskoye Cemetery]]. His grave is marked by a white marble sculpture.

A theory exists that Yesenin's death was actually a murder by [[OGPU]] agents who staged it to look like suicide. The novel ''Yesenin''<ref>{{cite book|last=Bezrukov|first=Vitali|title=Есенин|year=2005|publisher=Amfora|location=Moscow|isbn=5-94278-924-X|url=http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/7231240/}}</ref> published by [[Vitali Bezrukov]] is devoted to this version of Yesenin's death. In 2005 TV serial ''Sergey Yesenin'' based on this novel (with [[Sergey Bezrukov]] playing Yesenin) was shown on [[Channel One Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Romanova|first=Natalia|title=Сергей Есенин. Убийство Есенина – убийство совести русского народа коммунистическим режимом|url=http://www.epochtimes.ru/content/view/43187/9/|work=The Epoch Times}}</ref> Facts tending to support the assassination hypothesis were cited by [[Stanislav Kunyaev]] and Sergey Kunyaev in the final chapter of their biography of Yesenin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kunyaev|first=Stanislav |author2=Kunyaev, Sergey |title=Сергей Есенин |year=2010 |publisher=Molodaya gvardiya |location=Moscow |isbn= 978-5-235-03363-4 |url= http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5321991/ }} (pp. 537-598). Among facts to support the assassination hypothesis were:

1) At the time of his death, Yesenin was actively working on his collected works. He was not drinking after his departure from Moscow and was enthusiastic about leaving the capital and working on other new texts.  A project he was dreaming about was close to success: to start editing a literature magazine of his own. Most of his manuscripts were missing from his hotel room and had never been discovered (including his recently announced novella known under the work title ''When I was a boy…'' and his ''winter poems'' from the last months). Yesenin preferred to be well ordered in his work; but his hotel room was in extreme chaos, with his things scattered on the floor and with signs of a fight.

2) Yesenin had a fresh wound on his shoulder, one on his forehead and a bruise under one of his eyes. A few weeks before his death, many of his friends claimed that he had been carrying a revolver, but this weapon was never discovered. His jacket was missing, and he had to be covered with a sheet from the hotel.  The ligature with which he purportedly hanged himself, made from a belt that later disappeared, was reportedly not a hanging one: it was only holding the body to one side, to the right. Nevertheless, no further investigations were documented to have been made in this direction. The room where he died was also not examined.

3) The photos of the hotel room and the body were not made by a police photographer. None of his close friends (e.g. Klyuev, Valerian Pravduhin, Ilya Sadofiev) was taken to see the room. Neither were they officially interrogated, while Ehrlich reportedly did not seem aggrieved by the events (Ehrlich was sentenced to death and shot in 1937). The work known as his ''last poem'' is sometimes considered as written in 1924 and dedicated to the fellow poet Viktor Manuilov.

4) The medical documentation does not include the supposed hour of death. Later experts considered it careless and point out that the language is uncharacteristic for an experienced doctor like the one involved, Alexander Gilyarevsky, who died in 1931.

5) The fact that Yesenin remained in the Hotel Angleterre, where there was a regular strong police presence, is still unexplained, given the poet’s late negativism towards the authorities and his persistent feeling that they were following him and threatening him, shared with friends on various occasions. Moreover, he was not registered in the hotel, as well as his friend, the writer Georgy Ustinov, which may be interpreted as a sign that the visit may have already been prepared and planned by others. (Georgy Ustinov also reportedly killed himself in 1932.)</ref>

Enraged by his death, Mayakovsky composed a poem called ''To Sergei Yesenin'', where the resigned ending of Yesenin's death poem is countered by these verses: "in this life it is not hard to die, / to mold life is more difficult." In a later lecture on Yesenin, he said that the revolution demanded "that we glorify life." However, Mayakovsky himself would commit suicide in 1930.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klop, Stikhi, Poėmy|last=Mayakovsky|first=Vladimir|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|isbn=0253201896|pages=28 (introduction by Patricia Blake)}}</ref>

Yesenin's suicide triggered an epidemic of copycat suicides by his mostly female fans. For example, Galina Benislavskaya, his ex-girlfriend, killed herself by his graveside in December 1926. Although he was one of Russia's most popular poets and had been given an elaborate [[state funeral]], some of his writings were banned by [[the Kremlin]] during the reigns of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s criticism of Yesenin contributed significantly to the banning. Only in 1966 were most of his works republished.  Today Yesenin's poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.

[[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] included his poetry in his ''[[Requiem für einen jungen Dichter]]'' (''Requiem for a Young Poet''), completed in 1969.

The [[Ryazan State University]] is named in his honor.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rsu.edu.ru/index.php?section=457|publisher=Ryazan State University|access-date=8 September 2009|title=Кратко об университете}}</ref>

Yesenin appears as a character in the 1981 ballet ''[[Isadora (ballet)|Isadora]]'', by Kenneth Macmillan.

A [[Monument to Sergei Yesenin in St. Petersburg|monument to Yesenin]] opened in St. Petersburg in 1995.

In 2005 Russian studio Pro-Cinema Production produced a TV mini-series ''[[Yesenin (TV series)|Yesenin]]''. The movie described the version of his death according to which he was murdered by [[NKVD]] agents who staged his suicide. In the mini-series Yesenin was portrayed by [[Sergey Bezrukov]].

Sergei Yesenin's final poem was a major inspiration for the [[Bring Me the Horizon]] song "It Was Written in Blood" on their album ''[[Suicide Season]]''.

Yesenin is used as a pseudonym for a fictional poet in ''[[The Book of Laughter and Forgetting]]'' by [[Milan Kundera]]

Jim Harrison's poetry collection ''Letters to Yesenin'' is a series of poems addressed to Yesenin that illuminate his life and death.

Yesenin is the subject of the 2019 novel ''An Unquiet Heart'' by the English journalist and author [[Martin Sixsmith]].
