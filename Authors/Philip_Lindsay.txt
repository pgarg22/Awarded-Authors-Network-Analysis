'''Philip Lindsay''' (1906&ndash;1958) was an Australian writer, who mostly wrote [[historical novel]]s.  He was the son of [[Norman Lindsay]], an Australian artist and a younger brother of writer [[Jack Lindsay (writer)|Jack Lindsay]]. He was educated at the [[Anglican Church Grammar School]] in [[Brisbane]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=James|title=Churchie: The Centenary Register|year=2011|publisher=The Anglican Church Grammar School|location=Brisbane, Australia|isbn=978-0-646-55807-3}}</ref> and emigrated to England in 1929. Most of his novels were written whilst he lived in England. His daughter Cressida also became a novelist.

His novels often treated his subject matter in a dark fashion, with his central characters depicted as brooding, depressed, or disturbed characters. They include:

*''The Devil and King John'', influenced by [[Margaret Murray]]'s ''The Divine King in England'', claims that lying behind [[John, King of England|John]]'s clashes with the Church was that he had leanings towards the "Old Religion" of witchcraft (see [[witch-cult hypothesis]]).  His first wife [[Isabella, Countess of Gloucester|Hadwisa]] was an actual witch, who urged him to copy [[William II of England|William Rufus]] and be sacrificed at the tree.  <ref>"Review: "The Devil and King John" by Philip Lindsay". ''[[The Spectator]]'' Magazine, 16 April 1943 (pg. 20).</ref> However its treatment of the better-established facts of John's reign, although ambiguous, was more sympathetic to John than most accounts e.g. it considers that there were two sides to the argument over [[Magna Carta]].  John's nephew [[Arthur of Brittany|Arthur]] is killed by John in a fit of temper, but he is shown as a rebellious adolescent who did provoke John to some extent rather than the innocent child in some versions.  Archbishop [[Stephen Langton]] is an important character who is treated relatively sympathetically.  In his introduction Lindsay acknowledged that he had no evidence that Hadwisa was a witch or that this is what happened to Arthur, but for the purposes of his plot he needed to provide a link between John and witchcraft, and this was a good a guess as any about Arthur's fate.
*''One Dagger for Two'', about [[Christopher Marlowe]].  In this account Marlowe is an atheist, but heterosexual.  He was stabbed in a tavern quarrel, but there was a dispute over a woman behind it, it was not just a petty dispute over the bill.  (The woman involved was the subject of Marlowe's poem ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]''.)
*''They Have Their Dreams'', about [[Perkin Warbeck]].  It covers only the last period of his life, starting on the eve of his landing in Cornwall, and including his time seeking sanctuary in [[Beaulieu Abbey]].  Near the end Warbeck is told that he is really the illegitimate son of [[Margaret of York]] and a clergyman.
*''The Little Wench'', about Sir [[Lancelot]] and Queen [[Guinevere]] and their affair.
*''Here Comes the King'', about [[Catherine Howard]], Henry VIII's fifth wife.
*''The Merry Mistress'', about [[Jane Shore]], mistress of Edward IV.

He also wrote highly sympathetic biographies of [[Richard III of England]] (''The Tragic King'') and of [[Henry V of England]].

In addition, he did some work for the film industry.  He was one of a team of writers on ''[[Song of Freedom (film)|Song of Freedom]]'' and ''[[Under the Red Robe (1937 film)|Under the Red Robe]]'', and was a technical advisor on ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]''.
