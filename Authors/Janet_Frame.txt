'''Janet Paterson Frame''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZ|CBE}} (28 August 1924 – 29 January 2004) was a New Zealand author. She was internationally renowned for her work, which included novels, short stories, poetry, juvenile fiction, and an autobiography, and received numerous awards including being appointed to the [[Order of New Zealand]],<ref name = "DPMC">[http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/onz.html The Order of New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827165300/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/onz.html |date=27 August 2008 }} Honours List</ref> New Zealand's highest civil honour.<ref name="Read NZ">{{cite web |title=Frame, Janet |url=https://www.read-nz.org/writer/frame-janet |website=Read NZ Te Pou Muramura |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="OCNZL">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Worthington |first=Kim |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Roger |editor2-last=Wattie |editor2-first=Nelson |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature |title=Frame, Janet |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001/acref-9780195583489-e-418 |access-date=21 November 2020 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-3519-6 |oclc=865265749 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001}}</ref> 

Frame's celebrity derived from her dramatic personal history as well as her literary career. Following years of psychiatric hospitalisation, Frame was scheduled for a [[lobotomy]] that was cancelled when, just days before the procedure, her debut publication of short stories was unexpectedly awarded a national literary prize.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|title= Janet Frame, 79, Writer Who Explored Madness|first= Douglas|last= Martin|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6DF1138F933A05752C0A9629C8B63|date= 30 January 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2007-11-17}}</ref> Many of her novels and short stories explore her childhood and psychiatric hospitalisation from a fictional perspective, and her award-winning three-volume autobiography was adapted into the film ''[[An Angel at My Table]]'' (1990), directed by [[Jane Campion]].<ref name="Read NZ" /><ref name="OCNZL" />

=== Early years: 1924–1956 ===
[[File:Clock Oamaru.JPG|right|thumb|[[Oamaru]]: Clock tower on the old Post Office, described in Frame's ''Owls Do Cry'' and her autobiography, ''The Envoy from Mirror City'']]

Janet Frame was born Janet Paterson Frame in [[Dunedin]] in the south-east of New Zealand's [[South Island]] as the third of five children of [[Scottish New Zealanders|Scottish New Zealand]] parents.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 16.</ref> She grew up in a working-class family. Her father, George Frame, worked for the [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Government Railways]], and her mother Lottie (née Godfrey), served as a housemaid to the family of writer [[Katherine Mansfield]]. New Zealand's first female medical graduate, Dr [[Emily Hancock Siedeberg]], delivered Frame at [[St Helens Hospitals, New Zealand|St. Helens Hospital]] in 1924.<ref name="DNZB">{{DNZB|title=Janet Paterson Frame biography|id=6F1|plainlink=y}}</ref>

Frame spent her early childhood years in various small towns in New Zealand's South Island provinces of [[Otago]] and [[Southland Region|Southland]], including [[Outram, New Zealand|Outram]] and [[Wyndham, New Zealand|Wyndham]], before the family eventually settled in the coastal town of [[Oamaru]] (recognisable as the "Waimaru" of her début novel and subsequent fiction<ref>Leaver-Cooper, Sheila. ''Janet Frame's Kingdom by the Sea: Oamaru''. Dunmore (NZ), 1997</ref>). As recounted in the first volume of her autobiographies, Frame's childhood was marred by the deaths of two of her adolescent sisters, Myrtle and Isabel, who drowned in separate incidents, and the [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] suffered by her brother George (referred to as "Geordie" and "Bruddie").<ref name=FrameAutobio>Frame, Janet. ''An Autobiography'' Century Hutchinson (NZ), 1989.</ref>

In 1943, Frame began training as a teacher at the [[Dunedin College of Education]], auditing courses in English, French and psychology at the adjacent [[University of Otago]].<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 51–2.</ref> After completing two years of theoretical studies with mixed results,<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 61–2.</ref> Frame started a year of practical placement at the Arthur Street School in Dunedin, which, according to her biographer, initially went quite well.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Things started to unravel later that year when she attempted suicide by ingesting a packet of [[aspirin]]. As a result, Frame began regular therapy sessions with junior lecturer [[John Money]], to whom she developed a strong attraction,<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 64–5.</ref> and whose later work as a [[Sexology|sexologist]] specialising in [[Sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]] {{As of|2008|alt= remains}} controversial.<ref>[[Colapinto, John]].

[[File:Seacliff Lunatic Asylum NZ.jpg|right|thumb|Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in the [[Otago|Otago region]], where Frame was first committed in 1945.]]

In September 1945, Frame abandoned her teacher-training classroom at Dunedin's Arthur Street School during a visit from an inspector.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 66.</ref><ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Whi051Kota-t1-g1-t4.html#name-120555-1 Lloyd, Mike.

As a result, Frame was transferred from the local hospital's psychiatric ward to [[Seacliff Lunatic Asylum]], a fabled and feared mental institution located 20 miles north of Dunedin.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 71.</ref> During the next eight years, Frame was repeatedly readmitted, usually voluntarily, to [[psychiatric hospital]]s in New Zealand. In addition to Seacliff, these included [[Whau Lunatic Asylum|Avondale Lunatic Asylum]], in [[Auckland]], and [[Sunnyside Hospital]] in [[Christchurch]]. During this period, Frame was first diagnosed as suffering from [[schizophrenia]],<ref name="ReferenceB"/> which was treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Insulin shock therapy|insulin]].<ref name=FrameAutobio/><ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 97, 105.</ref>
[[File:OwlsDoCry.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Owls Do Cry''. Dennis Beytagh's cover illustration for Frame's début novel, released by New Zealand's Pegasus Press in 1957.]]
In 1951, while Frame was still a patient at Seacliff, [[Caxton Press (New Zealand)|New Zealand's Caxton Press]] published her first book, a critically acclaimed collection of short stories titled ''[[The Lagoon and Other Stories]]''.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 106.</ref> The volume was awarded the Hubert Church Memorial Award, at that time one of New Zealand's most prestigious literary prizes. This resulted in the cancellation of Frame's scheduled [[lobotomy]].<ref>[[#refFrame1991|Frame 1991]], pp. 222–23.</ref><ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 111–2.</ref> Four years later, after her final discharge from Seacliff Frame met writer [[Frank Sargeson]].<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 123–4.</ref> She lived and worked at his home in [[Takapuna]], an [[Auckland]] suburb, from April 1955 to July 1956, producing her first full-length novel, ''Owls Do Cry'' (Pegasus, 1957).<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 133.</ref>

== Literary career ==

=== 1957–1989 ===
Frame left New Zealand in late 1956, and the next seven years were most prolific in terms of publication. She lived and worked in Europe, primarily based in London, with brief sojourns to [[Ibiza]] and [[Andorra]].<ref>[[#refFrame1991|Frame 1991]], pp. 325–63</ref><ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 144.</ref> In May 1958 she legally changed her name to '''Nene Janet Paterson Clutha''', in part to make herself more difficult to locate and in part to recognise Māori leader [[Tamati Waka Nene]], whom she admired, and the [[Clutha River]], which was a source of creative inspiration.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="McLauchlan">{{cite news |last1=McLauchlan |first1=Gordon |title=A literary angel mourned |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/a-literary-angel-mourned/JFNOP75MRYHI5LIHRQRXR2URJE/ |access-date=30 January 2004 |work=NZ Herald |date=30 January 2004}}</ref> Frame still struggled with anxiety and depression, and in September 1958 admitted herself<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 184.</ref> to the [[Maudsley Hospital|Maudsley]] in London. American-trained psychiatrist Alan Miller, who studied under [[John Money]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], proposed that she had never suffered from schizophrenia.<ref>[[#refFrame1991|Frame 1991]], pp. 374–5</ref><ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 186.</ref> In an effort to alleviate the ill effects of her years spent in and out of psychiatric hospitals, Frame then began regular therapy sessions with psychiatrist [[Robert Hugh Cawley]], who encouraged her to pursue her writing. Frame dedicated seven of her novels to Cawley.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 196–7.</ref> 

Frame returned to New Zealand in 1963. She accepted the [[Robert Burns Fellowship|Burns Fellowship]] at the University of Otago in 1965.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 278–282, 283–6, 292, 298, 3000, 330, 378, 517, 518.</ref> She later lived in several parts of New Zealand's North Island, including Auckland, [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], [[Wanganui]], the [[Horowhenua]], [[Palmerston North]], [[Waiheke Island|Waiheke]], [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Browns Bay, New Zealand|Browns Bay]] and [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]].<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 392–3.</ref>

During this period Frame traveled extensively, occasionally to Europe, but principally to the United States, where she accepted residencies at the [[MacDowell Colony|MacDowell]] and [[Yaddo]] artists' colonies.<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 317–20, 324, 333, 337–40, 342–5, 347–8, 355, 358, 364, 442, 443–5.</ref> Partly as a result of these extended stays in the U.S., Frame developed close relationships with several Americans.<ref>King, Michael. "Janet Frame: Antipodean phoenix in the American chicken coop." ''Antipodes: A North American Journal of Australian Literature'' 15:(2): 86–87; December 2001.</ref> These included the painter [[Theophilus Brown]] (whom she later referred to as "the chief experience of my life"<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], p. 347.</ref>) and his long-time partner [[Paul John Wonner]], the poet [[May Sarton]], [[John Phillips Marquand]] and Alan Lelchuck. Frame's one-time university tutor/counsellor and longtime friend John Money worked in North America from 1947 onwards, and Frame frequently based herself at his home in [[Baltimore]].<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 279–80.</ref>

In the 1980s Frame authored three volumes of autobiography (''To the Is-land'', ''An Angel at my Table'' and ''The Envoy from Mirror City'') which collectively traced the course of her life to her return to New Zealand in 1963.<ref name=FrameAutobio/> The Australian novelist [[Patrick White]] described the first two volumes as "amongst the wonders of the world".<ref name="Marr">{{cite book |author-link=Patrick White |last1=White |first1=Patrick |title=Letter to Ingmar Björkstén |date=3 December 1985 |page=607}}</ref> Director Jane Campion and screenwriter [[Laura Jones (screenwriter)|Laura Jones]] adapted the trilogy for television broadcast. It was eventually released as an award-winning feature film, ''[[An Angel at My Table]]''. Actresses [[Kerry Fox]], Alexia Keogh and Karen Fergusson portrayed the author at various ages. Frame's autobiographies sold better than any of her previous publications,<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 470, 490–1, 495, 497, 506.</ref> and Campion's successful film adaptation of the texts<ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 448, 460, 466–67, 473–4, 484, 491–92, 495–6, 498, 511.</ref> introduced a new generation of readers to her work. These successes increasingly pushed Frame into the public eye.

In the [[1983 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|1983 Queen's Birthday Honours]], Frame was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], for services to literature.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49376 |date=11 June 1983 |page=34 |supp=2}}</ref> That year, ''To the Is-land'' also received the [[Ockham New Zealand Book Awards|Goodman Fielder Wattie Book of the Year Award]], the top literary prize in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Past Winners: 1983 |url=https://www.nzbookawards.nz/new-zealand-book-awards/past-winners/?year=1983 |website=New Zealand Book Awards |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref>

Frame intended the autobiographies to "set the record straight" regarding her past and in particular her mental status.<ref>Frame, Janet. "My Say." Interview with Elizabeth Alley. Concert Programme.

During her lifetime, Frame's work was principally published by American firm [[George Braziller]], garnering numerous literary prizes in her native New Zealand, and the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] in 1989 for her final novel, ''[[The Carpathians]]''.

=== 1990–2000 ===
On 6 February 1990, Frame was the sixteenth appointee to the [[Order of New Zealand]],<ref>"Honours and Awards" (15 February 1990) 23 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 445 at 446.</ref><ref name = "DPMC" /> the nation's highest civil honour. Frame also held foreign membership of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and, in her native New Zealand, received two honorary doctorates as well as the status of cultural icon.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Zealand Edge|url=http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/frame.html|publisher=Nzedge.com|access-date=2012-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227164728/http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/frame.html|archive-date=27 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Rumours occasionally circulated portraying Frame as a contender for the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], most notably in 1998, after a journalist spotted her name at the top of a list later revealed to have been in alphabetical order,<ref>MacLeod, Scott. "Reclusive Frame tipped as leading Nobel candidate." ''New Zealand Herald''. 2 October 2003.</ref><ref>[[#refKing2000|King 2000]], pp. 456, 470, 497, 514.</ref> and again five years later, in 2003, when [[Åsa Beckman]], the influential chief literary critic at the Swedish daily ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', wrongly predicted that Frame would win the prestigious prize.<ref>Fox, Gary. "Sth African J M Coetzee awarded Nobel prize for Literature, dashing hopes of NZ writer Janet Frame." ''IRN News''. 3 October 2003</ref>

Frame's writing became the focus of academic criticism from the late 1970s, with approaches ranging from [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] and [[Social realism|social realist]], to [[Feminist theory|feminist]] and [[poststructuralist]]. In later years, book-length monographs on Frame were published. These included Patrick Evans’s bio-critical contribution for the "Twayne's World Authors Series," ''Janet Frame'' (1977), Gina Mercer's feminist reading of the novels and autobiographies, ''Janet Frame: Subversive Fictions'' (1994), and Judith Dell Panny's allegorical approach to the works, ''I have what I gave: The fiction of Janet Frame'' (1992). A collection of essays edited by Jeanne Delbaere was first published in 1978, with a revised edition released under the title ''The Ring of Fire: Essays on Janet Frame'' in 1992. That same year, Dunedin's University of Otago hosted a conference dedicated to a discussion of Frame's work. Many of the papers were published in a special issue of ''The Journal of New Zealand Literature''.

[[File:WrestlingWithTheAngel.jpg|right|thumb|''Wrestling with the Angel''. The front cover of New Zealand historian [[Michael King]]'s award-winning biography on Frame, first published in 2000.]]

In 2000, New Zealand historian [[Michael King]] published his authorised biography of Frame, ''Wrestling with the Angel''. The book was simultaneously released in New Zealand and North America, with British and Australian editions appearing in later years.<ref name=FrameAutobio/> King's award-winning and exhaustive work attracted both praise and criticism. Some questioned the extent to which Frame guided the hand of her biographer,<ref>[[Harry Ricketts|Ricketts, Harry]]. "A life within the frame." ''[[The Lancet]]'' [UK] 10 November 2001: 1652.</ref><ref>Wilkins, Damien. "In the Lock-Up." ''Landfall'' 201 [NZ] May 2001: 25–36</ref><ref>Evans, Patrick. "Dr. Clutha’s Book of the World: Janet Paterson Frame, 1924–2004." Journal of New Zealand Literature 22: 15–3.</ref> while others argued that he had failed to come to terms with the complexity and subtlety of his subject.<ref>Wikse, Maria. "Materialisations of a Woman Writer: Investigating Janet Frame's Biographical Legend" Bern (SW): Peter Lang, 2006.</ref> Adding to the controversy, King openly admitted that he withheld information "that would have been a source of embarrassment and distress to her," and that he adopted publisher Christine Cole Catley's notion of "compassionate truth." This advocates "a presentation of evidence and conclusions that fulfil the major objectives of biography, but without the revelation of information that would involve the living subject in unwarranted embarrassment, loss of face, emotional or physical pain, or a nervous or psychiatric collapse." King defended his project and maintained that future biographies on Frame would eventually fill in the gaps left by his own work.<ref>King, Michael.

===Death and posthumous publications===
Frame died in Dunedin in January 2004, aged 79, from [[acute myeloid leukaemia]], shortly after becoming one of the first recipients of the [[Arts Foundation of New Zealand#Icon Award|Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Awards]], established to celebrate and acknowledge New Zealand artists who have achieved the highest standards of artistic expression.<ref>Herrick, Linda.

In 2010, ''Gifted,'' a novel by New Zealand academic and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans, was published and subsequently shortlisted for the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]]. The story is a fictionalised account of the relationship between Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his [[Takapuna]] property in 1955–56<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vup/2010titleinformation/gifted.aspx |title=gifted |publisher=Victoria.ac.nz |date=2008-06-18 |access-date=2012-10-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003012051/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vup/2010titleinformation/gifted.aspx |archive-date= 3 October 2012 }}</ref> – an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campion's film, ''An Angel at My Table'' (1990).<ref>See: Sargeson, Frank.
