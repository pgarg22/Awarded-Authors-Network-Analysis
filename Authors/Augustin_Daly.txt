'''John Augustin Daly''' (July 20, 1838{{snd}}June 7, 1899) was one of the most influential men in American theatre during his lifetime. Drama critic, theatre manager, playwright, and adapter, he became the first recognized stage director in America. He exercised a fierce and tyrannical control over all aspects of his productions. His rules of conduct for actors and actresses imposed heavy fines for late appearances and forgotten lines and earned him the title "the autocrat of the stage."<ref>{{cite book|last=Meserve|first=Walter J.|title=On stage, America! : a selection of distinctly American plays|date=1996|publisher=Feedback Theatrebooks & Prospero Press|location=New York|isbn=0937657204|page=[https://archive.org/details/onstageamericase0000unse/page/245 245]|author2=Meserve, introduced by Walter J.|url=https://archive.org/details/onstageamericase0000unse/page/245}}</ref> He formed a permanent company in New York and opened Daly's Theatre in New York in 1879 and a second one in London in 1893.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hildy|first=Oscar G.

==Biography==
Augustin Daly was born in [[Plymouth, North Carolina]] to Captain Denis Daly, a sea-captain and ship owner, and Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant John Duffy of the British Army. He was educated at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and in the public schools of New York City. His mother, early left a widow, brought her two boys to New York City, where they soon became frequent attendants at the theaters and were members of amateur groups, which under such names as the "Burton Association" or the "Murdoch Association" were the precursors of the [[Little Theatre Movement]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Quinn|first=Arthur Hobson|title=A History of The American Drama From the Civil War to the Present Day|date=1927|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|pages=8|type = Print}}</ref>

He was dramatic critic for several New York papers from 1859, and he adapted or wrote a number of plays, ''[[Under the Gaslight]]'' (1867) being his first success. In 1869 he became the manager of the [[Madison Square Theatre|Fifth Avenue Theatre on 24th St.]] and in 1873 the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]] on 28th. In 1879 he rebuilt and opened [[Daly's Theatre (30th St.)|Daly's Theatre]] at Broadway and 30th Street in New York, and, in 1893, [[Daly's Theatre]] in London.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Daly, Augustin|volume=7|page=779}}</ref>

[[File:Reading The Play (1882).jpg|thumb|Reading The Play (1882)]]
At the first of these, he gathered a company of players, headed by [[Ada Rehan]], which made for it a high reputation, and for them he adapted plays from foreign sources, and revived [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] comedies in a manner before unknown in America. He took his entire company on tour, visiting England, Germany and France, and some of the best actors on the American stage have owed their training and first successes to him.<ref name="EB1911"/> Among these were [[Clara Morris]], Sara Jewett, [[John Drew, Jr.]], [[Maurice Barrymore]], [[Fanny Davenport]], [[Agnes Ethel]], [[Maude Adams]], [[Ann Gilbert|Mrs. Gilbert]], [[Tyrone Power, Sr.]], [[Ada Dyas]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Maud Jeffries]] and many others.  Daly's willingness to, as he put it, "stoop to the curb and bestow upon the low, untried actor a chance at greatness" earned him the nickname "Little Man Auggie" among his peers. His play ''[[Leah the Forsaken]]'', adapted from [[Hermann Salomon Mosenthal]]'s ''Deborah'', was a star vehicle for [[Margaret Mather]].

His Shakespeare productions were often severely criticized by [[George Bernard Shaw]], who was active as a drama critic during those years. Shaw took Daly to task for cutting Shakespeare's plays and for presenting them in unorthodox ways. (Shaw was a strong believer in presenting Shakespeare's plays uncut.) Several of Shaw's criticisms of Daly's Shakespeare productions were reprinted in the anthology ''Shaw on Shakespeare''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Bernard|title=Shaw on Shakespeare|date=2002|publisher=Applause|location=New York|author2=Edwin Wilson}}</ref>

In 1894, he was awarded the [[Laetare Medal]] by the [[university of Notre Dame]], considered the most prestigious award for [[American Catholics]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= University of Notre Dame |title=Recipients {{!}} The Laetare Medal |url=https://laetare.nd.edu/recipients/#info1894 |access-date=31 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Daly was a great book-lover, and his valuable library was dispersed by auction after his death, which occurred in [[Paris]]. Besides plays, original and adapted, he wrote ''[[Margaret Woffington|Woffington]]: a Tribute to the Actress and the Woman'' (1888).<ref name="EB1911"/>

[[Dora Knowlton Ranous]], a onetime actress in the Daly company, published a 1910 memoir of her experiences entitled ''Diary of a Daly Débutante.''<ref>Rossiter Johnson, ''Dora Knowlton Ranous, Author — Editor — Translator: A Simple Record of a Noble Life''.</ref>

''[[Under the Gaslight]]'' (1867) is an example of Daly's mixture of realism and melodrama, seen in the authenticity of his depiction of real locations and in his use of social commentary.<ref name=Meserve/> The play introduced the now-clichéd device of the villain tying someone to railroad tracks, although in a reversal of the usual roles it was the hero who was tied up and the heroine who saved him.<ref>{{cite web|website=rwkotulski.org|url=http://www.rwkotulski.org/underthegaslight.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615220358/http://www.rwkotulski.org/underthegaslight.html |author=Kotulski, Richard Wakefield |archive-date=June 15, 2012 |title=Under the Gaslight}}</ref> In the book ''Vagrant Memories,'' the author, [[William Winter (author)|William Winter]] recalls how Daly came up with the device. He says: "He once told me under what circumstances he hit upon this device. He was walking home toward night, thinking intently about the play which he had begun to write, when suddenly the crowning expedient occurred to him and at the same instant he stumbled over a misplaced flagstone, striking his right foot against the edge of the stone and sustaining a severe hurt. "I was near my door," he said, "and I rushed into the house, threw myself into a chair, grasping my injured foot with both hands, for the pain was great, and exclaiming, over and over again, 'I've got it! I've got it! And it beats hot-irons all to pieces!" I  wasn't even thinking of the hurt. I had the thought of having my hero tied on a railroad track and rescued by his sweetheart, just in the nick of time, before the swift passage of an express train across a dark stage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winter|first=William|title=Vagrant Memories Being Further Recollections of Other Days|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924027264120|date=1915|publisher=George H. Doran Company|location=New York|page=279}}</ref> 
 
''A Flash of Lightning'' (1868), like ''[[Under the Gaslight]]'', is pure melodrama, with water and fire spectacles providing action scenes and special effects for its eager audiences.<ref name=Meserve/>

''Horizon'' (1871) is an adaptation of a [[Bret Harte]] story about the westward expansion of the States; it is an example of the popularity of western drama, coupled with Daly's interest in realism of the [[American literary regionalism|local color]] variety, although it remains melodramatic.<ref name=Meserve>[[Walter Joseph Meserve|Walter J. Meserve]], ''An Outline History of American Drama'', 2nd ed., 1994.</ref>

''Divorce'' (1871) and ''Pique'' (1875), both adaptations of British novels, demonstrate Daly's attempts to create social comedy, although the plays remain somewhat melodramatic.<ref name=Meserve/>
