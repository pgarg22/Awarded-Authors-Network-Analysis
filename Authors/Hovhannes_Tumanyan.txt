Many films and animated films have been adapted from Tumanyan's works. Two operas, ''Anush'' (1912) by [[Armen Tigranian]] and ''[[Almast]]'' (1930) by [[Alexander Spendiaryan]], were written based on his works.

Hovhannes Tumanyan was born on February 19, 1869 in the village of [[Dsegh]], [[Tiflis Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now in [[Lori Province]], Armenia).<ref name=gre/><ref name="encyclopedia.am">{{cite web | url    = http://encyclopedia.am/pages.php?bId=2&hId=1182&sWord=Array | script-title=hy:Թումանյան Հովհաննես |year = 2010 | publisher  = Դպրոցական Մեծ Հանրագիտարան, Գիրք II | access-date = July 10, 2012|language=hy}}</ref>

His father, Aslan (1839–1898), was the village priest known as Ter-Tadevos. He was an offspring of an Armenian princely family of [[Tumanishvili|Tumanyan]], branch of the famous royal house of [[Mamikonian]] that settled in Lori in 10th and 11th centuries from their original feudal fief of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]].{{fact|date=March 2020}}

His mother, Sona (1842–1936), was an avid storyteller with a particular interest in fables. Young Tumanyan was the oldest of eight children; his siblings were Rostom (1871–1915), Osan (1874–1926), Iskuhi (1878–1943), Vahan (1881–1937), Astghik (1885–1953), Arshavir (1888–1921), Artashes (1892–1916).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://toumanian.am/toumanian/html/kens/tohm.html | script-title=hy:ԹՈՒՄԱՆՅԱՆԻ ՏՈՀՄԸ | publisher  = Հովհաննես Թումանյանի թանգարան | access-date = July 10, 2012|language=hy}}</ref>

From 1877–1879, Tumanyan attended the [[parochial school]] of Dsegh. From 1879–1883 he went to a school in [[Jalaloghly]].<ref name="education">{{cite web | url    = http://toumanian.am/toumanian/html/kens/krtut.html | script-title=hy:ԿՐԹՈՒԹՅՈՒՆ | publisher  = Հովհաննես Թումանյանի թանգարան | access-date = July 11, 2012|language=hy}}</ref> Tumanyan moved to Tiflis in 1883, where he attended the [[Nersisyan School]] from 1883–1887.<ref name="encyclopedia.am"/> Tumanyan's wrote his first poem at the age of 12, while studying in [[Jalaloghly]] school. He lived at the teacher's house for a while and fell in love with the teacher's daughter Vergine.<ref name="education"/> Since 1893, Tumanyan worked for ''Aghbyur'', ''Murtch'', ''Hasker'' and ''Horizon'' periodicals and also was engaged in public activism.<ref name="encyclopedia.am"/>

In 1899, Tumanyan came up with an idea of organizing meetings of Armenian intellectuals of the time at his house on 44 Bebutov Street in Tiflis (present-day Amaghleba 18, in [[Sololaki]]).  Soon it became an influential literary group, which often gathered in the [[garret]] of Tumanyan's house. Vernatun means garret in Armenian, which was the name the group was referred to. Prominent members of the collective were [[Avetik Isahakyan]], [[Derenik Demirchyan]], [[Levon Shant]], [[Ghazaros Aghayan]], [[Perch Proshyan]], [[Nikol Aghbalian]], [[Alexander Shirvanzade]], [[Nar-Dos]], Vrtanes Papazyan, [[Vahan Terian]], [[Arakel Babakhanian|Leo]], Stepan Lisitsyan, Mariam Tumanyan, [[Gevorg Bashinjagyan]] and many other significant Armenian figures of early 20th century. With some pauses, it existed until 1908.<ref name="encyclopedia.am"/>

In 1912 Tumanyan was elected the president of the Company of Caucasus Armenian Writers.<ref name="encyclopedia.am"/>

In the fall of 1921, Tumanyan went to Constantinople to find support of Armenian refugees. After months spent there, he returned ill. After surgery in 1922, he started to get better. But in September, Tumanyan's disease started to progress again. He was transferred to a hospital in Moscow, where he died on March 23, 1923.<ref>{{cite web | url    = http://rcnc.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1177&Itemid=50 | script-title=ru:Туманян Ованес Тадевосович  | publisher  = РКНК  | access-date = July 11, 2012|language=ru}}</ref>

===Personal life===
In 1888, at the age of 19, Hovhannes Tumanyan married Olga Matchkalyan, 17.<ref>{{cite web | url    = http://toumanian.am/tangaran/biography.php?clear=1&cont=4 | script-title=hy:Ամուսնությունը  | publisher  = Հովհաննես Թումանյանի թանգարան | access-date = July 11, 2012|language=hy}}</ref> They had 10 children: Musegh (1889–1938), Ashkhen (1891–1968), Nvard (1892–1957), Artavazd (1894–1918), Hamlik (1896–1937), Anush (1898–1927), Arpik (1899–1981), Areg (1900–1939), Seda (1905–1988), Tamar (1907–1989).<ref>{{cite web | url    = http://toumanian.am/tangaran/biography.php?clear=1&cont=5 | script-title=hy:Զավակները | publisher  = Հովհաննես Թումանյանի թանգարան | access-date = July 11, 2012|language=hy}}</ref>

==Political and public activism==
During the government-provoked [[Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–1907]], Tumanyan took the role of a peacemaker, for which he was arrested twice.<ref name="encyclopedia.am"/> Tumanyan also deeply criticized the [[Georgian–Armenian War]] of 1918.<ref name="encyclopedia.am"/>
Tumanyan was also actively engaged in preaching the Gospel. As he put in one of his verses "There is only one way of salvation; through Jesus Christ abiding inside every one of us".

In October 1914 Tumanyan joined the "Committee for Support of War Victims", which later helped Armenian Genocide refugees settled in [[Vagharshapat|Etchmiadzin]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://toumanian.am/toumanian/html/kens/vorbangor.html | script-title=hy:ՀՈՎՀ.

In 1921 in Tiflis he founded the House of Armenian Art.

==Literary work==

Tumanyan's work is simple, natural and poetically inspired at the same time. It is not by mere chance that dozens of phrases and expressions from Tumanyan's works have become a natural part of people's everyday language, their sayings, adages, and maxims.<ref name="armenianhouse"/>

Tumanyan is usually regarded in Armenian circles as "All-Armenian poet".  He earned this title when the [[Catholicos of Armenia]] had ordered that Armenian refugees from the west not enter certain areas of his church and house, since he is considered to be "The Catholicos of all Armenians".  Tumanyan in response decried that decision claiming that the refugees could seek relief in the Catholicos' quarters under order of "The Poet of all Armenians".

He created lyrics, fables, epic poems and translations into Armenian of [[Byron]], [[Goethe]] and [[Pushkin]].<ref>Hovannes Tumanian – Great Armenian popular poet, native of Lori.</ref>
