Subsequently, Flint became editor of the new ''[[Jim Baen's Universe]]'' science-fiction e-zine while concurrently remaining a creative writer bringing out three to five titles per year. After the death of Jim Baen due to a stroke and after completing the contract for the tenth Grantville Gazette, Flint founded a new website "[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014013014/http://www.grantvillegazette.com/ grantvillegazette.com]"<ref>{{cite web|quote=The Grantville Gazette, which Jim Baen and I began as an experiment, has proven to be a very successful venture in electronic publishing.

As of October 2007 he lives with his wife Lucille (also an ex-labor organizer) in [[East Chicago, Indiana]].

In 2008, he donated his archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at [[Northern Illinois University]].<ref>[http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603071546/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm |date=June 3, 2012 }}, Northern Illinois University</ref>

==Electronic publishing==
{{no footnotes|section|date=October 2008}}
Eric Flint is noted as a co-founder and editor of the [[Baen Free Library]] which is an ongoing experiment in electronic publishing ([[e-book]]s in multiple unencrypted formats) where Flint and the late [[Jim Baen]] convinced authors to post entirely unprotected free copies of various works for download over the internet. One early goal was to see if the release of free electronic content would increase the sales of their traditional print or (for-pay) electronic editions. As part of the initial phase, Flint has published a [http://www.baen.com/library/ series of essays] that in form have been part blog and part ''letters to the editor'' tracking the experiment and championing the practice.

Financially, it seems to be working out for publisher Baen Books, as they have embraced unencrypted e-book publication for all their works available in a variety of common formats. Usually eighty to a hundred titles are available in the ''Baen Free Library'' at any given time. In most cases, the works involved are the early volumes in continuing series, ''appetite whetters'', where readers might be likely to purchase later works in the same series.

All new Baen Books can also be purchased as [[e-book]]s in the same unencrypted formats as the free library through [http://www.webscription.net/ Baen WebScriptions]. As an added wrinkle one can purchase a monthly ''collection'' of five bundled works in the release stage of publication at Baen's. Once the bundle reaches four months from its scheduled release date in print, about half of the work is serialized and available to readers purchasing the ''advanced peek''. A month later, the next quarter, followed by the last quarter, available about a month on average ahead of any printed work. The last delivery contains the copyedited e-book version of the book.

One can also purchase ''electronic Advanced Reader Copies'', which are not a part of the monthly bundle, but are available for purchase. These followed a successful experiment with an online [[eMagazine]], called the Grantville Gazette (more below—see ''1632 series''). They are unproofed manuscripts and are full of typos and errors. They are unedited from the author's word processor; however, they are available even before the first part of the monthly bundles. These copies do not include the final proofed version, which is available only in the single or monthly bundle for that book. In March 2007, Flint began acting as publisher of a for-fee [https://web.archive.org/web/20071014013014/http://www.grantvillegazette.com/ web-access version] of the gazette.

Flint also helmed [[Jim Baen's Universe]], an e-zine published from 2006 until 2010.
