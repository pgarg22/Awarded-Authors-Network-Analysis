'''Peter Hacks''' (21 March 1928 &ndash; 28 August 2003) was a [[Germany|German]] playwright, author, and essayist.

Hacks was born in [[Wrocław|Breslau (Wrocław)]], [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]]. Displaced by [[World War II]], Hacks settled in [[Munich]] in 1947, where he made acquaintance with [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]].  Hacks then followed Brecht to [[East Berlin]] in 1955. However, a continued cooperation between him and Brecht did not arise. From 1960 Hacks worked as a dramaturge at the Deutsches Theater (DT) in Berlin.

When the staging of his play "Die Sorgen und die Macht" (1962) sparked criticism from officials, he gave up his position as a dramaturge at the DT and lived again as a freelance writer.
His success on the world stage – most notably with "Ein Gespräch im Hause Stein über den abwesenden Herrn von Goethe" (A Discussion in the Stein Home about the Absent Mr. [[Goethe]]) – led to his literary acceptance within GDR and West-Germany.

Hacks was a communist and supported the East German government's 1976 expatriation of the singer [[Wolf Biermann]]. His correspondence with the communist historian [[Kurt Gossweiler]] has been published.

He won the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]].

Hacks died in [[Groß Machnow]].

Together with his wife Hacks used the pseudonym Saul O’Hara through which they could write and publish boulevard comedies (''Risky Marriage'').
