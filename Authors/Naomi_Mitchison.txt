'''Naomi Mary Margaret Mitchison, Baroness Mitchison''' {{postnom|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{née|'''Haldane'''}}; 1 November 1897 – 11 January 1999) was a [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] and poet. Often called a doyenne of Scottish literature, she wrote over 90 books of historical and science fiction, travel writing and autobiography.<ref name="scottish-places.info"/> Her husband [[Dick Mitchison, Baron Mitchison|Dick Mitchison]]'s [[life peer]]age in 1964 entitled her to call herself Lady Mitchison, but she never did.{{sfn |Maslen |2015}}{{sfn |Calder |1997 |p=}} Her 1931 work, ''The Corn King and the Spring Queen'', is seen by some as the prime 20th-century historical novel.{{sfn |Longford |1999}}

==Interests==
Like her father [[John Scott Haldane]] and elder brother [[J. B. S. Haldane]], Naomi Haldane initially pursued a scientific career. From 1908, she and her brother looked into [[Mendelian genetics]]. Their 1915 publication was the first demonstration of [[genetic linkage]] in mammals.{{sfn| Haldane |Sprunt |Haldane |1915 |pp=133-135}} However, whilst she was a diploma student at the Society of Oxford Home Students (later [[St Anne's College, Oxford]]), the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] changed her interest to nursing.

Naomi Mitchison was a vocal [[feminist]], particularly campaigning for [[birth control]]. ''We Have Been Warned'' (1935) is noted as her most controversial work, with its explicit sexuality. It was rejected by leading publishers and ultimately censored.{{sfn |Harrison |1999}}

==Biography==
===Childhood and family background===
Naomi Mary Margaret Haldane was born in [[Edinburgh]], the daughter and younger child of the [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]] and his wife (Louisa) Kathleen Trotter. Naomi's parents came from different political backgrounds, her father being a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and her mother from a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], pro-[[imperialist]] family. However, both were of landed stock; the [[Clan Haldane|Haldane family]] had been feudal barons of [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]] since the 13th century. Today the best-known member of the family is probably Naomi's elder brother, the [[biologist]] [[J. B. S. Haldane]] (1892–1964), but in her youth her paternal uncle [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane]], twice [[Lord Chancellor]] (from 1912 to 1915 under [[H. H. Asquith]], and in 1924 during the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Ramsay MacDonald]]), was better known.

Naomi followed her brother to the [[Oxford]] Preparatory School (later [[Dragon School]]) in 1904–1911, as the only girl there.{{sfn |Oman |1976 |p=149}} From 1911, she was tutored at home by a governess. She qualified for the [[University of Oxford]] in 1914, via the Oxford higher local examination and entered the Society of Oxford Home Students (later St Anne's College) to pursue a degree course in science. However, she chose before completing the course to become a nurse, as the [[First World War]] had broken out. After a course in first aid and home nursing in 1915, she joined a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] at [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School|St Thomas's Hospital]], London. Her service was much curtailed after she caught [[scarlet fever]].{{sfn |Maslen |2015}}

The Haldanes were known for their self-styled domestic experiments. She and her brother John started investigating Mendelian genetics in 1908. They initially used [[guinea pigs]] as experimental models, but changed to mice as they were more convenient to handle. Their findings were published as "Reduplication in Mice" in 1915. This was in fact the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals.{{sfn |Haldane |Sprunt |Haldane |1915 |pp=133–135}}

===Marriage and family life===
On 11 February 1916, Naomi married the [[barrister]] [[Dick Mitchison|Gilbert Richard Mitchison]] (23 March 1894 – 14 February 1970), who was a close friend of her brother. Mitchison was then on leave from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; like her, he came from a well-connected and wealthy family. He became a [[Queen's Counsel]], then a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour politician]], and eventually a [[life peer]] on 5 October 1964 as Baron Mitchison of Carradale in the County of Argyll, on retirement for his political work. Naomi thus became Lady Mitchison as the wife of a life peer, but she objected to the title. She played an active part in her husband's political career and in his constituency duties.{{sfn |Jeger |1999}}

Dick and Naomi Mitchison's marriage was not wholly satisfactory. After some years they both agreed to an [[open marriage]], in which they entered into several other relationships that were conducted with dignity and described with humour. Her first serious lover was the Oxford classicist [[Theodore Wade-Gery]], whose scholarship she drew on in writing her historical novels.{{sfn |Calder |2019 |pp=105–107}} As described in her autobiography, ''You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920–1940'', she fell deeply in love with Wade-Gery. She wrote him love poems and missed him greatly after he broke off the relationship, considering it incompatible with his marriage to another woman in 1928. She mitigated her sorrow by undertaking a risky mission to help persecuted socialists in [[Austrofascism|fascist-dominated Austria]]. Later she had several briefer, less intense affairs, in which the men were in love with her and she did her best to reciprocate. As she emphasized in describing these, she was careful to use contraceptives with her lovers and let her children be fathered by her husband alone – although she dreamed of a future in which her daughters would be able to "have children by several chosen fathers, uncensured".{{sfn |Mitchison |1986 |loc=Ch.8 Patterns of Loving}}

Naomi and Dick had seven children. Their four sons were Geoffrey (1918–1927), who died of [[meningitis]], [[Denis Mitchison|Denis]] (1919–2018), a professor of [[bacteriology]], [[Murdoch Mitchison|Murdoch]] (1922–2011), and [[Avrion Mitchison|Avrion]] (born 1928), both professors of [[zoology]]. Their three daughters were Lois (born 1926), Valentine (born 1928), and Clemency, who died in 1940, shortly after her birth.

Between 1923 and 1939, they lived at Rivercourt House, Upper Mall, [[Hammersmith]], London. They bought the Carradale House at [[Carradale]] in [[Kintyre]] in 1939, where they lived for the rest of their lives. The house was frequented by people of all sorts: lords, ladies, politicians, writers, neighbours, fishermen and farmers.{{sfn |Hoge |1999}} She and Denis MacIntosh, a local fisherman, wrote a documentary, ''Men and Herring: A Documentary'', in 1949. Ten years later this was adapted for [[BBC Television]] as a [[docudrama]], ''Spindrift''.<ref name="Spindrift"/>

===Literary career===
Mitchison was a prolific writer of more than 90 books in her lifetime, across a multitude of styles and genres. These include historical novels such as her first novel ''The Conquered'' (1923), set in [[Gaul]] in the 1st century BCE, during the [[Gallic Wars]] of [[Julius Caesar]], and her second novel ''Cloud Cuckoo Land'' (1925) set in 5th-century BCE [[Ancient Greece]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Her best work is thought to be ''The Corn King and the Spring Queen'' (1931), which treats three different societies, including a wholly fictional one, and explores themes of sexuality that were daring in her day. [[Terri Windling]] called it "a lost classic".{{sfn |Windling |Datlow |1994 |p=xx |loc=Summation 1994: Fantasy}} Literary critic Geoffrey Sadler stated of Mitchison's historical fiction: "On the basis of her early writings, she is unquestionably one of the great historical novelists."{{sfn |Sadler |1994 |pp=459–462}}

In 1932, Mitchison was commissioned by [[Victor Gollancz]] to edit a guide to the modern world for children. Mitchison's book, ''An Outline for Boys and Girls and Their Parents'', included several distinguished contributors, including [[W. H. Auden]], [[Richard Hughes (British writer)|Richard Hughes]], [[Gerald Heard]], and [[Olaf Stapledon]].{{sfn |Crossley |1994 |pp=201-203}} On publication, ''An Outline'' was praised by ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', the ''[[New Statesman]] ''and the ''[[London Mercury]]''.{{sfn |Crossley |1994 |pp=201-203}} However, several clergymen, including the [[Archbishop of York]], were angered by the book's lack of emphasis on Christianity, while other right-wing authors objected to a perceived sympathy with the [[Soviet Union]]. The Conservative writer [[Arnold Lunn]] wrote a lengthy attack on the book in the ''[[English Review]]'',{{sfn |Addison |2007 |p=247}} which contributed to its commercial failure.{{sfn |Crossley |1994 |pp=201-203}}

Undoubtedly her most controversial work, ''We Have Been Warned'', was published in 1935, based on a journey to the Soviet Union. In it she explored sexual behaviour, including [[rape]] and [[abortion]].<ref name="scottish-places.info"/> The book was rejected by various publishers. She approached first her friend Victor Gollancz, who flatly turned her down, observing that "publication of the book would cause a real outcry." The book was extensively rewritten to make it more acceptable to publishers, and was still subject to censorship. On publication it was universally despised for its depiction of rape, free love and abortion that "alienated readers on the left and horrified those on the political right."{{sfn |Joannou |2012 |p=56}} In 2005, files from the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] revealed that the British government had considered prosecuting the publishers of ''We Have Been Warned'', but ultimately decided not to do so.<ref name="BP2005"/>

Mitchison was a compulsive writer, as her travelogues revealed. She wrote on planes or in trains as prompted by the situation. For example, she wrote up a visit to the US in the 1930s, objecting to [[sharecropping]].

Her 1938 book ''The Moral Basis of Politics'' was a treatise on ethics and politics that she had worked on for three years.{{sfn |Deane |1998 |pp=235-239}} In it she defended the right of the left-wing journalist [[H. N. Brailsford]] to criticise the [[Moscow Trials]], which had caused controversy on the British left at the time.{{sfn |Benton |1990 |pp=111-115}}

Mitchison's ''The Blood of the Martyrs'' (1939) is set against the background of [[Nero]]'s [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of the Christians]]. She draws parallels between Nero and dictators of her own time, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].{{sfn |Castelli |2006 |pp=1-24}}

In 1952, Mitchison went to Moscow as a member of the Authors' World Peace Appeal. She frequently visited [[Africa]], especially [[Botswana]], where she was made a sort of tribal mother (''Mmarona'') to the [[List of Sotho-Tswana clans|baKgatla people]]. ''Mucking Around'' (1981) best describes her haphazard travels in five continents over 50 years.{{sfn |Jeger |1999}}

Later works included further historical novels: ''The Bull Calves'' (1947) about the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] and ''The Young [[Alexander the Great]]'' (1960). She also turned to fantasy, such as ''Graeme and the Dragon'' (1954, Graeme Mitchison being a grandson through [[Denis Mitchison|Denis]]), science fiction such as ''[[Memoirs of a Spacewoman]]'' (1962) and ''Solution Three'' (1975), [[fantasy]] such as the humorous [[Arthurian]] novel ''To the Chapel Perilous'' (1955), non-fiction such as ''African Heroes'' (1968), and also children's novels, poetry, travel and a three-volume autobiography. She was unsure exactly how many books she had written, often claiming there were about 70. The articles were uncountable, from book reviews for the old ''Time and Tide'' magazine and the ''New Statesman'' to practical essays on farming, campaigning articles, recollections and reflections.{{sfn |Jeger |1999}}

After her husband's death, Mitchison wrote several memoirs, published as separate titles between 1973 and 1985. She was also a good friend of the writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and one of the proof readers of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="sethkaller.com"/> [[Maxim Lieber]] served as her literary editor in 1935.

===Activism===
Mitchison, like her brother, was a committed socialist in the 1930s. She visited the Soviet Union in 1932 as part of a [[Fabian Society]] group and expressed some misgivings about the direction of Soviet society.{{sfn |Urquhart |1999 |p=3}} An active [[anti-fascist]], Mitchison travelled to Austria, where she undertook the risky task of smuggling documents and left-wing refugees out of the country.{{sfn |Montefiore |1996 |pp= 17, 60 and 202}}{{sfn |Caldecott |1984 |p=27}} She stood unsuccessfully as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for the [[Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Scottish Universities]] in [[1935 Combined Scottish Universities by-election|1935]], at a time when universities were still allowed to elect MPs. Eventually, as her political candidacy and her pro-Left writings had failed, she gradually became disenchanted with the Left. At this time she became politically attracted to [[Scottish Nationalism]] and increasingly wrote on specifically Scottish issues and themes. Her name was on [[George Orwell]]'s [[Orwell's list|list]] of people prepared in March 1949 for the [[Information Research Department]] set up at the Foreign Office by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]], who were considered to have pro-communist leanings and so be inappropriate to write for the IRD.{{sfn |Ezard |2003}}

Mitchison's advocacy continued in other ways. She became a spokeswoman for the island communities of Scotland. She was a friend of [[Seretse Khama]]{{sfn |Calder |1997 |p=}} and an advisor to the Bakgatla [[tribe]] of [[Botswana]]. Her keen interest in Scotland's problems led to her serving on Argyll County Council and the Highlands and Islands Development Council. Meanwhile she was a serious botanist, gardener and practical farmer.{{sfn |Mitchison |1944 |pp=23-26}} She became a Labour representative on Argyll County Council from 1945 to 1966. She served on the Highland Panel in 1947–1965 and the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council in 1966–1976.{{sfn |Longford |1999}}{{sfn |Maslen |2015}}

Mitchison was a Life Fellow of the [[Eugenics Society (UK)|Eugenics Society]]. She was also a vocal campaigner for [[women's rights]], advocating [[birth control]]. Her own lack of knowledge of birth control (as stated in her memoirs) led to an interest in the causes of birth control and abortion. She was on the founding council of North Kensington Women's Welfare Centre in London in 1924. Today, she is best known for her advocacy of feminism and her tackling of then-taboo subjects in her writing. She was a principal investor in the [[Partisan Coffee House]], a meeting place for the [[New Left]] off [[Soho Square]], which functioned in 1958–1962.{{sfn |Berlin |2009}}

Mitchison was present and supporting a Stop the Seventy Tour rally, aiming to halt the apartheid South African [[Rugby union|rugby]] and [[cricket]] tours of Britain in December 1969.{{sfn |Dean |1969}}

===Later life===
[[Image:Naomimitchison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of Naomi Mitchison, located in [[South Gyle]], Edinburgh]]
Dick predeceased her in 1970, but Naomi remained active as a writer well into her nineties.<ref name="scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk"/> She was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1985 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49969 |date=31 December 1984 |page=8 |supp=y}}</ref> In her old age she was anxious and depressed about the future, particularly the misuse of scientific development such as nuclear arms. She stated that to experience two world wars in a lifetime was too much. On the other hand, she never exhausted the Haldanes' eccentricity, and once remarked that her biography in ''Who's Who'' was "burning rubbish".{{sfn |Jeger |1999}}

When asked on her 90th birthday whether she had regrets in life, she replied, "Yes, all the men I never slept with. Imagine!"{{sfn |Hoge |1999}}

She died at [[Carradale]] on 11 January 1999 at the age of 101, and was cremated at the [[Clydebank]] crematorium on 16 January. Her ashes were then scattered there.{{sfn |Tinning |1999}}
