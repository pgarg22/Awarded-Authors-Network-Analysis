'''Anne Manning''' (17 February 1807 &ndash; 14 September 1879) was an English novelist. Born in London, she was an active writer, having 51 works to her credit. Though her writings were antiquated in style, they were considered to have some literary charm and a delicate historical imagination. Her best known novel features the young wife of the poet [[John Milton]].

==Background and life==
Manning initially produced two books of non-fiction, followed by her first fictional work ''Village Belles'' (first published in 1833, though some modern sources mistakenly say 1838). Her best known works were initially printed as serials in ''[[Richard Bowdler Sharpe|Sharpe's Magazine]]'' and later published in book form. She is best known for ''The Maiden and Married Life of Mary Powell, afterwards Mistress Milton'', which first appeared anonymously in 1849 and was later just referred to as ''Mary Powell''. It is derived from the story of the young wife of [[John Milton]]. She is also known for ''The Household of Sir Thomas More'', a picture of [[Thomas More|More's]] home life in the form of a diary written by his daughter Margaret.

''Mary Powell'' was so popular that her subsequent works simply identified Manning as "The Author of Mary Powell," otherwise remaining anonymous.<ref name="anonymous">Room, Adrian [https://books.google.com/books?id=eSIhzKnNUf4C&pg=PA387#v=onepage&q&f=false Dictionary of Pseudonyms], p. 387 (5th ed. 2010)</ref><ref name="memoriam">(14 February 1880).

Manning never married, and was considered a chronic invalid, living for many years at [[Reigate]] Hill in [[Surrey]] until her mother died, and then at sister's house near [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], where she died in 1879.<ref name="manningsutherland"/><ref name="yonge">[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vBrAAAAIAAJ&pg=211#v=onepage&q&f=false Women Novelists of Queen Victoria's Reign], pp. 211-16 (biographical sketch by [[Charlotte Mary Yonge]]) (1897)</ref>

Although inexpensive reprints of ''Mary Powell'' and ''The Household of Sir Thomas More'' were published into the 1930s, Manning's archaic style has long since fallen out of favor.<ref name="mitchell">Mitchell, Sally, ed.
