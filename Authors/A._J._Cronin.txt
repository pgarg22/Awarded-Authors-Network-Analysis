'''Archibald Joseph Cronin''' (19 July 1896 – 6 January 1981), known as '''A. J. Cronin''', was a Scottish [[physician]] and [[novelist]].<ref name=university>{{Cite web |url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH3031&type=P |title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of AJ Cronin |website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk}}</ref> His best-known novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'' (1937) tells of a Scottish doctor in a Welsh [[coal mining|mining]] village, who then shoots up the medical ladder in London. Cronin knew both venues, as a medical inspector of mines and as a doctor in [[Harley Street]]. The book describes some medical ethics that helped to inspire the [[National Health Service]]. Another popular mining novel of his, set in the [[North East England|North East of England]], is ''[[The Stars Look Down]]''. Both have been filmed, as have ''[[Hatter's Castle]]'', ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom]]'' and ''[[The Green Years]]''. His 1935 novella ''Country Doctor'' inspired a long-running [[BBC]] radio and TV series, ''[[Dr. Finlay's Casebook (TV and radio)|Dr. Finlay's Casebook]]'' (1962–1971), set in the 1920s. There was a follow-up series in 1993–1996.

==Early life==
[[File:RosebankCottageCardross.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rosebank Cottage, Cronin's birthplace]]
Cronin was born in [[Cardross, Argyll|Cardross]], [[Dunbartonshire]],<ref name="ReferenceB"/> [[Scotland]], the only child of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] mother, Jessie Cronin (née Montgomerie), and a [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Catholic]] father, Patrick Cronin. Cronin often wrote of young men from similarly mixed backgrounds. His paternal grandparents had emigrated from [[County Armagh]], Ireland, and become glass and china merchants in [[Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire|Alexandria]]. Owen Cronin, his grandfather, had had his surname changed from Cronague in 1870. His maternal grandfather, Archibald Montgomerie, was a [[hatter]] who owned a shop in [[Dumbarton]]. After their marriage Cronin's parents moved to [[Helensburgh]], where he attended Grant Street School. When he was seven years old, his father, an insurance agent and commercial traveller, died of [[tuberculosis]]. He and his mother moved to her parents' home in Dumbarton, and she soon became a public health inspector in [[Glasgow]].

Cronin was not only a precocious student at [[Dumbarton Academy]],<ref name=kirjasto>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ajcronin.htm |title=A. J. Cronin |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000044/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ajcronin.htm |archive-date=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> who won prizes in writing competitions, but an excellent athlete and [[association football]]er. From an early age he was an avid golfer, and he enjoyed the sport throughout his life. He also loved salmon fishing.

The family later moved to [[Yorkhill]], [[Glasgow]], where Cronin attended [[St Aloysius' College, Glasgow|St Aloysius' College]]<ref name=kirjasto/> in the [[Garnethill]] area of the city. He played football for the First XI there, an experience he included in one of his last novels, ''[[The Minstrel Boy (novel)|The Minstrel Boy]]''. A family decision that he should study either to join the church or to practise medicine was settled by Cronin himself when he chose "the lesser of two evils".<ref name="ReferenceA">Peter Haining (1994) ''On Call with Doctor Finlay''. London: Boxtree Limited. {{ISBN|1852834714}}</ref> He won a [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]] scholarship to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1914. Having been absent in 1916–1917 for naval service, he graduated in 1919 with highest honours in the degree of MBChB. Later that year he visited India as ship's surgeon on a liner. Cronin went on to earn additional qualifications, including a Diploma in Public Health (1923) and [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]] (1924). In 1925 he gained an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] at the University of Glasgow with a [[dissertation]] entitled "The History of [[Aneurysm]]".

==Medical career==
During the [[First World War]], Cronin served as a [[surgery|surgeon]] [[sub-lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] before graduating from medical school. After the war he trained at hospitals that included Bellahouston Hospital and [[Lightburn Hospital]] in Glasgow and the [[Rotunda Hospital]] in [[Dublin]]. He undertook general practice at [[Garelochhead]], a village on the [[Clyde River (Scotland)|Clyde]], and in [[Tredegar]], a [[mining]] town in [[South Wales]]. In 1924 he was appointed Medical Inspector of Mines for Great Britain. His survey of medical regulations in [[colliery|collieries]] and his reports on [[Silicosis|the correlation]] between coal-dust inhalation and [[pulmonology|pulmonary disease]] were published over the next few years. Cronin drew on his medical experience and research into the occupational hazards of the mining industry for his later novels – ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', set in Wales, and ''[[The Stars Look Down]]'', set in [[Northumberland]]. He subsequently moved to London, where he practised in Harley Street before opening a busy medical practice of his own in [[Notting Hill]]. Cronin was also the medical officer for the [[Whiteleys]] department store at the time and had an increasing interest in [[ophthalmology]].

==Writing career==
[[File:A. J. Cronin 1931b.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A. J. Cronin in 1931]]
In 1930 Cronin was diagnosed with a chronic [[duodenum|duodenal]] [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] and told to take six months' complete rest in the country on a milk diet. At Dalchenna Farm by [[Loch Fyne]] he was finally able to indulge a lifelong desire to write a novel, having previously "written nothing but prescriptions and scientific papers."<ref>A. J. Cronin, ''[[Adventures in Two Worlds]]''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1952, pp. 261–262.</ref> From Dalchenna Farm he travelled to Dumbarton to research the background of his first novel, using files from Dumbarton Library, which still has a letter from him requesting advice. He composed ''[[Hatter's Castle]]'' in the span of three months and quickly had it accepted by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]], the only publisher to which he submitted it, apparently after his wife had randomly stuck a pin in a list of publishers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It was an immediate success and launched Cronin's career as a prolific author. He never returned to medicine.

Many of Cronin's books were bestsellers in their day and translated into many languages. Some of his stories draw on his medical career, dramatically mixing realism, romance and social criticism. Cronin's works examine moral conflicts between the individual and society, as his idealistic heroes pursue justice for the common man. One of his early novels, ''[[The Stars Look Down]]'' (1935), chronicles transgressions in a mining community in north-east England and an ambitious miner's rise to be a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP).

A prodigiously fast writer, Cronin liked to average 5,000 words a day, meticulously planning the details of his plots in advance.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He was known to be tough in business dealings, although in private life he was a person whose "pawky humour... peppered his conversations," according to one of his editors, [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Cronin also contributed stories and essays to various international publications. During the [[Second World War]] he worked for the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], writing articles as well as participating in radio broadcasts to foreign countries.

==Influence of ''The Citadel''==
''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'' (1937), a tale of a mining company doctor's struggle to balance scientific integrity with social obligations, helped to promote the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the United Kingdom by exposing the inequity and incompetence of medical practice at the time. In the novel Cronin advocated a free public health service to defeat the wiles of doctors who "raised [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]-snatching and the bamboozling of patients to an art form."<ref name = "ReferenceA"/> Cronin and [[Aneurin Bevan]] had both worked at the [[Tredegar General Hospital|Tredegar Cottage Hospital]] in Wales, which served as one of the bases for the NHS. The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession, and there was a concerted effort by one group of specialists to get ''The Citadel'' banned. Cronin's novel, which became the highest-selling book ever published by Gollancz, informed the public about corruption in the medical system, which eventually led to reform. Not only were the author's pioneering ideas instrumental in creating the NHS, but according to the historian [[Raphael Samuel]], the popularity of Cronin's novels played a major role in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s landslide victory in 1945.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Samuel, R. |title=North and South: A Year in a Mining Village |journal=London Review of Books|volume=17|issue=12 |date=22 June 1995 |pages=3–6 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v17/n12/raphael-samuel/north-and-south}}</ref>

By contrast, one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, called the book's reception mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were extracting large amounts of money from their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to a lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted it for what it was, a topical novel. The press tried to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while [[Victor Gollancz]] followed suit in an attempt to promote the book – both overlooking that it was a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.

In the United States ''The Citadel'' won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]], Favorite Fiction of 1937, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].<ref name=nyt1938>"Booksellers Give Prize to 'Citadel': Cronin's Work About Doctors Their Favorite–'Mme.

ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).</ref> According to a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll taken in 1939, ''The Citadel'' was voted the most interesting book readers had ever read.<ref>Gallup Jr., Alec M. (2009). ''The Gallup Poll Cumulative Index: Public Opinion, 1935–1997'', p. 135, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|0842025871}}.</ref>

==Religion==
Some of Cronin's novels also deal with religion, which he had grown away from during his medical training and career, but to which he became reacquainted in the 1930s. At medical school, as he recounts in his autobiography, he had become an agnostic: "When I thought of God it was with a superior smile, indicative of biological scorn for such an outworn myth." During his practice in Wales, however, the deep religious faith of the people he worked among made him start to wonder whether "the compass of existence held more than my text-books had revealed, more than I had ever dreamed of. In short I lost my superiority, and this, though I was not then aware of it, is the first step towards finding God."

Cronin also came to feel, "If we consider the physical [[universe]]... we cannot escape the notion of a primary Creator.... Accept [[evolution]] with its [[fossils]] and elementary [[species]], its [[scientific]] [[doctrine]] of [[natural]] causes. And still you are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. ''[[Nothing comes from nothing|Ex nihilo nihil]]'', as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished [[zoologist]] to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting "a frankly atheistic approach," described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, "though he did not say how," of the [[abiogenesis|first primitive life-form]] from lifeless [[matter]]. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The naïve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club burst into a howl of laughter. The elaborate structure of logic offered by the test-tube realist had been crumpled by one word of challenge from a simple-minded boy."<ref>A. J. Cronin, ''Adventures in Two Worlds'', Chapter 40 ("Why I Believe in God," in ''The Road to Damascus. Volume IV: Roads to Rome'', edited by John O'Brien. London: Pinnacle Books, 1955, pp. 11–18).</ref>

==Family==
[[File:A. J. Cronin with family 1938.jpg|thumb|350px|Cronin with family in 1938]]
It was at university that Cronin met his future wife, Agnes Mary Gibson (May, 1898–1981), who was also a medical student.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A.J. Cronin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPxPAQAAIAAJ |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-8057-6884-8 |page=10}}</ref> She was the daughter of Robert Gibson, a [[master craftsman|master]] [[baker]], and Agnes [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]] Gibson ([[née]] Gilchrist) of [[Hamilton, Scotland|Hamilton]], Lanarkshire. The couple married on 31 August 1921. As a physician, May worked with her husband briefly in the [[dispensary]] while he was employed by the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]]. She also assisted him with his practice in London. When he became an author, she would [[proofread]] his [[manuscript]]s. Their first son, [[Vincent Cronin|Vincent]], was born in Tredegar in 1924. Their second, [[R. F. Patrick Cronin|Patrick]], was born in [[London]] in 1926, and Andrew, their youngest, in London in 1937.

With his stories being adapted for [[Hollywood]] films, Cronin and his family moved to the United States in 1939, living in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]], California, [[Nantucket]], Massachusetts, [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], Connecticut, and [[Blue Hill, Maine|Blue Hill]], Maine.<ref>{{Cite book |author=A. J. Cronin |title=The Minstrel Boy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShHzNCyJ3IwC&pg=PT293 |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4472-4413-4 |pages=293}}</ref> In 1945, the Cronins sailed back to England aboard the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']], staying briefly in [[Hove]] and then in [[Raheny]], Ireland, before returning to the US the following year. They took up residence at the [[Carlyle Hotel]] in [[New York City]] and then in [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], Massachusetts, before settling in [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], Connecticut, in 1947. Cronin also travelled frequently to summer homes in [[Bermuda]] and [[Cap-d'Ail]], France.

==Later years==
Ultimately Cronin returned to Europe, to reside in [[Lucerne]] and [[Montreux]], Switzerland, for the last 25 years of his life. He continued to write into his eighties. He included among his friends [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]], to whose first son he was a [[godparent|godfather]].

Although the latter part of his life was spent entirely abroad, Cronin retained great affection for the district of his childhood, writing in 1972 to a local teacher: "Although I have travelled the world over I must say in all sincerity that my heart belongs to Dumbarton.... In my study there is a beautiful 17th-century coloured print of the [[Dumbarton Rock|Rock]].... I even follow with great fervour the fortunes of the [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton football team]]."<ref>Letter quoted in obituary of Cronin in ''Lennox Herald''. There is a photocopy of this obituary (undated) at [http://jane-firthofclyde.blogspot.com/2009/01/cardross-and-j-cronin-part-3.html "Cardross and A. J. Cronin Part 3"]</ref> Further evidence of Cronin's lifelong support of Dumbarton F.C. comes from a framed typewritten letter hanging in the foyer of the club's stadium. The letter, written in 1972 and addressed to the club's then secretary, congratulates the team on its return to the top division after a gap of 50 years. He recalls his childhood support for it, and on occasion being "lifted over" the turnstiles (a common practice in times past so that children did not have to pay).<ref>[http://bigrab.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/a-j-cronin/ A.J. Cronin]. The Ben Lomond Free Press (28 November 2007)</ref>

Cronin died on 6 January 1981 in Montreux and is interred at [[La Tour-de-Peilz]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/obituaries/aj-cronin-author-of-citadel-and-keys-of-the-kingdom-dies.html |title=A. J. Cronin, author of 'Citadel' and 'Keys of the Kingdom', dies |date=10 January 1981 |website=New York Times |access-date=22 May 2021}}</ref> Many of Cronin's writings, including published and unpublished literary manuscripts, drafts, letters, school exercise books and essays, [[laboratory]] books and his M.D. thesis, are held at the [[National Library of Scotland]] and at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas]].

Cronin's widow Agnes followed him on June 10, 1981, and after cremation, her ashes were buried next to him.
