She lived in London for two years and lived in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] until 1997.

Walton speaks [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: "It's the second language of my family of origin, my grandmother was a well known Welsh scholar and translator, I studied it in school from five to sixteen, I have a ten year old's fluency on grammar and vocab but no problem whatsoever with pronunciation."<ref>{{cite news | first = Jo | last = Walton | title = LiveJournal comment on knowledge of Welsh | url = http://truepenny.livejournal.com/55561.html?thread=254729 | work = LiveJournal | date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 14 November 2017 | url-status = bot: unknown | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326152628/http://truepenny.livejournal.com/55561.html?thread=254729 | archive-date = 26 March 2012}}</ref>

== Writing career ==
Walton has been writing since she was 13, but her first novel was not published until 2000.  Before that, she had been published in a number of [[role-playing game]] publications, such as ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'', mostly in collaboration with her husband at the time, Ken Walton, co-founder of the [[Cakebread & Walton]] games company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=1835|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116090059/http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=1835|url-status=dead|title=Jo Walton :: Pen & Paper RPG Database<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=16 January 2005}}</ref> Walton was also active in online [[science fiction fandom]], especially in the [[Usenet]] groups ''rec.arts.sf.written'' and ''rec.arts.sf.fandom''. Her poem "The Lurkers Support Me in E-Mail" is widely quoted on it and in other online arguments, often without her name attached.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10407 |title=IRoSF: Login Required<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=1 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113220222/http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10407 |archive-date=13 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

Walton's first three novels, ''[[The King's Peace (novel)|The King's Peace]]'' (2000), ''[[The King's Name]]'' (2001), and ''[[The Prize in the Game]]'' (2002) were all fantasy and set in the same world, which is based on [[Arthurian]] Britain and the [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'s Ireland. She won the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]] in 2002. Her next novel, ''[[Tooth and Claw (novel)|Tooth and Claw]]'' (2003) was intended as a novel [[Anthony Trollope]] could have written, but about dragons rather than humans.

''[[Farthing (novel)|Farthing]]'' was her first science fiction novel, placing the genre of the [[cozy mystery]] firmly inside an [[alternative history]] in which the United Kingdom made peace with [[Adolf Hitler]] before the involvement of the United States in [[World War II]]. It was nominated for a [[Nebula Award]], a [[Quill Awards|Quill Award]],<ref>[http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/06/02/2007-quills-nominees/ Announcement of Quills nominees at ''The Beat''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120715165112/http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/06/02/2007-quills-nominees/ |date=15 July 2012 }}, 2 June 2007</ref> the [[John W.

A sequel, ''[[Ha'penny (novel)|Ha'penny]]'', was published in October 2007 by [[Tor Books]],<ref>[http://www.tor-forge.com/hapenny Tor Books blurb page for ''Ha'penny''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204224345/http://www.tor-forge.com/hapenny |date=4 December 2007 }}.</ref> with the final book in the trilogy, ''[[Half a Crown (novel)|Half a Crown]],'' published in September 2008. ''Ha'penny'' won the 2008 [[Prometheus Award]] (jointly with [[Harry Turtledove]]'s novel ''The Gladiator'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfs.org/releases/2008Finalists.shtml |title=Prometheus Award Finalists Announced |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2008 |publisher=Libertarian Futurist Society |access-date=25 April 2013}}</ref> and has been nominated for the [[Lambda Literary Award]].<ref>[http://www.lambdaliterary.org/winners-finalists/04/30/lambda-literary-awards-2007-2/ 20th Annual Lambda Literary Awards] accessed 25 April 2013.</ref>

In April 2007, [[Howard V. Hendrix]] stated that professional writers should never release their writings online for free, as this made them equivalent to [[Strikebreaker|scabs]].<ref name="livejournal">[http://community.livejournal.com/sfwa/10039.html Hendrix's "webscabs" post on LiveJournal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104175657/http://community.livejournal.com/sfwa/10039.html |date=4 January 2009 }}, April 2007</ref> Walton responded to this by declaring 23 April as [[International Pixel-Stained Technopeasant Day]], a day in which writers who disagreed with Hendrix could release their stories online en masse. In 2008 Walton celebrated this day by posting several chapters of an unfinished sequel to ''Tooth and Claw'', ''Those Who Favor Fire.''

In 2008, Walton began writing an online column for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]], mostly retrospective reviews of older books.<ref>[http://www.tor.com/tags/Jo%20Walton%20Reads Jo Walton Reads] at Tor.com</ref> A collection of these blog posts were published in ''What Makes This Book So Great'' (2014). She also wrote a series of articles revisiting the Hugo award nominees for each year from 1953 to 2000, which were later collected as ''[[An Informal History of the Hugos]]'' (2018).<ref name=locus-2018>
