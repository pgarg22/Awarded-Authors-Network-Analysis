==Career==
Hickman had many jobs before joining [[TSR, Inc.]] (the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons) in 1982, including working as a supermarket stocker, a movie projectionist, a theater manager, a glass worker, a television assistant director, and a drill press operator in a [[genealogy]] center.<ref name="Hickman Website" /> 

===TSR===
Together, Tracy and Laura wrote the original versions of the [[Adventure module|adventure modules]] ''[[Rahasia]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (module)|Pharaoh]]'', publishing them privately.<ref name="Dragon #120"/> ''Pharaoh'' was originally published by [[DayStar West Media]] in 1980.<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|15}} In 1981, Tracy entered into a business arrangement to produce an arcade immersion game,<ref name="Hickman Website" /> but his associate disappeared, leaving the Hickmans with $30,000 in debt.<ref name="Dragon #120"/> Tracy approached TSR with the modules ''Rahasia'' and ''Pharaoh'', "literally so that I could buy shoes for my children".<ref name="Dragon #120"/><ref name="HG">{{Cite book | contribution=[[Battle Cry (game)|Battle Cry]] | title=[[Hobby Games: The 100 Best]] | last=Hickman | first=Tracy | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=21–23 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}</ref> TSR bought the modules, and wanted to hire Tracy as well. Tracy recalls, "They said it would be easier to publish my adventures if I was part of the company. So, we made the move from [[Utah]] to [[Wisconsin]]. It was a terrifying experience. We had no money. My parents begged us not to venture into such foreign territory to pursue such a bizarre career. My father wrote that there was a secure job as a fry cook in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] (where my parents were living), and he pleaded with me to come take it."<ref name="Dragon #120"/>

When Tracy and Laura Hickman came to TSR, they brought ''Pharaoh'' with them.

===Dragonlance===
As he was traveling from Utah to Wisconsin to join TSR, Hickman conceived the idea for a setting to make [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]] fearsome once more. At TSR he found other creators who were interested in his project, which was called "Project Overlord".<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|16}} [[Harold Johnson (game designer)|Harold Johnson]] became the project's biggest promoter to upper management and convinced Hickman to expand his initial idea of a three-adventure trilogy.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|16}} Soon after, TSR management announced its intention to develop Hickman's series of dragon-based role-playing adventures.<ref name="Dragon #120"/> Hickman's proposal resulted in the ''[[List of Dragonlance novels#Chronicles|Dragonlance Chronicles]]'', which led to his association with [[Margaret Weis]].<ref name="Dragon #120"/> [[Jean Blashfield Black|Jean Black]], the managing editor of TSR's book department, picked Hickman and Weis to write ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]'' and the rest of the ''[[Dragonlance Chronicles]]'' series.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|16}} This was the first project TSR had undertaken that would include adult novels as well as games, calendars, and other spin-off products.<ref name="Dragon #120"/> It was also Hickman's first novel writing experience.<ref name=":0" /> The original ''Dragonlance'' team was formed under Hickman's leadership.<ref name="Dragon #120"/><ref>Phillips, Casey (February 19, 2010).

In March 2019, Hickman and Weis were contracted by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the new publisher of ''Dungeons and Dragons,'' to write another installment of the ''Dragonlance'' series. A new trilogy of books was planned to be published by [[Random House]].

Hickman left TSR in 1987.<ref name=":4" /> He has published more than 30 novels with Margaret Weis.<ref name="Dragon #250" /> Together they wrote the ''[[Darksword]]'' trilogy and ''[[The Death Gate Cycle]],''<ref name="Dragon #243">{{cite journal|last=Varney|first=Allen|author-link=Allen Varney|date=January 1998|title=ProFiles: Margaret Weis|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|location=[[Renton, Washington]]|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|issue=#243|page=120}}</ref> and collaborated on the ''[[Rose of the Prophet]]'' series (1988-1989).<ref name="designers" />{{rp|351}} Weis and Hickman returned to TSR to write new fiction, although TSR turned their intended trilogy into a single book, ''[[Dragons of Summer Flame]],'' published in 1995.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|29}} 

Tracy and Laura Hickman have been publishing game designs together for over thirty years,<ref name=":1" /> including the popular and innovative ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[Ravenloft (D&D module)|''Ravenloft'' module]] in 1983.

For the [[Starshield]] Project, Hickman and Weis produced the Del Rey Books-published novels ''Sentinels'' (later retitled ''Mantle of Kendis-Dai'') and ''Nightsword''. Hickman also wrote a story set in the Starshield universe for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #250 called "Dedrak's Quest". Of his and Weis's fictional setting, he said, "Starshield is a universe where a society of dragons can confront blaster-armed spacemen or wizards wielding magic staves with computer targeting," and that the Starshield Project "grew out of [his] desire to share the creation process with all [their] fans."<ref name="Dragon #250" /> According to Hickman, Starshield's ultimate purpose, and his biggest dream, was to finance a permanent colony on the planet [[Mars]] by the year 2010. Readers were able to freely download both the first novel in the series and the Starshield roleplaying game from Hickman's website.<ref name="Dragon #250" />

In the late 1990s, [[Larry Elmore]] approached Weis and Hickman to pitch his fantasy world of Loerem.
