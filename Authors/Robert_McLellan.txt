'''Robert McLellan''' [[OBE]] (1907–1985) was a [[Scottish renaissance]] dramatist, writer and poet and a leading figure in the twentieth century movement to recover Scotland’s distinctive theatrical traditions. He found popular success with plays and stories written in his native [[Modern Scots|Scots tongue]] and is regarded, alongside [[William Laughton Lorimer|William Lorimer]], as one of the most important modern exponents of [[prose|fine prose]] in the language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Paul Henderson |title=Review Essay: The Future of the Scots Language |journal=Scottish Affairs |date=1998 |issue=24 |page=84 |url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/scot.1998.0042 |access-date=22 February 2021|via=Edinburgh University Press|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In addition to his literary career, McLellan saw active service during [[World War II]], served as an elected councillor for the [[Isle of Arran]], his adopted home after marriage, and was active variously in the [[League of Dramatists]], the [[Society of Authors]] and the [[Scots Language Society|Lallans Society]]. In the early 1960s he served briefly as elected President for the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947|District Councils Association for Scotland]]. He was also a frequent campaigner in defence of local heritage and a dedicated [[beekeeper]].

McLellan today in literature is probably best remembered for the historical comedies, ''[[Jamie the Saxt]]'' and ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]'', and for his short story cycle, ''[[Linmill Stories]]'', but his stage-writing career was a long and experimental one spanning over thirty years of crucial development for Scottish theatrical self-expression. In his later career he also wrote for radio and television. He was awarded a [[Civil List Pension]] in 1968 for "services to literature in Scotland" and received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1978.

==Early career==
Robert McLellan began life as a dramatist in the early 1930s. Much of his early work was first produced by the short-lived [[Curtain Theatre (Glasgow)|Curtain Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scullion |first1=Adrienne |title=BBC Radio in Scotland, 1923-1939: devolution, regionalism and centralisation |journal=Northern Scotland |date=2015 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=77 |url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/nor.1995.0006 |access-date=22 February 2021|via=Edinburgh University Press|url-access=subscription}}</ref> a dynamic and ambitious subscription company founded in 1933 and based in the university district of the city.

This early period was a prolific and experimental one for the playwright. Throughout the decade he was effectively Curtain's "house dramatist", trying out various genres and modes in both Scots and English for performance before a dedicated and vocal "[[studio]]" audience. Some of these early works in short form, such as ''Jeddart Justice'' and ''The Changeling'', were also picked up by other non-professional companies around the country and entered in the annual [[Scottish Community Drama Association]] competitions of the era.

McLellan's first notable success came in 1936 with Curtain's production of his full-length three-act comedy, ''Toom Byres'', set among the [[Border reivers]] in the early days of the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI]]. This was quickly followed in 1937 by ''[[Jamie the Saxt]]'', set in the same period but this time in an urban milieu, its action taking place in and around the court in [[Edinburgh]] and featuring the king himself in his prime. This latter production, with the young [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]] famously creating a sensation in the title role, is generally regarded as the one which confirmed McLellan's reputation as a comic dramatist of substance in Scots.

McLellan is known to have been briefly resident in England as a [[screenwriter]] at some point around this time, but for whatever reason he soon came back to Scotland, marrying in 1938 and settling on the Isle of Arran. He continued to work with Curtain in mind, but his last production with the company, ''Portrait of an Artist'', this time written in [[Scottish English|English]] with a contemporary setting, met with less critical acclaim. For his next works, ''The Smuggler'' and ''The Bogle'', both set in the eighteenth century, the playwright made a return to historical Scots comedy.

In the event, ''The Bogle'' (later renamed ''Torwatletie''), would wait until 1946 for its debut production. By the time McLellan had completed the play, early in 1940, Curtain theatre was no more, having broken up after the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|declaration of war in 1939]]. The [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|war years]] would entail a significant interruption in McLellan's developing career as a playwright.

==War years==
By now a first-time father, McLellan enlisted with the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1940. He served for the next five years as an anti-aircraft gunner in defence around the British Isles (outwith Scotland) and on the [[Faroe Islands]]. Having set drama aside, he turned instead to poetry and short story, modes of writing which he found more conducive within the context of military life. It was also during his years in the services, in circa 1943, while stationed on the Faroes, that he met the poet [[Hans Andrias Djurhuus|Hans Djurhuus]]. McLellan as a writer in Scots later publicly acknowledged the inspiration he derived from his meetings with Djurhuus, a writer engaged in a parallel effort to forge new literary use for his own native [[Faroese language|Faroese]].

But during this time, the playwright had never lost sight of his principal career. As soon as hostilities ended in [[End of World War II in Europe|May 1945]], while still in uniform but freed of his duties, McLellan straightway composed the [[verse drama]] ''The Carlin Moth'' during the fortnight after [[VE Day]], by his own account, in the 'hot attic' of a mansion near [[Southwold]] on the [[Suffolk Coast and Heaths|Suffolk coast]] where his unit was stationed at the time. By combining the poetry with his drama, this resumption of his stage work had also added a new mode to his writing.

==Post-war years==
After [[demobilisation]] in 1946, McLellan returned to Arran. During his absence, the war years had seen developments in the Scottish theatre scene, such as the formation of [[Glasgow Unity Theatre|Unity Players]] in 1941, and [[James Bridie]]'s founding of [[Citizens Theatre|Glasgow Citizens]] in 1943, so McLellan perhaps returned with better hopes for a more professionalised institutional culture for new Scottish work. In any event, he hit the ground running. That same year, the newly composed ''Carlin Moth'' was produced on radio; the debut production of ''Torwatletie'', completed five years previously but kept on ice until his return from the war, was mounted by Unity (subsequently taken in 1947 to the first "[[Edinburgh Fringe]]", then on to London’s [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]] in 1948); and McLellan himself was already embarked on composing his next major play, ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]''. He also by this time had ''The Cailleach'', a short Scots play with a more sombre tone, under his belt.

McLellan conceived ''Flouers o Edinburgh'' first and foremost as a professional vehicle for Bridie's recently founded Citizens, but in the later 1940s the two men began to have differences. McLellan refused permission to tour ''Jamie the Saxt'' to London after Bridie insisted on license to make re-writes. Then, in 1948, Bridie's Citizens rejected ''Flouers''. Although Unity once again mounted the debut production, they did not achieve the same success as with ''Torwatletie'', and perhaps it was the radio production in 1951, a few months after Bridie's death, in which the play was finally "discovered". Either way, despite the initial resistance from Citizens, ''Flouers o Edinburgh'' went on to become one of McLellan's most popular and frequently revived works.

==1950s==
Citizens did finally mount two McLellan debuts: the historical study, ''[[Mary Stewart (play)|Mary Stewart]]'', in 1950, and ''The Road to the Isles'', a contemporary satire of land activism in the [[Scottish highlands|Highlands]], in 1954. These new plays did not win the same popular success as previous plays, but McLellan's established works continued to be a popular staple among the country's thriving amateur drama clubs and associations in the [[History of television|years before television]]. With Scotland's more formal theatrical institutions of the 1950s, on the other hand, McLellan became increasingly frustrated - a frustration he publicly expressed - seeing them as often resistant to, and misapprending of, Scottish theatrical values, especially around the matter of language.

In the course of the decade McLellan increasingly turned instead to [[broadcast radio]], establishing a good working relationship with the [[BBC Home Service|Scottish Home Service]] producer [[James Crampsie]]. Crampsie was more in tune with McLellan's needs and aspirations. As well as mounting radio adaptations of his work, he commissioned new writing, including works for broadcast around [[Burns night]], and three substantial series of dramatisations of episodes from Scottish history for schools broadcasts.

One of the next highlights of McLellan's career was the broadcast of his award-winning verse drama for radio in 1957, ''Sweet Largie Bay'', with its beautiful and elegaic evocation of generational change and decline in island life. At the close of the decade, ''Rab Mossgiel'', commissioned by Crampsie to mark the Burns bicentenary in 1959, was the first of the playwright's works to be broadcast on [[Television in Scotland|Scottish television]].

==Biography==
Robert McLellan was born in 1907 at the home of his maternal grandparents in [[Linmill]], a fruit farm close to [[Kirkfieldbank]] in the prosperous fruit-growing [[Clyde Valley]] region of [[Lanarkshire]]. His father was John McLellan, a printer by trade, who circa 1912 founded, and thereafter ran, the [[Allander Press]] in [[Milngavie]], still at that time a detached township to the north of [[Glasgow]]. Although the young McLellan grew up in Milngavie, he generally spent his summer holidays the Lanarkshire farm of his grandparents, and it was those times in the immediate pre-First World War period, which later became the inspiration for his ''Linmill Stories''.

After attending [[Bearsden Academy]] in Glasgow, McLellan entered the [[University of Glasgow]] as an undergraduate in moral philosophy in 1925. He did not complete his degree, possibly abandoning his studies after the death of his mother from tuberculosis in 1928.

McLellan met his future wife, Kathleen Heys from [[Grindleton]], [[Lancashire]], sometime before 1933 while rambling in the [[Lake District]]. They married in 1938, settling in Arran where they lived modestly on McLelllan's income as a playwright, latterly supplemented in the post-war years by the produce of his [[beekeeping]] and Kathleen’s [[handicraft|hand crafts]].

McLellan died suddenly at home in High Corrie on the day before his 78th birthday in January 1985. He is buried on Arran.
