When he was given an Award in Literature by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1991, the citation read:

<blockquote>J. D. McClatchy is a poet who has emerged into highly distinctive achievement in his third collection, The Rest of the Way. Formally a master, with enormous technical skills, McClatchy writes with an authentic blend of cognitive force and a savage emotional intensity, brilliantly restrained by his care for firm rhetorical control. His increasingly complex sense of our historical overdeterminations is complemented by his concern for adjusting the balance between his own poems and tradition. It may be that no more eloquent poet will emerge in his American generation.</blockquote>

In addition to being [[Literary executor|Literary Executor]] to [[Anthony Hecht]] and [[Mona Van Duyn]], McClatchy was also, along with [[UCLA]] professor and poet [[Stephen Yenser]], co-executor for the [[literary estate]] of [[James Merrill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/03/26/google-books-an-exchange/|title=Google & Books: An Exchange|first1=Stephen|last1=Yenser|first2=Tappan|last2=Wilder|first3=Margo|last3=Viscusi|first4=J.
