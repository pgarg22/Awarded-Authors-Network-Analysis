'''George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne''' [[Privy Council of England|PC]] (9 March 1666 – 29 January 1735), of [[Kilkhampton|Stowe]], Cornwall, was an English Tory politician who sat in the [[English House of Commons|English]] and [[British House of Commons]]  from 1702 until 1712, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lansdown and sat in the House of Lords. He was Secretary at War during the Harley administration from 1710 to 1712. He was also a noted  poet and made a name for himself with verses composed on the visit of [[Mary of Modena]], then Duchess of York, while he was at Cambridge in 1677. He was also a playwright, following in the style of [[John Dryden]].

==Origins==
Granville was the son of [[Bernard Granville (MP died 1701)|Bernard Granville]], the fourth son of [[Bevil Grenville|Sir Bevil Grenville]] (1596-1643) of [[Bideford]] in Devon and [[Stowe, Kilkhampton|Stowe]] in the parish of [[Kilkhampton]] in Cornwall, a heroic Royalist commander in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. (The family changed the spelling of its name in 1661 from "Grenville" to "Granville", following the grant of the titles [[Baron Granville]] and [[Earl of Bath]]).<ref>[[J. Horace Round]], Family Origins and Other Studies, ed. Page, William, 1930, p.164, The Granvilles and the Monks, p.130</ref> His uncle was [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath]] (1628-1701) whose half-first-cousin was [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle]], who both played leading roles in the [[Restoration (1660)|restoration of the monarchy]] to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1660. He was [[heir male]] of [[William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath]] (1692-1711),<ref>[[J. Horace Round]], Family Origins and Other Studies, ed. Page, William, 1930, p.164, The Granvilles and the Monks, p.141</ref> the 19-year-old son of his first cousin [[Charles Granville, 2nd Earl of Bath]] (1661–1701), lord of the manors of [[Manor of Bideford|Bideford]] in Devon and of [[Stowe, Kilkhampton]], Cornwall. These connections guaranteed that Granville began life as a staunch [[Tory]] and [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].

==Career==
[[File:Granville H. Walpole portrait.png|thumb|left|Granville as depicted in Walpole's ''A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors'', 1806.]]
Granville  was sent to France at the age of ten, with his tutor, William Ellis, who was a proponent of passive resistance and later a servant of James II at St  Germain.  He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1677.<ref>{{acad|id=GRNL677G|name=Grenville, George, Baron Lansdowne}}</ref> Among his productions while there were poems welcoming [[Mary of Modena]] when she visited the university. In 1682, he went to Paris with his brother Sir Bevill Granville, where they studied fencing, riding, dancing,  mathematics and   military science.  He stayed in France until 1687, accumulating a  £500 debt. He then lived  in England at his mother's house at Marr, near Doncaster. His early interests were literary and by the mid-1690s he had befriended [[John Dryden]] and begun to write plays.<ref name=HOP/> He wrote an undistinguished [[comedy of manners]] entitled ''[[The She-Gallants]]'', which was staged unsuccessfully in 1695. His adult plays bear the marks of Dryden's influence. ''The Heroick Love'' is taken from the first book of [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Iliad|Iliad]]''. Granville also followed Dryden in adapting [[Shakespeare]] and Granville's ''The Jew of Venice'' (1701) was a successful updating of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Perhaps his greatest success was ''The British Enchanters'' (1705), a pseudo-operatic extravaganza staged by [[Thomas Betterton]]'s company.

In the opinion of [[Samuel Johnson]], Granville's non-dramatic poetry is slavishly imitative of [[Edmund Waller]]. However some of his poetry was popular in its day. Perhaps Granville's most useful act as regards poetry was the encouragement he gave to [[Alexander Pope]], which Pope remembered with gratitude in his ''[[Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot]]''.

==Political life==
[[File:GranvilleArms QueenAnne'sWalk Barnstaple Devon.PNG|thumb|250 px|Heraldic [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] of George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne, detail from [[parapet]] of [[Queen Anne's Walk]], [[Barnstaple]], Devon, completed ''circa'' 1713.  [[Motto]] of Granville, Baron Lansdowne: ''Deo, Patriae, Amicis'' ("For God, my Country and Friends"). The motto of his uncle [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath]] was: ''Futurum invisibile'' ("The future is unseen")<ref>As seen on his heraldic [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] in the Church of St James the Great, [[Kilkhampton]], Cornwall</ref>]]

The death of Granville's parents and of his uncle the 1st Earl of Bath in 1701 placed Granville in a position of power which the accession of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1702 allowed him to employ. With the help of his cousin, Hon. John Granville, an influential Tory leader, he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Fowey (UK Parliament constituency)|Fowey]] at the [[1702 English general election]]. When his elder brother, Sir Bevill Granville, was appointed [[Governor of Barbados]],  Granville inherited his office as [[Governor of Pendennis Castle|constable of Pendennis Castle]] in 1703. In Parliament, he operated in the sphere of [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley]], who was an indifferent patron at first. He was absent from the division on the Tack, becoming  labelled a ‘Sneaker’. He was returned unopposed for Fowey at the [[1705 English general election]] and with the help of Harley fended of an attempt to remove him from his post at Pendennis Castle. His aspiration to obtain a post led him to support the Court in voting for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705, and he again supported the Court on the ‘place clause’ of the regency bill in February 1706. At the [[1708 general election]], he was returned again for Fowey. The height of his fame during the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]]-[[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]] administration came from his spirited defence of [[Henry Sacheverell]] in 1710.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url =http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/granville-george-1666-1735 | title= GRANVILLE, George (1666-1735), of Stowe, Cornw.| publisher= History of Parliament Online| access-date = 30 June 2019 }}</ref>

After the fall of the Godolphin government, Granville became MP for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]] at the [[1710 British general election]], and on 28 September 1710 he was made Secretary at War.<ref>Haydn, Joseph, ''Book of Dignities'' (London: Longman, Brown, Green & Longman, 1851), p. 190.</ref> In this capacity, he oversaw the passage of important bills on munitions and recruitment. However, his experience in the Tory government was marked by family and legal strife. He was the [[heir male]] to the senior line of the Granville family following the death without progeny in 1711 of his cousin [[William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath]]. He was not in succession to the earldom and was in recognition raised to the peerage on 1 January 1712 as '''Baron Lansdown of Bideford'''<ref>Round, p.141</ref> in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]] and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. He was one of [[Harley's Dozen]] created at once to change the political balance in the Whig-dominated Lord. He expended time and money in an ultimately futile effort to secure the title of [[Earl of Bath]]. Despite some success, his tenure in the War Office was marred by accusations of corruption and expensive contested elections. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1712.<ref name=HOP/>

In 1714 Queen Anne was succeeded by the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who favoured the Whigs. Almost all the Tories who held office under Anne were dismissed, including Lord Lansdown. Embittered, he began a secret correspondence with the Jacobite [[Old Pretender]] [[James Francis Edward Stuart|"James III"]]. On 6 October 1721 James, who refused to recognise his peerage "Baron Lansdown" bestowed by Queen Anne,<ref>The new patent referred to him as "George Granvill, commonly called Lord Lansdown..." (Round, p.141)</ref> created him "Lord of Lansdown"," Viscount [ ]" and "Earl of Bath" in the [[Jacobite Peerage]] of England, with remainder to his heirs male. On 3 November 1721 James created him "Duke of Albemarle", "Marquis Monck and Fitzhemmon", "Earl of Bath", "Viscount Bevel", and "Baron Lansdown of Bideford" in the [[Jacobite Peerage]] of England, which supposed titles had no legal validity in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. One of these titles referred to his family's supposed descent (officially confirmed to the 1st Earl of Bath by warrant of King Charles II in 1661<ref>Round, p.140</ref>) from [[Richard I de Grenville]] (d.post 1142) of [[Neath Castle]], one of the [[Twelve Knights of Glamorgan]] and a brother and follower of [[Robert FitzHamon]] the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. The titles Monck and Albemarle referred to the fact that the 1st Earl of Bath had been granted reversion of his cousin Monck's Dukedom of Albemarle, should the Duke have died without male progeny.<ref>Round, p.140</ref> The title "Lansdown" referred to Lansdown Hill near Bath in Somerset where his grandfather Sir Bevil Grenville had met his heroic death at the [[Battle of Lansdown]] in 1643. The titles created on 3 November 1721 were with remainder to the heirs male of his body, whom failing to his brother, Bernard Granville, and the heirs male of his body.

==Marriage==
On 15 December 1711 in the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in Westminster, London, he married (as her 2nd husband) Mary Villiers, the daughter of [[Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey]] (1656–1711) and the widow of [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth]].

==Death and burial==
He died in London on 29 January 1735, his wife having predeceased him by a few days, and was buried with her in the Church of [[St Clement Danes]] on 3 February 1735. He left no male progeny, and thus at his death the Barony of Lansdowne became extinct. His Jacobite titles, such as they were, were inherited by his nephew Bernard Granville, son of his brother Bernard. The younger Bernard died in 1776, when the Jacobite peerages created on 3 November 1721 became extinct, while those created on 6 October 1721 passed to his heir male.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/jacobitepeerage00unkngoog#page/n38/mode/2up Melville de Massue de Ruvigny, The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage & Grants of Honour (Edinburgh: T.C. & E.C.
