'''Alan Davies''' (born August 26, 1951), is a contemporary [[American poet]], [[critic]], and [[Magazine editor|editor]] who has been writing and publishing since the 1970s. Today, he is most often associated with the [[Language poets]].

==Life and work==
Alan Davies was born in [[Lacombe, Alberta|Lacombe]], a town in [[central Alberta]], Canada. By the mid-1970s, he was editing a poetry journal, ''Occulist Witnesses'', in the  [[Boston]] area where he had stayed for a few years after attending [[Robert Creeley]]'s poetry class at [[Harvard]] Summer School in 1972. By this time he had hand-published [[John Wieners]]' treatise on and for young poets, ''"The Lanterns along the Wall,"'' which Wieners had written especially for Creeley's class.<ref>http://jacketmagazine.com/21/kimb-rev1.html ''John and the Four Dunn(e)s
''</ref> and began more actively publishing his own poetry. Soon, Davies was forming relations with an experimental group of writers whose practice became determining features of what grew into the ''Language School''. This 'school' was not a group precisely, but a ''tendency'' in the work of many of its so-called practitioners.

Davies edited ''A Hundred Posters'', one of the important "little" magazines of the "Language" movement. Subsequently, Davies was included in the crucial anthology devoted to "language-centred" writing: ''In the American Tree'', edited by [[Ron Silliman]] ([[National Poetry Foundation]], 1986; 2002).

Alan Davies, who is a [[Buddhist]] (as pointed out by [[Juliana Spahr]]),<ref>[http://people.mills.edu/jspahr/poetrycrisis.htm "Poetry in a Time of Crisis"] links to an article by Spahr which first appeared in ''Poetry Project Newsletter'' 189 (2002), 6-8. It was originally written for the "Poetry in a Time of Crisis" panel at the 2001 [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] in December of that year. Much of the talk centers around a reading Alan Davies gave in early October 2001 (shortly after the events of [[9/11]]) at a small café in [[Brooklyn]], New York</ref> is currently living and working in [[New York City]].

Davies was the 2011 [[writer in residence]] at the [[University of Windsor]].<ref>[http://www.uwindsor.ca/english/fall-2011-writer-in-residence-alan-davies-0 "Writer in Residence"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231400/http://www1.uwindsor.ca/english/fall-2011-writer-in-residence-alan-davies-0 |date=2013-12-02 }} University of Windsor website.</ref>
