'''Francois Alwyn (Frans) Venter''' (27 November 1916 – 8 July 1997) was a prominent [[Afrikaans]] writer of the 20th century. His novels explored biblical religious themes, or cultural identities in the South African context. He also examined relations between white and black more closely in ''Wit oemfaan'', which describes a white boy's discovery of the customs of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nation. ''Swart pelgrim'' on the other hand relates the experiences and observations of a migrant from a black rural setting to the industrialised, white-dominated environment. He may be best known for his novel ''Geknelde land'' ([[Afrikaans]] for Afflicted land), which describes the [[Eastern Cape]] [[Boer]] community living under [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa raids]] and the English governance of the 19th century.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Hopetown, Northern Cape|Hopetown]], and grew up on his parents' farm in the [[Britstown]] district. He attended rural schools at first, before attending the Strydenburg Secondary School, and matriculating from Hopetown High School in 1934. He studied at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] and commenced a career as journalist in 1938.

==Adult career==
For 25 years he worked as a journalist in Cape Town, Pretoria, Windhoek and Johannesburg. He also wrote popular fiction, under the pseudonyms Meiring Fouché, Elske te Water, René Stegmann and Marius de Jongh.<ref>John Christoffel Kannemeyer, ''Geskiedenis van die Afrikaanse literatuur'', 2 vols., Volume 2, 2nd ed. Pretoria: Academica, 1984, {{ISBN|9780868741758}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=97bdU9vFBdDZoASkt4KACQ&id=fAcJAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22Meiring+Fouch%C3%A9%22+F.+A.+Venter&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22Meiring+Fouch%C3%A9%22 p.&nbsp;50] {{in lang|af}}.</ref> In 1960 he began farming in the [[Kenhardt]] district near [[Van Wyksvlei, Northern Cape|Vanwyksvlei]], where his parents had resided since the 1930s. In 1967 he had to leave the northern Cape due to declining health and settled in [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]], meaning to write full-time. In 1970, however, he returned to farming, this time as viticulturist at [[Vredendal]] in the [[Olifants River (Western Cape)|Olifants river]] valley. In 1976 when his health deteriorated again, he retired for good from farming and returned to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]].

==Recognition==
Venter received the [[Hertzog Prize]] for prose in 1976 for his novels ''Swart pelgrim'' and ''Geknelde land''. For ''Kambrokind'' he received the ''ruitertrofee'' ('equestrian trophy') of the Suid-Afrikaanse Federasie van Rapportryerskorpse in 1982. In 1981 the [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|University of Port Elizabeth]] awarded him the [[honorary degree]] D. Litt in recognition for his writings. In 1996 he received the Andrew Murray Prize for Literature. He was in addition a member of the [[Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde]] (a Dutch society for literature).

F.A. Venter died in 1997.
