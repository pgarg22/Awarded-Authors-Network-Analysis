'''Ray Buttigieg''' (born May 1, 1955) is a poet and musician.

He attended [[Qala, Malta|Qala]] primary school, then the Lyceum in Victoria, Gozo. He then moved to the United States and continued his studies in New York, where he settled permanently. By the age of 20 he had several poems published in anthologies in London and New York City.

==History==

===Writing===
Best known for ''Pastorale'' (1978), ''Poeticus I & II'' (1986) and (1992), and the very first book he ever wrote in his late teens ''Wizard's Spider Mystic Glider'' (1989) which are written in a [[classicism|classical]] style; he received criticism when he later introduced a more modern style in his experiments and improvisational poetry. In the last few years he returned to his earlier style in works like ''The Wisdom of Stones'' (2002), ''Remnants from the Book of Time'' (2002), and ''The Procession'' (1999). Although for the last 25 years Buttigieg has been writing only in English and very little in his native [[Maltese language|Maltese]], his subject matter still includes a great deal of influence from his native Malta.

===Music===
Ray Buttigieg since the age of ten became extremely interested in music when he started to sing [[Latin]] hymns on the gallery of the grand pipe organ at St Joseph's church. He was also attracted to pieces of metal of various sizes, weights and alloys as well as short wave radios where he thought the combination of these found instruments are uniquely musical that could be used as effects. He later learned the guitar and started to write songs for his first [[Rock and Roll|rock]] improvisational band.

===With Cykx===
Buttigieg started his professional musical career in New York and Philadelphia where he fronted a six piece [[glam/rock]] band [[Cykx]] where his catchy tunes mixed with his lyrical poetry produced two top ten pop hits in the mid-seventies. At the same time synthesizers and [[computers]] and several electronic music experiments on tape were becoming more interesting to Ray Buttigieg than bandmates who could never agree on anything. Soon the band was defunct and a new project band started. '''Ray Buttigieg/Cykx''', Cykx being the computer that replaced the members of the band. The pop or [[rock and roll|rock]] compositions now became explorations and experiments in sound. ''[[Compucircuit 0.008 m/s]]'' (1981), ''[[Mechanism of Thought]]'' (1984) were both very ground breaking albums.

Buttigieg believed that electronic synthesisers was a third 'high' in music, the first and second being acoustic and electric instruments.

===Solo Work===
Buttigieg embarked on a solo career ever since he set eyes on his first keyboards, a [[Mellotron]]. He was involved in multiple projects at the same time while being involved in solo major works and other series concepts like ''Earth noise'' and ''Sound Science Series'' in the 70's and ''[[The Symphonic Poems]]'', ''Music for '' and ''Diary of an Earthling'' series in the 80's. Film and Video work were also becoming a very interesting avenue to combine visuals, poetry and as the music soundtrack that would define the visuals all done under the same roof. He continued his career by producing some influential and lush albums like ''Sound of Transformation – Symphonic Poem No.1'' (1982), ''Quantum Mechanics'' (1985), ''Music for Movies'' (1986), ''Codes'' (1987) and ''Musical Instincts of Nature''.

==Producing records and collaborating==
Since the very beginning of his career in the mid-70's, Buttigieg has been sought after for creative guidance, collaborating, producing and as the idea man. His string of credits include in Rebellion, Process and After Thought in the 80's, and in the 90's co-wrote songs and produced bands like Novi Mystici, Prosper Falls, Selfish like Magnets and Noise Button. In the last few years of the new millennium Buttigieg has written songs for other artists in the genres of [[popular music/pop song]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]] format and has gone aggressively into everything electronic whether it is [[electronica]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[new age]] or [[Electronic music|electronic]] producing and collaborating with bands like [[FTSG]], [[Dyr3]], [[System 6]], [[Desire becomes Being]] and [[Circa 2000 AD]] for [[Cykxincorp]] and [[Standing Stone Recording Company]] record labels part of [[Cykxincorp Group of Companies]].
