'''Ronald Frederick Delderfield''' (12 February 1912&nbsp;– 24 June 1972) was an English novelist and dramatist, some of whose works have been adapted for television and film.

==Biography==

===Childhood in London and Surrey===
Ronald Frederick Delderfield was born in [[Bermondsey]], London, in 1912 to Alice and William James Delderfield (c. 1873–1956). His father worked for a meat wholesaler in [[Smithfield Market]], and was the first [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal]] to be elected to Bermondsey Council. William supported [[women's suffrage]] and the Boer cause in the [[Boer War]]. He was a firm supporter of the [[temperance movement]], and of [[David Lloyd George]] until the latter allied himself in government with the Conservative Party. From 1918 to 1923, the family lived at 22 Ashburton Avenue, [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey. ''The Avenue'' novels were  based on Ronald's life in [[Addiscombe]] and [[Shirley, London|Shirley Park]].

Delderfield attended an [[infant school]] in Bermondsey, then a "seedy and pretentious" small private school — "seventy boys and four underpaid ushers, presided over by a jovial gentleman who wore blue serge".<ref name="autobiography">{{cite book|last1=Delderfield|first1=Ronald Frederick|title=For My Own Amusement|url=https://archive.org/details/formyownamusemen00deld|url-access=registration|date=1972|publisher=Simon & Schuster}}</ref>{{rp|18}} He then went to a council school, which he hated, but which provided him with the prototype for Mr. Short in ''The Avenue''. This experience was followed by a [[grammar school]] whose dedicated teachers inspired several of his characters.  Once the family moved to [[Devon]], Delderfield first attended a co-educational grammar school and, finally, [[West Buckland School]].  In his autobiography ''For My Own Amusement'', Delderfield joked that West Buckland could be likened to schools in ''The Spring Madness of Mr Sermon'', ''The Avenue'' and ''A Horseman Riding By'', and that it had earned its fees three times over.<ref name="autobiography" />{{rp|22}} Again, in ''For My Own Amusement'', Delderfield divided the nation into city and suburb dwellers, rural dwellers, and those who lived in coastal towns.

On a family holiday in [[Swanage]] when he was young, Delderfield caught [[scarlet fever]] and had to spend three months in an isolation hospital.

===Residence in East Devon===
In 1923, Delderfield's father and a neighbour in Bermondsey bought the ''Exmouth Chronicle'', a local newspaper in [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]], and William became the editor. In 1929, Delderfield joined the staff of the paper and later succeeded his father as editor. In ''For My Own Amusement'', he describes his work—attending Magistrates' Courts and Council meetings, covering amateur dramatics and other events, visiting the bereaved to write local obituaries, even cycling after the fire engine to see if there was a story, as well as relying on a large number of local correspondents.  His experiences during this period were clearly mirrored in the romantic novel ''Diana''. In 1926 he had a house, 'Dove Cottage' (now 'Gazebo'), built on [[Peak Hill, Devon|Peak Hill]] in [[Sidmouth]].

Delderfield's first published [[play (theatre)|play]] was produced at [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in 1936; the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' wrote "more please, Mr Delderfield".{{citequote|date=September 2011}} One of his plays, ''[[Worm's Eye View]]'', had a run at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in [[London]], and was filmed in 1951 with [[Diana Dors]]. Following service in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during World War II, he resumed his literary career, while also running an antiques business near [[Budleigh Salterton]], Devon. Having begun with drama, Delderfield decided to switch to writing novels in the 1950s. His first novel, ''Seven Men of Gascony'', a tale of French soldiers in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], was published in 1949 by [[Thomas Werner Laurie|Werner Laurie]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Delderfield|first=R.

===Autobiography===
In ''For My Own Amusement'' (1972), Delderfield discusses the inspiration for the storylines and tells in anecdotes the origin of several of his characters. He believed that authors draw inspiration from the scenes of their youth, pointing out that [[Charles Dickens]]' characters nearly always used the [[stagecoach]], when he was writing in the age of the train. Delderfield calls his sources "character farms", the main ones being his time in Addiscombe, schooldays, and his time at the ''Exmouth Chronicle''. Of ''The Avenue'' and ''A Horseman Riding By'' he said, "I set out to tell a straightforward story of a group of undistinguished British people—the only kind of people I really know." Delderfield pointed out in this autobiography that he had been criticized for his very conventional views of women's social roles.

===Death===
Delderfield died at his home in [[Sidmouth]], then called Dove Cottage, of lung cancer, survived by his widow, the former May Evans, whom he married in 1936. They had a son and a daughter.<ref>R. F.

==Early 20th century social history as a subject of his writing==
Several of Delderfield's historical novels and series involve young men who return from war and take up careers in peacetime that allow the author to delve deeply into social history from the Edwardian era to the early 1960s.

=== Examples ===
* David Powlett-Jones of ''[[To Serve Them All My Days]]'' is from a Welsh working-class background and begins his teaching of history at a rural [[Public school (UK)|public school]] shortly after being released from a shell-shock ward in 1918. That novel examines the changes in private education and the development of the [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour]] political movement between the world wars.
* Adam Swann of the ''God is an Englishman'' series is a veteran of the British Army in India who forms a transport business in the mid-19th century. The series explores the economic history of the United Kingdom from the 1860s to the outbreak of the First World War.
* In the ''[[A Horseman Riding By]]'' trilogy, Paul Craddock, also an ex-soldier, becomes a rural landlord in Delderfield's own Devon in the early 20th century.
* The two-volume work ''The Avenue'', which follows the residents of a middle-class suburban road over a few decades, begins shortly after the end of World War I with the return of one resident, who finds that his wife has died in the [[Spanish flu]] epidemic and left him with several children to care for.

== Other works ==
Delderfield also published non-fiction books on Napoleonic history, historical novels involving the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and some isolated novels set in more contemporary periods.  His [[prose]] style tends to be straightforward and readable, lacking in any influence from post-modernist fiction, and his social attitudes are fairly traditional, though his politics, as expressed via his characters, are a mixture of [[progressivism|progressive]] and free market. In general, Delderfield's novels celebrate English history, humanity, and [[liberalism]] while demonstrating little patience with entrenched class differences and snobbery yet also sometimes advocating individualism, self-reliance, and other traditional Victorian values.

Delderfield wrote ''[[The Adventures of Ben Gunn]]'' (1956) which follows [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]] from [[sexton (office)|sexton]]'s son to pirate and is narrated by [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] in Gunn's words. It describes the life of Ben Gunn from the events which led him to leave Devon, and eventually to his presence on Treasure Island and involvement in the story told by Stevenson, and follows up with a brief summary of Ben Gunn's life afterwards.
