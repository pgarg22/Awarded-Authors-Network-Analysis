==Poetry==
Many of Strand's poems are [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] in tone, evoking the bays, fields, boats, and pines of his Prince Edward Island childhood. He has been compared to [[Robert Bly]] in his use of [[surrealism]], though he attributes his poems' surreal elements to an admiration of the works of [[Max Ernst]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], and [[René Magritte]].<ref name= perkins>{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=George|last2=Perkins|first2=Barbara|title=Contemporary American Literature|date=1988|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780075549543|page=953}}</ref> Strand's poems use plain and concrete language, usually without rhyme or meter. In a 1971 interview, he said, "I feel very much a part of a new international style that has a lot to do with plainness of diction, a certain reliance on surrealist techniques, and a strong narrative element."<ref name= perkins/>
