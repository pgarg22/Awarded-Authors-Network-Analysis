'''Subramania Bharathi''' (11 December 1882 – 11 September 1921), was a [[Tamils|Tamil]] writer, poet, journalist, [[Indian independence activist]], social reformer and [[polyglot]]. Popularly known as "Mahakavi Bharathi" ("Great Poet Bharathi"), he was a pioneer of modern Tamil poetry and is considered one of the greatest Tamil literary figures of all time. His numerous works included fiery songs kindling patriotism during the [[Indian Independence movement]].<ref name="Natarajan"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Congress Veteran reenacts Bharathis escape to Pondy|work=[[The Times of India]]|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chennai/Congress-veteran-re-enacts-Bharatis-escape-to-Pondy/amp_articleshow/53879675.cms}}</ref> He fought for the [[emancipation of women]], against [[child marriage]], stood for reforming [[Brahminism]] and religion. He was also in solidarity with [[Dalit|Dalits]] and [[Muslims]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Knowing Subramania Bharati beyond his turban colour|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/knowing-subramania-bharati-beyond-his-turban-colour/cid/1691909|access-date=2020-12-11|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Raman|first=Aroon|date=2009-12-21|title=All too human at the core|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/All-too-human-at-the-core/article16854491.ece|access-date=2020-12-11|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

Born in [[Ettayapuram]] of [[Tirunelveli district]] (present-day [[Thoothukudi district|Thoothukudi]]) in 1882, Bharathi had his early education in [[Tirunelveli]] and [[Varanasi]] and worked as a journalist with many newspapers, including [[The Hindu]], Bala Bharata, Vijaya, Chakravarthini, the ''Swadesamitran'' and ''India''. In 1908, an arrest warrant was issued against Bharathi by the government of [[British Raj|British India]] caused him to move to Pondicherry where he lived until 1918.<ref>{{Cite news|title=On the streets where Bharati walked|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/on-the-streets-where-bharati-walked/article5455980.ece}}</ref>

His influence on Tamil literature is phenomenal. Although it is said that he was proficient in around 14, including 3 non-Indian foreign languages. His favorite language was Tamil. He was prolific in his output. He covered political, social and spiritual themes. The songs and poems composed by Bharathi are very often used in [[Tamil cinema]] and have become staples in the literary and musical repertoire of Tamil artistes throughout the world. He paved the way for modern [[blank verse]]. He wrote many books and poems on how Tamil is beautiful in nature.

==Biography==
[[File:Subramanya Bharathi with his wife Chellamma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Photograph of Subramanya Bharathi with wife Chellamma]]
[[File:Bharathiyar House Room.jpg|thumb|Bharathiyar House in Puducherry]]
Bharathi was born on 11 December 1882 in the village of [[Ettayapuram]], to Chinnaswami Subramania [[Iyer]] and Lakshmi Ammal. Subramania, as he was named, went to the M.D.T. Hindu College in [[Tirunelveli]]. From a very young age, he was musically and poetically inclined.  Bharathi lost his mother at the age of five and was brought up by his father who wanted him to learn English, excel in arithmetic, and become an engineer.<ref name="Univ125"/><ref name="life"/> A proficient linguist, he was well-versed in Sanskrit, Hindi, Telugu, English, French and had a smattering of Arabic. Around the age of 11, he was conferred the title of "Bharathi", the one blessed by [[Saraswati]], the goddess of learning by the Raja of Ettayapuram seeing his excellence in poetry. He lost his father at the age of sixteen,  but before that when he was 15, he married Chellamma who was seven years old.

During his stay in [[Benaras|Varanasi]], Bharathi was exposed to [[Hinduism|Hindu spirituality]] and nationalism. This broadened his outlook and he learned Sanskrit, Hindi and English. In addition, he changed his outward appearance. He also grew a beard and wore a turban due to his admiration of Sikhs, influenced by his Sikh friend. Though he passed an entrance exam for a job, he returned to Ettayapuram during 1901 and started as the court poet of Raja of Ettayapuram for a couple of years. He was a Tamil teacher from August to November 1904 in Sethupathy High School in Madurai.<ref name="life"/> During this period, Bharathi understood the need to be well-informed of the world outside and took interest in the world of journalism and the print media of the West. Bharathi joined as Assistant Editor of the ''[[Swadesamitran]]'', a Tamil daily in 1904. In December 1905, he attended the All India Congress session held in Benaras. On his journey back home, he met [[Sister Nivedita]], Swami [[Vivekananda]]'s spiritual heir. She inspired Bharathi to recognise the privileges of women and the emancipation of women exercised Bharathi's mind. He visualised the new woman as an emanation of Shakti, a willing helpmate of man to build a new earth through co-operative endeavour. Among other greats such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, he considered Nivedita his [[Guru]], and penned verses in her praise. He attended the Indian National Congress session in Calcutta under Dadabhai Naoiroji, which demanded [[Swaraj]] and boycott of British goods.<ref name="life"/>

By April 1906, he started editing the Tamil weekly ''India'' and the English newspaper ''Bala Bharatham'' with [[M.P.T. Acharya]]. These newspapers were also a means of expressing Bharathi's creativity, which began to peak during this period. Bharathi started to publish his poems regularly in these editions. From hymns to nationalistic writings, from contemplations on the relationship between God and Man to songs on the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian]] and [[French revolution|French]] revolutions, Bharathi's subjects were diverse.<ref name="Univ125"/>

Bharathi participated in the historic Surat Congress in 1907 along with [[V.O. Chidambaram Pillai]] and Mandayam Srinivachariar, which deepened the divisions within the [[Indian National Congress]] with a section preferring armed resistance, primarily led by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] over moderate approach preferred by certain other sections. Bharathi supported Tilak with [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]] and Kanchi Varathachariyar. Tilak openly supported armed resistance against the British.<ref name="life"/>

In 1908, the British instituted a case against V.O. Chidambaram Pillai. In the same year, the proprietor of the journal ''India'' was arrested in [[Madras]]. Faced with the prospect of arrest, Bharathi escaped to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], which was under French rule.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bharati's Tamil daily Vijaya traced in Paris|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/12/05/stories/2004120500201100.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121180131/http://www.thehindu.com/2004/12/05/stories/2004120500201100.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 November 2016|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 December 2004}}</ref> From there he edited and published the weekly journal ''India'', ''Vijaya'', a Tamil daily, ''Bala Bharatham'', an English monthly, and ''Suryodayam'', a local weekly in Pondicherry. The British tried to suppress Bharathi's output by stopping remittances and letters to the papers. Both ''India'' and ''Vijaya'' were banned in India in 1909.<ref name="life"/>

During his exile, Bharathi had the opportunity to meet many other leaders of the revolutionary wing of the Independence movement like [[Aurobindo]], [[Lajpat Rai]] and V.V.S. Aiyar, who had also sought asylum under the French. Bharathi assisted Aurobindo in the ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]'' journal and later ''Karma Yogi'' in Pondicherry.<ref name="Univ125"/> This was also the period when he started learning Vedic literature. Three of his greatest works namely, ''Kuyil Pattu'', ''Panchali Sapatham'' and ''Kannan Pattu'' were composed during 1912. He also translated Vedic hymns, Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutra'' and ''[[Bhagavat Gita]]'' to Tamil.<ref name="life"/> Bharathi entered India near [[Cuddalore]] in November 1918 and was promptly arrested. He was imprisoned in the Central prison in Cuddalore in custody for three weeks from 20 November to 14 December and was released after the intervention of [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar]]. He was stricken by poverty during this period, resulting in his ill health. The following year, 1919, Bharathi met [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. He resumed editing ''Swadesimeitran'' from 1920 in [[Madras]] (modern-day [[Chennai]]).<ref name="Lal"/>

==Death==
He was badly affected by the imprisonments and by 1920, when a General Amnesty Order finally removed restrictions on his movements, Bharathi was already struggling. He was struck by an elephant named Lavanya at [[Parthasarathy temple]], [[Triplicane]], [[Chennai]], whom he used to feed regularly. When he fed a  coconut to Lavanya (the elephant), the elephant got fired up and attacked Bharathi. Although he survived the incident, his health deteriorated a few months later and he died early morning on 12 September 1921 at around 1 am. Though Bharathi was considered a people's poet, a great nationalist, outstanding freedom fighter and social visionary, it was recorded that there were only 14 people to attend his funeral. He delivered his last speech at Karungalpalayam Library in Erode, which was about the topic ''Man is Immortal''.<ref name="Last Speech at Erode">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/15/stories/2008041554140500.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415224901/http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/15/stories/2008041554140500.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 April 2008|title= Last speech delivered in Erode|date=15 April 2008|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=20 December 2013}}</ref> The last years of his life were spent in a house in [[Triplicane|Triplicane, Chennai]].

Bharathi is considered one of the pioneers of modern Tamil literature.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Changing society and modern Tamil literature|journal=Tamil Issue|jstor=40874190 |volume=4|issue=3/4|pages=21–36|year=1968|last1=Annamalai|first1=E.}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> Bharathi used simple words and rhythms, unlike his previous century works in Tamil, which had complex vocabulary. He also employed novel ideas and techniques in his devotional poems.<ref name="Natarajan"/> He used a metre called ''Nondi Chindu'' in most of his works, which was earlier used by Gopalakrisnha Bharathiar.<ref name=Sahitya/>

Bharathi's poetry expressed a progressive, reformist ideal. His imagery and the vigour of his verse were a forerunner to modern Tamil poetry in different aspects. He was the forerunner of a forceful kind of poetry that combined classical and contemporary elements. He had a prodigious output penning thousands of verses on diverse topics like Indian Nationalism, love songs, children's songs, songs of nature, glory of the [[Tamil language]], and odes to prominent freedom fighters of India like [[Tilak]], [[Gandhi]] and [[Lajpat Rai]]. He even penned an ode to New Russia and [[Belgium]]. His poetry not only includes works on Hindu deities like Shakti, Kali, Vinayagar, Murugan, Sivan, Kannan(Krishna), but also on other religious gods like [[Allah]] and Jesus. His insightful similes have been read by millions of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] readers. He was well-versed in various languages and translated speeches of Indian National reform leaders like [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name="Lal"/>

He describes the dance of Shakthi (in Oozhi koothu, Dance of destiny) in the following lines:

It is the opinion of some litterateurs that Bharathiar's ''Panchali Sapatham,'' based on the story of Panchali ([[Draupadi]]), is also an ode to [[Bharat Mata]]. That the [[Pandava]]ss are the Indians, the [[Kaurava]]s the British and the [[Kurukshetra]] war of [[Mahabharat]] that of the Indian freedom struggle. It certainly is ascribed to the rise of womanhood in society.<ref name="Univ125"/><ref name="life"/>

He is known to have said, "Even if Indians are divided, they are children of one Mother, where is the need for foreigners to interfere?" In the period 1910–1920, he wrote about a new and free India where there are no castes. He talks of building up India's defense, her ships sailing the high seas, success in manufacturing and universal education.  He calls for sharing amongst states with wonderful imagery like the diversion of excess water of the [[Bengal]] delta to needy regions and a bridge to [[Sri Lanka]].

Bharathi also wanted to abolish starvation. He sang, "''Thani oru manithanakku unavu illayenil intha jagaththinai azhithiduvom"''  translated as " If one single man suffers from starvation, we will destroy the entire world".

Some of his poems are translated by [[Jayanthasri Balakrishnan]] in English in her blog, though not published.<ref>{{cite web|title= Jayanthasri translations|url=https://mythreyid.academia.edu/JayanthasriBalakrishnan|access-date=20 April 2017|publisher=mythreyid.academia.edu}}</ref>

Even though he has strong opinions about Gods, he is also against false stories spread in epics and other part of social fabric in Tamil Nadu.

In Kuyil paattu (Song of Nightingale) [http://www.lakshmansruthi.com/tamilbooks/bharathiar/bharathi-IV-III10.asp ('''குயில் பாட்டு)''']  he writes.'''.'''

==Bharathi on caste system==
Bharathi also fought against the [[caste system]] in Hindu society. Bharathi was born in an orthodox [[Brahmin]] family, but he considered all living beings to be equal, and to illustrate this he performed the ''[[upanayanam]]'' for a young [[Dalit]] man and made him a [[Brahmin]]. He also scorned the divisive tendencies being imparted into the younger generations by their elderly tutors during his time. He openly criticised the preachers for mixing their individual thoughts while teaching the [[Vedas]], Upanishads and the [[Gita]]. He strongly advocated bringing the [[Dalits]] to the Hindu mainstream.

Here he expresses the love between human beings, where a man should not see their caste. They should see them as human beings. Not only human beings, they should see them as their brothers and sisters. This means that a well-educated person knows to treat them equally and not by their caste.
