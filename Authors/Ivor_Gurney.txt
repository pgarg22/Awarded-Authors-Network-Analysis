'''Ivor Bertie Gurney''' (28 August 1890 – 26 December 1937) was an English poet and [[composer]], particularly of songs. He was born and raised in [[Gloucester]]. He suffered from [[bipolar disorder|manic depression]] through much of his life and spent his last 15 years in psychiatric hospitals. Critical evaluation of Gurney has been complicated by this, and also by the need to assess both his poetry and his music.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/734854 Banfield, Stephen. Review of ''The Ordeal of Ivor Gurney'' by Michael Hurd, in ''Music and Letters'' Vol 60, No 3, pp. 339-341]</ref> Gurney himself thought of music as his true vocation: "The brighter visions brought music; the fainter verse".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/738157 Gurney, Ivor. 'The Springs of Music', in ''Musical Quarterly'' Vol 8 No 3, July 1922, pp. 319-322]</ref>

==Life==
Ivor Gurney was born at 3 Queen Street, [[Gloucester]], in 1890, as the second of four surviving children of David Gurney, a tailor, and his wife Florence, a seamstress.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/gloucestershire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8350000/8350379.stm |title=Gloucester composer fought in WWI |access-date=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207092316/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/gloucestershire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8350000/8350379.stm |archive-date=7 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

He showed musical ability at an early age. He sang as a chorister at [[Gloucester Cathedral]] from 1900 to 1906, when he became an articled pupil of [[Herbert Brewer|Dr Herbert Brewer]] at the cathedral. There he met a fellow composer, [[Herbert Howells]], who became a lifelong friend. Alongside Gurney and Howells, Brewer's third pupil at this time was [[Ivor Novello]], then known as Ivor Davies. He also enjoyed an enduring friendship with the poet [[F. W. Harvey]], whom he met in 1908.

The adults of most significance in Gurney's early life were the Rev. Alfred H. Cheesman, and two sisters, Emily and Margaret Hunt, who nurtured Gurney's interests in music and literature. Gurney began composing music at the age of 14,<ref>Marion Scott Notes, Royal College of Music Library, no date.</ref> and won a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1911. He studied there with [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], who also taught [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]], [[Marion Scott (musicologist)|Marion Scott]], [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]], [[Frank Bridge]], [[Arthur Bliss]], [[Herbert Howells]] and many others. Stanford told Howells that Gurney was potentially "the biggest of them all", but he was "unteachable".<ref>Charles Villiers Stanford quoted by Herbert Howells in "Ivor Gurney: The Musician", ''Music and Letters'', vol. 19/1, January 1938, p. 14.</ref>

Gurney possessed a dynamic personality, but he had been troubled by [[mood swing]]s that became apparent during his teenage years. He had a difficult time focusing on his work at college and suffered his first [[Mental breakdown|breakdown]] in 1913.<ref name="ReferenceA">Pamela Blevins, "Ivor Gurney and Marion Scott: Song of Pain and Beauty".</ref> After taking a rest, he seemed to recover and returned to college.

Gurney's studies were interrupted by [[World War I]], when he enlisted as a private soldier in the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] in February 1915. At the front, he began writing poetry seriously, sending his efforts to his friend, the musicologist and critic Marion Scott, who worked with Gurney as his editor and business manager. He was in the midst of writing the poems for what would become his first book, ''Severn and Somme'', when he was wounded in the shoulder in April 1917. He recovered and returned to battle, still working on his book and composing music, including the songs "In Flanders" and "By A Bierside". [[Sidgwick & Jackson]] accepted ''Severn and Somme'' in July, with publication set for the autumn. In the meantime, Gurney was [[Use of poison gas in World War I|gassed]] in September the same year and sent to the [[Bangour Village Hospital|Edinburgh War Hospital]], where he met and fell in love with a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|VAD]] nurse, Annie Nelson Drummond, but the relationship later broke down. 

There remains some controversy about the possible effects of the gas on his mental health, even though Gurney had clearly shown signs and symptoms of a [[bipolar disorder]] since his teens.<ref name=Blevins>Blevins, Pamela, "New Perspectives on Ivor Gurney's Illness, The Ivor Gurney Society Journal, vol. 6, 2000, pp. 29–58; Blevins, Pamela, Ivor Gurney and Marion Scott: Song of Pain and Beauty, The Boydell Press, 2008.</ref> "Being gassed (mildly) [his parenthesis] with the new gas is no worse than catarrh or a bad cold," Gurney wrote in a letter to Marion Scott on 17 September 1917. After his release from hospital, he was posted to [[Seaton Delaval]], a mining village in [[Northumberland]], where he wrote poems, including "Lying Awake in the Ward". His volume ''Severn and Somme'' was published in November 1917.

In March 1918, Gurney suffered a serious breakdown, triggered at least in part by the sudden breakdown of his relationship with Drummond.<ref name=Blevins /><ref>[[Ethel Voynich]] letter to Marion Scott, March 1938, The Gurney Archive, Gloucester, England</ref> He was hospitalised in the Gallery Ward at [[Brancepeth Castle]], County Durham, where he wrote several songs, despite the piano sounding, he said, like "a boiler factory in full swing because of the stone walls".<ref>Ivor Gurney to Marion Scott, 12 March 1918, ''Collected Letters'', p. 410.</ref> In June he threatened suicide, but he did not attempt it.

Gurney slowly regained some of his emotional stability and in October was honourably discharged from the army. Gurney received an unconventional diagnosis of nervous breakdown from "deferred" [[shell shock]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The notion that Gurney's instability should primarily be attributed to "shell shock" was perpetuated by Marion Scott, who used this term in the initial press releases after Gurney's death, as well as in his entry for ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''.

Gurney seemed to thrive after the war and was regarded as one of the most promising men of his generation, but his mental distress continued to worsen.<ref name=Blevins /> He studied for a brief time with [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] upon returning to the Royal College of Music, but he withdrew from the college before completing his studies. His second volume of poetry, ''War's Embers'', appeared in May 1919 to mixed reviews. He continued to compose, producing a large number of songs, instrumental pieces, chamber music, and two works for orchestra: ''War Elegy'' (1920) and ''A Gloucestershire Rhapsody'' (1919–1921). His music was being performed and published. However, by 1922, his condition had deteriorated to the point where his family had him [[Involuntary commitment|declared insane]].

It has been speculated that Gurney's mental problems may have resulted from [[syphilis]], contracted either while he was a music student before the war, or perhaps while serving as a soldier in France. Blevins, Gurney's biographer, however, concludes that he did not suffer from syphilis. The issue has also been discussed, more recently, by Cambridge academic and broadcaster Kate Kennedy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classRev/2002/Jun02/Gurney_syphilis.htm |title=Ivor Gurney and the Question of Syphilis MusicWeb(UK) |publisher=Musicweb-international.com |access-date=27 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324161549/http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Jun02/Gurney_syphilis.htm |archive-date=24 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Gurney spent the last 15 years of his life in [[psychiatric hospital]]s, first for a short period at [[Barnwood House Hospital|Barnwood House]] in Gloucester, and then at the [[Stone House Hospital|City of London Mental Hospital]], [[Dartford]], where he was diagnosed as suffering from "delusional insanity (systematised)".<ref>Gurney's medical records, Gurney Archive and M. Hurd, 1970, ''The Ordeal of Ivor Gurney'', Oxford.</ref> Gurney wrote prolifically during the asylum years, producing some eight collections of verse. His output included two plays in [[Shakespeare]]an style – "Gloucester Play (1926) and "The Tewkesbury Trial" (1926).<ref>[http://ivorgurney.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Plays.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714173434/http://www.ivorgurney.org.uk/catalogue/Plays.pdf |date=14 July 2014}}</ref> During this time he appeared to believe himself to be [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in person. He continued also to compose music but to a far lesser degree. An examination of his archive suggests that up to two-thirds of his musical output remains unpublished and unrecorded.<ref name=bbc/>

By the 1930s Gurney wrote little of anything, although he was described by Scott as being "so sane in his insanity".

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Ivor gurney grave.jpg|thumb|125px|right|The grave of Ivor Gurney at [[Twigworth]], Gloucestershire]]
[[File:The Candle, Gloucester Docks (geograph 2657961).jpg|thumb|125px|The Candle, Gloucester Docks (2011)]]
Gurney died of [[tuberculosis]] while still a patient at the City of London Mental Hospital, shortly before dawn on 26 December 1937, aged 47. He was buried in [[Twigworth]], near Gloucester. The service was conducted by his godfather, Rev. Alfred Cheesman. Gurney was "a lover and maker of beauty", it was stated on his gravestone. (The stone was replaced after it was damaged – the original is now stored inside Twigworth church.) Marion Scott preserved Gurney's manuscripts and letters and worked with composer [[Gerald Finzi]] to ensure that his legacy should not be forgotten.

On 11 November 1985, Gurney was among 16 [[War poet|Great War Poets]] commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poet's Corner]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/poets-of-the-first-world-war |title=Westminster Abbey, Poets' Corner |access-date=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911115547/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/poets-of-the-first-world-war |archive-date=11 September 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The inscription on the stone was written by a fellow Great War poet, [[Wilfred Owen]]: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."

In 2000, a [[Stained glass window|stained-glass window]] was installed in [[St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester]] and dedicated to the memory of Ivor Gurney.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of St Mary de Lode Church |url=http://www.swithunandmary.org.uk/History%20of%20St%20Mary%20de%20Lode.pdf |website=Parish of Hempsted with St Mary de Lode and St Mary de Crypt |publisher=Church of England |access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref> A memorial to Gurney was erected in 2009 [[Sint-Juliaan]], near [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], close to the spot where he was the victim of a [[mustard gas]] attack in 1917.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/2011/11/11/when-christ-lay-dying-on-the-battlefield/ |title="When Christ lay dying on the battlefield" ''Catholic Herald'' 2011/11/11/ |access-date=18 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116085738/http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/2011/11/11/when-christ-lay-dying-on-the-battlefield/ |archive-date=16 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Memorial Ivor Gurney - Sint-Juliaan - TracesOfWar.com |url=https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/51760/Memorial-Ivor-Gurney.htm |website=tracesofwar.com |access-date=25 September 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925142130/https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/51760/Memorial-Ivor-Gurney.htm |archive-date=25 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2014, [[BBC Four]] broadcast a documentary about Gurney, entitled ''The Poet Who Loved the War'', presented by [[Tim Kendall]], which focused on how the First World War had in some ways helped Gurney through the periods of depression he suffered and helped him become one of the war's foremost poets.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10730451/The-Poet-Who-Loved-the-War-BBC-Four-review.html "The Poet who Loved the War, BBC Four, review", ''The Telegraph'', 30 March 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222142536/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10730451/The-Poet-Who-Loved-the-War-BBC-Four-review.html |date=22 December 2016 }}.

In June and July 2014 Gurney was the subject of [[BBC Radio 3]]'s ''Composer of the Week'', based on Dr Kate Kennedy's biography, ''Ivor Gurney: Dweller in Shadows'', as part of the station's Music in the Great War series.

==Works==
===Compositions===
[[File:Gurney Ludlow and Teme.jpg|thumb|Cover of a 1923 edition of Gurney's song cycle ''Ludlow and Teme'']]
Gurney wrote hundreds of poems and more than 300 songs but only set a handful of his own poems to music, the best-known being "Severn Meadows". His well-known compositions include his ''Five Elizabethan Songs'' (or 'The Elizas' as he called them), written in 1913-14 while he was still a student at the Royal College of Music. The song cycles ''Ludlow and Teme'' (published 1923) and ''The Western Playland'', (published 1926), both settings of poetry by [[A. E. Housman]], were prepared for publication with the help of admirers and friends, including Gerald Finzi and his wife [[Joy Finzi|Joy]], [[Howard Ferguson (composer)|Howard Ferguson]] and Marion Scott.<ref>Chauvin, Ridley (2015). [https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3468&context=gradschool_dissertations ''A Performer's Guide to Ivor Gurney's The Western Playland'']</ref> Oxford University Press issued two sets of ten songs in 1938, a year after his death, selected and edited by Finzi and Ferguson. Three further sets of ten songs came out in 1952, 1959 and 1979.

Gurney set to music many of the poems of his contemporaries, including at least nineteen poems written by [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], six of them collected in the orchestral song cycle ''Lights Out'' published in 1926, and at least seven by [[W. H. Davies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_settings.html?ComposerId=1090 |title=Composer: Ivor (Bertie) Gurney (1890–1937) |publisher=recmusic.org |access-date=16 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707165850/http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_settings.html?ComposerId=1090 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> All of Gurney's settings from the Canadian poet [[Bliss Carman]]'s ''[[Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics]]'' (1904) were gathered together in a new collection, ''Seven Sappho Songs'' by Richard Carder in 1998.<ref>Songfacts</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Catalogue of the Ivor Gurney Archive |url=https://ivorgurney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IBG_Essays.pdf |publisher=Gloucestershire Archives |access-date=27 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027084311/https://ivorgurney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IBG_Essays.pdf |archive-date=27 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

It has been suggested that there is something of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], but considerably less of the prevailing folk idiom of the time, in the intensity of Gurney's musical language. He had a preference for setting dark ballads, as Schubert, [[Carl Loewe|Loewe]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] had before him, and "knew his Brahms and Schumann backwards, as his piano pieces testify".<ref>Dunnett, Roderic. [https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.572151&catNum=572151&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English Notes to Naxos CD 8.572151] (2009)</ref> But where he does lean towards folksong, as in his setting of [[Hilaire Belloc|Belloc]]'s "Ha’nacker Mill", it is often hard to tell whether the melody is original or traditional.<ref>[https://www.musicdurham.co.uk/blog/ivor-gurney Shuttleworth, Jane. 'Ivor Gurney', ''Music in Durham'']</ref>

His ''Five Preludes'' for piano were written in 1919-20 and published the following year. He also wrote as many as 20 string quartets, although most of these are lost. The String Quartet in D minor, composed in 1924, received its premiere recording in 2020.<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2020/Jun/Blue_hills_EMRCD065.htm ''Those Blue Remembered Hills''.

===War poet/local poet===
[[Edmund Blunden]], at the urging of Gerald Finzi, assembled the first collection of Gurney's poetry which was published in 1954. This was followed by [[P. J. Kavanagh]]'s ''Collected Poems'', first published in 1982 and reissued in 2004. It remains the most comprehensive edition of Gurney's poetry. Gurney is regarded as one of the great [[:Category:World War I poets|World War I poets]], and like others of them, such as [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], whom he admired, he often contrasted the horrors of the front line with the beauty and tranquillity of his native English landscape – these themes were explored in the 2012 musical play ''[[A Soldier and a Maker]]''.

Deliberately unrhetorical in his poetic tone,<ref>I. Ousby, ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (CUP 1996) p. 399.</ref> and writing as a ranker, not an officer,<ref>P. J. Kavanagh, ed., ''Collected Poems of Ivor Gurney'' (OUP 1982) p. 12.</ref> Gurney offered a complex, wry, unheroic view of the soldierly world of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]:<ref>J. Lucas, ''Modern English Poetry'' (London 1986) p. 96.</ref> presenting not a large statement (for or against war), but an individual experience.<ref>P. J. Kavanagh, ed., ''Collected Poems of Ivor Gurney'' (OUP 1982) Introduction pp. 2 and 12.</ref> Without diminishing the horrors of the front line, Gurney's poems often emphasise the moments of relief. "On Rest" was above all what he called "the relief of knowing mere being".<ref>P. J. Kavanagh, ed., ''Collected Poems of Ivor Gurney'' (OUP 1982) p. 73.</ref> By detailing the "small trifles" of trench life<ref>T. Kendall, ''Modern English War Poets'' (OUP 2006) p. 96–98.</ref> – moments of comradeship, letters from home, singsongs, bread and [[Fray Bentos (food brand)|Fray Bentos]] corned beef, wine, chocolate and café-au-lait<ref>P. J. Kavanagh, ed., ''Collected Poems of Ivor Gurney'' (OUP 1982) p. 77–78 ("Laventie").</ref> Gurney was able (in Blunden's words) to "express part of the Western Front secret... with distinctive, intimate and imaginative quickness."<ref>Quoted in P. J. Kavanagh, ed., ''Collected Poems of Ivor Gurney'' (OUP 1982) p. 11.</ref> In so far as he had a "manifesto", it was to present "the protest of the physical against the exalted spiritual; of the cumulative weight of small facts against the one large".<ref>Quoted in J. Stallworthy and J. Potter, eds., ''Three Poets of the First World War'' (Penguin 2011) p. 118.</ref>

At the same time, Gurney was something of a local poet, rooted in [[Gloucester]] and its surroundings, which remained a touchstone of reality for him, in the front line and later in the asylum.<ref>J. Lucas, ''Modern English Poetry'' (London 1986) p. 93.</ref> In the preface to his first book, he wrote of "my county, Gloucester, that whether I live or die stays always with me."<ref>Quoted in P. J. Kavanagh ed., ''Collected Poems of Ivor Gurney'' (OUP 1982) p. 13</ref> His tribute poem "Crickley Hill" was described by [[Edna Longley]] as "perhaps Gurney's most rapturous expression of local patriotism".<ref>Quoted in J. Stallworthy and J. Potter, eds., ''Three Poets of the First World War'' (Penguin 2011) p. 121.</ref>
