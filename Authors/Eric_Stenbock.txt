[[File:Eric Stenbock.jpg|thumb|Eric Stenbock, writer of [[decadent]] and [[macabre]] fiction and poetry]]
Count '''Eric Stanislaus''' (or '''Stanislaus Eric''') '''Stenbock''' ({{osd|12 March|1860|29 February}} at [[Thirlestaine Hall]] ([[Cheltenham]]) – {{osd|26 April|1895|14 April}} at Withdeane Hall in [[Brighton]]) was a [[Baltic region|Baltic]] [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[poet]] and writer of macabre fantastic fiction.

==Life==
Stenbock was the count of [[Bogesund]] and the heir to an estate near [[Kolga]] in [[Estonia]].  He was the son of Lucy Sophia Frerichs, the daughter and heiress of [[Johann Andreas Frerichs]], a [[Manchester]] cotton tycoon, and Count Erich Stenbock, of a distinguished Swedish noble family of the Baltic German House of nobility in Reval. The family rose to prominence in the service of King [[Gustav Vasa]]: [[Catherine Stenbock]] was the third and last consort of Gustav Vasa and [[Queen consort]] of [[Sweden]] between 1552 and 1560. Stenbock's great-grandfather was Baron [[Friedrich von Stuart]] (1761–1842) from Courland. [[Immanuel Kant]] was a great-great-granduncle of Stenbock.{{CN|date=November 2021}}

Stenbock's father died suddenly while he was one year old; his properties were held in trust for him by his grandfather Magnus. Eric's maternal grandfather died while Eric was quite young, also, in 1866, leaving him another trust fund.

Stenbock attended [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] in [[Oxford]] but never completed his studies.  While at Oxford, Eric was deeply influenced by the homosexual [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artist and illustrator [[Simeon Solomon]]. He is also said to have had a relationship with the composer and conductor [[Norman O'Neill]] and with other "young men".<ref name="bloodread">{{citation |title=Blood Read: The Vampire As Metaphor in Contemporary Culture |first=Joan |last=Gordon |first2=Veronica |last2=Hollinger |year=1997 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-1628-8 |page=177}}</ref>

In Oxford, Stenbock also converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] taking for himself the name Stanislaus. Some years later Eric also admitted to having tried a different religion every week in Oxford. At the end of his life, he seemed to have developed a [[syncretism|syncretist religion]] containing elements of Catholicism, [[Buddhism]] and [[idolatry]].

In 1885, Count Magnus died, upon which Stenbock, as the oldest living male relative, acceded to the status of [[Count]] and to the possession of the family's estates in Estonia.  Eric traveled to and lived in Kolga for a year and a half; he returned to England in the summer of 1887, during which time he sank deeper into [[alcoholism]] and [[drug addiction]].{{CN|date=November 2021}}

Stenbock behaved eccentrically.  He kept snakes, lizards, salamanders and toads in his room, and had a "zoo" in his garden containing a reindeer, a fox, and a bear. When he traveled, he invariably brought with him a dog, a monkey, and a life-sized doll.  This doll he referred to as "le Petit Comte" ("the little Count") and told everyone that it was his son; he insisted it be brought to him daily, and—when it was absent—he asked about its health. (Stenbock's family believed an unscrupulous Jesuit had been given large amounts of money by the Count for the "education" of this doll.)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stenbock|first=Stanislaus Eric, Count|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978571456|title=Of kings and things : strange tales and decadent poems|date=2018|others=David Tibet, Timothy D'Arch Smith|isbn=978-1-907222-57-3|location=London, UK|oclc=978571456}}</ref>

==Work==
Stenbock lived in England most of his life, and wrote his works in the [[English language]].  He published a number of books of verse during his lifetime, including ''Love, Sleep, and Dreams'', 1881, and ''Rue, Myrtle, and Cypress'' (1883).  In 1894, Stenbock published ''The Shadow of Death'', his last volume of verse, and ''Studies of Death'', a collection of short stories.{{CN|date=November 2021}}

==Death==
On 26 April 1895 Stenbock died from cirrhosis of the liver at his mother's home, Withdeane Hall, near Brighton; his death went unnoticed in the press, aside from a brief mention in ''The Times'' (30 April 1895). Stenbock had named [[More Adey]] as his literary executor. On 1 May the burial service was held in the [[Cemeteries and crematoria in Brighton and Hove#Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery|Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery]].{{CN|date=November 2021}}

==Legacy==
The band [[Current 93]] made an album of the same name of [[incidental music]] inspired by Stenbock's ''[[Faust]]'' story. Stenbock's legacy is supported by the invitation-only Stenbock Society, notable like Stenbock himself for its infrequent activity.

[[Marc Almond]] and [[Michael Cashmore]] released the two-track CD ''Gabriel & The Lunatic Lover'' in 2008 with two songs based on Stenbock's poems by the same name. This was followed in 2011 by the album ''[[Feasting with Panthers]]'' which included two more adaptations, "Sonnet XI" and "The Song of the Unwept Tear". All four poems were adapted and translated by [[Jeremy Reed (writer)|Jeremy Reed]].

[[Strange Attractor Press]] published a collection of Stenbock's short stories, poems, and essays, ''Of Kings and Things''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stenbock|first=Stanislaus Eric, Count|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978571456|title=Of kings and things : strange tales and decadent poems|date=2018|others=David Tibet, Timothy D'Arch Smith|isbn=978-1-907222-57-3|location=London, UK|oclc=978571456}}</ref> in 2019
