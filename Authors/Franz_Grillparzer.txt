'''Franz Seraphicus Grillparzer''' (15 January 1791 – 21 January 1872) was an [[Austria]]n [[writer]] who was considered to be the leading Austrian [[dramatist]] of the 19th century. His plays were and are frequently performed at the famous [[Burgtheater]] in [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boydellandbrewer.com/franz-grillparzer-hb.html?___store=boydel_uk&___from_store=boydel_us|title=Franz Grillparzer A Century of Criticism|website=Boydell & Brewer}}</ref> He also wrote the [[public speaking|oration]] for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s funeral.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Sonneck|editor-first=O. G.|title=Beethoven: impressions by his contemporaries.|year=1967|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-21770-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/beethovenimpress0000unse/page/229 229]|edition=Dover|url=https://archive.org/details/beethovenimpress0000unse/page/229}}</ref> 

While writing during the period of [[Romanticism]], Grillparzer's poetic language owes far more to the period of [[Classicism]] which reigned during his formative years. Committed to the classical ideals of aesthetic beauty and morality, his plots shy away from the [[realism (arts)|realism]] which developed during his time, preferring instead to use the theater to address spiritual values, which in the words of the dying queen of his [[Libuše|Libussa]], would only come after the period of [[Materialism]] had passed. Due to the identity-creating use of his works, especially after [[World War II]], he was named as the national poet of [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timetravel-vienna.at/en/news/detail/franz-grillparzer-one-of-the-most-contradictory-poet-personalities-in-austria/|title=Franz Grillparzer - one of the most contradictory poet personalities in Austria|website=Time Travel Vienna|date=24 March 2021}}</ref>

==Biography==

[[File:Hofkammerarchiv Plaque Grillparzer DSC 5268w.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Plaque commemorating Franz Grillparzer acting as director of the Hofkammerarchiv, Johannesgasse 6, 1st district of Vienna]]
Franz Grillparzer was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. His father, the [[advocate]] E. J. Grillparzer, was a severe pedant and a staunch upholder of the [[Josephinism|liberal traditions of the reign]] of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. E. J. Grillparzer was an unsuccessful lawyer whose fortunes were ruined by [[Napoleonic war|Napoleon's invasion]]. His mother, Anna Franziska, was a nervous, highly-strung woman,<ref name=EB1911/> daughter of [[Christoph Sonnleithner]], sister to [[Joseph Sonnleithner|Joseph]] and [[Ignaz von Sonnleithner|Ignaz]], aunt to [[Leopold von Sonnleithner|Leopold]].

Franz's father wished him to become a lawyer, and he entered the [[University of Vienna]] in 1807 as a student of [[jurisprudence]]. Two years later his father died, leaving the family in difficult circumstances. After obtaining his degree from the university in 1811, Franz became a private tutor for a noble family; then in 1813, he entered the civil service as a clerk at the Imperial and Royal ''Hofkammer'' ([[Exchequer]]) in Austria. In 1821, he unsuccessfully applied to the position of [[scribe]] at the Imperial Library, and later that same year, he was relocated to the Ministry of Finance. In 1832, he became [[archivist|director of the archives]] at the Imperial ''Hofkammer'', a position he held until his retirement in 1856. Grillparzer had little capacity for an official career and regarded his position merely as a means of independence.<ref name=EB1911/>

From early youth, Grillparzer displayed a strong literary impulse. He devoted especial attention to the Spanish drama, and many of his works show the influence of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]. In 1853, he wrote an autobiography of his life and times from birth to 1836. Among his posthumous writings are many fragments of literary, philosophic, and political criticism, all of them indicating a strong and independent spirit, not invariably just, but distinct, penetrating, and suggestive.<ref name=EB9/>

It is characteristic of him that he expresses extreme dislike of [[Hegel]]'s philosophy on the ground that its terms are unintelligible. On the other hand, he gives evidence of careful and sympathetic study of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Of modern literary critics, [[Gervinus]] was most repugnant to him, mainly because of the tendency of this writer to attribute moral aims to authors who created solely for art's sake. He rather maliciously says that Gervinus had one advantage and one disadvantage in writing his history of [[German literature]] – the advantage of common sense, the disadvantage of knowing nothing of his subject.<ref name=EB9/>

Of a quiet contemplative nature, Grillparzer shunned general society. He never married. He could seem cold and distant to strangers, but in conversation with people he liked, his real disposition revealed itself; his manner became animated, his eyes brightened, and a sarcastic but not ill-natured smile would play upon his lips. He often said that the art of writing poetry can neither be taught nor learned, but he also held that inspiration will not visit a poet who neglects to make himself master of his subject. Hence before writing a play he worked hard, striving to comprehend the spirit of the age he wished to represent. He was exceedingly fond of travel, and at different times visited all the leading European countries.<ref name=EB9/>

After 1840, when his only comedy was rejected by the public, he almost passed from the memory of his contemporaries. Fortunately for him, his admirer [[Heinrich Laube]] became artistic director of Vienna's court theater in 1849. Laube staged productions of Grillparzer's forgotten works, and their success was immediate and profound. To his own surprise, Grillparzer became the most popular author of the day; he was ranked with [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]], and lauded as the national poet of Austria. On his eightieth birthday, all classes from the court downwards united to do him honour; never, probably, did Vienna exert herself so much to prove her respect for a private citizen.<ref name=EB9/>

He was buried with an amount of ceremony that surpassed even the pomp displayed at [[Klopstock]]'s funeral.<ref name=EB9/> He was originally buried in the Währinger Cemetery in Vienna, now known as Schubertpark. He now lies at [[Hietzing Cemetery]].

==Early works up to ''Das goldene Vlies''==

[[File:Grillparzer Franz.JPG|thumb|left|230px|Franz Grillparzer, photography by [[Ludwig Angerer]]]]
From 1807 to 1809, Grillparzer wrote a long tragedy in [[Iamb (foot)|iambics]], ''Blanca von Castilien'', modeled on Schiller's ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]''. He also produced the dramatic fragments ''Spartacus'' and ''Alfred der Grosse'' (1809).<ref name=EB1911/>

When Grillparzer began to write, the German stage was dominated by the wild plays of [[Zacharias Werner]], [[Adolf Müllner]], and other authors of so-called "fate-tragedies." Grillparzer's play ''The Ancestress'' ({{lang-de|Die Ahnfrau|links=no}}), published in 1816, reflected this trend.<ref name=EB9/> It is a gruesome fate-tragedy in the [[trochaic]] measure of the Spanish drama, already made popular by Müllner's ''Schuld''.<ref name=EB1911/> The ghost of a lady who was killed by her husband for infidelity is doomed to walk the earth until her family line dies out, and this happens in the play amid scenes of violence and horror. Its general character is similar to that of Werner's dramas; it only differs from them in containing individual passages of much force and beauty.<ref name=EB9/> It reveals an instinct for [[drama]]tic as opposed to merely [[theatrical]] effect, which distinguishes it from other fate-dramas of the day. Its success led to the poet being classed for the best part of his life with playwrights like Müllner and [[Christoph Ernst von Houwald]].<ref name=EB1911/> In 1817, the first performances of ''The Ancestress'' made Grillparzer famous.

Grillparzer followed this gothic drama with [[Sappho (play)|''Sappho'']] (1818), a drama of a very different type. Similar to Goethe's ''[[Torquato Tasso (play)|Torquato Tasso]]'', Grillparzer dramatized the tragedy of poetic genius, showing how a poet must renounce earthly happiness to fulfill a higher mission.<ref name=EB1911/> After reading an [[Italian language|Italian]] translation of this play, [[Lord Byron]] expressed his conviction that Grillparzer would be held in reverence by posterity.<ref name=EB9/> Grillparzer's conceptions are not so clearly defined as Goethe's, nor is his diction so varied and harmonious; but the play has the stamp of genius, and ranks as one of the best works that attempt to combine the passion and sentiment of modern life with the simplicity and grace of ancient masterpieces.<ref name=EB9/>

In 1821, Grillparzer completed his ''{{ill|The Golden Fleece (play)|de|Das goldene Vlies|lt=The Golden Fleece}}'' trilogy, a project that had been interrupted in 1819 when his depressed mother committed suicide, and by Grillparzer's subsequent visit to Italy. The trilogy opens with a one-act prelude, ''Der Gastfreund,'' then depicts, in ''The Argonauts'' (''Die Argonauten'') [[Jason]]'s adventures in his quest for the Fleece. ''Medea'', a tragedy of classic proportions, contains the culminating events of the story of [[Medea]], which had been so often dramatized before.<ref name=EB1911/> Similarly to ''Sappho'' but on a larger scale, this trilogy is a tragedy of the heart's desire, the conflict of the simple happy life with that sinister power, be it genius or ambition, which upsets the equilibrium of life.<ref name=EB1911/> There is delicate art in the delineation of the mingled fascination and repulsion which Medea and Jason feel for each other, and when at last repulsion becomes the dominant force, Grillparzer gives splendid utterance to Medea's rage.<ref name=EB9/> At the end, Medea bears the fatal Fleece back to Delphi, while Jason is left to realize the futility of human striving and earthly happiness. The end is bitter disillusionment; the only consolation renunciation.<ref name=EB1911/> Some critics consider ''Medea'' Grillparzer's highest achievement.

==Historical tragedies==
For his historical tragedy ''King Ottokar's Fortune and End'' ({{lang-de|[[König Ottokars Glück und Ende]]||links=no}}, written 1823, but owing to difficulties with the [[censorship|censor]], not performed until February 19, 1825), Grillparzer dramatized the conflict of [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] with [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. It appealed strongly to the patriotic sympathies of the Viennese, because it depicted one of the proudest periods of Austrian history,<ref name=EB9/> the founding of the [[House of Habsburg]]. With an almost modern realism Grillparzer reproduced the medieval era, at the same time not losing sight of the needs of the theatre.<ref name=EB1911/> It cannot be said that the materials of the play are welded into a compact whole, but the characters are vigorously conceived, and there is a fine dramatic contrast between the brilliant, restless, and unscrupulous Ottokar and the calm, upright, and ultimately triumphant Rudolph.<ref name=EB9/> Because Ottokar is defeated, critics argue that this play represents another work in which Grillparzer preaches the futility of endeavour and the vanity of worldly greatness.<ref name=EB1911/>

A second historical tragedy, ''A faithful Servant of his Lord'' (''{{ill|Ein treuer Diener seines Herrn|de}}''), 1826, performed 1828), attempted to illustrate a more heroic theme; but the subject of the superhuman self-effacement of Bancbanus before his lord [[Otto I, Duke of Merania|Duke Otto of Meran]] proved too uncompromising an illustration of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]] of duty to be palatable in the theatre.<ref name=EB1911/> Liberal critics accused Grillparzer of promoting servility. At the same time, the play displeased the court, and its presentation was stopped. It hardly deserved to be made the subject of so much contention, for it is one of the least powerful of Grillparzer's later dramas.<ref name=EB9/>

With these historical tragedies began the darkest decade of Grillparzer's life. They brought him into conflict with the Austrian censor – a conflict that grated on Grillparzer's sensitive soul, and was aggravated by his own position as a servant of the state. In 1826, he paid a visit to [[Goethe]] in [[Saxe-Weimar]], and was able to compare the enlightened conditions of Weimar with the censorship of Vienna.<ref name=EB1911/>

To these troubles were added personal worries. In the winter of 1820/1821, Grillparzer had met and fallen in love with [[Katharina Fröhlich]] (1801–1879), but whether owing to a presentiment of mutual incompatibility, or merely owing to Grillparzer's conviction that life had no happiness in store for him, he shrank from marriage. Nevertheless, he was plunged into an abyss of misery and despair to which his diary bears heart-rending witness; his sufferings found poetic expression in the cycle of poems called ''Tristia ex Ponto'' (1835).<ref name=EB1911/>

==More masterpieces and a setback==
Still, during this time, Grillparzer completed two of his greatest dramas, ''Waves of the Sea and of Love'' ({{lang-de|Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen|links=no}}, 1831) and ''The Dream, a Life'' ({{ill|Der Traum ein Leben (play)|de|Der Traum ein Leben|lt=Der Traum ein Leben}}, 1834). ''Waves of the Sea and of Love'' dramatizes the story of [[Hero and Leander]], as a poetic love-tragedy with an insight into character motivation that predates the psychological dramas of [[Ibsen]].<ref name=EB1911/> The work again is formed on classic models, but in this instance his feeling is so distinctly modern that it does not find adequate expression in Grillparzer's carefully measured verse. The subject has never been more happily treated than in some passages, which, however, are marked rather by lyrical than dramatic qualities.<ref name=EB9>This article incorporates text from a publication now in the [[public domain]]: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Sime |first=James|title=Grillparzer, Franz|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica,_Ninth_Edition/Franz_Grillparzer|editor1-last=Baynes|editor1-first=T. S.|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=W. R.|edition=9th|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|volume=11|location=New York|publisher= Charles Scribner's Sons|date=1880}}</ref> The poetic influence of [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] is also evident.

''The Dream, a Life'', Grillparzer's technical masterpiece, is in form perhaps even more influenced by Spanish drama; it is also more of what Goethe called a confession. The aspirations of Rustan, an ambitious young peasant, are reflected in the hero's dream, which takes up nearly three acts of the play. Ultimately Rustan awakens from his nightmare to realize the truth of Grillparzer's own pessimistic belief that all earthly ambitions and aspirations are vanity; the only true happiness is contentment with one's lot and inner peace. It was the first of Grillparzer's dramas that did not end tragically.<ref name=EB1911/> Grillparzer provided the text for Schubert's 'Mirjams Siegesgesang' (Miriam's Song of Triumph), Op. 136/D. 942.

In 1838 Grillparzer produced his only [[comedy]], ''Woe to him who lies'' ({{lang-de|Weh dem, der lügt|links=no}}). But ''Woe to him who lies'', in spite of its humour of situation, its sparkling dialogue and its original premise — a hero who wins by invariably telling the truth, where his enemies invariably expect him to lie – was too strange to meet with approval in its day. Its premiere on 6 March 1838 was a failure. This was a severe blow to the poet, who turned his back forever on the German theatre.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Later life and final masterpieces==
[[File:Friedhof Hietzing Grabstein Franz Grillparzer 120505.jpg|thumb|upright|Franz Grillparzer's tomb]]

In 1836, Grillparzer paid a visit to [[Paris]] and [[London]], in 1843 to [[Athens]] and [[Constantinople]]. Then came the Revolution which struck off the intellectual fetters under which Grillparzer and his contemporaries had groaned in Austria, but the liberation came too late for him. Honours were heaped upon him; he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences; [[Heinrich Laube]], as director of the [[Burgtheater]], reinstated his plays into the repertory; in 1861, he was elected to the Austrian [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Herrenhaus]]; his eightieth birthday was a national festival, and when he died in Vienna, on 21 January 1872, the mourning of the Austrian people was universal.<ref name=EB1911/>

With the exception of a beautiful fragment, ''Esther'' (1861), Grillparzer published no more dramatic poetry after the fiasco of ''Weh dem, der lügt'', but at his death three completed tragedies were found among his papers. Of these, ''[[The Jewess of Toledo]]'' (''Die Jüdin von Toledo'', written in 1851), an admirable adaptation from the Spanish, has won a permanent place in the German classical repertory; ''Ein Bruderzwist in Habsburg'' is a powerful historical tragedy and ''[[Libussa]]'' is perhaps the most mature, as it is certainly the deepest, of all Grillparzer's dramas; the latter two plays prove how much was lost by the poet's divorce from the theatre.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |last=Robertson |first=John George |wstitle=Grillparzer, Franz |volume=12 |pages=597–598|inline=1}}</ref>

==Assessment==

Grillparzer was an important figure in the Viennese theater of the 1840s when his greatest dramatic works were produced. Together with [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel|Hebbel]], he rates as the most influential dramatist of the mid-nineteenth century. While most of his best plays originate in the age of [[Romanticism]], his works could not be classified as Romantic. His language and characters reflect the earlier sensibilities of [[neo-classicism]], exhibited in plays like Sappho and Das goldene Vlies which treats the subject matter of Jason bringing Medea back to [[Greece]]. In these plays he deals with classical themes as well as subject matter. One important characteristic of the age is that aesthetic beauty and virtue are seen as inter-related. In his historical plays like König Ottokars Glück und Ende, he expresses the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] optimism that humankind can put its affairs in order and realize an age of peace an harmony. This is a common theme in Austrian thought from this period. Some have suggested that this is a reflection of their multi-ethnic Austrian state. Ottkar, the thirteenth century [[Bohemia]]n king, wants to subjugate his neighbors, a thinly veiled reference to the recently defeated Napoleon. However, the play ends on an upbeat note.

Although Grillparzer was essentially a dramatist, his lyric poetry is in the intensity of its personal note hardly inferior to Lenau's; and the bitterness of his later years found vent in biting and stinging epigrams that spared few of his greater contemporaries. As a prose writer, he has left one powerful short story, Der arme Spielmann (1848), and a volume of critical studies on the Spanish drama, which shows how completely he had succeeded in identifying himself with the Spanish point of view.

Grillparzer's brooding, unbalanced temperament, his lack of will-power, his [[pessimism|pessimistic]] renunciation and the bitterness which his self-imposed [[martyr]]dom produced in him, made him peculiarly adapted to express the mood of Austria in the epoch of intellectual thraldom that lay between the [[Napoleonic wars]] and the [[Revolution of 1848]].{{cn|date=July 2020}}
