'''Halldór Kiljan Laxness''' ({{IPA-is|ˈhaltour ˈcʰɪljan ˈlaksnɛs|lang|Is-Halldor kiljan laxness.oga}}; born '''Halldór Guðjónsson'''; 23 April 1902 – 8 February 1998) was an Icelandic writer and winner of the 1955 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-30-countries-with-nobel-prize-winners.html|title = Nobel Prize Winners by Country|date = 23 October 2019}}</ref> He wrote novels, poetry, newspaper articles, essays, plays, travelogues and short stories. Writers who influenced Laxness included [[August Strindberg]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref>Halldór Guðmundsson, ''The Islander: a Biography of Halldór Laxness''. McLehose Press/Quercus, London, translated by Philip Roughton, 2008, pp. 49, 117, 149, 238, 294</ref>

==Early years==
Halldór Guðjónsson was born in [[Reykjavík]] in 1902.  When he was three his family moved to the Laxnes farm in [[Mosfellsbær|Mosfellssveit]] parish. He started to read books and write stories at an early age and attended the technical school in Reykjavík from 1915 to 1916. His earliest published writing appeared in 1916 in the children's newspapers ''Æskan'' and ''Sólskin'', the latter being a part of the North American Icelandic newspaper ''[[Lögberg-Heimskringla|Lögberg]]'', as well as in ''[[Morgunblaðið]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Halldór Laxness (23 April 1902-8 February 1998)|last1 = Kress|first1 = Helga|date = 2004|journal = Dictionary of Literary Biography|last2 = Tartt|first2 = Alison|editor-last = Stevens|editor-first = Patrick J.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Háskólabókasafn|first=Landsbókasafn Íslands-|title=Tímarit.is|url=https://timarit.is/?q=%22h.%20Gu%C3%B0j%C3%B3nsson%22&from=01.01.1916&to=31.12.1916&publicationId=&sort=&isLongSnippets=false&isBeygingar=false&isAdvanced=false&size=100|access-date=2021-10-10|website=timarit.is|language=is}}</ref> By the time his first novel, ''Barn náttúrunnar'' (''Child of Nature''), was published (1919) he had already begun his travels on the European continent.<ref>Guðmundsson, pp. 33-34</ref>

==1920s==
In 1922, Halldór joined the [[Clervaux Abbey|Abbaye Saint-Maurice et Saint-Maur]] in [[Clervaux]], [[Luxembourg]], where the [[Benedictine Order|monks]] followed the rules of [[Saint Benedict of Nursia]]. In 1923 he was baptized and confirmed in the [[Catholic Church]], adopting the surname Laxness after the homestead on which he was raised and adding the name Kiljan (the Icelandic name of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[martyr]] [[Saint Killian]]). While staying at the abbey Laxness practiced self-study, read books, and studied [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]]. He became a member of a group that prayed for reversion of the [[Nordic countries]] to Catholicism. Laxness wrote of his experiences in the essay ''Kaþólsk viðhorf'' (1925),  and the novels ''Undir Helgahnúk'' (1924) and ''[[Vefarinn mikli frá Kasmír]]'' (1927), the latter book hailed by noted Icelandic critic [[:is:Kristján Albertsson|Kristján Albertsson]]: 
<blockquote>"Finally, finally, a grand novel which towers like a cliff above the flatland of contemporary Icelandic poetry and fiction! Iceland has gained a new literary giant - it is our duty to celebrate the fact with joy!"<ref>Albertsson, Krístian, ''Vaka'' 1.3, 1927</ref></blockquote> 
Laxness's religious period did not last long. He lived in the [[United States]] from 1927 to 1929, giving lectures on Iceland and attempting to write screenplays for [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]].<ref>Einarsson, Stefán, ''A History of Icelandic Literature'', New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, p. 317 OCLC 264046441</ref> During this time he had also became attracted to [[socialism]]:

<blockquote>"…(Laxness) did not become a socialist in America from studying manuals of socialism but from watching the starving unemployed in the parks."<ref>{{Nobelprize}}</ref><ref>Laxness, Halldór,''Alþýðubókin'', Þriðja útgáfa (3rd edition), (Reykjavík, 1949), p.9</ref>

"… Laxness joined the socialist [[bandwagon effect|bandwagon]]… with a book ''Alþýðubókin'' (''The Book of the People'', 1929) of brilliant [[burlesque]] and satirical essays… "<ref>Einarsson, p. 292 {{OCLC|264046441}}</ref>

"Beside the fundamental idea of socialism, the strong sense of Icelandic individuality is also the sustaining element in ''Alþýðubókin''. The two elements are entwined together in characteristic fashion and in their very union give the work its individual character."<ref>Hallberg, Peter ''Halldór Laxness'', Twayne Publishers, New York, 1971, p.60</ref></blockquote>

In 1929 Laxness published an article critical of the United States in ''[[Lögberg-Heimskringla|Heimskringla]]'', a Canadian newspaper. This resulted in charges being filed against him, his detention and the forfeiture of his passport. With the aid of [[Upton Sinclair]] and the [[ACLU]], the charges were dropped and Laxness returned to Iceland.<ref>Guðmundsson, pp. 150-151</ref>

==1930s==
By the 1930s Laxness "had become the apostle of the younger generation" of Icelandic writers.<ref>Einarsson, pp. 263–4</ref>
<blockquote>"… ''Salka Valka'' (1931–32) began the great series of sociological novels, often coloured with socialist ideas, continuing almost without a break for nearly twenty years. This was probably the most brilliant period of his career, and it is the one which produced those of his works that have become most famous. But Laxness never attached himself permanently to a particular dogma."<ref name=r1>Sveinn Hoskuldsson, "Scandinavica", 1972 supplement, pp. 1–2</ref></blockquote> In addition to the two parts of ''Salka Valka'', Laxness published ''Fótatak manna'' (''Steps of Men'') in 1933, a collection of short stories, as well as other essays, notably ''Dagleið á fjöllum'' (''A Day's Journey in the Mountains'') in 1937.<ref>Hallberg, p. 211</ref>

Laxness's next novel was ''Sjálfstætt fólk ([[Independent People]]'' (1934 and 1935), which has been described as "… one of the best books of the twentieth century."<ref>Smiley, Jane, ''Independent People'', Vintage International, 1997, cover</ref>

When ''Salka Valka'' was published in English in 1936 a reviewer on the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' stated: "No beauty is allowed to exist as ornamentation in its own right in these pages; but the work is replete from cover to cover with the beauty of its perfection."<ref>Guðmundsson, p.229</ref>

In 1937 Laxness wrote the poem ''Maístjarnan'' (''The May Star''), which was set to music by Jón Ásgeirsson and has become a socialist anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://luijten.org/ijsland/2007/05/25/maistjarnan.html|title = Maístjarnan}}</ref>

This was followed by the four-part novel ''Heimsljós'' (''World Light'', 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1940), which is loosely based on the life of Magnús Hjaltason Magnusson, a minor Icelandic poet of the late 19th century.<ref>Hallberg, p.125</ref> It has been "… consistently regarded by many critics as his most important work."<ref>Magnusson, Magnus, ''World Light'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1969, p. viii</ref>

Laxness also traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1938 and wrote approvingly of the Soviet system and culture.<ref>Guðmundsson, p.182</ref> He was present at the "[[Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites"|Trial of the Twenty-one]]" and wrote about it in detail in his book ''Gerska æfintýrið'' (''The Russian Adventure'').<ref>Guðmundsson, p.265</ref> 

In the late 1930s Laxness developed a unique spelling system that was closer to pronunciation than standard Icelandic. This characteristic of his writing is lost in translation.<ref>Kress, p.73</ref>

==1940s==
In 1941 Laxness translated [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' into Icelandic, which caused controversy because of his use of [[neologisms]].<ref>Guðmundsson, p.279</ref> He continued to court controversy over the next few years  through the publication of new editions of several [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]] using [[modern Icelandic]] rather than the normalized [[Old Norse orthography]], which had become customary. Laxness and his publishing partners were taken to court following the publication of his edition of ''[[Hrafnkels saga]]'' in 1942. They were found guilty of violating a recent copyright law, but eventually they were acquitted of the charge when the copyright law was deemed a violation to the freedom of the press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Helgason|first=Jón Karl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KroOyT5QHZgC&q=jon+karl+helgason|title=The Rewriting of Njáls Saga: Translation, Ideology, and Icelandic Sagas|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-457-1|pages=121–136|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|title=Guardian of Memory: Halldór Laxness, Saga Editor|url=https://scancan.net/crocker_1_26.htm|journal=Scandinavian-Canadian Studies|year=2019|volume=26|pages=110–131}}</ref>

Laxness's "epic"<ref>Leithauser, Brad, ''The New York Times'', 15 February 2004</ref> three-part work of historical fiction, ''[[Íslandsklukkan]]'' (''[[Iceland's Bell]]''), was published between 1943 and 1946. It has been described as a novel of broad "… geographical and political scope… expressly concerned with national identity and the role literature plays in forming it… a tale of colonial exploitation and the obdurate will of a suffering people."<ref>Haslett, Adam, introduction to Iceland's Bell, Vintage International, 2003, p.viii.</ref> "Halldór Kiljan Laxness’s three-volume ''Íslandsklukkan'' … is probably the most significant (Icelandic) novel of the 1940s."<ref>Neijmann, Daisy, ''A History of Icelandic Literature'', University of Nebraska Press, 2006, p. 404</ref>

In 1946 the English translation of ''Independent People'' was published as a [[Book of the Month Club]] selection in the United States, selling over 450,000 copies.<ref>Lemoine, Chay (9 February 2007) [https://grapevine.is/mag/feature/2007/02/09/halldor-laxness-and-the-cia/].</ref>

In 1948 Halldór and his second wife, Auður Sveinsdóttir, moved into Gljúfrasteinn, a new house built in the countryside near Mosfellsbær, where they began a new family.  Auður, in addition to her domestic duties, also assumed the roles of personal secretary and business manager.

In response to the establishment of a permanent U.S. military base in [[Keflavík]], he wrote the [[satire]] ''Atómstöðin'' (''[[The Atom Station]]''), which may have contributed to a [[blacklisting]] of his novels in the United States.<ref>Lemoine, Chay (18 November 2010). [http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/11/18/the-view-from-here-no-8/#more-19435 The View from Here, No. 8]. icenews.is</ref><blockquote>"The demoralization of the occupation period is described ... nowhere as dramatically as in Halldór Kiljan Laxness' ''Atómstöðin'' (1948)... [where he portrays] postwar society in Reykjavík, completely torn from its moorings by the avalanche of foreign gold."<ref>Einarsson, p. 330</ref></blockquote>
Due to its examination of modern Reykjavík, ''Atómstöðin'' caused many critics and readers to consider it as the exemplary "Reykjavík Novel."<ref>Neijmann, p. 411</ref>

==1950s==
[[File:Laxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Halldór Laxness by [[Einar Hákonarson]], 1984]]

In 1952 Laxness was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] and in 1953 he was awarded the Soviet-sponsored [[World Peace Council prizes|World Peace Council]] literary Prize.<ref>Guðmundsson, p. 340</ref>

A Swedish film adaptation of his novel ''Salka Valka'', directed by [[Arne Mattsson]] and filmed by [[Sven Nykvist]], was released in 1954.<ref>Guðmundsson, p. 351</ref>

In 1955 Laxness was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], "… for his vivid epic power, which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland".<ref name="Literature1955">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1955/index.html|title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1955|publisher=Nobel Foundation}}</ref>

<blockquote>"His chief literary works belong to the genre… [of] narrative prose fiction. In the history of our literature Laxness is mentioned beside [[Snorri Sturluson]], the author of "[[Njáls saga|Njals saga]]", and his place in world literature is among writers such as Cervantes, Zola, Tolstoy, and Hamsun… He is the most prolific and skillful essayist in Icelandic literature both old and new…"<ref name=r1/></blockquote>

In the presentation address for the Nobel prize [[Elias Wessén]] stated:<blockquote>"He is an excellent painter of Icelandic scenery and settings. Yet this is not what he has conceived of as his chief mission. 'Compassion is the source of the highest poetry. Compassion with Asta Sollilja on earth,' he says in one of his best books… And a social passion underlies everything Halldór Laxness has written. His personal championship of contemporary social and political questions is always very strong, sometimes so strong that it threatens to hamper the artistic side of his work. His safeguard then is the astringent humour which enables him to see even people he dislikes in a redeeming light, and which also permits him to gaze far down into the labyrinths of the human soul."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1955 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1955/ceremony-speech/ |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=21 October 2018 |ref=Nobel55}}</ref></blockquote>

In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize Laxness spoke of:<blockquote>"… the moral principles she [his grandmother] instilled in me: never to harm a living creature; throughout my life, to place the poor, the humble, the meek of this world above all others; never to forget those who were slighted or neglected or who had suffered injustice, because it was they who, above all others, deserved our love and respect…"<ref>acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, 1955</ref></blockquote>
Laxness grew increasingly disenchanted with the Soviet bloc after the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].<ref>Guðmundsson, p. 375</ref>

In 1957 Halldór and his wife went on a world tour, stopping in New York City, Washington, DC, Chicago, Madison, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Peking (Beijing), Bombay (Mumbai), Cairo and Rome.<ref>Guðmundsson, pp. 380–384</ref>

Major works in this decade were ''[[Gerpla]]'', (''The Happy Warriors''/''Wayward Heroes'', 1952), ''Brekkukotsannáll'', (''[[The Fish Can Sing]]'', 1957), and  ''Paradísarheimt'', (''Paradise Reclaimed'', 1960).

==Later years==
In the 1960s Laxness was very active in Icelandic theater. He wrote and produced plays, the most successful of which was ''The Pigeon Banquet'' (''Dúfnaveislan'', 1966.)<ref>Magnússon, Sigurður (ed.),''Modern Nordic Plays, Iceland'', p. 23, Twayne: New York, 1973</ref>

In 1968 Laxness published the "visionary novel"<ref>Sontag, Susan, ''At the Same Time'', p.100, Farrar, Strauss and Giroux: New York, 2007</ref> ''Kristnihald undir Jökli'' (''Under the Glacier / Christianity at the Glacier''). In the 1970s he published what he called "essay novels": ''Innansveitarkronika'' (''A Parish Chronicle'', 1970) and ''Guðsgjafaþula'' (''A Narration of God's Gifts'', 1972). Neither has been translated into English.<ref>Guðmunsson, Halldór, ''Scandinavica'', Vol. 42, No. 1, pg 43</ref>

Laxness was awarded the [[Sonning Prize]] in 1969.

In 1970 Laxness published an influential ecological essay, ''Hernaðurinn gegn landinu'' (''The War Against the Land'').<ref>Henning, Reinhard, Phd. paper ''Umwelt-engagierte Literatur aus Island und Norwegen'', University of Bonn, 2014</ref>

He continued to write essays and memoirs throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. As he grew older he began to suffer from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and eventually moved into a nursing home, where he died at the age of 95.

==Family and legacy==

Laxness married to Ingibjörg Einarsdóttir (3 May 1908 - 22 January 1994) in 1930 (divorced in 1940), and married [[Auður Laxness|Auður Sveinsdóttir]] (30 June 1918 - 29 October 2012) in 1945.<ref>Guðmundsson, pp. 70, 138, 176, 335, 348, 380</ref>

He had four children: Sigríður Mária Elísabet Halldórsdóttir (''Maria'', 10 April 1923 - 19 March 2016), Einar Laxness (9 August 1931 - 23 May 2016), Sigríður Halldórsdóttir (''Sigga'', b. 26 May 1951) and [[Guðný Halldórsdóttir]] (''Duna'', b. 23 January 1954).

In the 21st century interest in Laxness in English-speaking countries has increased following the reissue of several of his novels and the first English-language publications of ''Iceland's Bell'' (2003) and ''The Great Weaver from Kashmir'' (2008).<ref>Holm, Bill, [https://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-ca-halldor-laxness23-2008nov23,0,7491955.story The man who brought Iceland in from the cold – Los Angeles Times].

[[Halldór Guðmundsson]]'s book ''The Islander: A Biography of Halldór Laxness'' won the Icelandic literary prize for best work of [[non-fiction]] in 2004.

Numerous dramatic adaptations of Laxness's work have been staged in Iceland. In 2005, the Icelandic National Theatre premiered a play by [[Ólafur Haukur Símonarson]], titled ''Halldór í Hollywood'' (''Halldór in Hollywood'') about the author's time spent in the United States in the 1920s.
