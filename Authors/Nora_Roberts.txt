The newly married couple settled in Boonsboro, Maryland. Roberts' husband worked at his father's sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts became a homemaker and would later refer to this time period as her "Earth Mother" years. Roberts spent much of her time doing crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children's clothes.<ref name="kloberdanz"/> Their marriage ended in divorce<ref>Bellafante, Ginia, (August 23, 2006) ''A Romance Novelist's Heroines Prefer Love Over Money'', New York Times, retrieved November 26, 2014.</ref> in 1983.

====Present====
Roberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qcADQAAQBAJ&q=%22Bruce+Wilder%22+%221985%22+%22roberts%22&pg=PT35 |title=The Obsession |publisher=Trivia-On-Books |year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/books/23roberts.html?mcubz=3 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=A Romance Novelist's Heroines Prefer Love Over Money |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |date=August 23, 2006 |quote=Not long into her career, Ms. Roberts divorced.

The Wilders also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel, which was undergoing renovations when it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008. It opened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=La Gorce|first=Tammy|title=Maryland's Civil War Country Seeks a Softer Side|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/travel/30boonsboro.html?scp=1&sq=Nora%20Roberts&st=cse&_r=0|access-date=April 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 29, 2010}}</ref>

Roberts once stated: "You're going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder."<ref name="nuckols2"/> She concentrates on one novel at a time,<ref name="nuckols"/> writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.<ref name="Plag"/> Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.<ref name="nuckols2">{{citation|last=Nuckols|first=Ben|title=Nora Roberts, 9-to-5 storyteller: Her writing output and sales are huge, her work is routine|newspaper=The Record (Bergen County, New Jersey)|date=August 22, 2006|page=F07}}</ref> She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the "texture and color" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.<ref name="aar1997">{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Laurie|author2=Linda Mowery|title=Nora Roberts on her MacGregor Series|url=http://www.likesbooks.com/roberts.html|publisher=All About Romance|date=September 22, 1997|access-date=August 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823003128/http://www.likesbooks.com/roberts.html|archive-date=August 23, 2007}}</ref>

She often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters. When possible, she does the same with the ''in Death'' books, writing three in a row before returning to contemporary romances.<ref name="schendel"/> Her trilogies are all released in paperback, as Roberts believes the wait for hardcover editions is too long for the reader.<ref name="bookreporter">{{cite web|title=Author Nora Roberts|publisher=BookReporter|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/au-roberts-nora.asp|access-date=August 9, 2007|date=March 10, 2000|last=Weiner|first=Debbie}}</ref>

Roberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an [[fear of flying|aversion to flying]].<ref name="Plag"/>

She is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local [[minor league baseball]] team [[Hagerstown Suns]] several times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suns release 2007 promotional schedule|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070402&content_id=201534&vkey=pr_milb&fext=.jsp|access-date=May 17, 2014|newspaper=milb.com|date=April 2, 2007}}</ref>

===Writing career===

====Beginning====
She began to write during a blizzard in February 1979 while housebound with her two small boys. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten she had little else to do.<ref name="adwoff">{{Citation|url=http://adwoff.com/nora-faq-professional.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218163954/http://adwoff.com/nora-faq-professional.htm|archive-date=February 18, 2012|title=Frequently Asked Questions and Answers from Nora Roberts |access-date=August 4, 2007}}</ref><ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.noraroberts.com/bio.htm |title=Author Nora Roberts |publisher=Nora Roberts |access-date=August 4, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714082145/http://www.noraroberts.com/bio.htm |archive-date=July 14, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> While writing down her ideas for the first time, she fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts.<ref name="elley">{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Karen Trotter|title=Nora Roberts deals with destiny in Three Fates|publisher=Book Page|url=http://www.bookpage.com/0204bp/nora_roberts.html|year=2002|access-date=August 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813174113/http://www.bookpage.com/0204bp/nora_roberts.html|archive-date=August 13, 2007}}</ref> She submitted her manuscripts to [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd|Harlequin]], the leading publisher of [[romance novels]], but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,

<blockquote>I got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been [[Janet Dailey]].<ref name="regis">Regis, pages 183–184</ref></blockquote>

Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts' work.

===Pseudonyms===

====Nora Roberts====
In 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette books, formed to take advantage of the pool of manuscripts from the many American writers that Harlequin had snubbed.<ref name="regis2">Regis, p 159</ref> Roberts found a home at Silhouette, where her first novel, ''[[Irish Thoroughbred]]'', was published in 1981. She used the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.<ref name="kloberdanz"/>

Between 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette.<ref name="kloberdanz"/> They were published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA's reissue program.  In 1985, ''Playing the Odds,'' the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published.  The book was an immediate bestseller.<ref name="kloberdanz"/>

In 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]] to write single title hardcovers as well as original paperbacks.<ref name="NRWriting">{{Citation|url=http://www.noraroberts.com/nwriting.htm |title=Nora Roberts on writing |access-date=August 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714082058/http://www.noraroberts.com/nwriting.htm |archive-date=July 14, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> She reached the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996's ''Montana Sky''. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she "[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words."<ref name="Plag"/>

Roberts and her career were featured in Pamela Regis' ''A Natural History of the Romance Novel.'' Regis calls Roberts "a master of the romance novel form, because she "has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization."<ref name="regis"/>  ''Publishers Weekly'' once talked about her "wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities" in the romance novel genre.<ref name="Plag"/>

===={{anchor|J. D. Robb}}J. D. Robb====
Roberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense novels in the vein of [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance novels while she built a following of readers.<ref name="Plag"/> After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts's prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so that they would be able to publish more of her work each year.<ref name="schendel">{{cite web|last=Schendel|first=Jennifer|title=The Appeal of the Romance Series|publisher=All About Romance|url=http://www.likesbooks.com/128.html#robb|date=November 15, 2001|access-date=August 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807072307/http://www.likesbooks.com/128.html#robb|archive-date=August 7, 2007}}</ref>

Her agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense novels under the new name.<ref name="Plag"/> Her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials "J. D." were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while "Robb" is a shortened form of Roberts. She first decided to use the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, she discovered that this pseudonym was used by another author.<ref name="adwoff"/>

As J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction [[police procedurals]]. These books, all part of the ''[[in Death]]'' series, feature NYPSD detective [[Eve Dallas]] and her husband [[Roarke (In Death)|Roarke]] and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.<ref name="schendel"/> When the ''in Death'' series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was in fact the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.<ref name="die">{{cite web|title=Interview with Nora Roberts |publisher=Die Buecherecke Romantische |first=Isolde |last=Wehr |date=April 2000 |url=http://www.die-buecherecke.de/roberts2.HTM |access-date=August 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705021841/http://www.die-buecherecke.de/roberts2.HTM |archive-date=July 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After publishing 18 novels in the ''in Death'' series, Putnam published the nineteenth, ''Divided in Death'', first in hardcover. The book became Roberts' first bestselling novel of 2004.<ref name="maryles2">{{citation|last=Maryles |first=Daisy |title=Nora's Newbies |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=February 9, 2004 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA380278.html?q=Nora+Roberts |access-date=August 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929094549/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA380278.html?q=Nora+Roberts |archive-date=September 29, 2009 }}</ref>

As of March 2019, Roberts has published 48 novels plus ten novellas in the ''in Death'' series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronological list of the In Death Series|website=Fall Into The Story|url=http://fallintothestory.com/chronological-list-of-the-in-death-series/|access-date=March 9, 2019|archive-date=January 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125215529/http://fallintothestory.com/chronological-list-of-the-in-death-series/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Other pseudonyms====
Roberts wrote a story for a magazine titled "Melodies of Love" under the pseudonym Jill March.<ref name="adwoff"/> She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty. When the ''Born In'' series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.<ref name="adwoff"/>

===Success===
In 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with ''Montana Sky'' and, in 2012, doubled that with ''The Witness''. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that ''[[USA Today]]'' listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]] came in 1991,<ref name="nuckols">{{cite web|last=Nuckols|first=Ben|title=For Romance Titan Roberts, Writing Novels is a 9-to-5 Job|publisher=WTOP News|date=August 7, 2006|url=http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?nid=25&pid=0&sid=872864&page=1|access-date=August 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010162819/http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?nid=25&pid=0&sid=872864&page=1|archive-date=October 10, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. ''[[The New York Times]]'' did not review any of those novels.<ref name="regis184">Regis, p 184.</ref> In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to ''Publishers Weekly'', not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the ''Publishers Weekly'' bestseller list, as her romance ''Time and Again'' was number one, and her J.D. Robb release ''Seduction in Death'' was number two.<ref name="maryles">{{citation|last=Maryles |first=Daisy |title=Roberts Scores with Mass Turnover |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=September 10, 2001 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA155409.html?q=Nora+Roberts |access-date=August 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928070628/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA155409.html?q=Nora+Roberts |archive-date=September 28, 2009 }}</ref>

Since 1999, every one of Roberts's novels has been a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]], and 124 of her novels have ranked on the ''Times'' bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts's novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on ''The New York Times'' Bestseller List, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400&nbsp;million copies of her books are in print, including 12&nbsp;million copies sold in 2005 alone.

A founding member of the [[Romance Writers of America]] (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization's Hall of Fame.<ref name="Plag"/> In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award|publisher=[[Romance Writers of America]]|year=2013|access-date=March 21, 2013|url=http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=543|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920213109/http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=543|archive-date=September 20, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA's [[RITA Award]]s, the highest honor given in the romance genre.<ref name="rita">{{cite web|title=RITA Awards: Past Winners|publisher=[[Romance Writers of America]]|year=2013|access-date=March 21, 2013|url=http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=535|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714074216/https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=535|archive-date=July 14, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Two of Roberts' novels, ''Sanctuary'' and ''Magic Moments'', had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, [[Lifetime Television]] adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: ''[[Angels Fall (TV film)|Angels Fall]]'' starring [[Heather Locklear]], ''[[Montana Sky]]'' starring [[Ashley Williams (actress)|Ashley Williams]], ''[[Blue Smoke]]'' starring [[Alicia Witt]], and ''[[Carolina Moon (2007 film)|Carolina Moon]]'' starring [[Claire Forlani]].

''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she "has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart."<ref name="holt">{{citation|last=Holt |first=Karen |title=Roberts, Mitchell Make Time's List |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=May 14, 2007 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6442060.html?q=Nora+Roberts |access-date=August 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928070743/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6442060.html?q=Nora+Roberts |archive-date=September 28, 2009 }}</ref> Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]].<ref name="holt"/>

===Victim of plagiarism===
In 1997, another best-selling romance writer, [[Janet Dailey]], admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts' ''Sweet Revenge'' and Dailey's ''Notorious'' back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism "mind-boggling", Roberts sued Dailey.<ref name="Plag"/> Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder.
