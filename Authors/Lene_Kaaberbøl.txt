== Biography ==

Born in Copenhagen, Lene Kaaberbøl grew up in the small town of [[Malling, Denmark|Malling]], in the countryside south of [[Aarhus]] in [[Jutland]]. She got her first book published when she was only 15 years old. It was also the first book of what became the Tina series<ref>Lene Kaaberbøl (1975): "Den første bog om Tina og hestene : hvori Tina får til opgave at tage sig af et moderløst, gyldenbrunt hingstføl" {{in lang|da}}</ref> and it has never been translated. Graduated from [[Aarhus Katedralskole]] and educated with a degree in both English and [[Dramaturgy]] from [[Aarhus University]], she has worked as a [[gymnasium (Denmark)|high school]] teacher and a translator, but her working life has been very diverse and she also made a living as a [[cleaning lady]] at one time.
