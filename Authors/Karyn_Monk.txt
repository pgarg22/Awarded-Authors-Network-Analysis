==Biography==

===Personal life===
Monk is the fourth child of John and [[Lorraine Monk|Lorraine (Spurrell) Monk]].  Because her parents had expected a boy, they had not chosen a girl's name, and decided to name their new daughter after the delivery room nurse.  Neither parent was sure how to spell the name "Karen," though, leading to the unique spelling they chose.<ref name="bio">{{cite web  | last=
