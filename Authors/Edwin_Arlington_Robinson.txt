'''Edwin Arlington Robinson''' (December 22, 1869 – April 6, 1935) was an American poet. Robinson won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] on three occasions and was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] four times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7779|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=April 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026080801/http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7779|archive-date=October 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Robinson was born in [[Alna, Maine|Head Tide]], [[Lincoln County, Maine]], but his family moved to [[Gardiner, Maine]], in 1871. He described his childhood in [[Maine]] as "stark and unhappy".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/391 |title=biography |publisher=Poets.org |date=April 6, 1935 |access-date=March 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302161023/http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/391 |archive-date=March 2, 2014 }}</ref> His parents were Edward and Mary née Palmer. They had wanted a girl, and did not name him until he was six months old, when they visited a holiday resort—at which point other vacationers decided that he should have a name, and selected the name "Edwin" from a hat containing a random set of boy's names. The man who drew the name was from [[Arlington, Massachusetts]], so "Arlington" was used for his middle name.<ref>''American Poets: From the Puritans to the Present'', by Hyatt H.

==Education==

Robinson's early struggles led many of his poems to have a dark pessimism and his stories to deal with "an American dream gone awry."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/ihas/poet/robinson.html |title=I Hear America Singing |publisher=PBS |access-date=March 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007215127/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ihas/poet/robinson.html |archive-date=October 7, 2013 }}</ref> His eldest brother, Dean Robinson, was a doctor and had become addicted to [[laudanum]] while self-medicating for [[neuralgia]].<ref name="d h tracy">{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=D.H.|title=Aspects of Robinson|url=http://www.cprw.com/Tracy/robinson.htm|publisher=Contemporary Poetry Review|access-date=December 8, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205215428/http://www.cprw.com/Tracy/robinson.htm|archive-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> The middle brother, Herman, a handsome and charismatic man, married the woman Edwin loved, Emma Löehen Shepherd.<ref name="bill peschel">{{cite web|last=Peschel|first=Bill|title=Edwin Arlington Robinson's Life and Career|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/robinson/life.htm|work=Modern American Poetry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|access-date=December 8, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102070933/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/robinson/life.htm|archive-date=November 2, 2012}}</ref> Emma thought highly of Edwin and encouraged his poetry,<ref name="bill peschel" /> but he was deemed too young to be in realistic competition for her hand, which didn't keep him from being rattled deeply by witnessing what he considered her being bamboozled by Herman's charm and choosing shallowness over depth.<ref name="d h tracy" /> The marriage was a great blow to Edwin's pride, and during the wedding ceremony, February 12, 1890, the despondent poet stayed home and wrote a poem of protest, "Cortège", the title of which refers to the train that took the newly married couple out of town to their new life in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name="danny d smith" /> Herman Robinson suffered business failures, and also started working life as an alcoholic, and ended up estranged from his wife and children. Herman died impoverished in 1909 of [[tuberculosis]] at [[Boston City Hospital]]. Robinson's poem ''[[Richard Cory]]'' was thought by Emma (Herman's wife) to refer to her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earobinson.com/pages/sites/site24.html|title=Richard Cory - Shepherd Family Residence|website=www.earobinson.com|access-date=April 25, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218044646/http://www.earobinson.com/pages/sites/site24.html|archive-date=February 18, 2017}}</ref>

At the age of 21, Robinson entered [[Harvard University]] as a [[Matriculation#Special student|special student]]. He took classes in English, French, and [[Shakespeare]], as well as one on [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] that he later dropped. He did not aim to get all A's; as he wrote his friend Harry Smith, "B, and in that vicinity, is a very comfortable and safe place to hang."

His real desire was to get published in one of the Harvard literary journals. Within the first fortnight of being there, ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'' published Robinson's "Ballade of a Ship." He was even invited to meet with the editors, but when he returned, he complained to his friend [[Mowry Saben]], "I sat there among them, unable to say a word."

Edwin's father, Edward, died after Edwin's first year at Harvard. Edwin returned to Harvard for a second year, but it was to be his last one as a student there. Though short, his stay in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] included some of his most cherished experiences, and there he made his most lasting friendships. He wrote his friend Harry Smith on June 21, 1893:

<blockquote>I suppose this is the last letter I shall ever write you from Harvard. The thought seems a little queer, but it cannot be otherwise. Sometimes I try to imagine the state my mind would be in had I never come here, but I cannot. I feel that I have got comparatively little from my two years, but still, more than I could get in Gardiner if I lived a century.</blockquote>

Robinson had returned to Gardiner by mid-1893. He had plans to start writing seriously. In October he wrote his friend Gledhill:

<blockquote>Writing has been my dream ever since I was old enough to lay a plan for an air castle. Now for the first time I seem to have something like a favorable opportunity and this winter I shall make a beginning.</blockquote>

==Career==
[[File:Lilla Carbot Perry - Edwin Arlington Robinson.jpg|thumb|[[Lilla Cabot Perry]], ''Edwin Arlington Robinson'', 1916, Colby College Special Collections, Waterville, Maine]]
With his father gone, Robinson became the man of the household. He tried farming and developed a close relationship with his brother's wife Emma Robinson, who after her husband Herman's death, moved back to Gardiner with her children. She twice rejected marriage proposals from Edwin, after which he permanently left Gardiner. He moved to New York, where he lived as an impoverished poet while cultivating friendships with other writers, artists, and intellectuals. In 1896, he self-published his first book, ''The Torrent and the Night Before'', paying 100 dollars for 500 copies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Robinson meant it as a surprise for his mother. Days before the copies arrived, his mother died of [[diphtheria]].

His second volume, ''[[Children of the Night (poetry collection)|Children of The Night]]'', had a somewhat wider circulation. Its readers included President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s son [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], who had received a copy from his teacher, who happened to be a friend of Robinson. Kermit then recommended it to his father, who, impressed by the poems and aware of Robinson's straits, invited Robinson to join him for dinner at the White House (though Robinson declined due to his lacking "suitable clothes"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dickey|first1=James|title=Classes on Modern Poets and the Art of Poetry|url=https://archive.org/details/classesonmodernp0000dick|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=1570035288|page=[https://archive.org/details/classesonmodernp0000dick/page/97 97]}}</ref>) and in 1905 offered the writer a [[sinecure]] at the New York Customs Office. According to [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]], author of ''[[Theodore Rex (book)|Theodore Rex]]'', a tacit condition of his employment was that, in exchange for his desk and two thousand dollars a year, he should work "with a view to helping American letters", rather than the receipts of the United States Treasury. Robinson remained in the job until Roosevelt left office.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/theodorerex00edmu|title=Theodore Rex|last=Morris|first=Edmund|publisher=Random House|year=2001|isbn=9780394555096|location=New York|oclc=46401900|url-access=registration}}</ref> In 1913, Robinson lived on [[Lighthouse Hill, Staten Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/01/26/famous-writers-staten-island-connection |title=Famous Writers With A Staten Island Connection |first=Donald |last=Laub |publisher=New York Public Library |date=January 26, 2011 |access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
