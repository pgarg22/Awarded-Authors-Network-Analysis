'''Peter Neville Frederick Porter''' [[Medal of the Order of Australia|OAM]] (16 February 1929{{spaced ndash}}23 April 2010) was a British-based Australian poet.

==Life==
Porter was born in [[Brisbane]], Australia, in 1929. His mother, Marion, died of a burst gall-bladder in 1938. He was educated at the [[Anglican Church Grammar School]] (then known as the Church of England Grammar School)<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=James|title=Churchie: The Centenary Register|year=2011|publisher=The Anglican Church Grammar School|location=Brisbane, Australia|isbn=978-0-646-55807-3}}</ref> and left school at eighteen to work as a trainee journalist at ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''. However, he only lasted a year with the paper before he was dismissed.<ref name="Telegraph &ndash; Obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/7625813/Peter-Porter.html|title=Peter Porter|date=23 April 2010|publisher=Telegraph|access-date=24 April 2010|location=London}}</ref> He emigrated to England in 1951. On the boat he met the future novelist [[Jill Neville]]. Porter was portrayed in Neville's first book, ''The Fall Girl'' (1966). After two suicide attempts, he returned to Brisbane. Ten months later he was back in England. In 1955 he began attending meetings of "[[The Group (literature)|The Group]]". It was his association with "The Group" that allowed him to publish his first collection in 1961.<ref name="Telegraph &ndash; Obit" />

He married Jannice Henry, a nurse from [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire]], in 1961 and had two daughters (born in 1962 and 1965).<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/porter-peter|title=Australian Poetry Library}}</ref> During this period he worked in advertising, and was beginning to find work in the literary press.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/07/peter-porter-interview-poetry|title=A life in writing: Peter Porter|first=Interview by Sarah|last=Crown|date=7 February 2009|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  Jannice committed suicide in 1974, greatly affecting Porter's work, in particular ''The Cost of Seriousness''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/interview-peter-porter|title=Interview: Peter Porter|first=Duncan|last=Fallowell|date=25 May 2010|website=Prospect Magazine}}</ref> In 1991 Porter married Christine Berg, a child psychologist.<ref name="Telegraph &ndash; Obit" />

In 2001, he was named Poet in Residence at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. In 2004 he was a candidate for the position of [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref name="Telegraph &ndash; Obit" /> In 2007, he was made a [[Royal Society of Literature]] Companion of Literature, an honour bestowed on a maximum of ten living writers.

Porter died on 23 April 2010, aged 81, after suffering from [[liver cancer]] for a year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lea|first=Richard|title=Poet Peter Porter dies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/23/poet-peter-porter-dies|work=The Guardian |access-date=25 April 2013|location=London|date=23 April 2010}}</ref> After news of Porter's death in 2010, the ''[[Australian Book Review]]'' announced it would rename its ABR Poetry Prize the Peter Porter Poetry Prize in honour of Porter.<ref>{{cite web|title=The latest literary news from the Editor's desk ...|url=https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/component/k2/69-april-2012/880-the-latest-literary-news-from-the-editor-s-desk|work=Australian Book Review|publisher=Australian Book Review|access-date=25 April 2013|quote=There were no such stylistic difficulties in Peter Porter's posthumously published poem 'Hermit Crab' ... one of the last poems that [he] wrote before his death in April 2010.

==Work==
His poems first appeared in the Summer 1958 and October 1959 issues of [[Delta (magazine)|''Delta'']].<ref>Kaiser, p 99</ref> The publication of his poem ''Metamorphosis'' in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' in January 1960 brought his work to a wider audience.<ref>''TLS'' No. 3021. Kaiser, p. 99</ref> His first collection ''Once Bitten Twice Bitten'' was published by [[Scorpion Press (Northwood)|Scorpion Press]] in 1961. Influences on his work include: [[W. H. Auden]], [[John Ashbery]], and [[Wallace Stevens]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. He went through distinct poetic stages, from the epigrams and satires of his early works ''Once Bitten Twice Bitten'', to the elegiac mode of his later ones; ''The Cost of Seriousness'' and ''English Subtitles''. In a recorded conversation with his friend [[Clive James]] he stated that the "glory of present-day English writing in America, in Australia and in Britain, is what is left over of the old regular metrical pattern and how that can be adapted to the new sense that the main element, the main fixture of poetry is no longer the foot (you know, the iambus or the trochee) but the cadence. It seems that what is very important is to get the best of the old authority, the best of the old discipline along with the best of the new freedom of expression."

In 1983 Porter was a judge in the [[Man Booker Prize|Bookerâ€“McConnell Prize]].<ref>{{Cite news   | title = Booker prize winners, shortlists and judges  | newspaper = The Guardian  | location = London| date =  10 October 2008 <!-- 15.55 BST -->
