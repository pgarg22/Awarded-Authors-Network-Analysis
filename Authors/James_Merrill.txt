'''James Ingram Merrill''' (March 3, 1926 &ndash; February 6, 1995) was an American poet.  He was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry in 1977 for ''[[Divine Comedies]].'' His poetry falls into two distinct bodies of work: the polished and formalist lyric poetry of his early career, and the epic narrative of occult communication with spirits and angels, titled ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (published in three volumes from 1976 to 1980), which dominated his later career. Although most of his published work was poetry, he also wrote essays, fiction, and plays.

==Early life==
James Ingram Merrill was born in [[New York City]], to [[Charles E. Merrill]] (1885&ndash;1956), the founding partner of the [[Merrill Lynch]] investment firm, and Hellen Ingram Merrill (1898&ndash;2000), a society reporter and publisher from [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref name="Chron">{{cite book|title=James Merrill: Selected Poems |editor=J.

Merrill's parents married in 1925, the year before he was born; he would grow up with two older half siblings from his father's first marriage, Doris Merrill Magowan<ref name=Doris>[http://slick.org/deathwatch/mailarchive/msg00246.html Philanthropist Doris Magowan dies at 87] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220020541/http://slick.org/deathwatch/mailarchive/msg00246.html |date=2013-12-20 }}, ''San Francisco Examiner'', 6 April 2001.

Merrill was drafted in 1944 into the [[United States Army]] and served for eight months.  His studies interrupted by war and military service, Merrill returned to [[Amherst College]] in 1945 and graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1947.<ref name="Chron"/>  Merrill's senior thesis on French novelist [[Marcel Proust]] heralded his literary talent, and his English professor upon reading it declared to the Amherst graduating class that Jim (as he was known there) was "destined for some sort of greatness."<ref>Hammer, Langdon.  ''James Merrill: Life and Art,'' Alfred A. Knopf, 2015.</ref>  ''The Black Swan'', a collection of poems Merrill's Amherst professor (and lover) [[Kimon Friar]] published privately in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], in 1946, was printed in just one hundred copies when Merrill was 20 years old.  Merrill's first mature work, ''The Black Swan'' is among Merrill's scarcest titles.  Merrill's first commercially published volume was ''First Poems'', issued in 990 numbered copies by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1951.

==''A Different Person''==

[[File:JamesMerrillDavidJackson1973window.jpg|thumb|left|James Merrill and [[David Noyes Jackson|David Jackson]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], October 1973 (photo: [[Judith Moffett]])]]
Merrill's partner of three decades was [[David Noyes Jackson|David Jackson]], a writer and artist. Merrill and Jackson met in New York City after a performance of Merrill's play ''The Bait'' at the Comedy Club in 1953. (Poet [[Dylan Thomas]] and playwright [[Arthur Miller]] walked out of the performance.<ref>Merrill, James. ''A Different Person: A Memoir'', New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1993, Chapter XX. "Arthur Miller and Dylan Thomas, whom Kimon [Friar] had brought to see the play, stumbled out, making remarks I'd have preferred not to hear and dragging after them the audience's attention, along with poor Kimon himself. ('What could I do?' he said next day on the phone. 'Dylan wanted a drink.' Years later I learned what Mr. Miller, with uncanny insight, had whispered in Dylan's ear shortly after the curtain rose: 'You know, this guy's got a secret, and he's gonna keep it.')" Reprinted in ''Collected Prose'', Knopf, 2004, p. 670.</ref>) Together, Jackson and Merrill moved to [[Stonington, Connecticut]] in 1955, purchasing a property at 107 Water Street (now the site of writer-in-residency program, the [[James Merrill House]], sponsored by the Stonington Village Improvement Association in Stonington Borough).<ref>{{cite web|last=Stonington Village Improvement Association in Stonington Borough|title=James Merrill House|url=http://www.jamesmerrillhouse.org/|access-date=18 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="TalkingWalls">Swansburg, John.

"[I]n the 1950s he established the Ingram Merrill Foundation, which until it ceased to exist in 1996, gave grants to writers, artists and other foundations.

In his 1993 memoir ''A Different Person'', Merrill revealed that he suffered [[writer's block]] early in his career and sought psychiatric help to overcome its effects (undergoing analysis with [[Thomas Detre|Dr. Thomas Detre]] in Rome). "Freedom to be oneself is all very well," he would write. "The greater freedom is not to be oneself."<ref name=ADFQuote>"It ended badly&mdash;with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] (a student none of us knew, invited for his looks) pistol-whipping our poor drunken [[Somerset Maugham]] under a blossoming tree&mdash;but what was an ointment without flies?

==The Ingram Merrill Foundation==

A prodigious correspondent and the keeper of many confidences, Merrill's "chief pleasure was friendship".<ref name="BraveElements"/><ref name="Gurganus">White, Edmund, editor. ''Loss Within Loss: Artists in the Age of AIDS.'' Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 2001, p. 282. Introducing Merrill at a December 13, 1993 New York poetry reading at the YMHA, novelist [[Allan Gurganus]] said: "His genius for friendship is, if possible, his single greatest genius. He has, almost secretly, created a foundation dedicated to encouraging gifted young painters and writers. The foundation makes raids of vigilante kindness. It had helped those young artists who are healthy and those who discover they are dying just as they've begun."</ref> Answering to "Jim" in his youth and to "James" in published adulthood (and to "JM" in letters from readers), he was called "Jimmy", a childhood nickname, by friends and family until the end of his life. Despite great personal wealth derived from an unbreakable trust made early in his childhood, Merrill lived modestly.<ref name="Trust">Merrill, James. ''A Different Person: A Memoir'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993, Chapter I. "As it happened, my father had taken a much earlier step to ensure his children's independence, by creating an unbreakable trust in each of our names. Thus at five years old I was rich, and would hold my own pursestrings when I came of age, whether I liked it or not. I wasn't sure I did like it. The best-intentioned people, knowing whose son I was and powerless against their own snobbery, could set me writhing under attentions I had done nothing to merit." Reprinted in ''Collected Prose'', Knopf, 2004, p. 461.</ref> (Before his father's death, Merrill and his two siblings renounced any further inheritance from their father's estate in exchange for $100 "as full quittance";<ref name="Estate">Merrill, James.

Knopf, 1993, Chapter XVI; reprinted in ''Collected Prose'', Knopf, 2004, pp. 619-620.</ref> as a result, most of Charles Merrill's estate was donated to charity, including "The Orchard.")

A philanthropist in his own right, Merrill created the [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]] in the 1950s, the name of which united his divorced parents. The private foundation operated throughout the poet's lifetime and subsidized literature, the arts, and public television, with grants  directed particularly to writers and artists showing early promise.<ref name="BraveElements"/><ref name=Gurganus/> Merrill met filmmaker [[Maya Deren]] in 1945 and the poet [[Elizabeth Bishop]] a few years later,  giving critical financial assistance to both and providing funds to hundreds of other writers, often anonymously.<ref name="TalkingWalls"/><ref name=intros>Merrill, James. ''A Different Person'', Knopf, 1993, Chapter II. Mustered out of the army in early 1945, Merrill returned to Amherst and civilian life, and soon began attending Kimon Friar's weekly lectures and workshops at the New York YMHA. Friar introduced Merrill to city friends including [[Anaïs Nin]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[Maya Deren]].</ref><ref>An (incomplete) list of writers and artists known to have received [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]] support can be found on its separate Wikipedia entry.</ref>

Merrill served as a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] from 1979 until his death.  While wintering in [[Arizona]], he died on February 6, 1995 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] related to [[AIDS]]. His ashes and the remains of David Jackson are buried side by side at Evergreen Cemetery, Stonington. Jackson's former wife and Merrill's friend, Doris Sewell Jackson is buried behind them.

In tribute to Merrill, ''The New Yorker'' republished his 1962 poem, "The Mad Scene", in its March 19, 1995 edition.<ref name=MadScene>James Merrill, [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/03/27/the-mad-scene/amp “The Mad Scene”], ''The New Yorker'', March 19, 1995.

==Awards==
Beginning with the prestigious [[Glascock Prize]], awarded for ''The Black Swan'' when he was an undergraduate, Merrill would go on to receive {{According to whom|every major poetry award in the United States|date=August 2021}}, including the 1977 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Poetry for ''[[Divine Comedies]]''. Merrill was honored in mid-career with the [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1973.

Merrill received the [[National Book Critics Circle|National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 1983 for his epic poem ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (composed partly of supposedly [[supernatural]] messages received via the use of a [[Ouija board]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1985 |year=1985 |publisher=Newspaper Enterprise Association, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-911818-71-5 |page=415}}</ref> In 1990, he received the first [[Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry]] awarded by the [[Library of Congress]] for ''[[The Inner Room]]''.

A writer of elegance and wit, highly adept at wordplay and puns, Merrill was a master of traditional [[meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] and [[Formalism (literature)|form]] who also wrote a good deal of [[free verse|free]] and [[blank verse]]. (Asked once if he would prefer a more popular readership, Merrill replied "Think what one has to ''do'' to get a mass audience. I'd rather have one perfect reader. Why dynamite the pond in order to catch that single silver carp?"<ref name="Kalstone">Merrill, James. "On 'Yánnina': An Interview with David Kalstone", ''Saturday Review'', December 1972; reprinted in ''Collected Prose'', New York: Knopf, 2004, p. 83.</ref>) Though not generally considered a [[Confessionalism (poetry)|Confessionalist]] poet, James Merrill made frequent use of personal relationships to fuel his "chronicles of love & loss" (as the speaker in ''[[Mirabell: Books of Number|Mirabell]]'' called his work). The divorce of Merrill's parents &mdash; the sense of disruption, followed by a sense of seeing the world "doubled" or in two ways at once &mdash; figures prominently in the poet's verse. Merrill did not hesitate to alter small autobiographical details to improve a poem's logic, or to serve an environmental, aesthetic, or spiritual theme.

As Merrill matured, the polished and taut brilliance of his early work yielded to a more informal, relaxed, and conversational tone.<ref>Merrill's 1993 memoir ''A Different Person'' charts this long evolution: "[T]he mere act of reading [my poems] aloud&mdash;something I was doing for virtually the first time [in March 1950]&mdash;quickly disabused me ... [M]y poems remained verbal artifacts, metered and rhymed to be sure, shaped and polished and begemmed, but set on the page with never a thought of their being uttered by a living voice." Quoted in ''Collected Prose'', 2004, pp. 461-462.</ref><ref name=Magician>Fraser, Caroline. [https://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/04/books/bk-33122 The Magician: Collected Poems by James Merrill], ''Los Angeles Times'', 4 March 2001. Retrieved 14 June 2013.</ref> Already established in the 1970s among the finest poets of his generation, Merrill made a surprising detour when he began incorporating extensive [[occult]] messages into his work (although a poem from the 1950s, "[[Voices from the Other World]]," foreshadows the practice).<ref name=ParisReview/><ref name=Bornhauser>Bornhauser, Fred. Interview with James Merrill in ''Contemporary Authors'', New Revision Series, vol. 10 (Detroit: Gale Research Company, 1983). Quoted in ''Collected Prose'', Knopf, 2004, pp. 135-136.</ref> The result, a 560-page [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] published as ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (1982), documents two decades of messages dictated from otherworldly spirits during [[Ouija board|Ouija]] [[séance]]s hosted by Merrill and his partner David Jackson. ''The Changing Light at Sandover'' is one of the longest [[epic poetry|epics]] in any language, and features the voices of recently deceased poet [[W. H. Auden]], Merrill's late friends [[Maya Deren]] and Greek socialite [[Maria Mitsotáki]], as well as heavenly beings including the [[Archangel Michael]]. Channeling voices through a Ouija board "made me think twice about the imagination," Merrill later explained. "If the ''spirits'' aren't external, how astonishing the ''mediums'' become! [[Victor Hugo]] said of his voices that they were like his own mental powers multiplied by five."<ref>Quoted in ''The Voice of the Poet'' (audio cassette), J. D. McClatchy, editor.</ref>

In Langdon Hammer's ''James Merrill: Life and Art'', Hammer quoted [[Alison Lurie]]'s writing of her experience with the Ouija board in ''Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson'' as:

{{blockquote|a game that got badly out of control ... couldn't tell what was real and what was not ... the board became a form of self-induced [[demonic possession]], to which Merrill, driven by his ambition to make poetry out of spirit messages, was especially susceptible, and in which Jackson was enlisted against his will.}}

Lurie's response after reading Merrill and Jackson's collaborative effort in ''The Changing Light at Sandover'': ''"I sometimes had the feeling that my friend's mind was intermittently being taken over by a stupid and possibly even evil intelligence"''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hammer |first=Langdon |date=April 14, 2015 |title=James Merrill: Life and Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03xoBAAAQBAJ&q=Familiar+Spirits:+A+Memoir+of+James+Merrill+and+David+Jackson+especially+susceptible&pg=PT277 |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0375413339 |quote=She made that view explicit in ''Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson'', which appeared in 2001, six years after Merrill's death and shortly before Jackson's. It describes their Ouija board experience as a game that got badly out of control, until they couldn't tell what was real and what was not. According to her, the board became a form of self-induced demonic possession, to which Merrill, driven by his ambition to make poetry out of spirit messages, was especially susceptible, and in which Jackson was enlisted against his will. For evidence, she quotes passages from ''The Changing Light at Sandover'', as if the trilogy were a factual record of their seances rather than a poetic fiction based on them. "As I read through the last two-thirds of the book," she writes, "I sometimes had the feeling that my friend's mind" -Merrill's mind- "was intermittently being taken over by a stupid and possibly even evil intelligence."}}</ref> According to Stoker Hunt, author of ''Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game'', before his death Merrill warned against the use of the Ouija board.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Stoker |date=1992 |title=Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYbyQcXnKvcC&q=Ouija:+The+Most+Dangerous+Game. |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Library |page=47 |isbn=0060923504 }}</ref>

Following the publication of ''The Changing Light at Sandover'', Merrill returned to writing shorter poetry which could be both whimsical and nostalgic: "Self-Portrait in TYVEK Windbreaker" (for example) is a [[conceit]] inspired by a [[windbreaker|windbreaker jacket]] Merrill purchased from "one of those vaguely imbecile / Emporia catering to the collective unconscious / Of our time and place." The [[Tyvek]] windbreaker &mdash; "DuPont contributed the seeming-frail, / Unrippable stuff first used for Priority Mail" &mdash; is "white with a world map." "A zipper's hiss, and the Atlantic Ocean closes / Over my blood-red T-shirt from the Gap."<ref name="Iowa">Marshall, Kathe Bonann.
