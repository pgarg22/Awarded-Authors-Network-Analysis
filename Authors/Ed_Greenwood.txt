'''Ed Greenwood''' (born July 21, 1959) is a Canadian fantasy writer and the original creator of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' game world. He began writing articles about the Forgotten Realms for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine beginning in 1979, and subsequently sold the rights to the setting to [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], the creators of the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' roleplaying game, in 1986. He has written many Forgotten Realms novels, as well as numerous articles and ''D&D'' game supplement books.

==Early life and the Forgotten Realms==
Ed Greenwood grew up in the upscale [[Toronto]] suburb of [[Don Mills]].<ref name="Dragon #244">{{cite journal |last=Varney |first=Allen |author-link=Allen Varney |title=ProFiles: Ed Greenwood |journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |issue=#244 |page=112 |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |location=[[Renton, Washington]] |date=February 1998}}</ref> He began writing stories about the [[Forgotten Realms]] as a child, starting in the mid 1960s; they were his "dream space for swords and sorcery stories".<ref name="30 Years" /> Greenwood conceived of the Forgotten Realms as one world in a "multiverse" of parallel worlds which includes the Earth. He imagined such worlds as being the source of humanity's myths and legends.<ref name="Dragon #244" />

Greenwood discovered the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' game in 1975 and soon became a regular player.<ref name="Dragon #244" /> He used the Realms as a [[fictional universe|setting]] for his campaigns, which centered around the fictional locales of [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]] and [[Shadowdale (Forgotten Realms)|Shadowdale]], locations that would figure prominently in his later writing.<ref name="FRA">[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]]; Greenwood, Ed. ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1990)</ref> According to Greenwood, his players' thirst for detail pushed him to further develop the Forgotten Realms setting: "They want[ed] it to seem real, and work on 'honest jobs' and personal activities, until the whole thing [grew] into far more than a casual campaign."<ref name="Dragon #244" />

Beginning with the periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood published a series of short articles that detailed the setting in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]''<!--It was called The Dragon at that time, even though it is now called Dragon.--> magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as The Curst.<ref name="Dragon #244" /><ref name="30 Years">[[Steve Winter|Winter, Steve]]; Greenwood, Ed; [[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]]. ''[[30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons]]'', pages 74-87. ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2004).</ref><ref name="designers">{{Cite book |author=Shannon Appelcline |title=Designers & Dragons |publisher=Mongoose Publishing |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|19}} He wrote voluminous entries to ''Dragon'' magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic items]], monsters, and [[Magic of Dungeons & Dragons|spells]].<ref name="FRA" />

==Partnership with TSR==
In 1986, the American game publishing company [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] began looking for a new [[campaign setting]] for the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' game,<ref name="30 Years" /> and assigned [[Jeff Grubb]] to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood in his articles for ''Dragon'' magazine.<ref name="FRA" /><ref name="designers" />{{rp|19}} According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; he answered "yes" to both questions.<ref name="Dragon #244" /> TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic [[Dragonlance]] setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign for ''AD&D'' 2nd Edition.<ref name="Dragon #244" />

Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began to prepare his Forgotten Realms material for official publication.<ref name="30 Years" /> He sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee.<ref name="Dragon #244" /> The following year, Greenwood used this material as a basis for writing the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' along with coauthor [[Jeff Grubb]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The campaign setting was a major success, and Greenwood continued to be involved with all subsequent incarnations of the Forgotten Realms in ''D&D''. He retained the rights to his fictional universe and went on to write numerous Forgotten Realms novels.<ref name="buker2002">{{cite book |first=Derek M. |last=Buker |year=2002 |title=The science fiction and fantasy readers' advisory: the librarian's guide to cyborgs, aliens, and sorcerers |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sciencefictionfa00buke_0/page/127 127–128] |work=ALA readers' advisory series |publisher=ALA Editions |isbn=0-8389-0831-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencefictionfa00buke_0/page/127 }}</ref> Many of these center around the wizard [[Elminster]], whom Greenwood has frequently portrayed at conventions and gaming events.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Greenwood feels his work on the Realms that he likes best are "those products that impart some of the richness and color of the Realms, such as the novel I wrote with Jeff Grubb, ''Cormyr''; the ''Volo's Guides''; ''[[The Seven Sisters|Seven Sisters]]''; ''[[The Code of the Harpers]]''; ''City of Splendors''; and stuff that lots of gamers have found useful, such as ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]'' and ''[[Ruins of Undermountain]]''."<ref name="Dragon #244" /> He found that it has been easy to keep his enthusiasm for the Realms over the years, as so many people care about it, ask him questions about the world's lore ("Realmslore"), and share with him what they have done.<ref name="Dragon #244" /> He has stated that the Forgotten Realms, as run by him in his own games, is more "dark" and edgy than it is in officially sanctioned, published works.<ref name="darker">[http://dicecast.blogspot.com/2010/09/dicecast-episode-10-interview-with-ed.html Interview on the DiceCast podcast]</ref>

Greenwood has also been contributing editor and creative editor of ''Dragon'' magazine.<ref name="HG">{{Cite book |contribution=[[Thurn and Taxis (board game)|Thurn and Taxis]] |title=[[Hobby Games: The 100 Best]] |last=Greenwood |first=Ed |editor-last=Lowder |editor-first=James |editor-link=James Lowder |publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] |year=2007 |pages=312–314 |isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}</ref>

Greenwood has published over two hundred articles in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'' and ''[[Polyhedron (magazine)|Polyhedron Newszine]]'', is a lifetime charter member of the Role Playing Game Association ([[RPGA]]) network, and has been Gen Con Game Fair guest of honor many times.<ref name="wizardsbio">{{cite web |url=http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=EdGreenwood |title=Ed Greenwood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625151644/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=EdGreenwood |archive-date=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Greenwood has written over thirty-five novels for ''TSR'', and written, co-written, or contributed to over two hundred books and game products from other publishers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Greenwood has also contributed to ''[[The Book of All Flesh]]'' (2001), an anthology based on ''[[All Flesh Must Be Eaten]]'',<ref name="designers" />{{rp|341}} and written short stories based on the ''[[Silver Age Sentinels]]'' role-playing game.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|337}} Greenwood's ''[[Castlemourn]]'' setting was published by [[Margaret Weis Productions]].<ref name="designers" />{{rp|353}} He is co-creator (with fantasy novelist [[Lynn Abbey]]) of the [[Mornmist]] fantasy setting.<ref name="HG" />

He has also contributed to most Forgotten Realms gaming accessories, and authored many more—including the detailed ''[[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo's Guide]]'' series—and continues to DM his own campaign. He writes regular Realmslore columns for the ''[[Wizards of the Coast]]'' website.

In addition to all these activities, Greenwood works as a library clerk (and sometimes as a librarian) and has edited over a dozen small press magazines.<ref name="wizardsbio" /> When not appearing at conventions, he lives in an old farmhouse in the countryside of Ontario.<ref name="wizardsbio" />

As of 1998, Greenwood lived in applegrowing country on [[Lake Ontario]], still working full-time at the North York Community Library, as he had since 1974, and continued to run his original Waterdeep campaign with the same core group he started with, albeit meeting only sporadically.<ref name="Dragon #244" /> He has stated that it is important for people who do freelance writing for roleplaying games to be active as both players and as dungeon masters.<ref name="darker" />

==Awards and honors==
Greenwood won "best player" at the 1984 Gen Con AD&D Open tournament and several Gamer's Choice Awards and Origins Awards for his game design.<ref name="HG" /> He was inducted into the Gamer's Choice Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Academy of Adventure Gaming's Hall of Fame in 2003.<ref name="HG" /> Order of Cramahe 2017.<ref name="cramahe">{{cite web |title=Inaugural Order of Cramahe Presented |url=https://www.cramahenow.com/?p=7694 |website=Cramahe Now - News Magazine |access-date=28 September 2020}}</ref> He received the Port Hope Civic Awards Arts & Culture Award 2019.<ref name="porthope">{{cite web |title=Port Hope - Civic Awards |url=https://www.porthope.ca/civic-awards |website=www.porthope.ca |access-date=28 September 2020}}</ref>
