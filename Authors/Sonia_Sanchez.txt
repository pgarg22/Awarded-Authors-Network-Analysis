'''Sonia Sanchez''' (born '''Wilsonia Benita Driver'''; September 9, 1934)<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Lennon, Gary Maniaci, Teodoro|title=.45|date=2009|publisher=Nordisk Film|oclc=488332802}}</ref> is an American poet, writer, and professor. She was a leading figure in the [[Black Arts Movement]] and has written over a dozen books of poetry, as well as short stories, critical essays, plays, and children's books. In the 1960s, Sanchez released poems in periodicals targeted towards African-American audiences, and published her debut collection, ''Homecoming,'' in 1969. In 1993, she received [[Pew Fellowships in the Arts|Pew Fellowship in the Arts]], and in 2001 was awarded the [[Robert Frost Medal]] for her contributions to the canon of American poetry.<ref name=":0" /> She has been influential to other African-American  poets, including [[Krista Franklin]].<ref name="Norton" />

==Early life==
Sanchez was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on September 9, 1934 to Wilson L. Driver and Lena Jones Driver. Her mother died when Sanchez was only one year old, so she spent several years being shuttled back and forth among relatives. One of those was her grandmother, who died when Sanchez was six.<ref name="Norton" /> The death of her grandmother proved to be a trying time in her life. Though only six, Sanchez suffered from losing her loved one, developing a stutter that contributed to her becoming introverted. However, her stutter only caused her to read more and more and pay close attention to language and its sounds.

In 1943, she moved to [[Harlem]] in New York City to live with her father (the school teacher), her sister, and her stepmother, who was her father's third wife. When in Harlem, she learned to manage her stutter and excelled in school, finding her poetic voice which later emerged during her studies at [[Hunter College]]. Sanchez focused on the sound of her poetry, admitting to always reading her poetry aloud, and received praise for her use of the full range of African and African-American vocal resources. She is known for her sonic range and dynamic public readings. She now terms herself as an "ordained stutterer.”<ref name="Norton" /> Sanchez earned a BA in political science in 1955 from Hunter College.

Sanchez pursued post-graduate studies at [[New York University]] (NYU), working closely with [[Louise Bogan]]. During her time at NYU, she formed a writers’ workshop in [[Greenwich Village]], where the “Broadside Quartet” was born. The “Broadside Quartet” included other prominent Black Arts Movement artists such as [[Haki Madhubuti]], [[Nikki Giovanni]] and [[Etheridge Knight]]. These young poets were introduced and promoted by [[Dudley Randall]], an established poet and publisher.

Although her first marriage to Albert Sanchez did not last, Sonia Sanchez would retain her professional name. She and Albert had one daughter named Anita. She later married Etheridge Knight, had twin sons named Morani Neusi and Mungu Neusi, but they divorced after two years. Nonetheless, motherhood heavily influenced the motifs of her poetry in the '70s with the bonds between mother and child emerging as a key theme. She also has three grandchildren.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="Norton" />

=== Teaching ===
Sanchez taught 5th Grade in NYC at the [[Downtown Community School]], until 1967. She has taught as a professor at eight universities and has lectured at more than 500 college campuses across the US, including [[Howard University]]. She was also a leader in the effort to establish the discipline of Black Studies at the university level. In 1966, while teaching at [[San Francisco State University]] she introduced Black Studies courses. Sanchez was the first to create and teach a course based on Black Women and literature in the United States and the course she offered on African-American literature is generally considered the first of its kind taught at a predominately white university.<ref name=blackpast>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/sanchez-sonia-1934|title=Sanchez, Sonia (1934– ) |last=Irons |first= Stasia |publisher= The Black Past|website=www.blackpast.org|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> She viewed the discipline of Black Studies as both a new platform for the study of race and a challenge to the institutional biases of American universities. These efforts are clearly in line with the goals of the Black Arts Movement and was a known black feminist. Sanchez was the first Presidential Fellow at [[Temple University]], where she began working in 1977. There, she held the Laura Carnell chair until her retirement in 1999. She is currently a poet-in-residence at Temple University. She has read her poetry in [[Africa]], [[the Caribbean]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Canada]].

=== Activism ===
Sanchez supports the [[National Black United Front]] and was a very influential part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Black Arts Movement]]. In the early 1960s, Sanchez became a member of CORE ([[Congress for Racial Equality]]), where she met [[Malcolm X]]. Though she was originally an integrationist in her thinking, after hearing Malcolm X speak Sanchez became more separatist in her thinking and focused more on her black heritage and identity.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.howard.edu/library/reference/guides/sanchez/|title=Library System - Howard University|website=www.howard.edu|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref>

In 1972, Sanchez joined the [[Nation of Islam]], during which time she published ''A Blues Book for Blue Black Magical Women'' (1974), but she left the organization after three years in 1975 because their views on women's rights conflicted. She continues to advocate for the rights of oppressed women and minority groups.<ref name=blackpast />
She wrote many plays and books that had to do with the struggles and lives of Black America. Among her plays are ''Sister Son/ji'', which was first produced Off-Broadway at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater]] in 1972; ''Uh, Huh: But How Do it Free us?'', staged in Chicago at the [[Northwestern University]] Theatre in 1975, and ''Malcolm Man/Don’t Live Here No Mo’'', first produced in 1979 at the ASCOM Community Center in Philadelphia.<ref name=":4">[https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/sonia-sanchez "Sonia Sanchez"], Writers Directory 2005, Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved August 9, 2019.</ref> Sanchez has edited two anthologies of Black literature: ''We Be Word Sorcerers: 25 Stories by Black Americans'' (1974) and ''360° of Blackness Coming at You'' (1999). She is also committed to a variety of activist causes, including the Brandywine Peace Community, MADRE, and Plowshares.

=== Black Arts Movement ===
The aim of the [[Black Arts Movement]] was a renewal of black will, insight, energy, and awareness. Sanchez published poetry and essays in numerous periodicals in the 1960s, including ''The Liberator'', ''Negro Digest'', and ''Black Dialogue''. Her writing established her importance as a political thinker to the "black aesthetic" program.<ref name=Norton>Gates, Henry Louis, and Valerie Smith (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of African American Literature''. W.W. Norton & Company, 2014 (Third edition).</ref> Sanchez gained a reputation as an important voice in the Black Arts movement after publishing the book of poems ''Home Coming'' in 1969. This collection and her second in 1970, titled ''We a BaddDDD People'' demonstrated her use of experimental poetic forms to discuss the development of black nationalism and identity.<ref name="oxfordbibliographies.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199827251/obo-9780199827251-0134.xml|title=Sonia Sanchez |first= Jennifer |last= Ryan-Bryant|work= Oxford Bibliographies |access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref>

==Style and themes==
Sanchez is known for her innovative melding of musical formats—such as the blues—and traditional poetic formats like [[haiku]] and [[tanka]]. She also uses spelling to celebrate the unique sound of [[Black English Vernacular|black English]], for which she gives credit to poets such as [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]].<ref name=":2" />

Her first collection of poems, ''Homecoming'' (1969), is known for its blues influences in both form and content. The collection describes both the struggle of defining black identity in the United States as well as the many causes for celebration Sanchez sees in black culture.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title=We a BaddDDD People|publisher= Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803121509417}}</ref> Her second book, ''We a BaddDDD People'' (1970), solidifies her contribution to the Black Arts Movement aesthetic by focusing on the everyday lives of black men and women. These poems make use of urban black vernacular, experimental punctuation, spelling, and spacing, and the performative quality of jazz.<ref name=":3" />

Though still emphasizing what she sees as the need for revolutionary cultural change, Sanchez's later works, such as ''I've Been a Woman'' (1978), ''Homegirls and Handgrenades'' (1985), and ''Under a Soprano Sky'' (1987), tend to focus less on separatist themes (like those of [[Malcolm X]]), and more on themes of love, community, and empowerment. She continues to explores the haiku, tanka, and sonku forms, as well as blues-influenced rhythms. Later works continue her experiments with forms such as the epic in ''Does Your House Have Lions?'' (1997), an emotional account of her brother's deadly struggle with AIDS,<ref name="Norton" /> and the haiku in ''Morning Haiku'' (2010).<ref name="oxfordbibliographies.com"/>

In addition to her poetry, Sanchez's contributions to the Black Arts Movement included drama and prose. She began writing plays while in San Francisco in the 1960s. Several of her plays challenge the masculinist spirit of the movement, focusing on strong female protagonists. Sanchez has been recognized as a pioneering champion of black feminism.<ref name=Norton />

== Contemporary works ==
Her more recent contemporary endeavors include a spoken-word interlude on "Hope is an Open Window", a song co-written by [[Diana Ross]] from her 1998 album ''[[Every Day is a New Day]]''. The song is featured as the sound bed for a tribute video to [[9/11]] that can be viewed on YouTube. Sanchez is currently among 20 African-American women to be a part of "Freedom's Sisters," a mobile exhibition initiated by the [[Cincinnati Museum Center]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name=":1" />
