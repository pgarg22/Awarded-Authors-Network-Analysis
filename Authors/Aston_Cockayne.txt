'''Sir Aston Cockayne, 1st Baronet''' (1608–1684)<ref>Also spelt '''Aston Cokain'''</ref> was, in his day, a well-known [[Cavalier]] and a minor literary figure, now best remembered as a friend of [[Philip Massinger]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Richard Brome]], [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randolph]], and other writers of his generation.{{sfn|Maidment|Logan|1967|p={{Page needed|date=February 2011}} }}

==Biography==
[[File:Arms of Cockayne.svg|thumb|left|150px|Cockayne coat of arms]] 
Aston Cockayne was the son of Thomas Cockayne and Ann, the daughter of [[Sir John Stanhope]]; Cockayne was born at [[Ashbourne Hall]] in Derbyshire, and baptised on 20 December 1608.{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}} He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{acad|id=CKN624A|name=Cokayne, Aston}}</ref> the University of Oxford, and at the [[Inns of Court]]. Like many other aristocrats of his time, he travelled through Europe in his youth, spending much of 1632 in France and Italy;{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}} like a few, he became fluent in their languages, and translated works of literature into English.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Cockayne was a Roman Catholic, and like other Catholics in his country in his era, was active in resistance against the [[Church of England]] and the social order that supported it. On 10 January 1641 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] elevated him to [[baronet]]. During the [[English Civil War]] he took the Royalist side.{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}} He joined the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in exile for a time.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} For much of the [[English Interregnum]] he lived on his estate of [[Pooley Hall]], at [[Polesworth]] in Warwickshire.{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}}

Cockayne was a cousin of the poet [[Charles Cotton]] (1630–87), and had connections with Cotton's circle, which included [[Izaak Walton]] (1598–1683).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Cockayne held the lands and Lordships of the Manors of Pooley in Warwickshire, and of Ashbourne. But in his later years he suffered financially,{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}} due to gambling.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} He sold Ashbourne Hall to Sir William Boothby (see [[Boothby baronets]]), in 1671 to pay creditors,{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}} and the family subsequently lost his manor at Pooley Hall in Warwickshire.  He died in poverty.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Works==
Cockayne is the author of ''A Masque at Bretbie,'' which was performed on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] of the Christmas season in 1639, and of ''Small Poems of Divers Sorts'', published in 1658. He also wrote plays: ''The Obstinate Lady,'' a comedy (first printed 1657), and ''Trappolin Suppos'd a Prince,'' a [[tragicomedy]] (printed 1658); and ''The Tragedy of Ovid'' (or ''Ovid's Tragedy'') (printed 1662). All three were published in one volume by [[Francis Kirkman]] in 1669. His works and his surviving letters constitute still-useful sources of information on the social and cultural affairs of mid-17th-century England.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!--for all the information in the paragraph-->

Cockayne's ''Small Poems'' collection of 1658 included verses to [[Humphrey Moseley]], publisher of the 1647 [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] folio. In that poem, Cockayne, a friend to both Massinger and Fletcher, noted that Massinger was part-author of many plays in the 1647 [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] folio—which eventually inspired a sweeping examination of the authorship problem in the canon of John Fletcher and his various collaborators.<ref>McGee, C.E., Magnusson, A. Lynne, eds., ''The Elizabethan Theatre XV: PART I: Collective Invention and Collaboration'', (Meany, Toronto, 2002); various articles.</ref> He dedicated his tragedy on [[Ovid]], to his cousin Charles Cotton.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!--for all the information in the paragraph-->

==Family==
He married Mary Kniveton, daughter of [[Kniveton baronets|Sir Gilbert Kniveton]] Baronet,{{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}} High Sheriff of Derbyshire.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Aston and Mary had 3 children:
A son, who died in his father's lifetime, leaving no issue; 
and two daughters, Mary and Isabella, who were co-heiresses. {{sfn|A. E. Cockayne|1863|p=223}}

Aston's titles and Lordships passed to main Cockayne family line; to Caleb Cockayne the male representative of the family proceeding from the sons of Sir Edward Cockayne, Sir Aston's grandfather.
