'''''''''Paolo Giacometti''' (1816â€“1882) was an Italian dramatist born at [[Novi Ligure]]. He was educated in law at [[Genoa]], but at the age of twenty had some success with his play ''Rosilda'' and then devoted himself to the stage. Depressed circumstances made him attach himself as author to various touring Italian companies, and his output was considerable; moreover, such actors as [[Adelaide Ristori|Ristori]], [[Ernesto Rossi (actor)|Rossi]] and [[Tommaso Salvini|Salvini]] made many of these plays great successes. Among the best of them were ''La Donna'' (1850), ''La Donna in seconde nozze'' (1851), ''Giuditta'' (1857), ''Sofocle'' (1860). ''La Morte civile'' (1861). A collection of his works was published at [[Milan]] in eight volumes (1859 et seq.).
His ''Marie Antoinette'' was written expressly for Ristori, and first staged in New York.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article244174971 |title=Madame Ristori as Marie Antoinette |newspaper=[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]] |issue=1079 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=21 September 1875 |accessdate=13 March 2021 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>
