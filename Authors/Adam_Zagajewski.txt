Adam Zagajewski was born in 1945 in [[Lviv|Lwów]] (now Lviv, Ukraine). His father was [[Tadeusz Zagajewski]] and his mother was Ludwika Zagajewska, ''née'' Turska. The Zagajewski family was [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)|expelled from Lwów]] to central Poland the same year as part of Soviet post-World War II policy. They moved to the city of [[Gliwice]] where he graduated from Andrzej Strug V High School (''V Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Andrzeja Struga''). Subsequently, he studied [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. He later taught philosophy at the [[AGH University of Science and Technology]]. In 1967, he made his poetic debut with ''Music'', a poem published in ''Życie Literackie'' magazine. He published his works as well as reviews in such magazines as ''Odra'' (1969–1976) and ''Twórczość'' (1969, 1971–1973).<ref name=culture>{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/adam-zagajewski|title=Adam zagajewski|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> During this time, he became involved in the ''New Wave'' (''Nowa fala'') literary movement also known as the Generation of '68'. The aim of the group was "standing up against the falsifications of reality and the appropriation of language by communist ideology and propaganda".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bookinstitute.pl/autorzy-detal,literatura-polska,3719,zagajewski-adam.html|title=Adam Zagajewski|access-date=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228122522/http://bookinstitute.pl/autorzy-detal,literatura-polska,3719,zagajewski-adam.html|archive-date=28 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> After signing the [[Letter of 59]] his works were banned by [[communism|communist]] authorities in Poland. In 1978, he was one of the founders and first lecturers of the Scientific Training Association. In 1982, he emigrated to [[Paris]], but in 2002 he returned to Poland together with his wife Maja Wodecka, and resided in [[Kraków]]. He was a member of the [[Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich|Polish Writers' Association]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Koziński |first1=Remigiusz |title=Odszedł esteta, eseista, poeta.

His literary works have received international recognition and have been translated into many languages.<ref name=culture/> Joachim T. Baer, a reviewer from ''[[World Literature Today]]'' pointed out that the recurring themes in Zagajewski's poetry include "the night, dreams, history and time, infinity and eternity, silence and death."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/adam-zagajewski|title=Adam Zagajewski|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> [[Colm Tóibín]] notes that in his best poems "he has succeeded in making the space of the imagination connect with experience; things seen and heard and remembered in all their limits and sorrow and relished joy have the same power for him as things conjured."<ref>{{cite news|author=Colm Tóibín|date=30 April 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/01/poetry.colmtoibin|title=Lvov Story|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> American poet [[Robert Pinsky]] observes that Zagajewski's poems are "about the presence of the past in ordinary life: history not as a chronicle of the dead … but as an immense, sometimes subtle force inhering in what people see and feel every day – and in the ways we see and feel". His poem ''"Try To Praise The Mutilated World"'' became famous when it was printed in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' shortly after the [[11 September attacks|September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/24/try-to-praise-the-mutilated-world |title=Try to Praise the Mutilated World|author=Adam Zagajewski|access-date=23 March 2021|date= 17 September 2001 |work=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast}}</ref><ref name=nobel>{{cite news |last= Scislowska|first=Monika|date= 22 March 2021|title= Acclaimed Polish poet Adam Zagajewski dies at age 75|url= https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/acclaimed-polish-poet-adam-zagajewski-dies-age-75-76603482|work= [[ABC News]]|access-date=22 March 2021}}</ref>
