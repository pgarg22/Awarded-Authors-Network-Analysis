==Biography==

Tomson Highway was born on 6 December 1951 in northwestern [[Manitoba]] to Balazee Highway and Joe Highway, a [[Caribou (North America)|caribou]] hunter and champion [[dogsled]] racer.<ref name=canenc>{{Cite web|last=Boyd|first=Colin|date=2017-06-29|title=Tomson Highway|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/highway-tomson|access-date=2021-11-04|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name="vankoeverden2021">{{Cite news|last=van Koeverden|first=Jane|date=2021-10-07|title=Tomson Highway's memoir, Permanent Astonishment, is written as 'a symphony to life'|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=https://www.cbc.ca/books/tomson-highway-s-memoir-permanent-astonishment-is-written-as-a-symphony-to-life-1.6199176|access-date=2021-11-03}}</ref> [[Cree]] is his first language and he was raised according to Cree tradition before being sent to [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]].<ref name="vankoeverden2021"/><ref>{{Cite web|last=Methot|first=Suzanne|date=November 1998|title=The universe of Tomson Highway|url=https://quillandquire.com/authors/the-universe-of-tomson-highway/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=[[Quill & Quire]]|language=en}}</ref> He is related to <!--Note: Sources conflict on whether he's Merasty's cousin or uncle; do not change this wording without a verifiable reference. --> actor/playwright [[Billy Merasty]].

When he was six, Tomson was taken from his family and sent to Guy Hill Indian Residential School. Until he was fifteen, he was allowed to return home only during the summer months.<ref name="Ostroff2015">{{cite web|last1=Ostroff|first1=Joshua|title=Tomson Highway Has A Surprisingly Positive Take On Residential Schools|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/12/15/tomson-highway-residential-schools_n_8787638.html|website=[[The Huffington Post Canada]]|access-date=4 March 2018|date=15 December 2015}}</ref>

Many children forced to attend such residential schools later reported abuse and terrible experiences, suffering because of being forced to abandon their languages and cultures. Highway has said that "Nine of the happiest years of my life I spent it at that school," crediting it with teaching him English and to play piano. He has said that "There are many very successful people today that went to those schools and have brilliant careers and are very functional people, very happy people like myself. I have a thriving international career, and it wouldn't have happened without that school."<ref name="Ostroff2015"/>

He obtained his B.A. in Honours [[Music]] in 1975 and his B.A. in English in 1976, both from the [[University of Western Ontario]].<ref name=canenc /> While working on his degree, he met playwright [[James Reaney]].<ref name=canenc /> For seven years, Highway worked as a social worker on [[Indian reserves|First Nations reserves]] across Canada. He also was involved in creating and organizing several indigenous music and arts festivals.<ref name=skallerup>Lee Skallerup, [http://canadian-writers.athabascau.ca/english/writers/thighway/thighway.php Tomson Highway]. [[Athabasca University]], February 12, 2015.</ref>

Drawing from these experiences, he has written novels and plays that have won him widespread recognition across Canada and around the world.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.tomsonhighway.com/biography.html www.tomsonhighway.com — official web-site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><!-- Need an independent Reliable Source, second person -->

In 1986, Highway published  ''[[The Rez Sisters]]'', which won multiple awards in productions across Canada. It also went to the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in 1988. In 1989, he published ''[[Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing]]'', which was the first Canadian play to receive a full production at [[Toronto]]'s [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]].

Both of these plays explore the native community on a fictional reserve of Wasychigan Hill on [[Manitoulin Island]]. ''The Rez Sisters'' depicts seven women of the community planning a trip to the "BIGGEST BINGO IN THE WORLD" in Toronto and features a male [[trickster]], called [[Nanabush]]. ''Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing'' depicts the men's interest in [[ice hockey]] and features a female trickster.  ''[[Rose (play)|Rose]]'', written in 2000, is the third play in the heptalogy, featuring characters from each of the previous plays.

Highway was artistic director of [[Native Earth Performing Arts]] in Toronto from 1986 to 1992,<ref name=skallerup/> as well as De-ba-jeh-mu-jig theatre group in Wikwemikong.

Frustrated with difficulties presented by [[Play (theatre)|play]] production, Highway wrote a novel called ''[[Kiss of the Fur Queen]]''.<ref name=skallerup/> The novel presents an uncompromising portrait of the [[sexual abuse]] of [[Indigenous peoples|Native]] children in [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] and its traumatic consequences. ''Kiss of the Fur Queen'' has won a number of awards and spent several weeks on top of Canadian bestseller lists.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

After a hiatus from playwriting, Highway wrote ''Ernestine Shuswap Gets Her Trout'' in 2005. Set in 1910, the play revolves around the visit of the "Big Kahoona of Canada" (then [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]]) to the [[Thompson River Valley]].

In 2010, Highway re-published ''The Rez Sisters'' and ''Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing'' in a Cree-language edition. Highway said that "the Cree versions [...] are actually the original versions. As it turns out, the original ones that came out 20 years ago were the translation."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2010/11/08/tomson-highway-cree389.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Tomson Highway releases plays in Cree | date=8 November 2010}}</ref>

His musical ''[[The (Post) Mistress]]'' premiered in 2009 as a [[cabaret]] titled ''Kisageetin''.<ref name=cabaret>[http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2009/jul/tomson_highway310709.aspx "Composer hopes cabaret will keep audience laughing"].

Highway divides his time between residences in [[Noelville, Ontario|Noelville]], [[Ontario]]<ref name=cabaret /> and in France with Raymond Lalonde, his partner of 29 years.<ref name="www.macleans.ca">[http://www.macleans.ca/2013/09/30/in-conversation-with-tomson-highway/ "In conversation with Tomson Highway"].

==Awards and recognition==

Highway has been awarded nine honorary degrees, from Brandon University, the University of Winnipeg, the University of Western Ontario (London), the University of Windsor, Laurentian University (Sudbury, Ontario), Lakehead University (Thunder Bay, Ontario), l'Universite de Montreal, University of Manitoba, and the University of Toronto. In addition, he holds two "equivalents" of such honours: from The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto and The National Theatre School in Montreal.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In 1994, he was made a member of the [[Order of Canada]]. In 1998, ''[[Maclean's Magazine|Maclean's]]'' named him as one of the '100 most important people in Canadian history'. In 2001, he received a [[Indspire Awards|National Indigenous Achievement Award]], now the Indspire Awards, in the field of arts and culture.

Although Highway is considered one of Canada's most important playwrights,<ref name=canenc /> in recent years both theatre critics and Highway have noted a significant gap between his reputation and the relative infrequency of his plays being produced by theatre companies.<ref name="www.macleans.ca"/> According to Highway, theatres frequently face or perceive difficulty in finding a suitable cast of First Nations actors, but are reluctant to risk casting non-Indigenous performers due to their sensitivity to being accused of [[cultural appropriation]]. He believes that such companies simply pass over his plays instead.<ref name=colourblind>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/theatre/a-new-staging-of-the-rez-sisters-defies-political-correctness/article2229640/ "A new staging of 'The Rez Sisters' defies political correctness"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 9, 2011.</ref>

In 2011, director Ken Gass mounted a production of ''The Rez Sisters'' at Toronto's [[Factory Theatre]]. As part of an ongoing research project into the effects of [[colour-blind casting]] on theatre, he staged two readings of the play — one with an exclusively First Nations cast and one with a colour-blind cast of actors from a variety of racial backgrounds — before mounting a full colour-blind stage production.<ref name=colourblind />

His memoir ''Permanent Astonishment'' was the winner of the 2021 [[Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction]].<ref>Jane van Koeverden, [https://www.cbc.ca/books/katherena-vermette-tomson-highway-and-cherie-dimaline-among-winners-at-2021-writers-trust-awards-1.6234384 "Katherena Vermette, Tomson Highway and Cherie Dimaline among winners at 2021 Writers' Trust Awards"].
