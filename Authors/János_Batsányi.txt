'''János Batsányi''' (9 May 1763 in [[Tapolca]] – 12 May 1845 in [[Linz]]) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[poetry|poet]].

In 1785, he published his first work, a [[patriotism|patriotic]] poem, "The Valour of the Magyars". In the same year he obtained a job as clerk in the treasury of the Hungarian city of Kassa ([[Košice]]), and there, in conjunction with other two Hungarian patriots, edited the ''[[Magyar Museum]]'', which was suppressed by the government in 1792.

In the following year he was deprived of his clerkship and in 1794, having taken part in the conspiracy of [[Ignác Martinovics]], he was thrown into the state prison of the [[Kufstein Fortress]], where he remained for two years.

After his release, he took a considerable share in the ''Magyar Minerva'', a literary review, and then proceeded to [[Vienna]], where he obtained a post in the bank. He married [[Gabriella Baumberg]],<ref>aka [[Gabriele von Baumberg]]</ref> a renowned poet from Vienna in 1805. Four years later he translated [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s proclamation to the Hungarians, and, in consequence of this anti-[[Habsburg]] act, had to take refuge in [[Paris]].

After the fall of Napoleon he was given up to the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]], who allowed him to reside at [[Linz]] until his death, on condition that he never left town. He published a collection of poems at Pest in 1827 and also edited the poetical works of [[Pál Ányos|Ányos]] and [[Faludi]].
