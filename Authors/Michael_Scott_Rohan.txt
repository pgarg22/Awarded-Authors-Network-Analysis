'''Michael Scott Rohan''' (22 January 1951 – 12 August 2018)<ref name=obit/> was a Scottish [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] author and writer on opera.

He had a number of short stories published before his first books, the science fiction novel ''[[Run to the Stars]]'' and the non-fiction ''[[First Byte]]''. He then collaborated with [[Allan J. Scott]] on the nonfiction ''[[The Hammer and The Cross (Rohan novel)|The Hammer and The Cross]]'' (an account of [[Christianity]] arriving in [[Viking]] lands, not to be confused with [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s similarly-themed novel trilogy of the same name) and the fantasy novels ''[[The Ice King (novel)|The Ice King]]'' and ''[[A Spell of Empire]]''.

Rohan is best known for the trilogy ''[[The Winter of the World]]'', set in the [[Ice Age]]. He also wrote the ''[[Spiral (novel series)|Spiral]]'' novels, in which our world is the Hub, or Core, of a [[spiral]] of mythic and [[legend]]ary versions of familiar cities, countries and continents.

In the "Author's Note" to ''[[The Lord of Middle Air]]'', Rohan asserted that he and [[Walter Scott]] have a common ancestor in [[Michael Scot]], who is a character in the novel.

According to his entry on the website of the [[Little, Brown Book Group]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Scott Rohan profile on Little,Brown Book Group site|url=http://www.littlebrown.co.uk/Authors/Q-R/571|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|accessdate=21 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813044205/https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/Authors/Q-R/571|archive-date=13 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> "after many years in [[Oxford]] and [[Yorkshire]] (they moved to [[Leeds]] in 1984),<ref name=biog>{{cite web|title=Who is Michael Scott Rohan, anyway?|url=http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/mike.scott.rohan/biog/biog_index.htm|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> he and his [[United States|American]] wife Deborah (Archives Conservator for [[Cambridgeshire]])<ref name=biog/> lived (as of 1994)<ref name=biog/> in a small village near [[Cambridge]], next to the pub."

==Family origins==
His father was of French origin, born on [[Mauritius]] but educated in France, and later studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. During [[World War II]] he joined the [[British Army]]. His mother came from the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]].<ref name=biog/>

==Early life==
Rohan was born in 1951 in Edinburgh, in, apparently, the house next door to that of the author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He was educated at the [[Edinburgh Academy]] and [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] University where, having initially planned to study English, changed to study [[law]]. It was during his time as a student that he joined the Science Fiction group. Here he met the Group's president, Allan Scott, who would later become his co-author of several books. He also met his future wife, [[Philadelphia]] native and [[Stanford]] post-graduate Deborah, through the Group. The couple married in 1977.<ref name=biog/>

==Professional life and writing==
He asserted that during his time studying, and after, he held various casual jobs, including "librarian, software technical writer, editor, translator, and shipping rare botanical specimens around the world". Achieving his Masters in 1973, Rohan left the legal field and went to work for an international publishing firm editing encyclopedias. This job he held for five years, until taking voluntary redundancy in 1978. It was at this point he began writing some of the works for which he is now best known – The Hammer and the Cross and Run to the Stars.<ref name=biog/>

==Illness==
Rohan was diagnosed with an incurable illness in 2000, and after that, stopped writing fiction.<ref name=obit>{{cite web |title=Michael Scott Rohan (1951-2018) |url=https://locusmag.com/2018/08/michael-scott-rohan-1951-2018/ |work=[[Locus Magazine]] |date=14 August 2018 |access-date=26 October 2021}}</ref> He died in Edinburgh on 12 August 2018, aged 67.<ref name=obit/>

==Interests==
Rohan "from an early age ... read voraciously, everything from Dan Dare to the Larousse Mythology, [[Conan Doyle]], [[C. S. Lewis]] ([[Out of the Silent Planet]], not [[Narnia]]), [[Tolkien]], and his older sister's copy of [[Lady Chatterley]]". He had interests in anthropology, history, [[archaeology]] (which had extended to participating in excavations), and [[palaeontology]], but also cinema, [[hifi]], and home entertainment. He was for two years a columnist for the London Times, and also at one time "a music journalist, a columnist and reviewer for Music Magazine and Opera Now in its first two years", and a regular contributor to "Classic CD, International Opera Collector, and others, as well as creating and editing The Classical Video Guide (1994)".<ref name=biog/> As of 2011, he was still contributing to opera publications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opera.co.uk|url=http://www.opera.co.uk/product.php?productID=116&categoryID=19&PHPSESSID=5118bda3fa3e3cdc9f815cdb44017044|publisher=Opera|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>

He enjoyed classical music and cited amongst his favourite composers [[Richard Wagner]] (and rated himself an authority on opera), [[Mozart]], [[Sibelius]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]].<ref name=biog/>

He spoke [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], and a little [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and was trying to learn [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref name=biog/>

He briefly played guitar and sang in a folk-rock band.<ref name=biog/>

He and his wife enjoyed archery and shared "a strong interest in wildlife conservation", particularly singling out the [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]].<ref name=biog/>
