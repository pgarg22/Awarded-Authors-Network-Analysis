'''Gáspár Nagy''' (May 4, 1949, [[Bérbaltavár]] – January 4, 2007, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[poet]] and [[writer]].

==Life==
He graduated from the Benedictine Grammar School of Pannonhalma where he studied Library Science in [[Szombathely]], then Aesthetics and Sociology in Budapest.
 
He was editor of Móra Ferenc Publishing House (1976–1980), secretary of Hungarian Writer’s Association (1981–85), co-editor, with [[Sándor Csoóri]], of ''Hitel'' the first legally permitted oppositional periodical (1988–2007) and literary editor of the [[Hungarian Catholic Radio]] (2003–2007). 
In 1974, he married Marta Szabo; they had one son, and two daughters.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gaspar-nagy-432313.html| title=Gaspar Nagy:Dissident Hungarian poet| work=The Independent| author=George Gömöri | date=16 January 2007 }}</ref>

From the very beginning his poetry was determined by the ideas of the two important facts of the Central-European history: 1956 and 1968. The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Budapest Autumn]] and the [[Prague Spring]] motivated him to protest against the Communist dictatorship and his poems stimulated the democratic changes in Hungary in 1989. His legendary “political system changing” poem "Öröknyár, elmúltam kilenc éves", (Eternal Summer: I’m Over Nine) was published in 1984 in the October issue of the Új Forrás  periodical. The brave poem was about the unmarked grave of [[Imre Nagy]] (he was the executed prime minister in the [[1956 revolution]]), and about the unnamed murderers.
<poem style="margin-left:2em">
One day he must be buried
and we must not forget
to appo'''IN'''t the murderers!
</poem>

The hidden initials of [[Imre Nagy]] ('''NI''' - in Hungary the [[given name]] traditionally comes after the [[family name]]) appear in the last two letters of each line. This hidden meaning escaped the notice of the [[Censorship|censor]]s and the poem was published. The authorities retaliated, stripping him of his post as Secretary to the Hungarian Writers Union.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gaspar-nagy-432313.html| title=Gaspar Nagy:Dissident Hungarian poet| work=The Independent| author=George Gömöri | date=16 January 2007 }}</ref>
