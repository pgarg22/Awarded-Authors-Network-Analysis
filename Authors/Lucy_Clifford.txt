'''Lucy Clifford''' (2 August 1846 – 21 April 1929), better known as '''Mrs. W. K. Clifford''', was an English novelist, playwright and journalist.

== Biography ==
Lucy Clifford was born '''Lucy Lane''' in London,<ref>{{Cite book |author=Chisholm, M. |title=Such Silver Currents |year=2002 |publisher=The Lutterworth Press |location=Cambridge |pages=8 |isbn=0-7188-3017-2}}</ref> the daughter of John Lane of [[Barbados]]. She married the mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] in 1875.

After his death in 1879, she earned a prominent place in English literary life as a novelist, and later as a dramatist. Her best-known story, ''Mrs . Keith's Crime'' (1885), centres  on [[euthanasia]].<ref>''XIX Century Fiction''. Part I: A–K. Jarndyce Bloomsbury, 2019.</ref> It was followed by several other volumes, such as ''Aunt Anne'' (1892). She also wrote ''The Last Touches and Other Stories'' (1892) and ''Mere Stories '' (1896), and several plays between 1898 and 1925.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Allardyce |title=English drama, 1900-1930; the beginnings of the modern period |url=https://archive.org/details/englishdrama190000alla |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |isbn=0-521-08416-4 |location=Cambridge [England] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/englishdrama190000alla/page/564 564] |oclc=588815}}</ref> She is perhaps most often remembered as the author of ''The Anyhow Stories, Moral and Otherwise'' (1882), a collection of stories she had written for her own children.

Lucy Clifford also wrote cinematic adaptations of her short stories and plays. At least two films were produced from these: ''The Likeness of the Night'' (1922), directed by Percy Nash, and ''Eve's Lover'' (1925), directed by [[Roy Del Ruth]].

Her wide circle of literary friends included [[Henry James]]. She had two children. Her daughter Ethel Clifford (died 1959), later Lady Dilke as the wife of Sir Fisher Wentworth Dilke, 4th [[Dilke baronets|Baronet]] (1877–1944), was a published poet.

Lucy Clifford died in 1929, and was buried alongside her husband on the eastern side of [[Highgate Cemetery]], London.

In 2004 Gowan Dawson described Lucy's efforts to uphold the reputation of Clifford after his death:
:...Clifford's disconsolate widow and two young daughters had been left totally unprovided for, and, notwithstanding a subsequent Testimonial Fund and Civil List pension, it was necessary for Lucy Clifford, who now owned the copyright of her late husband's works, to maximise the potential sales of his posthumous publications, not only by keeping Clifford in the public eye, but by ensuring that it was a generally positive (and thus marketable) portrayal of him that was presented.
