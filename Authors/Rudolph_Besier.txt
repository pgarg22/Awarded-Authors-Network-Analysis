'''Rudolf Wilhelm Besier''' (2 July 1878 – 16 June 1942) was a Dutch/English dramatist and translator best known for his play ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' (1930). He worked with [[H. G. Wells]], [[Hugh Walpole]] and [[May Edginton]] on dramatisations.

==Early life and career==
Besier was born in [[Blitar]], [[East Java]] ([[Dutch East Indies]]), in 1878 as the son of an English mother, Margaret Ann Collinson, and the Dutch soldier Rudolf Wilhelm Besier, who died six months before he was born and after whom he was named.<ref>[https://www.genealogieonline.nl/stamboom-indische-bikken/P2388.php Genealogy site]</ref>
He had some limited success early in his career in England, which began with ''The Virgin Goddess'' (1906) produced by [[Otho Stuart]] and with music by [[Christopher Wilson (composer)|Christopher Wilson]].<ref>Wearing, J.P.

==Major success==
Besier's major success came with ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' (1930), based on [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]] and [[Robert Browning]]'s courtship. After being rejected by two London producers, it premièred at the [[The Malvern Festival (1929-1939)|Malvern Festival]] of 1930, directed by Sir [[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]]. Besier failed to interest American producers, 27 of whom rejected his play, but the actress [[Katharine Cornell]] took a personal interest in it. She had it staged in Cleveland in 1931, and then in New York.<ref name=mcg>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VGNJxj9qnEkC&pg=PA344&lpg=PA344&dq=rudolph+besier&source=bl&ots=kbFI4NkC6B&sig=0LThog_B7EB4ubKliP2_w-JrzOk&hl=en&ei=MNKwTdfvO4TUvQONpbCSBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&q=rudolph%20besier&f=false Stanley Hochman, McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama]</ref> It was revived and produced in many countries, and was made into two films and a musical.
