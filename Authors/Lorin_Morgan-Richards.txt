Morgan-Richards was born in [[Beebetown, Ohio]], and is of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] ([[Amish]]) and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.

==Early years==
Richards was raised in an old converted one-room schoolhouse in [[Beebetown, Ohio]], that had a well for water. His mother (a student of fine art) taught him the basics of drawing and music composition on the family pump organ. Richards also credited his imagination on the plentiful books his family owned, creative isolation, and the sheer number of animals they took care of, many of which he incorporated into his early drawings and writings.<ref name="issuu1">{{cite web|date=2014-07-01|title=Celts in California|url=http://issuu.com/jamesmichaelmcdonough/docs/irish_a_e_for_digital|access-date=2014-08-05|publisher=Irish Arts & Entertainment}}</ref>

Richards interest in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[American frontier|American Western]] history began in childhood. "I remember my first book as a child was ''The Indians Knew'' by [[Tillie S. Pine]], an early reader from 1965 explaining the cultural ways and historical resourcefulness of Native Americans and how they are applied in the sciences today."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-weekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lrbw032616.pdf |title=Welsh in the Old West: More than you thought |publisher=British Weekly |date=2016-03-26 |access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>

When Richards entered second grade, he was diagnosed with a form of [[dyslexia]] that required tutoring through the ninth grade. By his early teens, he was reading and became inspired by [[Edward Lear]], [[L. Frank Baum]], [[Roald Dahl]], and [[Lewis Carroll]]; helping him overcome his reading disability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/feature-dark-letter-days-by-lorin-morgan-richards/ |title=Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |website=SteamKat.com |date=2016-04-09 |access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref>

==Theater==
[[File:Still photo from NYC Premiere of 'An Occurrence Remembered' directed by Lorin Morgan-Richards, 2001.jpg|thumb|Still photo from NYC Premiere of ''An Occurrence Remembered'' directed by Lorin Morgan-Richards, 2001]]Between 1993-2003, Richards received an [[Associate degree|AA Degree]] in [[Liberal Arts]] at [[Cuyahoga Community College]] and credited his [[Anthropology]] Professor Mark Lewine as a mentor. During this time, Richards also achieved minor success in producing music projects containing modern dance and theater, and befriended and collaborated with artist [[Textbeak]]. "I first attended Tri-C Western campus where my focus was on Liberal Arts. At the time, I kept a journal of random thoughts, doodles, and lyrics and used the filter of music as my art. So, the bulk of my classes were in this field of study. I made connections with other artists who shared similar passions, and we were all eager to form various projects of expression. I moved to [[Lakewood, Ohio|Lakewood]] to be closer to the performance spaces and switched to Tri-C Metro where I was awakened out of my shell by an Anthropology teacher named Dr. Mark Lewine."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cacho |first=Daniela |url=http://www.cccvoice.com/2018/02/26/one-of-many-tri-c-alumni-contains-a-creator-of-childrens-literature/ |title=One of many Tri-C Alumni Contains a Creator of Children's Literature – The Voice |website=Cccvoice.com |date=2015-02-13 |access-date=2018-02-27}}</ref> In 1999, Richards solo album ''ENKI'' and subsequent live production were based on [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s book ''[[The Twelfth Planet]]''.<ref>Scene Magazine, 2000 Scene Magazine Music Awards, Erick Trickey, published 27 April 2000</ref><ref>Last Sigh Magazine, Enki, by Tek, published 28 May 2000</ref><ref>The Cleveland Free Times, The Power of ENKI, by Laura DeMarco, Published 17–23 November 1999</ref> The show premiered in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] under the choreography of Michael Medcalf. Native American musical act Shouting Mountain opened the evening. In 2001, Richards followed the success of ''ENKI'' with the production of ''An Occurrence Remembered'', influenced by the metaphysical war writings of [[Ambrose Bierce]]. The performance premiered in [[New York City]].<ref>Civil War Times Illustrated, December 2001</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ambrosebierce.org/journal4zaffino.html|title=Kyle Zaffino Reviews a Concept Album by Lorin Morgan-Richards|website=Ambrosebierce.org}}</ref> Richards reflects on the performance: "Rehearsals were underway when 9-11 happened and I recall we continued only for our own therapy of the situation, knowing theater-goers were not going out. It was a tremendous performance, but it financially broke me."<ref name="autogenerated1">Golwg360, 21 January 2016, Welsh language newspaper.</ref>

Richards calls his synth music "Dark Electronic Storytelling" as it is conceptually based on written works and is meant for dramatic performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.darktwincities.com/reviews.php?review=60 |title=Reviews |website=Darktwincities.com |date=2008-10-04 |access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref>

Richards announced on social media in June 2018 that he was re-releasing previous albums and upcoming tracks under the new moniker ''Elder Moon''.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1007344454926135296|user=LMorganRichards|title=I will be rereleasing my past albums and upcoming tracks as my new songwriting moniker Elder Moon.

==Writing career==
In 2002, Richards moved to [[Los Angeles]] to start over where he refocused his artistic direction into writing and illustrating, which he said: "did not need the expenses of my past but only a pen and paper."<ref>Gothic Beauty Magazine, Issue 31, 2010</ref> While his novel ''[[Me’ma and the Great Mountain]]'' (2012) began drafts as early as 2002, it was ''[[Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories]]'' that became his first book release in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lamkin|first=Elaine|date=2010-01-29|title=Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories (Book) {{!}} Horror Movie, DVD, & Book Reviews, News, Interviews at Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/simon-snootle-and-other-small-stories-book|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129081753/http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/simon-snootle-and-other-small-stories-book|archive-date=29 January 2010}}</ref><ref>Disdeinen.net, 13 October 2009</ref>

The following year Richards delivered four new releases including his second book of short stories in ''[[A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels]]''.

Richards conceptualized most of ''[[The Goodbye Family]]'' characters in 2009 during a trip to the UK and France with his wife, although they were mentioned before this in his western novel ''Me’ma and the Great Mountain''. Richards explains "I took a diary on the trip in order to write my second novel ''The Goodbye Family''.[[File:Orphie Goodbye Family Lorin Morgan-Richards.jpg|thumb|Orphie from ''The Goodbye Family'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards]]

The Goodbye family consisted of undertakers Otis and Pyridine, their daughter Orphie and her pet tarantula Dorian. Orphie was first seen atop the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] with gargoyles, Otis was trying to board a train at customs with a shrunken head, Pyridine was sewing a limb back together in [[Cardiff]], and Dorian was capturing a fairy to eat. Following these illustrations, a cat Ouiji was unveiled and Orphie is said to have a brother named Kepla, but he is hardly ever seen and it is unclear if he even exists."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/goodbyeanniversary-2/ |title=An Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |website=SteamKat.com|date=2016-11-28 |access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>

Between 2009 and 2013, Richards was bookbinding his limited edition versions of each title with runs equaling 50 to 400. These collectible books were typically [[Oversewn binding|oversewn]] by hand with a faux leather hard backing and linen pages inside. In an interview he states:

"Having seen what is being printed by majors these days with poor quality paper, I wanted to provide the reader with a book that carries more value near the same price and that can last for generations. Nothing would be more inspiring to me than to know my books are treasured like an heirloom."

Stylistically, Richards prefers a pencil and ink approach to his illustrations, and his writing often has elements of dark satire. Many of his stories also have a strong [[Environmentalism|environmental message]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200227172800/https://www.patreon.com/posts/patreon-with-34254480]</ref>

Between 2015 and 2018 Richards ran two weekly cartoons on Steamkat, a comic strip site, ''The Goodbye Family'' and ''The Noodle Rut''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/ |title=Home |website=SteamKat.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> Richards won the 2016 Official Tasty Nugget award for his illustrated story ''Sad Lost Doll''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tastynuggets.com/morgan-richards |title=Tasty Nuggets Banjo's Hollywood |website=Tastynuggets.com |date=2016-11-01 |access-date=2016-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111060737/http://tastynuggets.com/morgan-richards |archive-date=11 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[File:Marcil d'Hirson Garron.jpg|thumb|''Homeless child studies under the moonlight'' by Marcil d'Hirson Garron]] Since 2018, Richards has syndicated his series ''The Goodbye Family'' on [[Tapas (syndicate)|Tapas]] as well as through his social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tapas.io/series/The-Goodbye-Family|title=The Goodbye Family &#124; Tapas|website=Tapas.io|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> In 2021, Richards created ''The Goodbye Family: The Animated Series''.<ref>http://voyagela.com/interview/conversations-with-orphie-goodbye/</ref>

===The Goodbye Family===
{{Main|The Goodbye Family}}[[File:Down_West_by_Lorin_Morgan-Richards.jpg|thumb|right|''Down West'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards]]
Since 2017, Richards has released his comic collections on a nearly quarterly basis, growing his audience, and solely focusing on The Goodbye Family and his Weird West brand. In an interview in 2019, he announced an early 2020 release of his second novel ''[[The Goodbye Family#The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain|The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain]]'' saying:

<blockquote>It follows the lives of Weird West undertakers Otis, Pyridine, and their daughter Orphie. Pyridine is a witch and matriarch mortician, Otis is a brainless but bold hearse driver, and Orphie is appointed grave digger for her strength of twenty men. Through bumbling Otis discovers his neighbors are turning into zombies, a mystery that is directly affecting their burial business. In their backyard cemetery they travel to the underworld for answers and uncover a plot to surface the evil entities, that would otherwise burn in the Lake of Fire, have risen again through oil pumps that are being bottled as a tonic medicine for the ground above. The tonic is consumed and the host fully takes over the body when the body perishes. Can the Goodbyes hilarious gaffes and revelations plug up the works?<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfreads.com/interview-with-author-lorin-morgan-richards/,%20https://www.nfreads.com/interview-with-author-lorin-morgan-richards/|title=Interview With Author Lorin Morgan-Richards|website=Nfreads.com}}</ref></blockquote>

==A Raven Above Press==
A Raven Above Press was founded in 2009 by Richards with a focus on printing his illustrated stories and promoting other authors and illustrators of Celtic and Native American origin. The press also became a catalyst for producing cultural events and art exhibits. Notably, the [[Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesworldwide.org/2014/02/welsh-artists-to-descend-on-hollywood-this-coming-st-davids-day/ |title=Welsh artists to descend on Hollywood this coming St David's Day |publisher=Wales World Wide |date=2014-02-10 |access-date=2014-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034417/http://www.walesworldwide.org/2014/02/welsh-artists-to-descend-on-hollywood-this-coming-st-davids-day/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 1 August 2013, [[Celtic Family Magazine]] hit the newsstands with a release party in Cardiff, Wales.<ref name="issuu1"/> Richards was the founder and publisher of Celtic Family Magazine from its inception in 2013 to its hiatus in 2017.

Richards would produce a book for every Welsh event he curated through A Raven Above Press. Outside of including his own illustration, these books often had American and Welsh artists depict the subject matter. Notable artists involved were Jen Delyth, [[Ruth Jên]], [[Siobhan Owen]], [[Monica Richards]], [[Nichola and Sarah Hope]], and [[Nathan Wyburn]] to name a few. The following is a list of these books: 
* <small>''A Welsh Alphabet'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards and Peter Anthony Freeman (2010) in conjunction with the 2011 West Coast Eisteddfod.</small>
* <small>''The Children's Voice: A Definitive Collection of Welsh Nursery Rhymes'' by Peter Anthony Freeman (2012) in conjunction with the 2012 Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival.</small>

===Native American Involvement===
[[File:Lorin Morgan-Richards speaking at Bringing the Circle Together.jpg|thumb|Lorin Morgan-Richards speaking at Bringing the Circle Together]] Richards speaking on the history books he read in grade school: "Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. I remembered seeing at a very early age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief [[Spotted Elk]] (Bigfoot) and he was part of the [[massacre at Wounded Knee]]. That photo has always stuck with me. I knew something was not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story."<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

====Bringing the Circle Together====
{{Main|Bringing the Circle Together}}
[[File:Western children's author Lorin Morgan-Richards with his daughter Berlin.jpg|thumb|Lorin Morgan-Richards with his daughter Berlin]] Between 2008 and 2012, Richards partnered with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and Indigenous groups in Los Angeles to establish ''[[Bringing the Circle Together]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://feministmagazine.org/2009/03/mar-18-on-fm/ |title=Mar 18 on FM: Women's Month, Bridge City & So.

The series offered a central gathering place to screen documentaries by and about Indigenous people while providing historical narratives with guest speakers, and art and cultural demonstrations. Special guests included [[Makana (musician)|Makana]], [[Saginaw Grant]], [[Douglas Miles]], [[Blase Bonpane]], among others.

The film series in partnership with AIM Santa Barbara held a community birthday celebration at Nahui Ohlin in Los Angeles for [[Leonard Peltier]] on 12 September 2009, with an update on his status and how the public could get involved to petition his release. Richards spoke to a reporter: "This is all grassroots. Everyone's voice counts. The time is now because Barack Obama, our president, had said it's not the president that actually makes the change, it's going to be our pressure upon the president that will make the change."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la.indymedia.org/news/2009/09/230316.php |title=Rally for Leonard Peltier : LA IMC |website=La.indymedia.org |access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> The event was followed in December by a screening of ''Warrior: The Life of Leonard Peltier'' with discussion afterward by Ben Carnes, members of AIM Santa Barbara, as well as friends and family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/events/2009/12/ |title=Events &#124; Japanese American National Museum |website=Janm.org |access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>

===Celtic involvement===
[[File:Author and illustrator Lorin Morgan-Richards in Old Town San Diego (33520541991).jpg|thumb|Author and illustrator Lorin Morgan-Richards]]
Richards became heavily involved in the Welsh-American community after the closure of the [[Welsh Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles)|Welsh Presbyterian Church]] in December 2012.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} Before this, Richards had helped coordinate an [[Eisteddfod]] at Barnsdall Art Park in 2011. Feeling a need to fill the void of losing the church as a cultural center, Richards founded the [[Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival]], an annual event taking place on or around 1 March celebrating Wales. The first festival took place on 1 March 2013. Singer and harpist [[Siobhan Owen]] headlined the large-scale event. In conjunction with the festival, Richards began producing [[Celtic Family Magazine]], a nationally distributed print and digital publication on Celtic interests.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barton |first=Cath |url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/the-welsh-in-america/ |title=The Welsh in America |date=31 October 2013 |publisher=Wales Arts Review |access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>

Richards considers himself a [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]], stating that:
