Three books were books of the year in ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]''. ''What the Water Gave Me'' was shortlisted for the Wales Book of the Year. Petit has been shortlisted for the [[Forward Prize]] and in 2001 she was one of ten poets commissioned by [[BBC Radio 4]] to write a poem for [[National Poetry Day]]. In 2004, she was selected by the Poetry Book Society as one of the [[Next Generation Poets]]. ''The Zoo Father'' is published in a bilingual edition in Mexico and distributed in Spain and Latin America. She has received many awards, including the Cholmondeley Award, four from Arts Council England and three from the Society of Authors.

She was Poetry Editor of ''[[Poetry London]]'' from 1990 to 2005, a [[Royal Literary Fund]] Fellow at [[Middlesex University]] from 2007 to 2009 and a Royal Literary Fund Fellow at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in 2011–12.

In 2018 Petit became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].

The Australian poet [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] has praised her work in ''The Times Literary Supplement'', where he wrote: "No other British poet I am aware of can match the powerful mythic imagination of Pascale Petit." [[Jackie Kay]] in ''The Observer'' wrote: "Pascale's poems are as fresh as paint, and make you look all over again at Frida and her brilliant and tragic life." [[Ruth Padel]], reviewing ''What the Water Gave Me: Poems after Frida Kahlo'' in ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "Petit's collection is not a verse biography, but a hard-hitting, palette-knife evocation of the effect that bus crash had on Kahlo's life and work. 'And this is how I started painting. / Time stretched out its spectrum / and screeched its brakes.' WH Auden, in his elegy for [[Yeats]], tells the Irish poet: 'Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.' Petit's collection, exploring the way trauma hurts an artist into creation, celebrates the rebarbative energy with which Kahlo redeemed pain and transformed it into paint."
