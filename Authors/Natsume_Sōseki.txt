{{nihongo|'''Natsume Sōseki'''|夏目 漱石|extra=9 February 1867&nbsp;– 9 December 1916}}, born '''{{nihongo|Natsume Kin'nosuke|夏目 金之助}}''', was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] novelist. He is best known around the world for his novels ''[[Kokoro]]'', ''[[Botchan]]'', ''[[I Am a Cat]]'', ''[[Kusamakura (novel)|Kusamakura]]'' and his unfinished work ''[[Light and Darkness (novel)|Light and Darkness]]''. He was also a scholar of [[British literature]] and writer of [[haiku]], ''[[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'', and [[fairy tale]]s. From 1984 until 2004, his portrait appeared on the front of the Japanese [[Banknotes of the Japanese yen|1000 yen note]].

==Early years==
Born in 1867 as Natsume Kinnosuke in the town of Babashita in the [[Edo]] region of Ushigome (present Kikui, [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]]), Sōseki began his life as an unwanted child, born to his mother late in her life, forty years old and his father then fifty-three.<ref name="edwin">{{cite book | author=McClellan, Edwin | title= Two Japanese Novelists: Sōseki & Tōson  | publisher= Tuttle Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-8048-3340-0}}</ref> When he was born, he already had five siblings. Having five children and a toddler had created family insecurity and was in some ways a disgrace to the Natsume family.<ref name="edwin"/> A childless couple, Shiobara Masanosuke and his wife, adopted him in 1868 and raised him until the age of nine, when the couple divorced.<ref name="edwin"/> He returned to his biological family and was welcomed by his mother although regarded as a nuisance by his father. His mother died when he was fourteen, and his two eldest brothers died in 1887, intensifying his sense of insecurity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Sōseki attended the First Tokyo Middle School (now [[Hibiya High School]]),<ref>{{cite book|title=新書で入門 漱石と鴎外 (A pocket paperback == introduction: Natsume and Ōgai)|last=Takahashi|first=Akio|isbn=978-4-10-610179-3|year=2006|publisher=Shinchosha}}</ref> where he became enamored with [[Chinese literature]], and fancied that he might someday become a writer. His desire to become an author arose when he was about fifteen when he told his older brother about his interest in literature.<ref name="edwin"/> However, his family disapproved strongly of this course of action, and when Sōseki entered the [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] in September 1884, it was with the intention of becoming an architect. Although he preferred [[Chinese classics]], he started studying English at that time, feeling that it might prove useful to him in his future career, as English was a necessity in Japanese college.<ref name="edwin"/>

In 1887, Sōseki met [[Masaoka Shiki]], a friend who would give him encouragement on the path to becoming a writer, which would ultimately be his career. Shiki tutored him in the art of composing [[haiku]]. From this point on, he began signing his poems with the name Sōseki, which is a Chinese idiom meaning "stubborn". In 1890, he entered the English Literature department, and quickly mastered the English language. In 1891 he produced a partial English translation of the classical work ''[[Hōjōki]]''<ref name="keene 308">Keene 1998 : 308.</ref> upon request by his then English literature professor [[James Main Dixon]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.15055/00007202 |title=Natsume Sōseki's English Translation of Hōjōki : Characteristics and Strategies |first=Pradhan |last=Gouranga |journal=Japan Review |pages=69–88 |issn=0915-0986 |publisher=International Research Center for Japanese Studies |year=2019}}</ref>  Sōseki graduated in 1893, and enrolled for some time as a graduate student and part-time teacher at the Tokyo Normal School.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 1895, Sōseki began teaching at [[Matsuyama Middle School]] in [[Shikoku]], which became the setting of his novel ''[[Botchan]]''. Along with fulfilling his teaching duties, Sōseki published haiku and Chinese poetry in a number of newspapers and periodicals. He resigned his post in 1896, and began teaching at the Fifth High School in [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]]. On June 10 of that year, he married Nakane Kyōko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.tohoku.ac.jp/en/collections/soseki/life.html|title=Soseki's Life {{!}} Tohoku University Library|website=www.library.tohoku.ac.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref>

[[File:Natsume Soseki house Clapham.jpg|thumb|right|Natsume Sōseki's lodgings in [[Clapham]], South London]]

==In the United Kingdom, 1901–1903==
In 1900, the Japanese government sent Sōseki to study in Great Britain as "Japan's first Japanese English literary scholar".<ref>Brodey and Tsunematsu p.7</ref> He visited [[Cambridge]] and stayed a night there, but gave up the idea of studying at the university because he could not afford it on his government scholarship.<ref>Brodey and Tsunematsu p.8</ref> He studied instead at [[University College London]] (UCL). He had a miserable time in [[London]], spending most of his days indoors buried in books, and his friends feared that he might be losing his mind.<ref>Introduction, p.V {{cite book | author=Natsume Soseki | title=I Am A Cat  | publisher= Tuttle Publishing | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8048-3265-6}}</ref> He also visited [[Pitlochry]] in Scotland, where he lodged with John Henry Dixon at the Dundarach Hotel.

He lived in four different lodgings: 76 Gower Street, near the British Museum; 85 Priory Road, West Hampstead; 6 Flodden Road, Camberwell; and 81 The Chase, Clapham (see the photograph). Only the last of these addresses, where he lodged with Priscilla Leale and her sister Elizabeth, proved satisfactory. Five years later, in his preface to ''Bungakuron'' (''The Criticism of Literature''), he wrote about the period:
{{quote|The two years I spent in London were the most unpleasant years in my life. Among English gentlemen I lived in misery, like a poor dog that had strayed among a pack of wolves.<ref>''Theory of Literature'', May 1907, introduction</ref>}}

He got along well with Priscilla, who shared his love of literature, notably Shakespeare and Milton (his tutor at UCL was the Shakespeare scholar [[William James Craig|W. J. Craig]]),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Natsume|first1=Sōseki|last2=Tsunematsu|first2=Ikuo|title=Spring miscellany and London essays|year=2002|publisher=Tuttle|location=Rutland, VT|isbn=978-0-8048-3326-4|page=80}}</ref> and who also spoke fluent French, much to his admiration. The Leales were a Channel Island family, and Priscilla had been born in France. The sisters worried about Sōseki's incipient paranoia and successfully urged him to get out more and take up cycling.

Despite his poverty, loneliness, and mental problems, he solidified his knowledge of English literature during this period and returned to the [[Empire of Japan]] in January 1903.<ref name="McClellan_164">McClellan (1959) p.164</ref> In April he was appointed to the First National College in Tokyo. Also, he was given the lectureship in [[English literature]], subsequently replacing Koizumi Yakumo ([[Lafcadio Hearn]]) and ultimately becoming a professor of English literature at the [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]],<ref name="McClellan_164"/> where he taught literary theory and [[literary criticism]].

==Literary career==

Sōseki's literary career began in 1903, when he began to contribute haiku, ''[[renku]]'' (haiku-style linked verse), ''haitaishi'' (linked verse on a set theme) and literary sketches to [[literary magazine]]s, such as the prominent ''[[Hototogisu (magazine)|Hototogisu]],'' edited by his former mentor [[Masaoka Shiki]], and later by [[Kyoshi Takahama|Takahama Kyoshi]]. However, it was the public success of his satirical novel ''[[I Am a Cat]]'' in 1905 that won him wide public admiration as well as critical acclaim.<ref>Mostow, Joshua S. ''The Columbia Companion to modern East Asian literature'', Columbia University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-231-11314-4}} p88</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Nathan|first=Richard|date=10 September 2021|title=Soseki’s Cat: A Quantum Leap for Japanese Literature|url=https://www.redcircleauthors.com/news-and-views/sosekis-cat-a-quantum-leap-for-japanese-literature/|url-status=live|website=The Circle, Red Circle Authors}}</ref>

He followed on this success with short stories, such as "''Rondon tō''" ("Tower of London") in 1905<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://iafor.org/archives/journals/iafor-journal-of-literature-and-librarianship/10.22492.ijl.2.1.04.pdf |title='Braving the London fog': Natsume Sōseki's ''The Tower of London'' |journal=The IAFOR Journal of Literature and Librarianship |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2013 |pages=57–65 |access-date=2020-12-05}}</ref> and the novels ''[[Botchan]]'' ("Little Master"), and ''[[Kusamakura (novel)|Kusamakura]]'' ("Grass Pillow") in 1906, which established his reputation, and which enabled him to leave his post at the university for a position with ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' in 1907, and to begin writing full-time. Much of his work deals with the relation between [[Japanese culture]] and [[Western culture]]. His early works in particular are influenced by his studies in London; his novel ''[[Kairo-kō]]'' was the earliest and only major prose treatment of the [[Arthurian legend]] in Japanese.<ref>Takamiya, Toshiyuki (1991). "Natsume Sōseki". In [[Norris J. Lacy]], ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', p. 424. (New York: Garland, 1991). {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.</ref> He began writing one novel a year before his death from a [[stomach ulcer]] in 1916.

[[File:1000 yen Natsume Soseki.jpg|thumb|right|Obverse of a 1984 series 1000 [[Japanese yen banknote]] ]]

Major themes in Sōseki's works include ordinary people fighting against economic hardship, the conflict between duty and desire (a traditional Japanese theme; see [[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]), loyalty and group mentality versus freedom and individuality, personal isolation and estrangement, the rapid [[industrialization of Japan]] and its social consequences, contempt of Japan's aping of Western culture, and a pessimistic view of human nature. Sōseki took a strong interest in the writers of the ''[[Shirakaba]]'' (White Birch) literary group. In his final years, authors such as [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa|Akutagawa Ryūnosuke]] and [[Masao Kume|Kume Masao]] became close followers of his literary style as his disciples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2017/08/19/books/book-reviews/ryunosuke-akutagawa-writing-shadows-japans-literary-giants/#.XWTF2ugzZEY|title=Ryunosuke Akutagawa: Writing in the Shadow of Japan's Literary Giants|last=Laflamme|first=Martin|date=19 August 2017|website=The Japan Times|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kume-Masao|title=Kume Masao|date=2018|website=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In the 21st century, there has been a global emergence of interest in Sōseki.<ref name=shimbun>{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/style/AJ201404200016 |title=Meiji-Taisho Era novelist Natsume becoming trendy across the world 100 years later |work=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |author1=Yusuke Takatsu |author2=Mariko Nakamura |date=April 20, 2014 |access-date=April 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428051434/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/style/AJ201404200016 |archive-date=April 28, 2014 }}</ref> Sōseki's ''Kokoro'' has been newly published in 10 languages, such as Arabic, Slovenian and Dutch, since 2001.<ref name=shimbun/> In South Korea, the complete collection of Sōseki's long works began to be published in 2013.<ref name=shimbun/> In English-speaking countries there has been a succession of English translations since 2008.<ref name=shimbun/> About 60 of his works have been translated into more than 30 languages. Reasons for this emergence of global interest have been attributed in part to [[Haruki Murakami]] who said Sōseki was his favorite Japanese writer.<ref name=shimbun/> Political scientist Kang Sang-jung, who is the principal of [[Seigakuin University]], said, "Soseki predicted the problems we are facing today. He had a long-term view of civilization." He also said, "His popularity will become more global in the future".<ref name=shimbun/>

In 2016, the centennial of Sōseki's death, [[Nishogakusha University]] in Tokyo collaborated with [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]], robotics researcher at [[Osaka University]], to create a robotic android version of Sōseki. Sōseki's grandson, [[Fusanosuke Natsume]], voiced the 130&nbsp;cm figure which depicted Sōseki at age 45. The robot gave lectures and recitations of Sōseki's works at the university, as a way to engage students' interest in literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2016/12/19/language/lets-discuss-soseki-robot/#.XWSwi-gzZEY|title=Let's Discuss the Soseki Robot|last=Otake|first=Tomoko|date=9 December 2016|website=Japan Times|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref>

In 2017, as part of the 150-year commemoration of Sōseki's birth, the Asahi Beer Oyamazaki Villa Museum of Art displayed the letter Sōseki had written suggesting names for the villa itself.<ref>[https://www.asahibeer-oyamazaki.com/english/ ]</ref> Sōseki had been on good terms with the owner, Shotaro Kaga, who asked him to name the house. Sōseki died before its completion in 1917. Sōseki's diary was also on display during the exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asahibeer-oyamazaki.com/english/tokubetu/33770/|title=Soseki, Kyoto and the Oyamazaki Villa|date=March 2017|website=Asahi Beer Oyamazaki Villa Museum of Art|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2017/03/14/arts/openings-outside-tokyo/soseki-kyoto-oyamazaki-villa-commemorating-150th-anniversary-novelists-birth/#.XWSwhegzZEY|title=Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the Novelist's Birth|last=Tanaka|first=Yukari|date=14 March 2017|website=Japan Times|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, retired professor Ikuo Tsunematsu reopened the Sōseki Museum, in Surrey, dedicated to the writer's life in the United Kingdom. The museum originally opened in 1982 in London, but closed in 2016 due to high maintenance costs and a decreased rate of attendance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/08/national/museum-chronicling-novelist-natsume-sosekis-life-u-k-begins-new-chapter/#.XWSwZegzZEY|title=Museum Chronicling Novelist Natsume Soseki's Life in U.K. Begins New Chapter|date=July 8, 2019|website=Japan Times}}</ref> The collection includes over 10,000 items including works in translation, collected books and magazines from Sōseki's stay in London, and census records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culture24.org.uk/am31865|title=Soseki Museum|date=2017|website=Culture 24|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>

Sōseki appears as a character in ''[[The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures]]'', where he is charged with stabbing a woman in the back during his stay in London, and defended by the protagonist. In the game, he has a pet cat called Wagahai, a reference to ''[[I Am a Cat]]''. He also appears in the sequel, ''[[The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve]]'', where he is further charged with a man's poisoning in London, as well as appearing as a witness to a murder that occurs in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dai Gyakuten Saiban/Great Ace Attorney scans from Weekly Famitsu 07/02|url=http://www.japanese3ds.com/post/121759368809|website=japanese3ds.com|publisher=japanese3ds.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619112314/http://www.japanese3ds.com/post/121759368809|archive-date=2015-06-19}}</ref> In the manga and anime [[Bungo Stray Dogs|''Bungou Stray Dogs'']], a character is named and based around Sōseki. In homage to his novel of the same name, Sōseki's character uses the ability 'I Am a Cat' which allows him to transform into a calico cat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=文豪ストレイドッグス (Bungou Stray Dogs) Volume 12|last=Kafka|first=Asagiri|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|year=2017|isbn=978-4-04-104287-8|chapter=Chp. 50}}</ref>
