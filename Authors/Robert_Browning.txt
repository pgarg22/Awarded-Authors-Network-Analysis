}}
'''Robert Browning''' (7 May 1812 – 12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose [[dramatic monologue]]s put him high among the [[Victorian literature|Victorian poets]]. He was noted for [[irony]], [[characterization]], dark humour, [[social commentary]], historical settings and challenging [[vocabulary]] and [[syntax]]. His career began well – the long poems [[Pauline: A Fragment of a Confession|''Pauline'']] (1833) and [[Paracelsus (poem)|''Paracelsus'']] (1835) were acclaimed – but his reputation shrank for a time – his 1840 poem [[Sordello (poem)|''Sordello'']] was seen as wilfully obscure – and took over a decade to recover, by which time he had moved from [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelleyan]] forms to a more personal style. In 1846 Browning married fellow poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]] and moved to Italy. By her death in 1861 he had published the collection [[Men and Women (poetry collection)|''Men and Women'']] (1855). His [[Dramatis Personæ (poetry collection)|''Dramatis Personae'']] (1864) and book-length [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' (1868–1869) made him a leading poet. He remained prolific, but his reputation today rests mainly on his middle period. By his death in 1889 he was seen as a sage and philosopher-poet who had fed into Victorian social and political discourse. Societies for studying his work survived in Britain and the US into the 20th century.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Robert Browning was born in [[Walworth]] in the parish of [[Camberwell]], Surrey, which now forms part of the [[London Borough of Southwark|Borough of Southwark]] in south London. He was baptised on 14 June 1812, at Lock's Fields Independent Chapel, York Street, Walworth,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JW86-2ZV |title=FamilySearch.org}}</ref> the only son of Sarah Anna (née Wiedemann) and Robert Browning.<ref name="Karlin9">Browning, Robert. Ed. Karlin, Daniel (2004) ''Selected Poems'' Penguin, p. 9</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/robert-browning-dlb2/ |title=Robert Browning Biography |work=bookrags.com}}</ref> His father was a well-paid clerk for the [[Bank of England]], earning about £150 per year.<ref name="Maynard">John Maynard, ''Browning's Youth''</ref> Browning's paternal grandfather was a slave owner in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts, West Indies]], but Browning's father was an [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]]. Browning's father had been sent to the [[West Indies]] to work on a sugar plantation, but, due to a slave revolt there, had returned to England. Browning's mother was the daughter of a German shipowner who had settled in [[Dundee]] in Scotland, and his Scottish wife. Browning had one sister, Sarianna. Browning's paternal grandmother, Margaret Tittle, who had inherited a plantation in St Kitts, was rumoured (within the family) to have a mixed race ancestry, including some Jamaican blood, but author Julia Markus suggests she was [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Kittitian]] rather than Jamaican.<ref>''Dared and done: the marriage of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning'' Knopf, 1995, University of Michigan, p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0-679-41602-9}}</ref> The evidence, however, is inconclusive.<ref>''The dramatic imagination of Robert Browning: a literary life'', 2007. Richard S. Kennedy, Donald S. Hair, University of Missouri Press, p. 7. {{ISBN|0-8262-1691-9}}</ref> Robert's father, a literary collector, amassed a library of around 6,000 books, many of them rare. As such, Robert was raised in a household of significant literary resources. His mother, to whom he was very close, was a devout [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] and a talented musician.<ref name="Karlin9"/> His younger sister, Sarianna, also gifted, became her brother's companion in his later years, after the death of his wife in 1861. His father encouraged his children's interest in literature and the arts.<ref name="Karlin9"/>

By 12, Browning had written a book of poetry which he later destroyed when no publisher could be found. After being at one or two private schools, and showing an insuperable dislike of school life, he was educated at home by a tutor via the resources of his father's extensive library.<ref name="Karlin9"/> By 14, he was fluent in French, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian and Latin. He became a great admirer of the [[Romantic poets]], especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. Following the precedent of Shelley, Browning became an [[atheism|atheist]] and vegetarian. At 16, he studied Greek at [[University College London]] but left after his first year.<ref name="Karlin9"/> His parents' staunch [[evangelicalism|evangelical faith]] prevented his studying at either [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University]], both then open only to members of the [[Church of England]].<ref name="Karlin9"/> He had inherited substantial musical ability through his mother, and composed arrangements of various songs. He refused a formal career and ignored his parents' remonstrations, dedicating himself to poetry. He stayed at home until the age of 34, financially dependent on his family until his marriage. His father sponsored the publication of his son's poems.<ref name="Karlin9"/>

}}In March 1833, ''"Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession"'' was published anonymously by Saunders and Otley at the expense of the author, Robert Browning, who received the money from his aunt, Mrs Silverthorne.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chesterton |first=G K |title=Robert Browning |publisher=Macmillan Interactive Publishing |location=London |date=1903 |isbn=978-0-333-02118-7 |edition=1951}}</ref> It is a long poem composed in homage to the poet [[Percy Bysse Shelley|Shelley]] and somewhat in his style. Originally Browning considered ''Pauline'' as the first of a series written by different aspects of himself, but he soon abandoned this idea. The press noticed the publication. W. J. Fox writing in ''The Monthly Repository'' of April 1833 discerned merit in the work. [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] praised it in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''. However, it sold no copies.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Major Works |first=Robert |last=Browning |editor=Roberts, Adam |editor2=Karlin, Daniel |isbn=978-0-19-955469-0 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=Oxford World's Classics}}</ref> Some years later, probably in 1850, [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] came across it in the Reading Room of the [[British Museum]] and wrote to Browning, then in [[Florence]] to ask if he was the author.<ref name="TheCambridge1907">{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 volumes (published 1907–1921) |volume=XIII|chapter=III}}</ref> [[John Stuart Mill]], however, wrote that the author suffered from an "intense and morbid self-consciousness".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://britlitwiki.wikispaces.com/Robert+Browning |title=Robert Browning |last=Stevenson |first=Sarah |access-date=26 August 2012}}</ref> Later Browning was rather embarrassed by the work, and only included it in his collected poems of 1868 after making substantial changes and adding a preface in which he asked for indulgence for a boyish work.<ref name="TheCambridge1907" />

In 1834, he accompanied the Chevalier George de Benkhausen, the Russian consul-general, on a brief visit to [[St Petersburg]] and began ''Paracelsus'', which was published in 1835.<ref name="Browning Poetical Works 1833–1864">{{Cite book |title=Browning Poetical Works 1833–1864 |editor=Ian Jack |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1970 |chapter=Introduction and Chronology |isbn=978-0-19-254165-9 |oclc=108532 |url=https://archive.org/details/browningpoetical00brow}}</ref> The subject of the [[Paracelsus|16th-century savant and alchemist]] was probably suggested to him by the Comte Amédée de Ripart-Monclar, to whom it was dedicated. The publication had some commercial and critical success, being noticed by [[Wordsworth]], [[Dickens]], [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]], J. S. Mill and the already famous [[Tennyson]]. It is a monodrama without action, dealing with the problems confronting an intellectual trying to find his role in society. It gained him access to the London literary world.

As a result of his new contacts he met [[William Charles Macready|Macready]], who invited him to write a play.<ref name="Browning Poetical Works 1833–1864"/> ''[[Strafford (play)|Strafford]]'' was performed five times. Browning then wrote two other plays, one of which was not performed, while the other failed, Browning having fallen out with Macready.

In 1838, he visited Italy looking for background for ''[[Sordello (poem)|Sordello]]'', a long poem in heroic couplets, presented as the imaginary biography of the Mantuan bard spoken of by [[Dante]] in the [[Divine Comedy]], canto 6 of Purgatory, set against a background of hate and conflict during the Guelph-Ghibelline wars. This was published in 1840 and met with widespread derision, gaining him the reputation of wanton carelessness and obscurity. Tennyson commented that he only understood the first and last lines and Carlyle wrote that his wife had read the poem through and could not tell whether Sordello was a man, a city or a book.<ref>Browning, Robert. Ed. Karlin, Daniel (2004) Selected Poems Penguin</ref>

Browning's reputation began to make a partial recovery with the publication, 1841–1846, of ''Bells and Pomegranates'', a series of eight pamphlets, originally intended just to include his plays. Fortunately for Browning's career, his publisher, Moxon, persuaded him to include some "dramatic lyrics", some of which had already appeared in periodicals.<ref name="Browning Poetical Works 1833–1864"/>

===Marriage===

[[File:Clasped Hands of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning MET DT8282.jpg|thumb|''[[Clasped Hands of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'', 1853 by [[Harriet Hosmer]].]]

In 1845, Browning met the poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]], six years his senior, who lived as a semi-invalid in her father's house in [[Wimpole Street]], London. They began regularly corresponding and gradually a romance developed between them, leading to their marriage and journey to Italy (for Elizabeth's health) on 12 September 1846.<ref name="Karlin10">Browning, Robert. Ed. Karlin, Daniel (2004) ''Selected Poems'' Penguin p10</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/182 |title=Robert Browning|website=poets.org |access-date=7 May 2020}}</ref> The marriage was initially secret because Elizabeth's domineering father disapproved of marriage for any of his children. Mr. Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did for each of his children who married: "The Mrs. Browning of popular imagination was a sweet, innocent young woman who suffered endless cruelties at the hands of a tyrannical papa but who nonetheless had the good fortune to fall in love with a dashing and handsome poet named Robert Browning."<ref>Peterson, William S. ''Sonnets From The Portuguese''. Massachusetts: Barre Publishing, 1977.</ref> At her husband's insistence, the second edition of Elizabeth's ''Poems'' included her love sonnets. The book increased her popularity and high critical regard, cementing her position as an eminent Victorian poet. Upon [[William Wordsworth]]'s death in 1850, she was a serious contender to become [[Poet Laureate]], the position eventually going to [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].

From the time of their marriage and until Elizabeth's death, the Brownings lived in Italy, residing first in [[Pisa]], and then, within a year, finding an apartment in [[Florence]] at [[Casa Guidi]] (now a museum to their memory).<ref name="Karlin10"/> Their only child, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning]], nicknamed "Penini" or "Pen", was born in 1849.<ref name="Karlin10"/> In these years Browning was fascinated by, and learned from, the art and atmosphere of Italy. He would, in later life, describe Italy as his university. As Elizabeth had inherited money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy, and their relationship together was happy. However, the literary assault on Browning's work did not let up and he was critically dismissed further, by patrician writers such as [[Charles Kingsley]], for the desertion of England for foreign lands.<ref name="Karlin10"/>

===Political views===
Browning identified as a [[liberalism|Liberal]], supported the emancipation of women, and opposed slavery, expressing sympathy for the North in the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="Robert Browning">{{Cite book |last1=Woolford |first1=John |last2=Karlin |first2=Daniel |title=Robert Browning |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |page=157}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dowden |first1=Edward |title=Robert Browning |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013444744 |date=1904 |publisher=J.M.

He was also a stalwart opponent of anti-Semitism, leading to speculation that Browning himself was Jewish.<ref name="Robert Browning"/> In 1877 he wrote a poem explaining "Why I am a Liberal" in which he declared: "Who then dares hold – emancipated thus / His fellow shall continue bound? Not I."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Woolford |first1=John |last2=Karlin |first2=Daniel |title=Robert Browning |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |page=158}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dowden |first1=Edward |title=Robert Browning |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013444744 |date=1904 |publisher=J.M.

===Religious beliefs===
Browning was raised in an evangelical non-conformist household. However, after his reading of Shelley he is said to have briefly become an atheist.<ref name=everett>Everett, Glenn. [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/rbrelge.html Browning's Religious Views] at [[Victorian Web]]. Retrieved 19 February 2018</ref> Browning is also said to have made an uncharacteristic admission of faith to Alfred Domett, when he is said to have admired Byron's poetry "as a Christian".<ref name=Dommet>Domett, Alfred. [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/religionov.html Robert Browning's Religious Context and Belief], cited at [[Victorian Web]]. Retrieved 19 February 2018</ref> Poems such as "Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day" seem to confirm this Christian faith, strengthened by his wife. However, many have dismissed the usefulness of these works at discovering Browning's own religious views due to the consistent use of dramatic monologue which regularly expresses hypothetical views which cannot be ascribed to the author himself.<ref name=everett/>

Browning believed [[spiritualism]] to be fraud, and proved one of [[Daniel Dunglas Home]]'s most adamant critics. When Browning and his wife [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth]] attended one of his séances on 23 July 1855,<ref name="Thomas1989">[[Donald Serrell Thomas]]. (1989).

The man who slices lemons into drink,

He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye,
And fly-leaf ballads on the vendor's string,
And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall.
He took such cognizance of men and things, 
If any beat a horse, you felt he saw;
If any cursed a woman, he took note;
Yet stared at nobody—you stared at him,
And found, less to your pleasure than surprise,
He seemed to know you and expect as much.

In Florence, probably from early in 1853, Browning worked on the poems that eventually comprised his two-volume ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'', for which he is now well known,<ref name="Karlin10"/> although in 1855, when they were published, they made relatively little impact.

In 1861, Elizabeth died in Florence. Among those whom he found consoling in that period{{vague|reason = the one ending in '61, or the one beginning then, or a *completely*undelimited one that surrounded her death?|date=August 2019}} was the novelist and poet [[Isa Blagden]], with whom he and his wife had a voluminous correspondence.<ref>"Isa Blagden", in: ''The Brownings' Correspondence''. [http://www.browningscorrespondence.com/biographical-sketches/?id=123. Retrieved 13 May 2015.]</ref> The following year Browning returned to London, taking Pen with him, who by then was 12 years old. They made their home in 17 [[Warwick Crescent]], [[Maida Vale]]. It was only when he became part of the London literary scene—albeit while paying frequent visits to Italy (though never again to Florence)—that his reputation started to take off.<ref name="Karlin10"/>

In 1868, after five years work he completed and published the long blank-verse poem ''[[The Ring and the Book]]''. Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of 12 books: essentially 10 lengthy dramatic monologues narrated by various characters in the story, showing their individual perspectives on events, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Long even by Browning's standards (over twenty-thousand lines), ''The Ring and the Book'' was his most ambitious project and is arguably his greatest work; it has been called a ''tour de force'' of dramatic poetry.<ref name="Karlin11"/> Published in four parts from November 1868 to February 1869, the poem was a success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought for nearly 40 years.<ref name="Karlin11">Browning, Robert. Ed. Karlin, Daniel (2004) ''Selected Poems'' Penguin p11</ref> The Robert Browning Society was formed in 1881 and his work was recognised as belonging within the British literary canon.<ref name="Karlin11"/>

[[File:Robert browning cartoon-1-.png|thumb|1882 caricature from ''[[Punch Magazine]]'' reading: "''The Ring and Bookmaker from Red Cotton Nightcap country"'']]

In the remaining years of his life Browning travelled extensively. After a series of long poems published in the early 1870s, of which ''Balaustion's Adventure'' and ''[[Red Cotton Night-Cap Country]]'' were the best-received,<ref name="Karlin11"/> the volume ''[[Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper]]'' included an attack against Browning's critics, especially [[Alfred Austin]], who was later to become [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. According to some reports Browning became romantically involved with [[Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie]], Lady Ashburton, but he refused her proposal of marriage, and did not remarry. In 1878, he revisited Italy for the first time in the seventeen years since Elizabeth's death, and returned there on several further occasions. In 1887, Browning produced the major work of his later years, ''Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in Their Day''. It finally presented the poet speaking in his own voice, engaging in a series of dialogues with long-forgotten figures of literary, artistic, and philosophic history. The Victorian public was baffled by this, and Browning returned to the brief, concise lyric for his last volume, ''[[Asolando]]'' (1889), published on the day of his death.<ref name="Karlin11"/>

Browning died at his son's home [[Ca' Rezzonico]] in Venice on 12 December 1889.<ref name="Karlin11"/> He was buried in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]; his grave now lies immediately adjacent to that of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref name="Karlin11"/>

During his life Browning was awarded many distinctions. He was made [[LL.D.]] of Edinburgh, a life Governor of London University, and had the offer of the [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Lord Rectorship of Glasgow]]. But he turned down anything that involved public speaking.

Browning's admirers have tended to temper their praise with reservations about the length and difficulty of his most ambitious poems, particularly ''Sordello'' and, to a lesser extent, ''The Ring and the Book''. Nevertheless, they have included such eminent writers as [[Henry James]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. Among living writers, [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series and [[A. S. Byatt]]'s ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' refer directly to Browning's work.

Today Browning's critically most esteemed poems include the monologues ''[[Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Andrea Del Sarto (poem)|Andrea Del Sarto]]'', and ''[[My Last Duchess]]''. His most popular poems include ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', ''[[How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix]]'', the [[diptych]] ''[[Meeting at Night]]'', the patriotic ''[[Home Thoughts from Abroad]]'', and the children's poem ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]''. His abortive dinner-party recital of ''How They Brought The Good News'' was recorded on an [[Edison Records|Edison]] [[phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]], and is believed to be one of the oldest surviving recordings made in the United Kingdom of a notable person (a recording of Sir Arthur Sullivan's voice was made about six months earlier).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Fkadd_T1A |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/b9Fkadd_T1A |archive-date=2021-11-07 |url-status=live |title=Speaking voice of Sir Arthur Sullivan, 1888 |via=www.youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Browning is now popularly known for such poems as ''[[s:Porphyria's Lover|Porphyria's Lover]]'', ''[[s:My Last Duchess|My Last Duchess]]'', ''[[s:How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix|How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix]]'', and ''[[s:The Pied Piper of Hamelin (Browning)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', and also for certain famous lines: "Grow old along with me!" (''[[s:Rabbi Ben Ezra|Rabbi Ben Ezra]]''), "A man's reach should exceed his grasp" and "Less is more" (''[[Andrea Del Sarto (poem)|Andrea Del Sarto]]''), "It was roses, roses all the way" (''The Patriot''), and "God's in His heaven—All's right with the world!" (''[[Pippa Passes]]'').

His critical reputation rests mainly on his [[dramatic monologue]]s, in which the words not only convey setting and action but reveal the speaker's character. In a Browning monologue, unlike a [[soliloquy]], the meaning is not what the speaker voluntarily reveals but what he inadvertently gives away, usually while [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalising]] past actions or [[special pleading]] his case to a silent auditor. These monologues have been influential, and today the best of them are often treated by teachers and lecturers as paradigm cases of the monologue form. One such example used by teachers today is his satirisation of the sadistic attitude in his ''Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t7JEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22IX+SOLILOQUY+OF+THE+SPANISH+CLOISTER+BY+ROBERT+BROWNING%22&source=bl&ots=c8f72qVfWv&sig=ACfU3U0ANv_7fwmlYAWn2QL8-bQSg6ZXOg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY5NOK4arhAhVEKKwKHSIPC3AQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22IX%20SOLILOQUY%20OF%20THE%20SPANISH%20CLOISTER%20BY%20ROBERT%20BROWNING%22&f=false Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister], full text on Google Books</ref> Ian Jack, in his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning's poems 1833–1864, comments that [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] "all learned from Browning's exploration of the possibilities of dramatic poetry and of colloquial idiom".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Browning |title=Browning Poetical Works 1833–1864 |editor=Ian Jack |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1970 |chapter=Introduction |isbn=978-0-19-254165-9 |oclc=108532 |url=https://archive.org/details/browningpoetical00brow}}</ref>

In Oscar Wilde's dialogue ''[[The Critic as Artist]]'', Browning is given a famously ironical assessment: "He is the most Shakespearean creature since Shakespeare. If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made [[Hamlet]]. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is [[George Meredith]]. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose."

Probably the most adulatory judgment of Browning by a modern critic comes from [[Harold Bloom]]: "Browning is the most considerable poet in English since the major Romantics, surpassing his great contemporary rival [[Tennyson]] and the principal twentieth-century poets, including even [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]], and [[Wallace Stevens]]. But Browning is a very difficult poet, notoriously badly served by [[literary criticism|criticism]], and ill-served also by his own accounts of what he was doing as a poet.... Yet when you read your way into his world, precisely his largest gift to you is his involuntary unfolding of one of the largest, most enigmatic, and most multipersoned literary and human selves you can hope to encounter."<ref name="Bloom2004">[[Harold Bloom]] (2004). ''The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer through Robert Frost''. HarperCollins. pp. 656–657. {{ISBN|978-0-06-054042-5}}</ref>

His work has nevertheless had many detractors, and most of his voluminous output is not widely read. In a largely hostile essay [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote: "We all want to like Browning, but we find it very hard."<ref>Burgess, Anthony [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/15th-april-1966/19/sage-and-mage-of-the-steam-age Sage and Mage of the Steam Age] ''[[The Spectator]]'', 14 April 1966, p. 19. Retrieved 19 October 2013</ref> [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[George Santayana]] were also critical. The latter expressed his views in the essay "The Poetry of Barbarism," which attacks Browning and [[Walt Whitman]] for what he regarded as their embrace of irrationality.

In 1914, the American modernist composer [[Charles Ives]] created the ''Robert Browning Overture'', a dense and darkly dramatic piece with gloomy overtones reminiscent of the [[Second Viennese School]].

In 1917, the U.S. composer [[Margaret Hoberg Turrell]] composed a song based on Browning's poem "Love: Such a Starved Bank of Moss".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qlC1AAAAIAAJ&q=margaret+hoberg |title=Robert Browning: A Bibliography, 1830-1950 |date=1953 |publisher=Cornell University Press |language=en}}</ref> In 1920, the U.S. composer [[Anne Stratton]] composed one based on Browning's poem "Parting at Morning".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Office |first=Library of Congress Copyright |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jnQAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA760&dq=parting+at+morning+anne+stratton&hl=en |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries |date=1920 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|language=en}}</ref>

In 1930, the story of Browning and his wife was made into the play ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', by [[Rudolph Besier]]. It was a success and brought popular fame to the couple in the United States. The role of Elizabeth became a signature role for the actress [[Katharine Cornell]]. It was twice adapted into film. It was also the basis of the stage musical ''[[Robert and Elizabeth]]'', with music by [[Ron Grainer]] and book and lyrics by [[Ronald Millar]].

In ''[[The Browning Version (disambiguation)|The Browning Version]]'' ([[Terence Rattigan]]'s 1948 play or one of several film adaptations), a pupil makes a parting present to his teacher of an inscribed copy of Browning's translation of the ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]''.
<!-- Note that, on 2013-02-16 anyway, [[The Browning Version]] links to a disambiguation page, which is "almost always unintended" (as Wikipedia automatically notified me after the fact), but in this case its targets are exactly those specified between parentheses above, and it does not seem opportune to instead single out either the original play or one of the film adaptations, which would seem a matter of personal experience and preference. -->
<!-- The inscription may be a verse from the original rewritten as a hexameter, unless that was just in ''[[The Browning Version (1994 film)|The Browning Version]]''. -->

[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' was chiefly inspired by Browning's ''Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came'', whose full text was included in the final volume's appendix.

[[Michael Dibdin]]'s 1986 crime novel "A Rich Full Death" features Robert Browning as one of the lead characters.

Lines from ''Paracelsus'' were recited by the character [[Fox Mulder]] at the beginning and the end of the 1996 ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[The Field Where I Died]]".

[[Mark Alburger]]'s 2004 opera [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin]] sets the Browning poem in the time of [[George W. Bush]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].

Gabrielle Kimm's 2010 novel ''His Last Duchess'' is inspired by ''My Last Duchess''.

A memorial plaque on the site of Browning's London home, in Warwick Crescent, [[Maida Vale]], was unveiled on 11 December 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |url-status=dead |title=City of Westminster green plaques |archivedate=16 July 2012}}</ref>
