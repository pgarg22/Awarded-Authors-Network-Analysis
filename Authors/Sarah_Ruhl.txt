==Biography==
===Early life===
Ruhl was born in [[Wilmette]], [[Illinois]]. Her mother, Kathleen Ruhl, earned a Ph.D. in Language, Literacy, and Rhetoric, from the University of Illinois and became an English teacher, as well as an actress and a theatre director.

===''The Clean House''===
{{Main|The Clean House}}
Ruhl gained widespread recognition for her play ''[[The Clean House]]'' (2004). "The play takes place in a 'metaphysical Connecticut' where married doctors employ a Brazilian housekeeper who is more interested in coming up with the perfect joke than in cleaning.  Trouble erupts when the husband falls in love with one of his cancer patients".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ruhl|first=Sarah|title=The Clean House|year=2007|publisher=Samuel French}}</ref> It won the [[Susan Smith Blackburn Prize]] in 2004 and was a [[Pulitzer Prize]] finalist in 2005.<ref name="Pulitzer">{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2010-Drama |title=The Pulitzer Prizes &#124; Citation |publisher=Pulitzer.org |year=2010 |access-date=2010-09-20}}</ref>

===''Eurydice''===

''[[Eurydice (Ruhl play)|Eurydice]]'' (2004) was produced [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Second Stage Theatre]] in June to July 2007.<ref name="Isherwood">{{cite web|last1=Isherwood|first1=Charles|title=The Power of Memory to Triumph Over Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/theater/reviews/19seco.html?_r=0|website=nytimes|publisher=nytimes|access-date=4 May 2016}}</ref> Prior to that it had been staged at [[Yale Rep]] (2006), [[Berkeley Rep]] (2004), Georgetown University, and [[Circle X Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hernandez |first= Ernio|date=June 18, 2007 |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/sarah-ruhls-eurydice-opens-off-broadway-june-18-com-141583 |title=Sarah Ruhl's eurydice Opens Off-Broadway June 18 |publisher=Playbill.com}}</ref> She wrote ''Eurydice'' in honor of her father, who died in 1994 of cancer, and as a way to "have a few more conversations with him."  The play explores the use and understanding of language, an interest which she shared with her father:<ref name="Lahr" />

<blockquote>Each Saturday, from the time Ruhl was five, Patrick took his daughters to the Walker Brothers Original Pancake House for breakfast and taught them a new word, along with its etymology.  (The language lesson and some of Patrick's words—"ostracize," "peripatetic," "defunct"—are memorialized in the 2003 ''Eurydice'', a retelling of the Orpheus myth from his inamorata's point of view, in which the dead Father, reunited with his daughter, tries to re-teach her lost vocabulary.)<ref name=Lahr/></blockquote>

''Eurydice'' is Ruhl's version of the classic Eurydice and Orpheus tale.<ref name="Isherwood" /> It portrays an [[Alice in Wonderland]]-esque underworld, complete with talking stones and a Lord of the Underworld, who can be seen riding a red tricycle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ruhl|first=Sarah|title=The Clean House and Other Plays|year=2006|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|location=New York|pages=384}}</ref> In keeping with the play's Greek origins, the Stones serve as a new take on a Greek chorus. The Stones comment on the action and warn the characters, but cannot intervene in any of the events.  The play explores relationships, love, communication, and the permeability between the world of the living and the world of the dead, in a quest to discover where true meaning lies in life and thereafter.<ref name="Isherwood" />

In 2020, Ruhl adapted the play as a libretto for a [[Eurydice (Aucoin)|new opera]] composed by [[Matthew Aucoin]]. It premiered at the [[Los Angeles Opera]] on February 1, 2020.<ref name="Swed">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-02-03/la-opera-matthew-aucoin-eurydice-review|title=Review: At L.A.

The play received a UK premiere at [[The Arches (Glasgow)]] in June 2011.  The play explores technology and the disconnect people are experiencing in the digital age:

<blockquote>"Cell phones, iPods, wireless computers will change people in ways we don't even understand," Ruhl stated. "We're less connected to the present. No one is where they are. There's absolutely no reason to talk to a stranger anymore—you connect to people you already know. But how well do you know them? Because you never see them—you just talk to them. I find that terrifying."<ref name=Lahr/></blockquote>

Ruhl explains,

<blockquote>One physician quoted in the book [''The Technology of the Orgasm''] argued that at least three-fourths of women had ailments that could be cured by the vibrator. Which is kind of stunning. The economy for vibrators, even then, was vast; I mean, it was a million-dollar enterprise.<ref name=Vogel/></blockquote>

The play then moved to [[Sydney]], Australia and premiered for the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] with [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] in the title role.

==Themes and style==
In September 2006, she received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. The announcement of that award stated: "Sarah Ruhl, 32, playwright, New York City. Playwright creating vivid and adventurous theatrical works that poignantly juxtapose the mundane aspects of daily life with mythic themes of love and war."<ref>{{cite web|last1=York|first1=John|title=Sarah Ruhl's Passion Play|url=http://www.theatermirror.com/JYpassionCIRCUIT.htm|website=Theatremirror.com|access-date=4 May 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://www.macfound.org/fellows/787/ "Meet the Class of 2006. Sarah Ruhl"] macfound.org, accessed December 1, 2015</ref>

[[John Lahr]], in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', wrote of Ruhl:

<blockquote>But if Ruhl's demeanor is unassuming, her plays are bold. Her nonlinear form of realism—full of astonishments, surprises, and mysteries—is low on exposition and psychology. "I try to interpret how people subjectively experience life," she has said. "Everyone has a great, horrible opera inside him. I feel that my plays, in a way, are very old-fashioned. They're pre-Freudian in the sense that the Greeks and Shakespeare worked with similar assumptions. Catharsis isn't a wound being excavated from childhood."<ref name=Lahr/></blockquote>

In a discussion with Paula Vogel for ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Ruhl described the psychology of her plays as "putting things up against [[Freud]] ... it's a more [[medieval]] sensibility of the humors, [[melancholia]], black [[bile]], and transformation." Rather than "connect the dots psychologically in a linear way," Ruhl prefers to create emotional psychological states through transformation of the performance space.<ref name=Vogel/>

==Personal life==
In 2005, Ruhl married child psychiatrist Tony Charuvastra. He teaches a course at NYU that utilizes ''In the Next Room'' as a required reading.<ref name=Lahr/> Ruhl and Charuvastra have three children: Anne and twins William and Hope.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/communication-arts/ruhl|title=Playwright Sarah Ruhl|date=2016-09-15|website=Communication Arts|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>

==Awards, nominations and honors==
Ruhl was awarded the Residency 1 program by the [[Signature Theatre Company]] in 2019. This involves "a year-long intensive, exploration of a writer's body of work."<ref>Clement, Olivia. [http://www.playbill.com/article/signature-theatre-welcomes-5-new-residents# "Signature Theatre Welcomes 5 New Residents"] playbill, March 28, 2019</ref>

In 2006, Ruhl received a [[MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]] with a cash award of $500,000. Ruhl commented: "...the money is truly astounding. The whole thing really does leave one speechless."<ref>[http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/off-broadway/4255/fit-to-be-tidy "MacArthur “genius” Sara Ruhl opens up' The Clean House'"] ''Time Out New York''</ref>

Ruhl has been awarded the Steinberg Distinguished  Playwright Award for 2016; the awardee is given a cash award of $200,000. The Steinberg committee said, in part: "Her work sparks conversation in audiences of all ages with its emotionally vivid language [...] Sarah Ruhl is unique. She fills her intelligent and highly theatrical plays with striking oddities and playful humor.
