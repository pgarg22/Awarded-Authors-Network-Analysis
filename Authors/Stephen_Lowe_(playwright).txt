'''Stephen Lowe''' (born December 1947) is an English playwright and director.

Lowe's plays have dealt with subjects ranging from the takeover of Tibet by the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]] in 1959 (''Tibetan Inroads'') to a dying [[DH Lawrence]] trying find a publisher for [[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley]] (''Empty Bed Blues''); from [[Donald McGill]] postcards (''Cards'' and ''Kisses on the Bottom'') to [[Dr John Dee]] (''The Alchemical Wedding'').  His best known plays are [[Touched (play)|''Touched'']], about a group of working-class women in Nottingham at the end of the second world war; [[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (play)|''The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists'']], about a group of house-painters in 1906 (adapted from the [[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists|novel]] by [[Robert Tressell]]); and ''Old Big ‘Ead in the Spirit of the Man'', in which football hero [[Brian Clough]] comes back from the dead to inspire a playwright working on his latest play.

He has had plays produced by the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]], [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], [[Riverside Studios]], [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]], [[Hampstead Theatre]], [[Joint Stock Theatre Company|Joint Stock]]; and at regional theatres across the country including [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Theatre in the Round]], [[Sheffield Crucible]], [[Liverpool Playhouse]], [[Derby Playhouse]], [[Birmingham Rep]], [[Salisbury Playhouse]] and [[Plymouth Theatre Royal]].

==Early life==
Lowe was born Stephen James Wright in [[Sneinton]], [[Nottingham]], where his father was a labourer and his mother was a machinist in Nottingham's [[Lace Market]]. He graduated from [[Birmingham University]] in English and Theatre Studies.

After university, Lowe worked in various jobs while writing, including part-time lecturer, clerk, hospital receptionist, newspaper distributor, advertising manager, housepainter, barman and civil servant.  While working as a part-time shepherd in the [[Yorkshire Dales]], he was commissioned by [[Alan Ayckbourn]] to write a comedy double-bill, ''Comic Pictures'', and joined his [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Theatre in the Round]] company as an actor and writer.  Ayckbourn produced ''Comic Pictures'' in 1976.

Lowe took his mother's maiden name as a professional identity in 1976, when he joined Ayckbourn's company.<ref>''Moving Pictures'', Four Plays by Stephen Lowe. London, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 1985.</ref>

==Peace plays==
In the 1980s, Lowe edited two anthologies of peace plays for Methuen.  The first volume was of plays by British playwrights, including [[Deborah Levy]], [[Adrian Mitchell]], and Lowe himself (Keeping Body and Soul Together).  It was published in 1985 during a period of increased tension towards the end of the [[Cold War]], and Lowe's introduction quoted from [[Gabriel García Márquez|Gabriel Garcia Marquez's]] [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] acceptance speech, "we, the inventors of tales, who will believe anything, feel entitled to believe that it is not yet too late to engage in the creation of a utopia of a very different kind."<ref>Introduction to Peace Plays volume 1, edited by Stephen Lowe; Methuen, London, 1985; p vii</ref>  The second volume, published in 1990, came out of the new era of [[glasnost]] and a thaw in relations between the two [[superpower]]s.  For this volume Lowe selected plays by two American playwrights, [[Arthur Kopit]] and Richard Stayton; and by two Russian playwrights, Fyodor Burlatsky, a former adviser to [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].
