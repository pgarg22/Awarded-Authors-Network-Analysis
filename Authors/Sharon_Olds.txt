'''Sharon Olds''' (born November 19, 1942) is an American poet. Olds won the first San Francisco Poetry Center Award in 1980,<ref>"[https://poetry.sfsu.edu/past-winners-poetry-center-book-award Recipients of the Poetry Center Book Award, 1980–present]", San Francisco State University Poetry Center; [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sharon-olds "Sharon Olds]", Poetry Foundation.</ref> the 1984 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]],<ref>[https://www.bookcritics.org/past-awards/1984/ "1984 Winners & Finalists"], National Book Critics Circle.</ref> and the 2013 [[Pulitzer Prize in Poetry]].<ref name="2013 Pulitzer Prizes">"[https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2013 2013 Pulitzer Prizes]", The Pulitzer Prizes.</ref> She teaches creative writing at [[New York University]] and is a previous director of the Creative Writing Program at NYU.<ref>"[https://as.nyu.edu/cwp/graduate/faculty.html Creative Writing Program - Core Graduate Faculty]," NYU Arts & Science.</ref>

==Early life==
Sharon Olds was born on November 19, 1942, in [[San Francisco]], California, but was brought up in [[Berkeley, California]], along with her siblings.<ref name="Sharon Olds">[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sharon-olds "Sharon Olds]", Poetry Foundation.</ref> She was raised as a "hellfire [[Calvinist]]," as she describes it.<ref>"[https://www.modernamericanpoetry.org/poet/sharon-olds Sharon Olds]", ''Modern American Poetry''.</ref> Her father, like his before him, was an [[alcoholic]] who was often abusive to his children. In Olds' writing she often refers to the time (or possibly even times) when her father tied her to a chair.<ref>{{Citation needed|reason= This link no longer exists or has moved to a new location||date=February 2021}}[http://barclayagency.com/speakers/videos/olds.html The Barclay Agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160634/http://barclayagency.com/speakers/videos/olds.html |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref> Olds' mother was often either unable or too afraid to come to the aid of her children.

The strict religious environment in which Olds was raised had certain rules of censorship and restriction. Olds was not permitted to go to the movies and the family did not own a television, but her reading was not censored. She liked fairy tales, and also read [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/04/26/interview-with-poet-sharon-olds/BzVG1akoejxrah6kvzFZVN/story.html?p1=Article_Related_Box_Article#| title=Sharon Olds | author=Amy Sutherland|work=[[The Boston Globe]]| date=April 26, 2013}}</ref> By nature "a [[pagan]] and a [[pantheist]]," she has said that in childhood she was exposed in her church to "both great literary art and bad literary art," with "the great art being psalms and the bad art being hymns. The four-beat was something that was just part of my consciousness from before I was born." Of her Calvinist childhood, she said in 2011 that though she was about 15 when she conceived of herself as an [[atheist]], "I think it was only very recently that I can really tell that there's nobody there with a copybook making marks against your name."<ref name="Sharon Olds: Blood, sweat and fears">"[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/sharon-olds-blood-sweat-and-fears-421691.html Sharon Olds: Blood, sweat and fears]", ''Independent'', September 22, 2011.</ref>

Olds was sent east to [[Dana Hall School]], an all-girls school for grades 6 to 12 in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], that boasts an impressive list of alumnae.<ref name="Dana Hall School: Sharon Olds 1960">[http://library.danahall.org/archives/danapedia/alumnae/sharon-olds-1960/ Dana Hall School: Sharon Olds 1960]</ref> There she studied mostly English, History, and Creative Writing. Her favorite poets included [[William Shakespeare]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], but it was [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Howl and Other Poems]]'' that she carried in her purse through 10th grade.<ref>"[https://www.vogue.com/article/fine-print-poet-sharon-olds-chronicles-the-end-of-her-marriage-in-a-new-collection Fine Print: Poet Sharon Olds Chronicles the End of Her Marriage in a New Collection]", ''Vogue'', August 22, 2012.</ref>

For her bachelor's degree Olds returned to California where she earned her BA at [[Stanford University]] in 1964. Following this, Olds once again moved cross country to New York, where she earned her Ph.D. in English in 1972 from [[Columbia University]].<ref name="Sharon Olds"/> She teaches creative writing at [[New York University]]. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on "[[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]'s Prosody," because she appreciated the way he defied convention.<ref name="Dana Hall School: Sharon Olds 1960"/>

==Personal life==
 {{Quote box |width=400px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center
 |quote =<poem>
I want to go up to them and say Stop, 
don’t do it—she’s the wrong woman, 
he’s the wrong man, you are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do, 
you are going to do bad things to children,
you are going to suffer in ways you have not heard of,
you are going to want to die. I want to go
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it,
her hungry pretty face turning to me, 
her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
his arrogant handsome face turning to me, 
his pitiful beautiful untouched body, 
but I don’t do it. I want to live. 
</poem>

On March 23, 1968, she married Dr. David Douglas Olds in New York City and, in 1969, gave birth to the first of their two children. In 1997, after 29 years of marriage, they divorced, and Olds moved to New Hampshire, though she commutes to New York three days a week.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} There, she lives in the same [[Upper West Side]] apartment she has lived in for the past 40 years while working as a Professor at [[New York University]]. In New Hampshire she lives in Graylag Cabins in [[Pittsfield, New Hampshire|Pittsfield]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Her partner, Carl Wallman, is a former cattle breeder.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/sharon-olds-my-husband-left-me-after-32-years--but-i-refuse-to-be-a-victim-8455264.html| title=Sharon Olds: My husband left me after 32 years — but I refuse to be a victim | author=Melanie McDonagh|work=[[London Evening Standard]]| date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>

In 2005, First Lady [[Laura Bush]] invited Olds to the [[National Book Festival]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Olds declined the invitation and responded with an [[open letter]] published in ''[[The Nation]]''. The editors suggested others follow her example. She concluded her letter by explaining: "So many Americans who had felt pride in our country now feel anguish and shame for the current regime of blood, wounds and fire. I thought of the clean linens at your table, the shining knives and the flames of the candles, and I could not stomach it."<ref>Sharon Olds, "[https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/open-letter-laura-bush/ Open Letter to Laura Bush]," ''The Nation,'' September 19, 2005.</ref>

==Poetry==
Following her Ph.D., Olds let go of an attachment to what she thought she knew about poetic convention and began to write about her family, abuse, and sex, focusing on the work and not the audience.

Olds has said that she is more informed by the work of poets such as [[Galway Kinnell]], [[Muriel Rukeyser]] and [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] than by [[Confessional poetry|confessional poets]] like [[Anne Sexton]] or [[Sylvia Plath]]. Plath, she comments "was a great genius, with an IQ of at least double mine" and while these women charted well the way of women in the world she says "their steps were not steps I wanted to put my feet in."<ref name="Sharon Olds: Blood, sweat and fears"/>

When Olds first sent her poetry to a literary magazine she received a reply saying, "This is a literary magazine. If you wish to write about this sort of subject, may we suggest the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The true subjects of poetry are … male subjects, not your children."<ref name="Sabine Durrant">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/26/sharon-olds-american-poet-divorce |title=Sharon Olds: Confessions of a divorce |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Sabine Durrant |date=26 January 2013 |access-date=26 January 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

Olds eventually published her first collection, ''Satan Says'', in 1980, at the age of 37. ''Satan Says'' sets up the sexual and bodily candour that would run through much of her work. In "The Sisters of Sexual Treasure" she writes, "As soon as my sister and I got out of our/ mother's house, all we wanted to/do was fuck, obliterate/her tiny sparrow body and narrow/grasshopper legs."<ref name="independent.co.uk">Quoted in "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/sharon-olds-blood-sweat-and-fears-421691.html Sharon Olds: Blood, sweat and fears]", ''Independent'', September 22, 2011.</ref>

The collection is divided into four sections: "Daughter," "Woman," "Mother," "Journeys." These titles echo the familial influence that is prevalent in much of Olds' work.

''The Dead and the Living'' was published in February 1984. This collection is divided into two sections: "Poems for the Dead" and "Poems for the Living."  The first section begins with poems about global injustices. These injustices include the [[Armenian genocide]] during [[World War I|WWI]], the [[Tulsa race riot|1921 Tulsa Race Riot]], the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], and even the [[death of Marilyn Monroe]].

Olds' book ''The Wellspring'' (1996), shares with her previous work the use of raw language and startling images to convey truths about domestic and political violence and family relationships.<ref name="Author Page: Sharon Olds">"[https://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/olds.html Author Page: Sharon Olds]", New York State Writers Institute.</ref> In a ''New York Times'' review, Lucy McDiarmid hailed her poetry for its vision: "like [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], Ms. Olds sings the body in celebration of a power stronger than political oppression."<ref>Lucy McDiarmid, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/books/private-parts.html Private Parts]", ''New York Times'', September 15, 1996.</ref> [[Alicia Ostriker]] noted Olds traces the "erotics of family love and pain." Ostriker continues: "In later collections, [Olds] writes of an abusive childhood, in which miserably married parents bully and punish and silence her. She writes, too, of her mother's apology "after 37 years," a moment when "The sky seemed to be splintering, like a window/someone is bursting into or out of."<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> Olds' work is anthologized in over 100 collections, ranging from literary/poetry textbooks to special collections. Her poetry has been translated into seven languages for international publications. She has been published in [[Beloit Poetry Journal]]. She was the New York State [[Poet Laureate]] for 1998–2000.<ref name="Author Page: Sharon Olds"/>

''[[Stag's Leap (book)|Stag's Leap]]'' was published in 2013. The poems were written in 1997, following the divorce from her husband of 29 years. The poems focus on her husband, and even sometimes his mistress. The collection won the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]] for Poetry.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/poet-sharon-olds-scoops-ts-eliot-prize-for-confessional-work-about-her-husbands-affair-8451387.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Nick | last=Clark | title=Poet Sharon Olds scoops TS Eliot Prize for 'confessional' work about her husband's affair | date=14 January 2013}}</ref> She is the first American woman to win this award.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It also won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]].<ref>"[https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/sharon-olds The 2013 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry]", The Pulitzer Prizes.</ref>

==Women's Movement==
Olds did not participate in the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Movement]] at first, but she says, "My first child was born in 1969. In 1968 the Women's Movement in New York City—especially among a lot of women I knew—was very alive. I had these strong ambitions to enter the bourgeoisie if I could. I wasn't a radical at all. But I do remember understanding that I had never questioned that men had all the important jobs. And that was shocking—well, I was 20 years old! I'd never thought, "Oh, where's the woman bus driver?" So there's another subject—which was what it felt like to be a woman in the world."<ref>"[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/advice-young-poets-sharon-olds-conversation Advice to Young Poets: Sharon Olds in Conversation]", Michael Laskey, Poets.org, May 12, 2010.</ref>
