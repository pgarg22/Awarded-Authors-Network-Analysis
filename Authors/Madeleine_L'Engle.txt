Her works reflect both her [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and her strong interest in modern [[science]].

==Early life==
Madeleine L'Engle Camp was born in [[New York City]] on November 29, 1918, and named after her great-grandmother, Madeleine Margaret L'Engle,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Saunders-3590 |title=Madeleine Margaret L'Engle |series=genealogy}}</ref> otherwise known as Mado.<ref name=Summer>{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=The Summer of the Great-Grandmother |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1974 |isbn=0-374-27174-7 |pages=164}}</ref> Her maternal grandfather was Florida banker [[Bion Barnett]], co-founder of [[Barnett Bank]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Her mother, a pianist, was also named Madeleine: Madeleine Hall Barnett. Her father, Charles Wadsworth Camp, was a writer, critic, and foreign correspondent who, according to his daughter, suffered lung damage from [[mustard gas]] during [[World War I]].{{efn|In a 2004 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of the writer, relatives of L'Engle disputed the mustard gas story, stating instead that Camp's illness was caused by [[alcoholism]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Zarin |first=Cynthia |title=The Storyteller |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/12/040412fa_fact_zarin?currentPage=all |access-date=14 February 2012 |magazine=The New Yorker |date=12 April 2004}}</ref>}}

L'Engle wrote her first story at age of five and began keeping a [[personal journal|journal]] at age eight.<ref name= "Suncatcher">{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F. |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1972 |pages=30–31 |isbn=1-880913-31-3}}</ref> These early literary attempts did not translate into academic success at the New York City private school where she was enrolled. A shy, clumsy child, she was branded as stupid by some of her teachers. Unable to please them, she retreated into her own world of books and writing. Her parents often disagreed about how to raise her, and as a result she attended a number of [[boarding school]]s and had many [[governess]]es.<ref name="Circle">{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=A Circle of Quiet |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus & Giroux]] |year=1972 |isbn=0-374-12374-8}}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2014}} The Camps traveled frequently. At one point, the family moved to a [[château]] near [[Chamonix]] in the [[French Alps]], in what Madeleine described as the hope that the cleaner air would be easier on her father's lungs. Madeleine was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland. However, in 1933, L'Engle's grandmother fell ill, and they moved near [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to be close to her. L'Engle attended another boarding school, [[Ashley Hall (school)|Ashley Hall]], in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. When her father died in October&nbsp;1936, Madeleine arrived home too late to say goodbye.<ref>{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=The Summer of the Great-Grandmother |publisher=Farrar, Straus, & Giroux |year=1974 |isbn=0-374-27174-7 |pages=119}}</ref>

==Education, marriage, and family==
L'Engle attended [[Smith College]] from 1937 to 1941. After graduating ''[[cum laude]]'' from Smith,<ref name=Horn>{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Franklin (actor) |title=Madeleine L'Engle |journal=[[Horn Book Magazine]] |date=August 1963 |url=http://www.hbook.com/magazine/articles/1960s/aug63_franklin.asp |access-date=May 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529221101/http://www.hbook.com/magazine/articles/1960s/aug63_franklin.asp |archive-date=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> she moved to an apartment in New York City. L'Engle published her novels ''The Small Rain'' and ''Ilsa'' prior to 1942.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.madeleinelengle.com/madeleine-lengle/|title=Learn About Madeleine L'Engle, Beloved Author of A Wrinkle in Time|work=Madeleine L'Engle|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref> She met actor  [[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]] that year when she appeared in the play ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' by [[Anton Chekhov]],<ref>{{iBDB name|472125}}</ref> and she married him on January 26, 1946.  Later she wrote of their meeting and marriage, "We met in ''The Cherry Orchard'' and were married in ''The Joyous Season''."<ref name= Horn /> The couple's first daughter, Josephine, was born in 1947.

The family moved to a 200-year-old farmhouse called Crosswicks in [[Goshen, Connecticut]] in 1952. To replace Franklin's lost acting income, they purchased and operated a small general store, while L'Engle continued with her writing. Their son Bion was born that same year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F. |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1972 |isbn=1-880913-31-3 |pages=72}}</ref> Four years later, seven-year-old Maria, the daughter of family friends who had died, came to live with the Franklins and they adopted her shortly thereafter.  During this period, L'Engle also served as [[choir]] director of the local [[Congregational church]].<ref name="Chronology">{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F. |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1972 |pages=169–73 |chapter=A Chronology of Madeleine L'Engle's Life and Books |isbn=1-880913-31-3}}</ref>

==Writing career==
L'Engle determined to give up writing on her 40th birthday (November 1958) when she received yet another rejection notice. "With all the hours I spent writing, I was still not pulling my own weight financially."  Soon she discovered both that she could not give it up and that she had continued to work on fiction subconsciously.<ref name = NEH />

The family returned to New York City in 1959 so that Hugh could resume his acting career. The move was immediately preceded by a ten-week cross-country camping trip, during which L'Engle first had the idea for her most famous novel, ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'', which she completed by 1960. It was rejected more than thirty times before she handed it to [[John C. Farrar]];<ref name=NEH/> it was finally published by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] in 1962.<ref name="Chronology" />

In 1960 the Franklins moved to an apartment on the [[Upper West Side]],  in the [[Cleburne Building]] on [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|West End Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web |title=West End Home of A Wrinkle in Time Author Sells for $4 M |first=Lysandra |last=Ohrstrom |date=March 7, 2008 |newspaper=Observer |url=http://www.observer.com/2008/west-end-avenue-home-late-childrens-author-madeleine-lengle-franklin-sold |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505085331/http://www.observer.com/2008/west-end-avenue-home-late-childrens-author-madeleine-lengle-franklin-sold |archive-date=May 5, 2009}}</ref>  From 1960 to 1966 (and again in 1986, 1989 and 1990), L'Engle taught at St. Hilda's & St. Hugh's School in New York. In 1965 she became a volunteer librarian at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], also in New York. She later served for many years as writer-in-residence at the cathedral, generally spending her winters in New York and her summers at Crosswicks.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, L'Engle wrote dozens of books for children and adults. Four of the books for adults formed the ''Crosswicks Journals'' series of autobiographical memoirs. Of these, ''The Summer of the Great-grandmother'' (1974) discusses L'Engle's personal experience caring for her aged mother, and ''Two-Part Invention'' (1988) is a memoir of her marriage, completed after her husband's death from [[cancer]] on September 26, 1986.

===On writing for children===
Soon after winning the Newbery Medal for her 1962 "junior novel" ''A Wrinkle in Time'', L'Engle discussed children's books in ''The New York Times Book Review''.<ref name="NYTBR">{{cite news|title=How's One to Tell?|last=L'Engle|first=Madeleine|date=May 12, 1963|newspaper=The New York Times|page=BR21}}</ref> The writer of a good children's book, she observed, may need to return to the "intuitive understanding of his own childhood," being ''childlike'' although not ''childish''.  She claimed, "It's often possible to make demands of a child that couldn't be made of an adult... a child will often understand scientific concepts that would baffle an adult. This is because he can understand with a leap of the imagination that is denied the grown-up who has acquired the little knowledge that is a dangerous thing." Of philosophy, etc., as well as science, "the child will come to it with an open mind, whereas many adults come closed to an open book. This is one reason so many writers turn to fantasy (which children claim as their own) when they have something important and difficult to say."<ref name="NYTBR" />

==Religious beliefs==
L'Engle was a Christian who attended [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] churches and believed in [[universal salvation]], writing that "All will be redeemed in God's fullness of time, all, not just the small portion of the population who have been given the grace to know and accept Christ. All the strayed and stolen sheep. All the little lost ones."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/september/22.73.html|title=A Distorted Predestination|last=Wilson|first=John|date=September 1, 2003|newspaper=Christianity today}}</ref> As a result of her promotion of [[Christian universalism]], many Christian bookstores refused to carry her books, which were also frequently banned from Christian schools and libraries. At the same time, some of her most secular critics attacked her work for being too religious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2181704,00.html|title=Madeleine L'Engle: Bestselling children's author, renowned for A Wrinkle in Time|last=Eccleshare|first=Julia|date=October 2, 2007|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

Her views on divine punishment were similar to those of [[George MacDonald]], who also had a large influence on her fictional work. She said "I cannot believe that God wants punishment to go on interminably any more than does a loving parent. The entire purpose of loving punishment is to teach, and it lasts only as long as is needed for the lesson. And the lesson is always love."<ref>{{cite book|title=Hell Under Fire: Modern Scholarship Reinvents Eternal Punishment|last1=Morgan|first1=Christopher W|last2=Peterson|first2=Robert A|page=171}}</ref>

In 1982, L'Engle reflected on how suffering had taught her. She told how suffering a "lonely solitude" as a child taught her about the "world of the imagination" that enabled her to write for children. Later she suffered a "decade of failure" after her first books were published. It was a "bitter" experience, yet she wrote that she had "learned a lot of valuable lessons" that enabled her to persevere as a writer.<ref>Madeleine L'Engle, ''Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith & Art'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1982), 58.</ref>

==Later years, death, and legacy==
L'Engle was seriously injured in an automobile accident in 1991, but recovered well enough to visit [[Antarctica]] in 1992.<ref name="Chronology" /> Her son, Bion Franklin, died on December 17, 1999, from the effects of prolonged alcoholism.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/04/12/the-storyteller-cynthia-zarin |title=The storyteller: fact, fiction, and the books of Madeleine L'Engle |last=Zarin |first=Cynthia |date=April 12, 2004 |magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> He was 47 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2193535071 |newspaper=Religion & Ethics News Weekly |title=Madeleine L'Engle |date=November 17, 2000 |publisher=PBS}}</ref>

In her final years, L'Engle became unable to teach or travel due to reduced mobility from [[osteoporosis]], especially after suffering an [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] in 2002. She also abandoned her former schedule of speaking engagements and seminars. A few compilations of older work, some of it previously unpublished, appeared after 2001.

L'Engle died of natural causes at Rose Haven, a [[Nursing home care|nursing facility]] close to her home in Litchfield, Connecticut, on September 6, 2007, according to a statement made by her publicist the following day.<ref>{{cite news |type=obituaries |title=Esther Mitgang; Madeleine L'Engle |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=June 21, 2007 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6476596.html |access-date=September 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113151649/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6476596.html |archive-date=January 13, 2008}}</ref>

L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in Time'' was adapted to a film twice by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. A [[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|television film]], directed by [[John Kent Harrison]], premiered on May 10, 2004. When asked in an interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'' if the film "met her expectations", L'Engle said, "I have glimpsed it. ...&nbsp;I expected it to be bad, and it is."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/i-dare-you-127959 |magazine=Newsweek |title=Madeleine L'Engle |date=May 6, 2004}}</ref> A [[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|theatrical film]], directed by [[Ava DuVernay]], premiered March 9, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/wrinkle-in-time/|title=Why A Wrinkle in Time Will Change Hollywood|website=TIME.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>

==Awards, honors, and organizations==
In addition to the numerous awards, medals, and prizes won by individual books L'Engle wrote, she personally received many honors over the years.<ref name="Chronology" /> These included being named an Associate Dame of Justice in the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] (1972);<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47369|page=13902|date=November 4, 1977 }}</ref> the USM Medallion from [[The University of Southern Mississippi]] (1978); the Smith College Medal "for service to community or college which exemplifies the purposes of liberal arts education" (1981); the Sophia Award for distinction in her field (1984); the [[Regina Medal]] (1985); the ALAN Award for outstanding contribution to adolescent literature, presented by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (1987);<ref>{{cite web |title=One Great Read Programs and Events A Wrinkle in Time by Madeline L'Engle |url=http://www.tcpl.lib.in.us/onegreatread |website=www.tcpl.lib.in.us |publisher=Tippecanoe County Public Library |access-date=February 4, 2015}}</ref> and the Kerlan Award (1991).

In 1985 she was a guest speaker at the [[Library of Congress]], giving a speech entitled "Dare to be Creative!" That same year she began a two-year term as president of the [[Authors Guild]].  In addition she received over a dozen [[honorary degree]]s from as many colleges and universities, such as [[Haverford College]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A Commencement for the Millennium |work=Haverford News |publisher=Haverford College |year=2002 |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/archives/commencement2000.html |access-date=September 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017003544/http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/archives/commencement2000.html |archive-date=October 17, 2007}}</ref> Many of these name her as a Doctor of Humane Letters, but she was also made a Doctor of Literature and a Doctor of Sacred Theology, the latter at [[Berkeley Divinity School]] in 1984.

L'Engle received the annual [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]] in 1998.  The Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for a "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature." Four books by L'Engle were cited: ''Meet the Austins'', ''A Wrinkle In Time'', ''A Swiftly Tilting Planet'', and ''A Ring of Endless Light'' (published 1960 to 1980).<ref name=edwards/> In 2004 she received the [[National Humanities Medal]]<ref name = NEH>[http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/madeleine-lengle "Madeleine L'Engle"].

===The Madeleine L'Engle Collection===
Since 1976, [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in [[Illinois]] has maintained a special collection of L'Engle's papers, and a variety of other materials, dating back to 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wheaton.edu/learnres/ARCSC/collects/sc03/content.htm |publisher=Wheaton |title=About the Collection – Madeleine L'Engle |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112215501/http://www.wheaton.edu/learnres/ARCSC/collects/sc03/content.htm |archive-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref> The Madeleine L'Engle Collection includes manuscripts for the majority of her published and unpublished works, as well as interviews, photographs, audio and video presentations, and an extensive array of correspondence with both adults and children, including artwork sent to her by children.

In 2019, a collection of 43 linear feet of L'Engle's family, personal, and literary papers came to the [[Sophia Smith Collection|Sophia Smith Collection of Women's History]] at Smith College.

==Bibliographic overview==
L'Engle's best-known works are divided between the "Chronos" and "[[Kairos]]" frameworks.<ref name="tree">{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=The L'Engle Family Tree, in Many Waters |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1986 |location=New York |isbn=0-374-34796-4}}</ref> The former is the framework in which the stories of the Austin family take place and is presented in a primarily realistic setting, though occasionally with elements that might be regarded as [[science fiction]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The latter is the framework in which the stories of the Murry and O'Keefe families take place and is presented sometimes in a realistic setting and sometimes in a more [[fantasy|fantastic]] or magical milieu.{{citation needed|date= June 2012}} Generally speaking, the more realistic Kairos material is found in the O'Keefe stories,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} which deal with the second-generation characters.  However, the Murry-O'Keefe and Austin families should not be regarded as living in separate worlds, because several characters cross over between them, and historical events are also shared.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to novels and poetry, L'Engle wrote many nonfiction works, including the autobiographical ''[[Crosswicks Journals]]'' and other explorations of the subjects of faith and art. For L'Engle, who wrote repeatedly about "story as truth", the distinction between fiction and memoir was sometimes blurred. Real events from her life and family history made their way into some of her novels, while fictional elements, such as assumed names for people and places, can be found in her published journals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F. |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1972 |isbn=1-880913-31-3 |pages=89–90}}</ref>

A [[Theme (literature)|theme]], often implied and occasionally explicit, in L'Engle's works is that the phenomena that people call religion, science, and magic are simply different aspects of a single seamless reality.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Important L'Engle characters==
{{Main |Major characters in the works of Madeleine L'Engle}}
Most of L'Engle's novels from ''A Wrinkle in Time'' onward are centered on a cast of recurring characters, who sometimes reappear decades older than when they were first introduced. The "Kairos" books are about the Murry and O'Keefe families, with [[Meg Murry]] and [[Calvin O'Keefe]] marrying and producing the next generation's protagonist, [[Polyhymnia O'Keefe]]. L'Engle wrote about both generations concurrently, with Polly (originally spelled Poly) first appearing in 1965, well before the second book about her parents as teenagers (''A Wind in the Door'', 1973). The "Chronos" books center on [[Vicky Austin]] and her siblings. Although Vicky's appearances all occur during her childhood and teenage years, her sister Suzy also appears as an adult in ''A Severed Wasp'', with a husband and teenage children. In addition, two of L'Engle's early protagonists, Katherine Forrester and Camilla Dickinson, reappear as elderly women in later novels. Rounding out the cast are several characters "who cross and connect": [[Canon Tallis]], [[Adam Eddington]], and [[Zachary Gray]], who each appear in both the Kairos and Chronos books.<ref name="tree" />
