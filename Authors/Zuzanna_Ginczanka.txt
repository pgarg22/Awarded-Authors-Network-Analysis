'''Zuzanna Ginczanka''', ''[[pen name]]'' of '''Zuzanna Polina Gincburg''' (March 22,{{r|Sulamito}} 1917 – January 1945){{r|Ironia}} was a [[Polish people|Polish]]-[[Jews|Jewish]] [[poet]] of the [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|interwar period]]. Although she published only a single collection of poetry in her lifetime, the book ''O centaurach'' (''On Centaurs'', 1936) created a sensation in Poland's literary circles.{{r|Kuncewicz}} She was arrested and executed in [[Kraków]] shortly before the end of World War II.{{efn|The exact date of birth of Zuzanna Ginczanka (Sara Ginzburg) is a subject of an ongoing debate due to conflicting documentary evidence.

==Life==
Zuzanna Ginczanka was born '''Zuzanna Polina Ginzburg''' ("Gincburg" in Polish phonetic respelling) in [[Kiev]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Her Jewish parents fled the [[Russian Civil War]], settling in 1922 in the predominantly [[Yiddish]]-speaking town of [[Rivne|Równe]], also called Równe [[Volhynia|Wołyńskie]] by the inhabitants, in the [[Kresy|''Kresy Wschodnie'' (Eastern Borderlands)]] of [[Second Polish Republic|pre-War Poland]] (now in Western part of [[Ukraine]]).<ref>For the date of Ginczanka's arrival at Równe (1922), see ''Mały słownik pisarzy polskich'', pt. 2, ed. J. Z. Białek ''[[et al.]]'', Warsaw, Wiedza Powszechna, 1981, p. 66.  {{ISBN|8321400124}}. However, Professor Izolda Kiec states that Ginczanka's parents arrived at Równe in October/November 1917, bringing the several months' old child with them; see Izolda Kiec, ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, pp.&nbsp;34 & 176.  {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> Her father, Simon Ginzburg, was a lawyer by profession, with her mother Tsetsiliya ([[:ru:Цецилия|Цецилия]]) Ginzburg, ''[[née]]'' Sandberg, a housewife.<ref>[[Jan Śpiewak]], ''Pracowite zdziwienia: szkice poetyckie'', ed.

This is confirmed by [[Tadeusz Wittlin]], p. 241 (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), who adds that her mother lived in [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]], after remarriage, while her father worked as an attorney in [[Berlin]]. (Neither source mentions the parents' names.)  [[Józef Łobodowski|Łobodowski]], on the other hand, while confirming that the mother settled in Spain, initially at [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordova]] and then at Pamplona, recalls having been told by Ginczanka that her father was "dead", adding that she was very reticent about her family in general; in: Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', Toronto, Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, pp. 11{{ndash}}12.

Melancholia Zuzanny Ginczanki'' published by Fundacja OŚKA, Warsaw 2001).</ref>

===Early period===
Ginczanka spoke both [[Russian language|Russian]], the choice of her emancipated parents, and the Polish of her friends, but did not know a word of Yiddish. Her longing to become a Polish poet caused her to choose the Polish language. According to Ginczanka's mother, she began composing verses at the age of 4, authoring a whole [[ballad]] at the age of 8.<ref>Letter of Ginczanka's mother to [[Kazimierz Wyka]], written in Russian after the [[Second World War]]; cited in: Izolda Kiec, "Trochę wierszy, trochę fotografii, wspomnienia kilku przyjaciół", ''Czas Kultury'' ([[Poznań]]), No. 16, May 1990, p. 107.</ref> She published her first poems while still at school, debuting in 1931 {{mdash}} at the age of 14 {{mdash}} with the poem "Uczta wakacyjna" (A&nbsp;Vacation Feast) published in the bimonthly high-school newspaper ''Echa Szkolne'' edited by [[Czesław Janczarski]].<ref name="Warsaw 1994, p. 46"/> During this period of her life Ginczanka was also active as the author of song lyrics.<ref>Izolda Kiec (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 37.</ref> Her "mainstream" debut in a nationwide forum took place in August 1933 in the pages of the ''Kuryer Literacko-Naukowy'', a Sunday supplement to the well-known ''[[Ilustrowany Kuryer Codzienny]]'', with the publication of the 16-line poem entitled "Żyzność sierpniowa" (Fertility in the Month of August; or perhaps, with greater poetic licence: Fullness of August).<ref>Cf. ''Współcześni polscy pisarze i badacze literatury: słownik biobibliograficzny'', ed. J. Czachowska & A. Szałagan, vol. 3 (G{{ndash}}J), Warsaw, Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, 1994, p. 46.  {{ISBN|8302056367}}, {{ISBN|8302054445}}.  Cf. also Lesław M. Bartelski, ''Polscy pisarze współcześni, 1939{{ndash}}1991: leksykon'', Warsaw, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 1995, p. 110.  {{ISBN|8301115939}}.</ref> In the "Żyzność sierpniowa", the 16-year-old poet speaks with the voice of a mature woman looking wistfully back on the world of young people in the bloom of life, with its ripeness for love (hence the title), from the knowing and indulgent perspective of one whose life had come to fruition long before: the reader can be forgiven for thinking that the author of the verses before him is a person of advanced age. The last two lines, moreover, give voice to the [[:pl:Katastrofizm (kultura)|catastrophic]] sonorities that will forever remain the signature trait of Ginczanka's poetry, often couched in [[wiktionary:sanguinary|sanguinary]] imagery as they are here:<blockquote>

Encouraged by [[Julian Tuwim]] to participate in the Young Poets' Competition (''Turniej Młodych Poetów'') organized the next spring by the ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'', the most important [[literary magazine|literary periodical]] in Poland at the time, she won an [[honourable mention]] (third class) with the poem "Gramatyka" (The Grammar), printed in the issue of 15 July 1934 of the weekly that was devoted in part to the results of the competition. She was 17 years old; most if not all of the other 22 finalists (like [[Tadeusz Hollender]], b.&nbsp;1910, and [[Anna Świrszczyńska]], b.&nbsp;1909, who won first prizes, or [[:pl:Witold Makowiecki|Witold Makowiecki]], b.&nbsp;1903, who won an honourable mention, first class, and [[Juliusz Żuławski]], b.&nbsp;1910, honourable mention, third class) were her seniors in age.<ref>See ''Wiadomości Literackie'', vol. 11, No. 29 (556), 15 July 1934, p. 3.  Many of the names of the other finalists cannot be further identified: they are people who didn't make a mark in later times.</ref> Seven weeks later, in its edition of 2 September 1934, ''Wiadomości Literackie'' will revisit its poetry competition by publishing a list of additional book prizes awarded to the winners: for her contribution, Zuzanna Ginczanka will receive a collection of [[Michelangelo]]'s poetry in the translation of [[Leopold Staff]].<ref>"Turniej Młodych Poetów", ''Wiadomości Literackie'', vol. 11, No. 36 (563), 2 September 1934, p. 6.  Cf. Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, ''Poezje {{mdash}} Michał Anioł Buonarroti'', tr. & ed. Leopold Staff, Warsaw, J. Mortkowicz, 1922.</ref> Ginczanka's poem, which opens boldly with a [[punctuation mark]] (a [[parenthesis|left parenthesis]]), deals with [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], describing each in a poetic way beginning with the [[adjective]], then taking on the [[adverb]], and ending with a philosophico-philological analysis of the [[personal pronoun]] ("''I'' without ''you'', ''you'' without ''me'', amounts to nought"; line 30) {{mdash}}<blockquote>

''trzeba tylko wziąć je do ręki''

To this period belongs likewise Ginczanka's poem "Zdrada" (Betrayal; though the word can also mean "treason") composed sometime in 1934.

===Warsaw period===
Upon her arrival in [[Warsaw]] in September 1935, the 18-year-old Ginczanka, already notable, quickly became a "legendary figure" of the [[Interwar period|pre-War]] [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] world of artists of Warsaw as a ''[[protégée]]'' of [[Julian Tuwim]], the [[doyen]] of the Polish poets at the time, a connection which opened for her the doors to all the most important literary periodicals, salons, and publishing houses of the country.<ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', Toronto, Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, p. 9.  [[Wacław Iwaniuk]], ''Ostatni romantyk: wspomnienie o Józefie Łobodowskim'', ed. J. Kryszak, Toruń, Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika, 1998, p. 60. {{ISBN|832310915X}}.  Matuszewski (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).</ref> (Her detractors bestowed on her the sobriquet of "Tuwim in a petticoat", ''Tuwim w spódnicy''; while [[Witold Gombrowicz|Gombrowicz]], known for inventing his own private names for all his acquaintances, monikered her "Gina".)<ref>''Polski słownik judaistyczny: dzieje, kultura, religia, ludzie'', vol. 1, ed. Z. Borzymińska & R. Żebrowski, Warsaw, Prószyński i S-ka, 2003, p.&nbsp;482.  {{ISBN|837255126X}}.  On Gombrowicz's moniker for Ginczanka, see Joanna Siedlecka, ''Jaśnie Panicz: o Witoldzie Gombrowiczu'', Warsaw, Prószyński i S-ka, 2003, p.&nbsp;171.  {{ISBN|8373373675}}.</ref>  High-calibre critics, such as [[Karol Wiktor Zawodziński]], have traced aspects of Ginczanka's lyricism to the poetic achievement of Tuwim, deemed both indefinable and inimitable but concerning primarily the renewed focus on the word, its freshness, and the ultimate conciseness of expression respective of each particular poetic image or vision treated.<ref>[[Karol Wiktor Zawodziński|Karol W.&nbsp;Zawodziński]], "Liryka polska w dobie jej kryzysu" (Polish Lyric Poetry in the Age of Its Crisis), ''Przegląd Współczesny'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;69, No.&nbsp;206, June 1939, pp.&nbsp;14{{ndash}}15 (302{{ndash}}303).</ref> [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]] for his part recalls that Ginczanka was "very good" as a poet from the first, without any initial period of incubation of the poetic talent, and {{mdash}} conscious of her literary prowess {{mdash}} kept herself apart from literary groupings, in particular wishing to distance herself publicly from the [[Skamander]] circle with which she would have normally been associated by others.<ref>[[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]], ''Marginalia'', ed. M. Iwaszkiewicz, P. Kądziela & L. B. Grzeniewski, Warsaw, Interim, 1993, p. 60.  {{ISBN|8385083286}}.</ref>  Thus for example, her frequenting of the [[Ziemiańska|Mała Ziemiańska]] café, the renowned haunt of the Warsaw literati where with gracious ease she held court at the table of [[Witold Gombrowicz]], was memorialized in her poem "Pochwała snobów" (In Praise of Snobs) published in the [[satirical magazine]] ''[[Szpilki]]'' in 1937.<ref>''[[Szpilki]]'', No. 13, 1937.  Cited in: Janusz Stradecki, ''W kręgu Skamandra'', Warsaw, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1977, p. 310, n. 38.</ref>  (The co-founder of the [[:pl:Szpilki (czasopismo)|magazine in question]], the artist [[Eryk Lipiński]], who will play an important role in salvaging her manuscripts after the War, will name his daughter Zuzanna in memory of Ginczanka.<ref>[http://www.rp.pl/artykul/721964.html?print=tak&p=0 Article on the Presspublica web portal.]</ref>  The other co-founder, [[:pl:Zbigniew Mitzner|Zbigniew Mitzner]], will opine in his [[memoirs]] that Ginczanka was tied to this particular weekly magazine by the closest bonds of all the alliances that she maintained with the [[literary magazine|literary press]].)<ref>[[Zbigniew Mitzner]], ''Tak i nie: wybór felietonów z lat 1936{{ndash}}1966'', Warsaw, Czytelnik, 1966, p. 240.</ref>  In testimony to her fame, she would sometimes be herself the subject of satirical poems and drawings published in literary periodicals, as for example in the 1937 Christmas issue of the ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'' where she is pictured in the collective cartoon representing the ''[[wiktionary:crème de la crème|crème de la crème]]'' of Polish literature (next to [[Andrzej Nowicki (writer)|Andrzej Nowicki]] and [[Janusz Minkiewicz]], both holding [[Cupid|Cupid's bows]], though their arrows point discreetly away from her rather than towards).<ref>See ''Wiadomości Literackie'', vol. 14, No. 52/53 (738/739), 26 December 1937, p. 24.

====Impressions====
Ginczanka was a woman possessed of striking, arresting beauty {{mdash}} "the beauty of a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icon]]", in the words of the slightly older writer [[:pl:Ryszard Matuszewski (literat)|Ryszard Matuszewski]] who remembered her visits to the Zodiak café in Warsaw<ref>[[Ryszard Matuszewski]], ''Z bliska: szkice literackie'', Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1981, p. 202.  {{ISBN|830800508X}}.</ref> {{mdash}} many of her fellow writers remarking on her eyes in particular (each slightly different, both in some reports enhanced by a [[:it:Strabismo#Strabismo di Venere|strabismus of Venus]]) and on the irresistibly attractive harmony between her nimble physical appearance and her personal psychology.  [[Jan Kott]] saw in fact a connection between her poetry, "which enthuses all", and her personal beauty: "there was something of a [[Persian literature|Persian]] ''[[qasida]]'' in both", he wrote.<ref>[[Jan Kott]], ''Przyczynek do biografii'', [[London]], Aneks, 1990, p. 41.  {{ISBN|0906601754}}.</ref> (Her Italian translator, Alessandro Amenta, has recently taken this line of reasoning further, opining that for her admirers, her body has merged with her text.)<ref>Cf.

[[Józef Łobodowski]], perhaps the most serious contender for her hand between 1933 and 1938, dedicated to her several poems published in ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'' and later in the Polish [[émigré]] press, as well as devoting to her one of his last collections of poetry, ''Pamięci Sulamity'' ("In Remembrance of the [[Shulamite]] [[Shulammite Woman|Woman]]"; see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), with a valuable autobiographical introduction.<ref>Wacław Iwaniuk, ''Ostatni romantyk: wspomnienie o Józefie Łobodowskim'', ed.

With the kind of celebrity she enjoyed, her apartment in the [[wiktionary:ulica|ulica]] Szpitalna in [[Warsaw]] (picture at right) was transformed into the premier literary salon of Poland on the occasions of her birthdays, name-days, etc.  [[Eryk Lipiński]] reports that it is here that he saw the famed author [[Witold Gombrowicz]] in the flesh for the first time.<ref>[[Eryk Lipiński]], "Ja i wielu ludzi (III): Witold Gombrowicz" (Me and Lots of Others, Part III: [[Witold Gombrowicz]]), ''Stolica'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;40, No.&nbsp;52 (1971), 29&nbsp;December 1985, p.&nbsp;11.

====Publication====
Although she published only a single collection of poetry in her lifetime, the book ''O centaurach'' ("About the Centaurs"), it created a sensation.<ref name="Kuncewicz">[[Piotr Kuncewicz]], ''Agonia i nadzieja'' (vol.&nbsp;1 of ''Literatura polska od 1918''), [[Warsaw]], Polska Oficyna Wydawnicza BGW, 1993, p.&nbsp;112.  {{ISBN|8370665187}}.</ref>  She explained the title by pointing to the dual nature of the [[centaur]], a mythological creature that was part man, part horse {{mdash}} here adopted as a [[simile]] for her poetical project of uniting in verse the disparate qualities of [[wisdom|sagacity]] and [[eroticism|sensuality]], "tightly conjoined at the waist like a centaur".<ref>Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 9.</ref>  This is especially significant to the [[feminist literary theory]] as it presents a vision of what has traditionally been considered male and female elements fused together in art and life.<ref>Maya Peretz, "Bondage and Freedom in the Voice of Polish Women Poets"; in: ''Translation Perspectives: Selected Papers'', vol.&nbsp;3 (''1985{{ndash}}86''), ed. M.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Rose, [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton (New York)]], National Resource Center for Translation and Interpretation: SUNY{{ndash}}Binghamton Translation Research and Instruction Program, 1984, p.&nbsp;27.  {{ISSN|0890-4758}}.</ref>  To those who had not heard of Ginczanka before, the first exposure to her verses was often an awakening.  The testimony of the poet [[:pl:Tadeusz Bocheński (poeta)|Tadeusz Bocheński]] may be cited as a case in point, being the more valuable for having been expressed in a private letter and not intended for public consumption.  Writing in February 1936 to the editor-in-chief of the [[literary magazine|literary monthly]] ''[[:pl:Kamena (czasopismo)|Kamena]]'', [[Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski]], Bocheński excoriates the well-known poets [[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]] and [[Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska|Pawlikowska]] while at the same time stating the following:
:<span style="font-size:92%; line-height: 1.3em;">[[Mieczysław Jastrun|Jastrun]] inspires interest, [as does] Ginczanka, otherwise unknown to me: I feel instinctively that we are dealing here with a deeper nature, with poetry of a higher pedigree (''rasowsza poezja''); who is she? where is this lady coming from?<ref>From the letter of [[Tadeusz Bocheński]] to [[Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski]] dated 15 February 1936; quoted in: Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski, ''W kręgu Kameny'' (vol. 7 of ''Pisma: wydanie jubileuszowe''), ed.

One of the most distinguished modern Ukrainian poets and the one most hated by the Soviets, [[:uk:Маланюк Євген Филимонович|Yevhen Malanyuk]] (1897{{ndash}}1968),<ref>S. H. [''[[sic]]''], "Ukrainian Writers in Exile, 1945{{ndash}}1949", ''The Ukrainian Quarterly'', vol. 6, 1950, p. 74.</ref> then living in exile in Warsaw, on being first introduced to Ginczanka's poetry by Julian Tuwim ran breathlessly into the editorial offices of the ''[[:pl:Biuletyn Polsko-Ukraiński|Biuletyn Polsko-Ukraiński]]'' with the news of the revelation from a new "excellent poetess".<ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', Toronto, Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, p. 10.</ref>  Ginczanka did not hesitate to lend her art to the furtherance of a social cause, as shown in her poem "Słowa na wiatr" (Words To the Four Winds), published in the ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'' in March 1937, whose message impugns the honesty of the country's authorities and industrial groupings in making promises to render assistance to those in need during the difficult winter period.  Her voice here is mercilessly biting and derisive ("they count, and count, and lick their fingers, and count some more" {{mdash}} ''[[sc.]]'' the remaining winter pages in the tear-off calendar on the wall, and the money to be saved) as she accuses the potentates of stalling for time in the hope that the cold spell will pass and they will not have to make good on their pledges.<ref>Zuzanna Ginczanka, "Słowa na wiatr", ''Wiadomości Literackie'', vol. 14, No. 14 (700), 28 March 1937, p. 21.</ref>

====Radio dramas====
Ginczanka wrote several [[radio dramas]] for the Polish national broadcaster, the [[Polskie Radio|Polskie Radjo]].  In July 1937 her programme ''Pod dachami Warszawy'' ("Under the Roofs of Warsaw"), authored jointly with [[Andrzej Nowicki (writer)|Andrzej Nowicki]], was broadcast.<ref>"Program stacyj radjowych na niedzielę, dnia 4&nbsp;lipca 1937&nbsp;r." (Radio Pragrammes for Sunday, 4&nbsp;July 1937), ''[[Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny|Ilustrowany Kuryer Codzienny]]'' (Kraków), vol.&nbsp;28, No.&nbsp;184, 5&nbsp;July 1937, p.&nbsp;24.</ref> In March 1938 Polish press carried an announcement of another radio drama authored by Ginczanka jointly with Nowicki, ''Sensacje amerykańskie'' ("American Sensations"), on the theme of [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s journey to America, broadcast by the Polskie Radjo.<ref>"Program stacyj radjowych na niedzielę 27&nbsp;marca 1938&nbsp;r."

===Intimations of war===
As observed by attentive readers such as [[:pl:Monika Warneńska|Monika Warneńska]], Ginczanka had prophetically foreseen the onset of the [[Second World War]] and the annihilation that it would bring with it, but expressed it all in poetic touches so delicate that their true import might have been missed before the event.<ref>[[Monika Warneńska]], ''Warsztat czarodzieja'', [[Łódź]], Wydawnictwo Łódzkie, 1975, p. 221.</ref>  Such is her poem entitled "Maj 1939" (May 1939) published on the first page of the ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'', the premier [[literary magazine|literary periodical]] in [[Second Polish Republic|pre-War Poland]], 61 days before the outbreak of the War, in July 1939. The poem is surrounded on all sides by the massive article by [[:pl:Edward Boyé|Edward Boyé]] analyzing the nature of the [[Italian Fascism]], the only other piece printed on the page.  Ginczanka's poem, deceptively insouciant {{mdash}} almost ebullient {{mdash}} in tone while it considers the uncertainty as to whether the Spring might pass under the shadow of war or alternatively under the spell of love, employs the [[metaphor]] of the [[Fork (road)#Fork|fork in the road]] where either of the two divergent arms, though ostensibly very different and having the opposite direction "at odds" with the other, does in fact lead "[[last things|to the last things]]" (''do spraw ostatecznych''; line 28).<ref>Cf. Izolda Kiec, "Wiosna radosna? (Ginczanka i Słonimski)", ''[[Twórczość]]'', No. 9, 1992, pp. 70{{ndash}}78.</ref>  Thus, in a twist on [[Robert Frost|Robert Frost's]] [[The Road Not Taken (poem)|famous poem]], it makes no difference ''here'' to take "the one less travelled by":

==Invasion of Poland==
[[File:8-8a, Rustaveli Street, Lviv.jpg|thumb|The building in the [[wiktionary:ulica|ulica]] Jabłonowskich №&nbsp;8a in [[Lvov]] where Ginczanka lived in 1939{{ndash}}1942 and where she was betrayed to the Nazis (in a 2011 photo; street today renamed after [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]])]]

Ginczanka left Warsaw in June 1939 to spend her summer vacations (as was her habit every year) with her grandmother in Równe Wołyńskie. Here she was caught by the outbreak of the Second World War occasioned by the [[Invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on Friday, 1&nbsp;September 1939, and in reaction to this news decided to stay at Równe, a town which, being located on the Eastern Borderlands of Poland, was relatively sheltered from the hostilities of war. This circumstance changed dramatically just two weeks later with the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet invasion of Poland|attack on Poland from the East]] on 17&nbsp;September, which brought Soviet rule to Równe (a town never to be returned to Poland again), and with it communist harassment and attacks targeting the "bourgeois elements" and the propertied classes in particular. The grandmother Klara Sandberg's ground-floor business (pharmacy store) in the town's main street was immediately expropriated, while their second-story living quarters were in large measure requisitioned for Soviet officials, squeezing the owners (including Ginczanka) into a single servant's room. These developments forced upon Ginczanka the decision to leave Równe to try to find accommodation in the much larger Polish city of [[Lvov]], situated 213 kilometres to the south-east and likewise occupied by the Soviet Union. Before departure, the grandmother packed all the family heirlooms and valuables like table silver into her luggage, both as a means of preserving her ownership of the movable property and to provide for Ginczanka's future dowry. In Lvov Ginczanka rented a flat in the apartment building in the [[wiktionary:ulica|ulica]] [[Jabłonowski family|Jabłonowskich]] №&nbsp;8a (pictured to the right), where her co-residents included [[Karol Kuryluk]], and the writers [[Władysław Bieńkowski]] (1906{{ndash}}1991), [[Marian Eile]] (1910{{ndash}}1984), and [[Franciszek Gil]] (1917{{ndash}}1960).<ref>Izolda Kiec, "Dzieje swarliwe i wielkie przyjdzie ci jeszcze przemierzyć"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, pp.&nbsp;147[[wiktionary:ff.|ff.]] {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref>

During the years 1939{{ndash}}1942 Ginczanka lived in the city of Lvov in occupied Poland, working as an editor. She wrote a number of Soviet propaganda poems. She narrowly managed to avoid arrest by Ukrainian forces targeting Jewish population of the city, being shielded by her Nansen passport which, unfamiliar to them, impressed them sufficiently to spare her.<ref name="IKZG149">Izolda Kiec, "Dzieje swarliwe i wielkie przyjdzie ci jeszcze przemierzyć"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;149. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref>

Early in 1940, at the age of 22, she married in Lvov the Polish art historian [[Michał Weinzieher]], her senior in age by 14 years (in some accounts, by 16 years), a move which she did not elect to explain to her friends.<ref name="IKZG149" /> While officially married to Weinzieher, she carried on a contemporaneous relationship with an artist Janusz Woźniakowski, a young Polish [[graphic designer]] extremely devoted to her poetry.<ref name="IKZG149" /> Woźniakowski helped her avoid detection after [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany's invasion of Lvov]] late in June 1941 and offered her general moral support.<ref>Natan Gross, ''Poeci i Szoa: obraz zagłady Żydów w poezji polskiej'', [[Sosnowiec]], Offmax, 1993, p. 118. {{ISBN|8390014939}}.

Most of the manuscripts with these works have perished, very few of them being recreated after the War from memory by those who had come to know them by heart.<ref name="IKZG149" />

With the invasion by Nazi Germany of the Eastern Borderlands of Poland on [[Operation Barbarossa|22&nbsp;June 1941]], an area previously occupied since [[Soviet invasion of Poland|17&nbsp;September 1939]] by the Soviet Union, the situation of the Jewish population once again changed dramatically for the worse, the [[Holocaust]] being already in full swing at that time. In Równe, Ginczanka's grandmother and her closest relative in Poland, Klara Sandberg, was arrested by the Nazis and died of a heart attack induced by the horror of impending death while being transported to a place of execution at [[Zdołbunów]], barely 17 kilometres away.<ref name="IKZG155">Izolda Kiec, "Gdy oto pęka wiersz nie mogąc pomieścić grozy"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;155. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref>  In Lvov, the female concierge in the building where Ginczanka resided, resentful of having allocated space in her building to a refugee like Ginczanka in the first place, saw her opportunity to rid herself of the unwelcome tenant and at the same time to enrich herself. In the summer of 1942 she denounced Ginczanka to the Nazi authorities newly in power in town as a Jew hiding in her building on false papers. The Nazi police immediately made an attempt to arrest Ginczanka, but other residents of the building helped her avoid arrest by slipping out the back door, etc. On one single day the [[Schupo]] made three separate raids on the building in an effort to arrest Ginczanka.  They finally succeeded in capturing her.<ref name="IKZG155" /> While a narrow brush with death, this arrest did not result in Ginczanka's execution as on this occasion she escaped from captivity. Sources differ as to the exact circumstances in which this happened. According to the court documents from the [[post-War]] trial of Zofja Chomin, as reported in the press ([[#Aftermath|see Aftermath below]]), she managed to give her captors a slip after having been brought to the police station but before being securely imprisoned; according to other sources, her friends managed to redeem her from Nazi hands by bribery.<ref>Izolda Kiec, "Gdy oto pęka wiersz nie mogąc pomieścić grozy"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;156. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> Whatever the details of this outcome, the incident led Ginczanka to the writing of her best known poem "Non omnis moriar" ([[#The "Non omnis moriar"|see insert]]).

===Kraków period===
In September 1942 Michał Weinzieher, Ginczanka's husband, decided to leave Lvov in order to escape the internment in the [[Lvov Ghetto]]. They moved to Kraków in the hope that the large city where he was unknown would provide him the anonymity necessary for survival on false papers.<ref name="IKZG159">Izolda Kiec, "Nie zostawiłam tutaj żadnego dziedzica"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;159. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> His own younger brother had already been murdered two years earlier by the [[Soviets]] in the [[Katyn Massacre]], and Weinzieher was literally running away from death. During his stay in Kraków with the Güntner family Weinzieher (unwisely for the times) continued to pursue his left-wing political activism and continued to maintain contacts with underground left-wing political parties.<ref name="IKZG159" /> It is here, and in these circumstances, that he was joined a few months later by his wife, Zuzanna Ginczanka, whose false papers indicated that she was a person of [[Armenians|Armenian nationality]].<ref name="IKZG160">Izolda Kiec, "Nie zostawiłam tutaj żadnego dziedzica"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;160. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> The few months that separated her and her husband's arrival in Kraków were spent by Ginczanka with Woźniakowski at his aunt's in [[Felsztyn]], 97 kilometres to the south-west of Lvov, where Ginczanka was presented as Woźniakowski's fiancée. The false papers on which Ginczanka and Weinzieher travelled were provided in both cases by Janusz Woźniakowski.<ref name="IKZG160" />

In Kraków Ginczanka occupied a room next door to Weinzieher's, spending most of her time in bed. According to her hosts, Ginczanka used to say that "My creative juices flow from my laziness".<ref name="IKZG160" /> Here her most frequent visitor was Janusz Woźniakowski, but she also maintained close contacts with the noted painter, [[Helena Cygańska-Walicka]] (1913{{ndash}}1989), the wife of the [[art historian]] [[Michał Walicki]], [[Anna Rawicz]], and others.<ref>Izolda Kiec, "Nie zostawiłam tutaj żadnego dziedzica"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;160. {{ISBN|8390172003}}. Kiec indicates "Halina [''[[sic]]''] Cygańska-Walicka" and "Anka Jawicz [''[[sic]]'']", obvious misprints or mistakes for "Helena'' Cygańska-Walicka" and "Anna (or Anka) Rawicz".</ref> Because even on rare outings in the street Ginczanka was attracting the unwelcome attention of passers-by with her exotic beauty, she decided to change her hideaway by moving to the (then suburban) spa locality of [[Swoszowice, Kraków|Swoszowice]] on the southern outskirts of Kraków, where she joined up with a childhood friend of hers from Równe, [[#Photos|Blumka Fradis]], who was herself at the time hiding there from the Nazis.<ref name="IKZG161">Izolda Kiec, "Nie zostawiłam tutaj żadnego dziedzica"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;161. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref>

At the beginning of 1944, apparently as an entirely fortuitous mishap, Janusz Woźniakowski was arrested in a mass ''[[łapanka]]'' or random round-up of Polish citizens in the street.<ref name="IKZG161" /> The laundry receipt found on his person indicated the address of Ginczanka's ''old'' hideout, no longer occupied by her but a place where Woźniakowski continued to reside with Weinzieher. During a search of the premises, which a bloodied Woźniakowski was made to witness, Ginczanka's husband, Michał Weinzieher, was additionally arrested.<ref name="IKZG161" /> On 6&nbsp;April 1944 there appeared pasted on the walls of Kraków an announcement issued by the "[[Drumhead court-martial|Summary Tribunal]] of the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]]" (''Standgericht der Sicherheitspolizei'') listing 112 names of people sentenced to death: the first 33 names were those on whom the sentence of death had ''already'' been carried out, the rest were those awaiting execution. Janusz Woźniakowski's name is the fifth on the list. Michał Weinzieher's is further down.<ref>[[Tadeusz Wroński]], ''Kronika okupowanego Krakowa'', Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1974, pp.&nbsp;331{{ndash}}332.  Cf. Izolda Kiec, "Nie zostawiłam tutaj żadnego dziedzica"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;161. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref>

===Arrest===
Zuzanna Ginczanka frequently changed hiding places, the last one was in the apartment of Holocaust rescuer Elżbieta Mucharska; located at Mikołajska&nbsp;№&nbsp;5 Street in the heart of [[Kraków Old Town]].<ref name="IKZG161"/> The circumstances of Ginczanka's arrest were pondered upon by postwar memorist.<ref name="IKZG161" /> The first account is that of Wincentyna Wodzinowska-Stopkowa (1915{{ndash}}1991), published in her 1989 memoir ''Portret artysty z żoną w tle'' ("A Portrait of the Artist with the Wife in the Background").<ref name="WWS55">Wincentyna Wodzinowska-Stopkowa, ''Portret artysty z żoną w tle'', Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1989. {{ISBN|8308019692}}.

A separate account of Zuzanna Ginczanka's arrest was given orally to Professor Izolda Kiec of the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|University of Poznań]] 46 years after the fact, in January 1991, by Jerzy Tomczak, grandson of Elżbieta Mucharska, Ginczanka's last hostess in Kraków mentioned in the preceding paragraph; it is included in her 1994 book ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'' ("Zuzanna Ginczanka: Life and Work"; see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), to date the most serious book on Ginczanka {{mdash}} a poet who is still awaiting a proper critical, academic biography. At the time of Ginczanka's arrest in the autumn of 1944 Tomczak was ten years' old and living in one room with Ginczanka for about a month or so.<ref name="IKZG162">Izolda Kiec, "Nie zostawiłam tutaj żadnego dziedzica"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;162. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> He recalls that during her stay Ginczanka never left the premises even once for security reasons, and she would never open the door if she happened to be alone. The only visitor she received was a high-school friend of hers, "a blonde without Semitic features" (Blumka Fradis).<ref name="IKZG162" />  Returning from school one day he was intercepted on the stairs by a neighbour who told him to back off: "''They'' are at your place...".  He withdrew at this and went into the entryway of the apartment building across the street (pictured to the right). About half an hour later, from this vantage point, he observed Zuzanna Ginczanka and Blumka Fradis being escorted by the Gestapo out of his building.<ref name="IKZG162" /> He comments: "I have no idea how they managed to track them down. I suspect a denunciation by a neighbour. There is no other possibility."<ref name="IKZG162" />

===Notes from the prison cell===
Izolda Kiec (b.&nbsp;1965), the author of the 1994 book on Ginczanka, was able to track down a person who was in direct contact with Ginczanka ''after'' her last arrest in the autumn of 1944. This person is a woman named Krystyna Garlicka, the sister of the Polish writer [[Tadeusz Breza]] (1905{{ndash}}1970), who resided in 1992 in [[Paris]].<ref>Izolda Kiec, ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, pp.&nbsp;162 & 181. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> Krystyna Garlicka was apparently incarcerated at one point together with Ginczanka, in the same cell, and as a fellow-prisoner developed a rapport with her which made her privy to Ginczanka's confessions and much of her ultimate fate unknown to outsiders.  According to Garlicka's report given to Kiec in 1992, 47 years after the fact, Ginczanka accepted her in prison because she was acquainted with her brother, Tadeusz Breza.<ref name="IKZG163">Izolda Kiec, ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;163. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.</ref> They slept together on a single straw mattress that was spread out on the floor for the night, a time when Garlicka would listen to Ginczanka's confessions.<ref name="IKZG163" /> According to Garlicka, Ginczanka told her that her final arrest was due to a betrayal by her Kraków hostess, Elżbieta Mucharska, as she herself never left the house and "no one had any knowledge of her whereabouts".<ref>Izolda Kiec, ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;163. {{ISBN|8390172003}}. This detail is also independently confirmed by Łobodowski, who does not reveal his sources; see Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', [[Toronto]], Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, p.&nbsp;13.</ref> Ginczanka, who was at first detained in the notorious facility in the [[Montelupich Prison|ulica Montelupich]], was very afraid of torture (for which that prison was infamous), and to stave off attacks on her body she affected a particular concern for her hair, which she would repeatedly touch during interrogations to make small corrections to her locks, etc.<ref name="IKZG163" /> This was noticed by the Gestapo interrogators, and when they came to torment her it was her hair that was selected for special treatment: she was dragged across the floor by the hair.<ref name="IKZG163" /> Although she screamed in pain, she was never broken and never admitted to being Jewish.<ref name="IKZG163" /> However, this was not the case with her friend (Blumka Fradis), who broke down: "perhaps she lacked the courage and the willpower of Ginczanka", Garlicka comments.<ref name="IKZG163" />  Blumka Fradis made a confession which spelled the end of the investigations and "sealed the fate for both of them".<ref name="IKZG163" /> Ginczanka was apparently hoping to be deported in the aftermath to the [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]] in the first instance, and thence to [[Auschwitz]], resolved to overcome everything and survive.<ref name="IKZG163" /> This however did not happen, as she was transferred to another prison in Kraków.

===Place and date of death===

[[File:Investigator custody in Kraków 4.jpg|thumb|Back side of the [[Kraków-Podgórze Detention Centre|prison in the ulica Stefana Czarnieckiego&nbsp;3]] in Kraków, facing the back yard where Ginczanka was murdered, in a 2011 photo (note the blocked-out windows). The building, designed as a courthouse by the Polish-Jewish architect [[Ferdynand Liebling]] (1877{{ndash}}1942), was built in 1905]]

There is no consensus among the published sources as to the exact place of Ginczanka's death. There ''is'' a broad consensus on the circumstance of her having been ''executed by firearm'', either by single firearm or by firing squad, in a ''prison'' located in the ''southern suburbs'' of Kraków.<ref>See, for example, Edward Balcerzan, ''Poezja polska w latach 1939-1965'' (pt. 1: ''Strategie liryczne''), Warsaw, Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, 1982, p. 30.  {{ISBN|830201172X}}.</ref> Many older sources identify the suburb in question as [[Płaszów]] (administratively part of the municipality of Kraków since 1912, but colloquially referred to as a separate community) {{mdash}} not to be confused with the [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Nazi concentration camp of the same name situated in the same locality]]: no claim has ever been made that Ginczanka was deported to ''any'' [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]].<ref>For "Płaszów" as her place of death, see, for example, ''Żydzi w Polsce: dzieje i kultura: leksykon'', ed. J. Tomaszewski & A. Żbikowski, Warsaw, Cyklady, 2001, p. 106.  {{ISBN|838685958X}}. ''[Also in:]'' Marek Sołtysik, ''Świadomość to kamień: kartki z życia Michała Choromańskiego'', [[Poznań]], Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, 1989, p. 9.  {{ISBN|8321006841}}.</ref> Other sources identify the suburb in question to have been the neighbouring spa locality of [[Swoszowice, Kraków|Swoszowice]] (likewise today within the southern borders of Kraków municipality).<ref>For "[[Swoszowice, Kraków|Swoszowice]]" as her place of death, cf. [[Julian Aleksandrowicz]], ''Kartki z dziennika doktora Twardego'', Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1983, p. 60.  {{ISBN|8308009727}}.  (1st ed., 1962.)</ref>  More recently the prison courtyard of the infamous facility in the [[Montelupich Prison|ulica Montelupich №&nbsp;7]] in Kraków has been pointed out as the place of her death.<ref>For the [[Montelupich Prison]] as her place of death, cf. ''Mały słownik pisarzy polskich'', pt. 2, ed. J. Z. Białek ''[[et al.]]'', Warsaw, Wiedza Powszechna, 1981, p. 66.  {{ISBN|8321400124}}.  Lesław M. Bartelski, ''Polscy pisarze współcześni, 1939{{ndash}}1991: leksykon'', Warsaw, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 1995, p. 110. {{ISBN|8301115939}}.</ref>  This identification, perhaps conjectural, would contradict the earlier sources, as the prison in question lies in the city ''centre'' and not on the southern confines of the metropolitan area.  Finally, and perhaps most authoritatively, Izolda Kiec (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), a professor in the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|University of Poznań]], basing her conclusions on unpublished written sources as well as on the numerous oral interviews with eyewitnesses and others directly connected with Ginczanka's life conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, indicates for the first time the courtyard of the prison facility located in the [[Kraków-Podgórze Detention Centre|ulica Stefana Czarnieckiego №&nbsp;3]] in Kraków as the place of Ginczanka's martyrdom (see picture to the right).<ref>Kiec however misspells the name of the street as the ulica "Czarneckiego [''[[sic]]'']": the street is in fact named after the 17th-century Polish personage of <tt>[[Stefan Czarniecki|Stefan Czarn'''i'''ecki]]</tt>.  See the separate article on the [[Kraków-Podgórze Detention Centre]].</ref>  The latter identification does not contradict the earlier sources citing Płaszów, as ''both'' the Płaszów precinct ''and'' the ulica Czarnieckiego are located in the same southern Kraków district of [[Podgórze]]. Moreover, Kiec also states {{mdash}} thereby possibly reconciling all the earlier sources {{mdash}} that Ginczanka was indeed imprisoned at first in the Montelupich Prison, where her interrogation under torture took place, and only after that had been completed was she transferred to the (smaller) prison in the ulica Czarnieckiego, where she was murdered.<ref name="IKZG163" />  Ginczanka was 27 years old.

Ginczanka's high-school friend, Blumka Fradis, was shot in the courtyard at [[Kraków-Podgórze Detention Centre|Czarnieckiego 3]] together with her.<ref name="IKZG163" />

Józef Łobodowski reports the privileged information he received in the 1980s from a source he does not reveal to the effect that Ginczanka's execution took place "just before" (''tuż przed'') the liberation of Kraków (a historical event dated to 18&nbsp;January 1945) {{mdash}} that is to say, in the first part of January 1945.<ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', [[Toronto]], Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, p.&nbsp;13.</ref> Without specifying the 1945 date, Izolda Kiec says much the same thing ("a few days (''na kilka dni'') before the end of the war").<ref>Izolda Kiec, ''Zuzanna Ginczanka: życie i twórczość'', [[Poznań]], Obserwator, 1994, p.&nbsp;163. {{ISBN|8390172003}}.  Professor Kiec's dating of Ginczanka's death is unsourced in her book.  A further imprecision is introduced by the expression "before the end of the war" (''przed zakończeniem wojny''), which has to be taken to mean "before the end of the war ''in Kraków''", as 18&nbsp;January 1945 is not the date of the end of the [[Second World War]] overall.</ref>  If the expressions "just before" and "a few days" were to be interpreted figuratively to mean "a short time" but not necessarily "a ''very'' short time", the date of Ginczanka's death could be pushed back to December 1944, but this procedure would involve stretching the literal meaning of the words of these two key witnesses.  [[Wacław Iwaniuk]], a personal acquaintance of Ginczanka, strongly corroborates our dating of Ginczanka's death: in an interview given in 1991, Iwaniuk states: "Ginczanka was murdered by the Gestapo in Kraków, ''probably on the last day of Kraków's occupation''" (''chyba w ostatnim dniu okupacji Krakowa'') {{mdash}} ''[[i.e.]]'', on 17&nbsp;January 1945.<ref>Zbigniew W.&nbsp;Fronczek, "W wojsku i na emigracji: rozmowa z Wacławem Iwaniukiem o Józefie Łobodowskim" (In Military Service and in Exile: An Interview with [[Wacław Iwaniuk]] about [[Józef Łobodowski]]), ''Gazeta w Lublinie'', No.&nbsp;196, 23&nbsp;November 1991, p.&nbsp;5.</ref>

In an article published in the ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' in December 2015, Ryszard Kotarba, the historian of the aforementioned [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]], speculates however that Ginczanka might have been among the several prisoners brought to that camp by truck on 5 May 1944, most of whom were executed on the spot.<ref>Ryszard Kotarba, "Zuzanna Ginczanka: śmierć poetki. Historia okupacyjna", ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', 14 December 2015.http://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,19333036,zuzanna-ginczanka-smierc-poetki-historia-okupacyjna.html</ref>

===="Non omnis moriar"====
Her single best known poem, written in 1942 and untitled, commonly referred to as "Non omnis moriar" from its opening words (Latin for "Not all of me will die", the ''[[incipit]]'' of an ode by [[Horace]]), which incorporates the name of her purported betrayer within the text, is a [[paraphrase]] of [[Juliusz Słowacki]]'s poem "[[Testament mój]]" (The Testament of Mine).<ref>Scharf (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).</ref>  The "Non omnis moriar" was first published in the weekly periodical ''[[:pl:Odrodzenie (tygodnik)|Odrodzenie]]'' of Kraków in 1946 at the initiative of [[Julian Przyboś]], a poet who had been one of the most distinguished members of the so-called Kraków Avant-garde (''[[:pl:Awangarda Krakowska|Awangarda Krakowska]]'').  Przyboś appended a commentary entitled "Ostatni wiersz Ginczanki" (Ginczanka's Last Poem), saying in part:
:<span style="font-size:95%; line-height: 1.7em;">Hers is the most moving voice in Polish lyrical literature, for it deals with the most terrible tragedy of our time, the Jewish martyrdom.  Only the poems of [[Mieczysław Jastrun|Jastrun]], serving as they are as an epitaph on the sepulchre of millions, make a similar impression, but not even do they evince the same degree of bitterness, of irony, of virulence and power or convey the same brutal truth as does the testament of Ginczanka.  I find its impact impossible to shake off.  We read it for the first time pencilled on a torn and wrinkled piece of paper, like the secret messages that prisoners smuggle out of their dungeons.  (…) The most despairing confessions, the most heartrending utterances of other poets before their death fall far below this proudest of all poetic testaments.  This indictment of the human beast hurts like an unhealed wound.  A shock therapy in verse.<ref>[[Julian Przyboś]], "Ostatni wiersz Ginczanki", ''Odrodzenie'', No. 12, 1946, p. 5.  Cf. Sh. L. [Shemuʾel-Leyb] Shnayderman, ''Between Fear and Hope'', tr. N. Guterman, New York, Arco Publishing Co., 1947, p. 262.</ref></span>
The "Non omnis moriar" was highly esteemed by many others, including the poet [[Stanislaw Wygodzki]],<ref>In a letter of [[Stanislaw Wygodzki]] to [[Tadeusz Borowski]] dated 21 May 1946; quoted in: Tadeusz Borowski, ''Postal Indiscretions: The Correspondence of Tadeusz Borowski'', ed.

Nitecki, Evanston (Illinois), Northwestern University Press, 2007, pp. 86{{ndash}}87.  {{ISBN|9780810122031}}, {{ISBN|0810122030}}.</ref> while another Polish poet, [[Anna Kamieńska]], considered it to be one of the most beautiful poems in the Polish language.<ref>[[Anna Kamieńska]], ''Od Leśmiana: najpiękniejsze wiersze polskie'', Warsaw, Iskry, 1974, p. 219.  Cited in: Shallcross, ''The Holocaust Object'', p. 39 (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).</ref>  Scholars have uncovered textual parallels between "Non omnis moriar" and the ''[[Petit Testament]]'' of [[François Villon]].<ref>[[Mieczysław Inglot]], "Poetyckie testamenty liryczne: uwagi wokół wiersza 'Testament mój' Juliusza Słowackiego", ''Zagadnienia Rodzajów Literackich'', vol. 40, No.1/2, 1997, pp. 101{{ndash}}119.  Cf. Shallcross, ''The Holocaust Object'', p. 49 (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).</ref>  However, perhaps the most significant aspect of the "Non omnis moriar" is its indictment of [[Antisemitism in Poland|Polish antisemitism]] by a Jewish woman who wished more than anything else to become a Polish poet, and to be ''accepted'' as Polish (rather than as an "exotic Other").  In her entire ''oeuvre'' Ginczanka never espoused anything like a Jewish identity, her preoccupations with identity having been focused exclusively on her being a woman.<ref>Bożena Umińska (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 353.</ref>  It is the reference made in the "Non omnis moriar" to the "Jewish things" (''rzeczy żydowskie''; line 6) {{mdash}} Ginczanka's personal effects that will now be [[Looting|looted]] by her betrayer, the [[thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of ''Jewish'' silver]] earned by (and in ethnic contrast with) this particular [[kiss of Judas|kiss of an ''Aryan'' Judas]] {{mdash}} that takes Ginczanka out of the sphere of realisation of her dream.<ref>Cf.

===Aftermath===
In January 1946 on charges of [[collaborationism]] Zuzanna Ginczanka's betrayer before the [[Nazis]], Zofja Chomin, and her son Marjan Chomin were arrested and tried in a court of law. Ginczanka's poem "Non omnis moriar" formed part of the evidence against them.  (This is considered by many scholars to be the only instance in the annals of juridical history of a poem being entered in evidence in a criminal trial.)  According to the article which appeared in the newspaper ''[[:pl:Express Wieczorny|Express Wieczorny]]'' of 5 July 1948 (page 2), Zofja Chomin, the concierge in the building (in the ulica Jabłonowskich №&nbsp;8a) where Ginczanka lived in Lwów, was sentenced to four years' imprisonment for betraying Ginczanka's identity to the Nazis {{mdash}} the poem "Non omnis moriar" again being cited in the writ of the sentence {{mdash}} while her son was acquitted.  Zofja Chomin's defence before the court were to be her words, intended to refute the charge of collaborationism: "I knew of only one little Jewess in hiding..." (''znałam tylko jedną żydóweczkę ukrywającą się...'').  An account of these events is given in a study by Agnieszka Haska (see [[#Related materials|Bibliography]]).

Despite the quality of her poetry, Ginczanka was ignored and forgotten in postwar [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], as communist censors deemed her work to be undesirable.
