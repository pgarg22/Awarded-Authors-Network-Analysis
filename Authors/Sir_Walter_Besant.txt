'''Sir Walter Besant''' (14 August 1836 – 9 June 1901) was an English [[novelist]] and [[historian]]. [[William Henry Besant]] was his brother, and another brother, Frank, was the husband of [[Annie Besant]].

==Early life and education==
The son of wine merchant William Besant (1800–1879),<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-30736|doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/30736|title = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year = 2004}}</ref> he was born at [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]] and attended school at St Paul's, Southsea, Stockwell Grammar, London and [[King's College London]].

In 1855 he was admitted as a [[pensioner]] to [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he graduated in 1859 as 18th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]].<ref>{{acad|id=BSNT855W|name=Besant, Walter}}</ref> After a year as Mathematical Master at [[Rossall School]], [[Fleetwood]], [[Lancashire]], and a year at [[Leamington College]], he spent six years as professor of mathematics at the [[Royal College Curepipe|Royal College]], [[British Mauritius]]. A decline in health compelled him to resign, and he returned to England and settled in London in 1867. From 1868 to 1885 he held the position of Secretary to the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. In 1871 he was admitted to [[Lincoln's Inn]].

==Career==
In 1868 he published ''Studies in French Poetry''. Three years later he began his collaboration with writer [[James Rice (writer)|James Rice]]. Among their joint productions are ''Ready-money Mortiboy'' (1872), and ''The Golden Butterfly'' (1876), both, especially the latter, very successful. This association was ended by the death of Rice in 1882. Thereafter Besant continued to write voluminously by himself, his main novels being ''All in a Garden Fair'' (which [[Rudyard Kipling]] credited in ''Something of Myself'' with inspiring him to leave India and make a career as a writer, and which [[George Gissing]] read with 'extreme delight', calling it 'one of the most charming and delicate of modern novels),<ref>Letters of George Gissing to members of his family, collected and arranged by Algernon and Ellen Gissing. London: Constable, 1927, letter dated 6/3/1884</ref> ''Dorothy Forster'' (his own favorite), ''Children of Gibeon'', and ''[[All Sorts and Conditions of Men]]''. The two last belonged to a series in which he endeavored to arouse the public conscience to the hardship among the poorest classes of cities. In this crusade Besant had considerable success, the establishment of The People's Palace in the East of London being one result. His 1889 novel ''The Bell of St. Paul's'' was considered by his contemporary author [[George Gissing]] to be an 'absurd and empty book'.<ref>Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.274.</ref> In addition to his fiction, Besant wrote largely on the history and [[topography]] of London. His plans for this topic were left unfinished: among his books on this subject is ''London in the 18th Century''.
