'''Tian Han''' (12 March 1898 – 10 December 1968), [[Wade-Giles|formerly romanized]] as '''T'ien Han''', was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] drama activist, playwright, a leader of revolutionary music and films, as well as a translator and poet. He emerged at the time of the [[New Culture Movement]] of the early 20th century and continued to be active until the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was denounced and jailed for two years until his death, before being "posthumously rehabilitated" by the Chinese authorities in 1979. He is considered by drama historians as one of the three founders of Chinese spoken drama, together with [[Ouyang Yuqian]] and [[Hong Shen]].{{sfn|Chen|2014|p=5}} His most famous legacy may be the lyrics he wrote for "[[March of the Volunteers]]" in 1934, which were later adopted as the [[national anthem]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/594812/Tian-Han|title=Tian Han|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|accessdate= 16 February 2015}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Tian Han and Nie Er.jpg|thumb|Tian Han ''(right)'' and [[Nie Er]] ''(left)'', respectively the lyricist and the composer of "[[March of the Volunteers]]", photographed in [[Shanghai]] in 1933]]
During the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, Tian became famous for the vigorous anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist activities in the circle of artists and intellectuals he gathered.

Tian was educated at Tokyo Higher Normal School (present-day [[University of Tsukuba]]) in Japan. Returning from Japan in 1921, Tian established the Creation Society together with [[Guo Moruo]] and [[Yu Dafu]], and other Chinese intellectuals. The Southern China Society, also headed by Tian, played a leading role in promoting dramatic performances in southern China. In 1927, Tian taught at the Department of Literature of Shanghai Art University. Later, he joined The League of Chinese Left-Wing Dramatists. In 1934, he collaborated with the activist [[Liu Liangmo]] on the patriotic anthem, [[March of the Volunteers]].

Tian used various aliases and [[pen name]]s including his [[courtesy name]] Tián Shòuchāng ({{lang|zh|田壽昌}}), Bóhóng ({{lang|zh|伯鴻}}), Chén Yú ({{lang|zh|陳瑜}}), Shùrén ({{lang|zh|漱人}}), and Hànxiān ({{lang|zh|漢仙}}).

Tian, then Chairman of the Union of Chinese Drama Workers and Vice-Chairman of the All China's Federation of Literary and Art Circles, was attacked in 1966 for his historical play ''Xie Yaohuan'' (1961), regarded as an attack on [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]]'s policies and the CCP leadership.  Criticism of this play, along with two other historical plays (''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]'' by [[Wu Han (historian)|Wu Han]] and ''[[Li Huiniang]]'' by [[Meng Chao]]), were the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution.{{sfn|Wagner|1990|p=80}}  Tian was denounced in a 1 February 1966 ''[[People's Daily]]'' article entitled "Xie Yaohuan is a Big Poisonous Weed" (田汉的《谢瑶环》是一棵大毒草 ''Tián Hàn de Xiè Yáohuán Shì yī kē Dà Dúcǎo'').<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Current Background|publisher=American Consulate General|place=Hong Kong|date=30 March 1966|issue=784|title=T'ien Han and his Play Hsieh Yao-huan|page=1}}</ref> The ''[[Jiefang Daily]]'' called ''Xie Yaohuan'' a "political manifesto". The play was condemned for, among other things, of "being a wholesale inheritance of China's theatrical legacy and promoting traditional plays", "disparaging revolutionary modern plays" and "promoting bourgeois class liberalism and obfuscating the direction for the workers, peasants and soldiers", Tian was incarcerated as a "counterrevolutionary" in a prison run personally by [[Kang Sheng]], and died there in 1968. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he and ''Xie Yaohuan'' were “rehabilitated posthumously” (considered to be rehabilitated after death) in 1979.{{sfn|Wagner|1990|p=137}}
