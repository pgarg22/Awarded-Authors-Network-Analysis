The intensifying [[Vietnam War]] interrupted his higher education.

Chicago Vietnam Veterans Memorial]. Retrieved 2021-11-18.</ref> His arrival happened to coincide with the "Mini-Tet" Offensive of May 1968, the month that proved to be the deadliest of the entire war for U.S. forces.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/05/25/the-men-killed-on-a-single-day-in-the-vietnam-war-and-the-haunting-wall-that-memorializes-them/].

After his military service, Tillery returned to Phoenix and attended [[Arizona State University]]. He received a bachelor's degree in Latin American Studies in 1972, and went on to [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]], where in 1973 he earned a master's degree in International Management.

After moving to the [[Chicago]] area, he co-founded The Townsend Agency, Ltd. in 1979, and worked as an advertising executive for 17 years.

==Creative Life==

Throughout his time in the business world he felt drawn to create literature and art. One of his short stories, "Dragon with a Broken Wing," was selected by [[Ray Bradbury]] to receive first prize in a contest honoring the famous native of [[Waukegan, Illinois]].<ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gary-tillery/17/270/883. Gary Tillery, Author and Sculptor]. [[LinkedIn]]. Retrieved 2012-11-19.</ref> In 1996, Tillery resigned his position as chairman of The Townsend Agency to pursue his twin interests of writing and sculpture.

As a writer, his best-known work is ''The Cynical Idealist: A Spiritual Biography of John Lennon''. The book was the first to examine [[John Lennon]] as a man of ideas, exploring his impact on the world as a consequence of his spiritual growth and his self-generated [[Humanism|humanist]] philosophy. Reviewer Grady Harp observed: "Without resorting to puffery or hero worship, Tillery places Lennon's accomplishments with the arts as well as with the framework of political upheaval of his day to reveal a man who will be remembered not only for his prodigious talent, but also for his influence on philosophical thinking."<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Cynical-Idealist-Spiritual-Biography-Lennon/product-reviews/0835608751/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2.
