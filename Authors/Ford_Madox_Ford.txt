'''Ford Madox Ford''' (né '''Joseph Leopold Ford Hermann Madox Hueffer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|f|ər}} {{respell|HEF|ər}});<ref>{{cite book| first= Daniel| last= Jones| title= Everyman's English Pronouncing Dictionary| edition= 13th; rev. A.C. Gimson| place= London| publisher= Dent| year= 1967| page= 236}}</ref> 17 December 1873 – 26 June 1939) was an English novelist, poet, critic and editor whose journals ''[[The English Review]]'' and ''[[The Transatlantic Review (1924)|The Transatlantic Review]]'' were instrumental in the development of early 20th-century English and American literature.

Ford is now remembered for his novels ''[[The Good Soldier]]'' (1915), the ''[[Parade's End]]'' [[tetralogy]] (1924–1928) and ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' [[trilogy]] (1906–1908). ''The Good Soldier'' is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, ''The Observer''′s "100 Greatest Novels of All Time", and ''The Guardian''′s "1000 novels everyone must read".

==Early life==
Ford was born in Wimbledon in London,<ref>{{cite book|title=Complete Works of Ford Madox Ford, with picture of birthplace in Kingston Road, Wimbledon. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s24bAgAAQBAJ&q=ford+madox+ford+kingston+road&pg=PT9|isbn=9781908909701|access-date=3 Feb 2014|last1=Ford|first1=Ford Madox|date=17 November 2013}}</ref> to [[Catherine Madox Brown]] and [[Francis Hueffer]], the eldest of three; his brother was [[Oliver Madox Hueffer]] and his sister was [[Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer]], the wife of David Soskice and mother of [[Frank Soskice]]. Ford's father, who became music critic for ''[[The Times]]'', was German and his mother English. His paternal grandfather [[:de:Johann Hermann Hüffer|Johann Hermann Hüffer]] was first to publish [[Westphalia]]n poet and author [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]]. He was named after his maternal grandfather, the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Ford Madox Brown]], whose biography he would eventually write. His mother's older half-sister was [[Lucy Madox Brown]], the wife of [[William Michael Rossetti]] and mother of [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti]].

In 1889, after the death of their father, Ford and Oliver went to live with their grandfather in London.  Ford graduated from the [[University College School]] in London, but never attended university.<ref name="Ford Madox Society">{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=Max|title=Ford Madox Ford (1873-1939): Biography|url=http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/fords-biography.html |publisher=The Ford Madox Society|access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref> In November 1892, at 18, he became a Catholic, "very much at the encouragement of some Hueffer relatives, but partly (he confessed) galled by the 'militant atheism and anarchism' of his English cousins."<ref>Janet Soskice, "I have never felt so at home." ''The Tablet'', 8 September 2012, 15. Ford was a great uncle of Soskice's husband.</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1894, Ford eloped with his school girlfriend Elsie Martindale. The couple were married in [[Gloucester]] and moved to [[Bonnington]]. In 1901, they moved to [[Winchelsea]].<ref name="Ford Madox Society"/> They had two daughters, Christina (born 1897) and Katharine (born 1900).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/fords-biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Ford Madox Ford Society}}</ref> Ford's neighbours in Winchelsea included the authors [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[W.H. Hudson]], [[Henry James]] in nearby Rye, and [[H.G. Wells]].<ref name="Ford Madox Society" />

In 1904, Ford suffered an [[agoraphobic]] breakdown due to financial and marital problems. He went to Germany to spend time with family there and undergo treatments.<ref name="Ford Madox Society" />

In 1909, Ford left his wife and set up home with English writer [[Violet Hunt|Isobel Violet Hunt]], with whom he published the literary magazine ''[[The English Review]]''. Ford's wife refused to divorce him and he attempted to become a German citizen in order to obtain a divorce in Germany. This was unsuccessful. A reference in an illustrated paper to Violet Hunt as "Mrs Ford Madox Hueffer" gave rise to a successful libel action being brought by Mrs Ford in 1913. Ford's relationship with Hunt did not survive the First World War.<ref>''South Lodge'' by Douglas Goldring, Constable and Co, 1943)</ref>

Ford used the name of '''Ford Madox Hueffer''', but changed it to Ford Madox Ford after World War I in 1919, partly to fulfil the terms of a small legacy,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stang |first1=Sondra |title=The Ford Madox Ford Reader |date=1986 |publisher=Carcanet |location=Manchester |isbn=0-85635-519-4 |page=481}}</ref> partly "because a Teutonic name is in these days disagreeable", and possibly to avoid further lawsuits from Elsie in the event of his new companion, Stella, being referred to as "Mrs Hueffer".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Judd |first1=Alan |title=Ford Madox Ford |date=1991 |publisher=Flamingo |location=London |isbn=0-00-654448-7 |page=324}}</ref>

Between 1918 and 1927, he lived with [[Stella Bowen]], an Australian artist 20 years his junior. In 1920, Ford and Bowen had a daughter, Julia Madox Ford.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Saddest Story: A Biography of Ford Madox Ford | url=https://archive.org/details/saddeststorybiog0000mize |url-access=registration |place=New York |first=Arthur |last=Mizener |publisher=World Publishing |year=1971}}</ref>

In the summer of 1927, ''The New York Times'' reported that Ford had converted a mill building in Avignon, France into a home and workshop that he called "Le Vieux Moulin". The article implied that Ford was reunited with his wife at this point.<ref name=Avignon>{{cite news|last1=Birkhead |first1=May |title=Americans In Paris Find Book Material; Burton Holmes Obtains Unique Pictures -- Maddox Ford Writes in an Old Mill.

In the early 1930s Ford established a relationship with [[Janice Biala]], a Polish-born artist from New York, who illustrated several of Ford's later books.<ref>''South Lodge'' by Douglas Goldring, Constable & Co, 1943)</ref> This relationship lasted until the late 1930s.

Ford spent the last years of his life teaching at [[Olivet College]] in [[Olivet, Michigan|Olivet]], Michigan. He was taken ill in [[Honfleur]], France in June 1939 and died shortly afterwards in [[Deauville]] at the age of 65.

==Literary life==
[[File:Ford Madox Ford 80 Campden Hill Road blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 80 [[Campden Hill Road]], Kensington, London]]
One of Ford's most famous works is the novel ''[[The Good Soldier]]'' (1915). Set just before World War I, ''The Good Soldier'' chronicles the tragic expatriate lives of two "perfect couples", one British and one American, using intricate [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. In the "Dedicatory Letter to Stella Ford” that prefaces the novel, Ford reports that a friend pronounced ''The Good Soldier'' “the finest [[French literature|French novel]] in the English language!” Ford pronounced himself a "[[Tory]] mad about historic continuity" and believed the novelist's function was to serve as the historian of his own time.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=441444|title=The Tory in a Time of Change: Social Aspects of Ford Madox Ford's Parade's End|first=Gene M.|last=Moore|date=23 December 1982|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=28|issue=1|pages=49–68|doi=10.2307/441444}}</ref> However, he was dismissive of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], referring to it as "the Stupid Party."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Ford Madox |title=Memories and Impressions: A Study in Atmospheres |url=https://archive.org/details/memoriesimpressi00ford |date=1911 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |page=[https://archive.org/details/memoriesimpressi00ford/page/193 193]}}</ref>

Ford was involved in British war propaganda after the beginning of [[World War I]]. He worked for the [[War Propaganda Bureau]], managed by [[C. F. G. Masterman]], along with [[Arnold Bennett]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[Gilbert Murray]]. Ford wrote two propaganda books for Masterman; ''When Blood is Their Argument: An Analysis of Prussian Culture'' (1915), with the help of [[Richard Aldington]], and ''Between St Dennis and St George: A Sketch of Three Civilizations'' (1915).

After writing the two propaganda books, Ford enlisted at 41 years of age into the [[Welch Regiment]] of the British Army on 30 July 1915. He was sent to France.  Ford's combat experiences and his previous propaganda activities inspired his [[tetralogy]] ''[[Parade's End]]'' (1924–1928), set in England and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] before, during and after World War I.

[[File:FifthQueen-cvr archive-org (PD).jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[The Fifth Queen|The Fifth Queen: And How She Came to Court]]'' (1906) by Ford Madox Ford, then known as Ford Madox Hueffer]]

Ford wrote dozens of novels as well as essays, poetry, memoirs and literary criticism.  He collaborated with [[Joseph Conrad]] on three novels, ''[[The Inheritors (Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford)|The Inheritors]]'' (1901), ''[[Romance (novel)|Romance]]'' (1903) and ''[[The Nature of a Crime]]'' (1924, although written much earlier). During the three to five years after this direct collaboration, Ford's best known achievement was ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' trilogy (1906–1908), historical novels based on the life of [[Catherine Howard]], which Conrad termed, at the time, "the swan song of historical romance."<ref name=Judd157>{{cite book

Ford's poem ''Antwerp'' (1915) was praised by [[T.S. Eliot]] as "the only good poem I have met with on the subject of the war".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Antwerp |title=Antwerp | first=Pericles |last=Lewis }}</ref>

Ford's novel ''[[Ladies Whose Bright Eyes]]'' (1911, extensively revised in 1935)<ref>{{cite journal| first= Richard A. | last= Cassell| title= The Two Sorrells of Ford Madox Ford| journal= [[Modern Philology]]| volume= 59| number= 2| date= November 1961| pages= 114–121 | doi= 10.1086/389447| jstor= 434869| s2cid= 154530201}}</ref> is a [[Time travel]] novel, like  [[Mark Twain|Twain]]'s classic ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', only dramatising the difficulties, not the rewards, of such idealised situations.

When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Ford took the side of the left [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]], declaring: "I am unhesitatingly for the existing Spanish Government and against Franco’s attempt—on every ground of feeling and reason...Mr Franco wishes to establish a government resting on the arms of Moors, Germans, Italians.

==Promotion of literature==
In 1908, Ford founded ''[[The English Review]]''.  Ford published works by [[Thomas Hardy]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Henry James]], [[May Sinclair]], [[John Galsworthy]] and [[William Butler Yeats]]; and debuted works of [[Ezra Pound]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Norman Douglas]]. Ezra Pound and other Modernist poets in London in the teens particularly valued Ford's poetry as exemplifying treatment of modern subjects in contemporary diction.  In 1924, he founded ''The Transatlantic Review'', a journal with great influence on modern literature. Staying with the artistic community in the Latin Quarter of [[Paris]], Ford befriended [[James Joyce]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Ezra Pound]]<ref>{{cite book| editor-last= Lindberg-Seyersted| editor-first= Brita| title= Pound/Ford, the story of a literary friendship: the correspondence between Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford and their writings about each other| first1= Ezra| last1= Pound| first2= Ford Madox| last2= Ford| first3= Brita| last3= Lindberg-Seyersted| publisher= New Directions Publishing| year= 1982| isbn= 978-0-8112-0833-8| url= https://archive.org/details/poundfordstoryof00poun}}</ref> and [[Jean Rhys]], all of whom he would publish (Ford was the model for the character Braddocks in Hemingway's ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''<ref>{{cite book| page= 84| title= Ford Madox Ford: The Essence of His Art| first= Richard| last= Wald| publisher= University of California Press| year= 1964| via= Google Books}}</ref>).  [[Basil Bunting]] worked as Ford's assistant on the magazine.

As a critic, Ford is known for remarking "Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you." [[George Seldes]], in his book ''[[Witness to a Century]]'', describes Ford ("probably in 1932") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co-author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: "'and he disowns me now that he has become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes." Ford says, "I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making a name like Hemingway." Seldes observes, "At this climax Ford began to sob. Then he began to cry."<ref>{{cite book |last=Seldes |first=George |date=1987 |title=Witness to a Century |url=https://archive.org/details/witnesstocentury00seld/page/258 |location=New York |publisher=Ballantine Books |pages=[https://archive.org/details/witnesstocentury00seld/page/258 258–259] |isbn=0345331818 }}</ref>

Hemingway devoted a chapter of his Parisian memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'' to an encounter with Ford at a café in Paris during the early 1920s.  He describes Ford  "as upright as an ambulatory, well clothed, up-ended hogshead."<ref name= AMFx>{{cite book| first= Ernest| last= Hemingway | title= [[A Moveable Feast]]}}</ref>

During a later sojourn in the United States, Ford was involved with [[Allen Tate]], [[Caroline Gordon]], [[Katherine Anne Porter]] and [[Robert Lowell]] (who was then a student).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honaker|first1=Lisa|title=Caroline Gordon: A Biography, and: Flannery O'Connor and the Mystery of Love (review)|journal=MFS: Modern Fiction Studies|date=Summer 1990|volume=36|issue=2|pages=240–42|doi=10.1353/mfs.0.0714|s2cid=161254508}}</ref> Ford was always a champion of new literature and literary experimentation. In 1929, he published ''The English Novel: From the Earliest Days to the Death of Joseph Conrad'', a brisk and accessible overview of the history of English novels. He had an affair with [[Jean Rhys]], which ended acrimoniously,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rhys.htm |title=Jean Rhys |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615145356/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rhys.htm |archive-date=15 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which Rhys fictionalised in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]''.

==Reception==
Ford is best remembered for his novels ''[[The Good Soldier]]'' (1915), the ''[[Parade's End]]'' [[tetralogy]] (1924–1928) and ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' [[trilogy]] (1906–1908). ''The Good Soldier'' is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html | work= Modern Library| title= 100 Best Novels| publisher= Random House| date= July 20, 1998}}</ref> ''The Observer''′s "100 Greatest Novels of All Time",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/bookaward/The+Observer's+100+Greatest+Novels+of+All+Time|title=The Observer's 100 Greatest Novels of All Time - Book awards |website=Librarything.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> and ''The Guardian''′s "1000 novels everyone must read".<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/23/bestbooks-fiction/print| work= [[The Guardian]]| title= 1000 novels everyone must read| date= 23 January 2009}}</ref> The Parades End tetralogy was made into an acclaimed BBC/HBO 5 part TV series in 2012.
