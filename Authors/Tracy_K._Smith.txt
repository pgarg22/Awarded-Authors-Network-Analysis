==Critical reception==
In his review of ''Life on Mars'', [[Troy Jollimore]] selects Smith's poem "My god, it's full of stars" as particularly strong, "making use of images from science and science fiction to articulate human desire and grief, as the speaker allows herself to imagine the universe:"<ref name=Jollimore />
:... sealed tight, so nothing escapes. Not even time,
:Which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.
:So that I might be sitting now beside my father
:As he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe
:For the first time in the winter of 1959.
In his review of the collection, [[Joel Brouwer]] also quoted at length from this poem, writing that "for Smith the abyss seems as much a space of possibility as of oblivion:"<ref name=Brouwer />
:Perhaps the great error is believing we’re alone,
:That the others have come and gone — a momentary blip —
:When all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,
:Bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel
:Nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,
:...
[[Dan Chiasson]] writes of another aspect of the collection: "The issues of power and paternalism suggest the deep ways in which this is a book about race. Smith’s deadpan title is itself racially freighted: we can’t think about one set of fifties images, of Martians and sci-fi comics, without conjuring another, of black kids in the segregated South. Those two image files are situated uncannily close to each other in the cultural cortex, but it took this book to connect them."<ref name=Chiasson />

About ''The Body's Question'', [[Lucie Brock-Broido]] writes: "How delightful it is to fall under the lucid and quite more than lovely spell of Tracy K. Smith's debut collection. Smith's work is deceptively plainspoken, but these are poems that are powerfully wrought, inspiring in all the clarity of their many gospel truths. ''The Body's Question'' announces a remarkable new voice, brilliantly bundled, ingeniously belted down."

[[Yusef Komunyakaa]] writes: "''The Body's Question'' is an answer to pure passion, but the beauty is that the brain isn't divorced from the body. The strength of character in these marvelous poems delights and questions. Here's a voice that can weave beauty and terror into one breath, and the unguarded revelations are never verbal striptease."

"Tracy Smith speaks many different languages. Besides the Spanish that graces the 'Gospels' of her book's opening section, Smith also seems perfectly at home speaking of grief and loss, of lust and hunger, of joy and desire, which here often means the desire for desire, and a desire for language itself....She seems to speak in tongues, to speak about that thing even beyond language, answering 'The Body's Question' of her title," said [[Kevin Young (poet)|Kevin Young]].

About Smith's second book, ''Duende'', [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]] writes: "Tracy K. Smith synthesizes the riches of many discursive and poetic traditions without regard to doctrine and with great technical rigor. Her poems are mysterious but utterly lucid and write a history that is sub-rosa yet fully within her vision. They are deeply satisfying and necessarily inconclusive. And they are pristinely beautiful without ever being precious. Writers and musicians have explored the concept of [[Duende (art)|duende]], which might in English translate to a kind of existential blues. Smith is not interested in sadness, per se. Rather, in the strange music of these poems I think Smith is trying to walk us close to the edge of death-in-life, the force of hovering death in both the personal and social realms, admitting its inevitability and sometimes-proximity, and understand its manifestations in quotidian acts. This dark force is nonetheless a life force, which, in the poem 'Flores Woman,' concludes 'Like a dark star. I want to last' If ''Duende'' were wine, it would certainly be red; if edible, it would be meat cooked rare, coffee taken black, stinky cheese, bittersweet chocolate. Tracy K. Smith's music is wholly her own, and ''Duende'' is a dolorous, beautiful book."

Smith has received praise throughout her books for her questions on relationships, identity and sexuality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/magazine/poem-a-mans-world.html|title=Poem: A Man's World|last=Smith|first=Tracy K.|date=2018-11-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/books/review/leslie-jamison-sylvia-plath-joan-didion-jean-rhys.html|title=Cult of the Literary Sad Woman|last=Jamison|first=Leslie|date=2019-11-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Hilton Als]] of [[The New Yorker]] writes: "Part of the gorgeous struggle in Smith’s poetry is about how to understand and accept her twin selves: the black girl who was brought up to be a polite Christian and the woman who is willing to give herself over to unbridled sensation and desire."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/tracy-k-smiths-poetry-of-desire|title=Tracy K.
