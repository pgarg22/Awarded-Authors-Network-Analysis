[[File:Imagination 195205.jpg|thumb|Sheckley's first story, "Final Examination", was published in the May 1952 issue of ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'']]

'''Robert Sheckley''' (July 16, 1928 – December 9, 2005)<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Sheckley Encyclopaedia Britannica]</ref> was an American writer. First published in the science-fiction magazines of the 1950s, his numerous quick-witted stories and novels were famously unpredictable, [[absurdism|absurdist]], and broadly comical.

Nominated for [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]]s, Sheckley was named [[Author Emeritus]] by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] in 2001.

==Biography==

Sheckley was born to an assimilated Jewish family in [[Brooklyn]], New York City. In 1931 the family moved to [[Maplewood, New Jersey]]. Sheckley attended [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], where he discovered science fiction. He graduated in 1946<ref>Maxine N. Lurie, Marc Mappen. ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey'', p. 736. Rutgers University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3325-4}}</ref> and hitchhiked to California the same year, where he tried numerous jobs: landscape gardener, pretzel salesman, barman, milkman, warehouseman, and general laborer "board man" in a hand-painted necktie studio. Finally, still in 1946, he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to Korea.<ref name=obit>Jonas, Gerald. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/books/10sheckley.html "Robert Sheckley, 77, Writer of Satirical Science Fiction, Is Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2005. Accessed November 20, 2007.</ref> During his time in the army he served as a guard, an army newspaper editor, a payroll clerk, and  guitarist in an army band. He left the service in 1948.<ref>Robert Sheckley. ''Untouched by Human Hands'', p. 170. First edition, paperback. Ballantine Books 73, 1954.</ref>

Sheckley graduated from [[New York University]] in 1951. The same year he married, for the first time, to Barbara Scadron. The couple had one son, Jason. Sheckley worked in an aircraft factory and as an assistant metallurgist for a short time, but his breakthrough came quickly: in late 1951 he sold his first story, ''Final Examination'', to ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'' magazine. He quickly gained prominence as a writer, publishing stories in ''Imagination'', ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'', and other science fiction magazines. The 1950s saw the publication of Sheckley's first four books: short story collections ''Untouched by Human Hands'' ([[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]], 1954), ''Citizen in Space'' (1955), and ''Pilgrimage to Earth'' ([[Bantam Books|Bantam]], 1957), and a novel, ''[[Immortality, Inc.]]'' (first published as a serial in ''Galaxy'', 1958).

Sheckley and Scadron divorced in 1956. The writer married journalist Ziva  Kwitney in 1957. The newly married couple lived in Greenwich Village. Their daughter, [[Alisa Kwitney]], born in 1964, would herself become a successful writer.  Applauded by critic [[Kingsley Amis]], Sheckley was now  selling many of his deft, satiric stories to mainstream magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]''. In addition to his science fiction stories, in the 1960s Sheckley started writing suspense fiction. More short story collections and novels appeared in the 1960s, and a film adaptation of an early story by Sheckley, ''[[The 10th Victim]]'', was released in 1965.

Sheckley spent much of 1970s living on [[Ibiza]]. He and Kwitney divorced in 1972 and the same year Sheckley married Abby Schulman, whom he had met in Ibiza. The couple had two children, Anya and Jed. The couple separated while living in London. In 1980, the writer returned to the United States and became fiction editor of the newly established ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'' magazine.<ref name=obit2>Priest, Christopher. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/20/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1 Obituary: Robert Sheckley.]</ref> Sheckley  left ''OMNI'' in 1981 with his fourth wife, writer Jay Rothbell: they subsequently traveled widely in Europe, finally ending up in Portland, Oregon, where they separated.  He married Gail Dana of Portland in 1990. Sheckley continued publishing further science fiction and espionage or mystery stories, and collaborated with other writers such as [[Roger Zelazny]] and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]].

During an April 2005 visit to [[Ukraine]] for the Ukrainian Sci-Fi Computer Week, an international event for science fiction writers, Sheckley fell ill and had to be hospitalized in [[Kyiv]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/05/05/sheckleyhospital.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060324014702/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/05/05/sheckleyhospital.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Sci-Fi Writer Robert Sheckley on Artificial Respiration in Ukrainian …|date=March 24, 2006|archive-date=March 24, 2006|website=mosnews.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref> His condition was very serious for a week, but he appeared to be slowly recovering. Sheckley's official website ran a fundraising campaign to help cover his treatment and his return to the United States. He settled in Red Hook, in northern Dutchess County, New York, to be near his daughters Anya and Alisa. On November 20 he had surgery for a [[Cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]]; he died in a [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] hospital on December 9, 2005.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Works==

Sheckley was a prolific and versatile writer. His works include not only original short stories and novels, but also TV series episodes (''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]''), novelizations of works by others (''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms]]'', after the film<ref>{{cite web|title=A Call to Arms (Babylon 5)|url=https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/babylon-5-a-call-to-arms_robert-sheckley/1091376/#isbn=0345431553&idiq=806454|publisher=thriftbooks.com|access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Call to Arms (Babylon 5) by Robert Sheckley|url=https://www.risingshadow.net/library/book/14085-a-call-to-arms|publisher=risingshadow.net|access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref>), stories in [[shared universe]]s such as ''[[Heroes in Hell]]'', and collaborations with other writers. He was best known for his several hundred short stories,<ref name=obit /> which he published in book form as well as individually. Typical Sheckley stories include "Bad Medicine" (in which a man is mistakenly treated by a psychotherapy machine intended for Martians), "Protection" (whose protagonist is warned of deadly danger unless he avoids the common activity of "lesnerizing", a word whose meaning is not explained), and "The Accountant" (in which a family of wizards learns that their son has been taken from them by a more sinister trade&mdash;accountancy). In many stories Sheckley speculates about alternative (and usually sinister) social orders, of which a good example is the story "A Ticket to Tranai" (which tells of a sort of [[Utopia]] designed for human nature as it actually is, which turns out to have terrible drawbacks).

Sheckley's early stories include the far future AAA Ace detective agency series. In these tales, the two partners face unusual problems often related to human incompetence or laziness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.darkroastedblend.com/2005/10/robert-sheckley.html|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Reading Experience: Robert Sheckley|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Sheckley wrote a series of three mystery novels featuring detective Hob Draconian, as well as novels set in the worlds of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. Before his death Sheckley had been commissioned to write an original novel based on the TV series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' for [[Powys Media]], but died before completing the manuscript.

His novel ''[[Dimension of Miracles]]'' is often cited as an influence on [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', although in an interview for [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'', Adams said he had not read it until after writing the Guide.<ref>{{YouTube|7LmfCGy_ZLg|Video Interview with Neil Gaiman at Google campus}}.  Gaiman testifies to Adams' claim in a question about Sheckley, beginning 31:58.  Retrieved April 15, 2009</ref>

==Film, TV and radio adaptations==
[[File:Robert Sheckley 5405.jpg|thumb|Robert Sheckley c. 1954]]
One of Sheckley's early works, the 1953 ''[[Galaxy science fiction|Galaxy]]'' short story "[[Seventh Victim]]", was the basis for the film ''[[The 10th Victim]]'', also known by the original Italian title ''La decima vittima''.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/20/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1|title= Robert Sheckley|first= Christopher|last= Priest|date= December 20, 2005|access-date= November 1, 2016|via= The Guardian}}</ref> The film starred [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Ursula Andress]]. A novelization of the film, also written by Sheckley, was published in 1966. <!-- The story may also have been the inspiration for the role-playing game [[Assassin (game)|''Assassin'']]. The Japanese novel and film ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'' and the series of best-selling novels ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' also have the same premise as Sheckley's story. COMMENTED OUT, BECAUSE NO SOURCE WAS CITED TO SHOW THAT THESE WERE BASED ON SHECKLEY RATHER THAN HAVING BEEN DEVISED INDEPENDENTLY-->  The satirical premise <!-- invented by Sheckley COMMENTED OUT FOR SAME REASON--> is that in the future killings are legal and televised, and that potential victims or hunters can get corporate sponsors and extra perks to assist them in succeeding as a professional, corporate-sponsored, celebrity killer.

Sheckley's novel ''[[Immortality, Inc.]]''&mdash;about a world in which the afterlife could be obtained via a scientific process&mdash;was very loosely adapted into a film, the 1992 ''[[Freejack]]'', starring [[Mick Jagger]], [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. It was also adapted into the first episode of the third season of the British BBC series ''[[Out of the Unknown]]''. This episode is lost due to the then common practice of wiping the shows after broadcast.

The 1954 story "Ghost V" and the 1955 story "The Lifeboat Mutiny" were adapted into two episodes of the [[USSR]] science fiction TV series ''[[This Fantastic World]]''.<ref>[http://www.gtrf.ru/ State Fund of Television and Radio Programs] {{in lang|ru}}</ref> "Ghost V" was staged also by Estonian TV channel [[Eesti Televisioon|ETV]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arhiiv.err.ee/show-category-single-files/lavastuslik/31/default/4|title=Üksikud saated – ERR – Digihoidla|last=ERR|website=arhiiv.err.ee|access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref>

The 1958 short story "The Prize of Peril" was adapted in 1970 as the German TV movie ''[[Das Millionenspiel]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066079/|title=Das Millionenspiel|date=October 18, 1970|access-date=November 1, 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> and again in 1983 as the French movie ''[[Le Prix du Danger]]''. Written about a man who goes on a TV show in which he must evade people out to kill him for a week in order to win a large cash prize, it is perhaps the first-ever published work predicting the advent of reality television. There are many similarities between Sheckley's story and Stephen King's novel ''[[The Running Man (King novel)|The Running Man]]'', published later in 1982, of which a film adaptation was later made.

"[[The Game of X]]" (1965) was loosely adapted as the 1981 Disney film, ''[[Condorman]]''.<ref name=NYTimes>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/31/movies/condorman-espionage-spoof.html 'CONDORMAN', ESPIONAGE SPOOF], in ''[[the New York Times]]'', published August 31, 1981; retrieved March 21, 2018</ref>

The short story "[[Watchbird]]" was adapted for the short-lived TV series ''[[Masters of Science Fiction]]''. It did not initially air in the US, but on February 12, 2012, the [[Science Channel]] began airing the episodes, under the title ''Stephen Hawking's Sci-Fi Masters'', beginning with the first domestic airing of the episode "Watchbird".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/hawkings-sci-fi-masters/|title=Stephen Hawking's Sci Fi Masters|work=[[Science Channel]]}}</ref> It was included on the DVD set for the series.

The 1958 short story "The Store of the Worlds" from the collection ''[[Store of Infinity]]'' was adapted to a short film titled ''The Escape'' by the filmmaker [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]], starring [[Julian Sands]], [[Art Malik]], [[Olivia Williams]] and [[Ben Miller]].  The film had its premiere at the 2017 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York.

A number of Sheckley's works, both as Sheckley and as Finn O'Donnevan, were also adapted for the radio show ''[[X Minus One]]'' in the late 1950s, including the above-mentioned "Seventh Victim", "Bad Medicine", and "Protection". The radio show ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' also in the late 1950s did a version of "Watchbird" and [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|South Africa radio]] did their version of "Watchbird" on the series ''SF68''.

In 2007, Chris Larner and David Gilbert created the radio show "The Laxian Key" based on Sheckley's short stories. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00c8r32</ref>
