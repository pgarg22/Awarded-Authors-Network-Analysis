'''Leszek Józef Serafinowicz''' (pen name: '''Jan Lechoń'''; 13 March 1899 in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]] – 8 June 1956 in [[New York City]]) was a Polish [[poet]], literary and theater critic, diplomat, and co-founder of the [[Skamander]] literary movement and the [[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America]].

Lechoń studied the Polish language and literature at the [[University of Warsaw]], by which point he had already authored two collections of poetry and a play. He was co-editor of ''Pro arte et studio'' magazine. Lechoń created the name ''Skamander'' for that literary group and delivered the opening speech at the group's first meeting on 6 December 1919. During the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–21), he worked in the press office of [[Head of state|Chief of State]] [[Józef Piłsudski]].

Lechoń was a member of the ''[[Picador|Pikador]]'' literary cabaret, a member of the Polish Writers' Union, and secretary-general of the [[PEN International|PEN Club]]. In 1926–29 he edited the satirical magazine ''Cyrulik Warszawski'' ('The Barber of Warsaw'—named in reference to ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''). In 1925 he received an award from the Polish Book Publishers' Association, and in 1935 an award from the [[Polish Academy of Literature]].<ref name="portalwiedzy">{{cite web | url=http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/29184,,,,polska_akademia_literatury,haslo.html | title=Polska Akademia Literatury | publisher=Encyklopedia [[Onet.pl]], Grupa Onet.pl SA | year=2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Lerski-451">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTUTqE2difgC&q=%22Polish+Academy+of+Literature%22&pg=PA451 | title=''Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945'' | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=1996 | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | author=[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], Piotr Wróbel, Richard J.

In 1921 he attempted suicide and spent some time in hospitals or sanatoriums trying to overcome [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. A troubled homosexual affair influenced Lechoń's decision to abandon Warsaw.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Robert |last1=Aldrich|first2= Garry |last2=Wotherspoon |title= Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|page= 307|url= http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biol1/lechon01.html}}</ref> From 1930 to 1939 he was a [[cultural attaché]] at the Polish embassy in [[Paris]]. After the [[Battle of France|fall of France to Nazi Germany]], he left for [[Brazil]] and later settled in [[New York City]]. There he co-edited many Polish newspapers and magazines; in 1942 he co-founded the [[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America]].

On the suggestion of a psychiatrist, Lechoń started writing a diary (1949–56). Amid recondite autobiographical reminiscences, the diary also documents  Lechoń's attempts to come to terms with his homosexuality. "Oppressed by a sense of émigré obsolescence and poetic sterility, unable to resolve the conflict between his programmatically traditionalist Polish public persona and the anxieties of an aging, impecunious homosexual in an America beset by [[McCarthyism]] ...",<ref>Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon - Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II, 261</ref> Lechoń committed suicide on 8 June 1956 by jumping from the twelfth floor of the [[Hudson Hotel]]. At the time, his motive for doing so was given as depression deepened by "social degradation". The memoirs of [[Adam Ciołkosz]] point also to depression caused by the strengthening of the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|communist regime in Poland]].

In 1991 Lechoń's remains were [[exhumation|exhumed]] from [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[Queens]] and transferred to a cemetery in [[Laski, Warsaw West County|Laski]], to a family tomb shared with his parents, Władysław and Maria Serafinowicz.

Lechoń made his literary debut at the age of 14 with poetry collections entitled ''Na złotym polu'' ('In a Golden Field', 1913) and ''Po różnych ścieżkach'' ('On Different Paths', 1914). In 1916, his drama ''W pałacu Stanisława Augusta'' ('At the Palace of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław August]]') premiered at the Old Orangery in Warsaw. His poetry collection ''Srebrne i czarne'' ('Silver and Black') earned him an award from the Polish Book Publishers' Association. However, growing interest in Lechoń's work and his successes in the field of poetry had a negative influence on him. He found his status and fame overwhelming and did not publish further until the outbreak of [[World War II]].

[[Poland]]'s wartime demise awakened in him the passion to continue writing. He published ''Lutnia po Bekwarku'' in 1942 and ''Aria z kurantem'' in 1945, as well as ''Marmur i róża''. His other works include ''Karmazynowy poemat'' and ''Iliada''.

Lechoń's poetry, which combined [[romanticism|romantic]] and [[classicism|classicist]] elements, was different from that of other members of the Skamander group. He also translated several dramas, wrote reviews and essays.

==From Lechoń's ''Diaries''==
"Mankind prospers in one of the falsest illusions, that the world is run by wise people.  This would be impossible, if only because most of mankind are mediocrities, if not outright stupid people.  If we speak with a physician, say about a writer, the physician is convinced that the writer is a good writer.  We writers know that maybe 10 percent of writers are good, the rest being mediocrities and idiots.  Likewise the writer supposes that a physician with whom he is unfamiliar is an accomplished expert in his line of work—whereas he is usually a mediocrity.  It is amazing that, in spite of this, the world looks as it does."<ref>''"Ludzkość prosperuje w jednym z najfałszywszych złudzeń, że świat prowadzą ludzie mądrzy.  Byłoby to niemożliwe choćby dlatego, że większość tej ludzkości to przeciętność—jeśli już nie ludzie głupi.  Skoro mówimy z lekarzem np. o jakimś pisarzu—jest on przekonany, że ten pisarz jest dobrym pisarzem.  My pisarze wiemy, że dobrych pisarzy jest może 10 procent, reszta to miernoty i idioci.  Tak samo pisarz przypuszcza, że nie znany mu bliżej lekarz jest wziętym fachowcem—gdy najczęściej jest on miernotą.  Jest tu zdumiewające, że mimo tego świat wygląda, jak wygląda."''  Jan Lechoń, ''Dzienniki'' (Diaries), volume II, quoted in Katarzyna Wójcik, ''"120. rocznica urodzin Jana Lechonia"'' ("120th Anniversary of Jan Lechoń's Birth", pp. 1, 10 of the issue), ''[[Gwiazda Polarna]]'', vol. 110, no. 9 (27 April 2019), p. 10.</ref>
