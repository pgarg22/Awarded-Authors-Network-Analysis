Born in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], Stoppard left as a child [[refugee]], fleeing [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|imminent Nazi occupation]]. He settled with his family in Britain after the war, in 1946, having spent the three years prior (1943–1946) in a boarding school in [[Darjeeling]] in the Indian [[Himalayas]]. After being educated at schools in [[Nottingham]] and [[Yorkshire]], Stoppard became a [[journalist]], a [[drama critic]] and then, in 1960, a playwright.

It was announced in June 2019 that he had written a new play, ''[[Leopoldstadt (play)|Leopoldstadt]]'', set in the [[Jewish]] community of early 20th-century [[Vienna]]. The play premiered in January 2020 at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] with [[Patrick Marber]] directing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/26/jewish-district-inspires-tom-stoppard-personal-new-play-leopoldstadt|title=Jewish district inspires Tom Stoppard in 'personal' new play|author= Brown, Mark|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 June 2019|access-date=18 September 2021}}</ref> In October 2020, it won the Olivier Award for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play|Best New Play]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wolf|first=Matt|date=2020-10-26|title=2020 Olivier Awards: Better late than never as Dear Evan Hansen and Tom Stoppard win top awards|url=https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/theatre-news/west-end-features/2020-olivier-awards-better-late-than-never|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-02|website=London Theatre Guide|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Tom Stoppard's Olivier-Winning Leopoldstadt Sets Dates for West End Return|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/200675/tom-stoppards-olivier-winning-leopoldstadt-sets-dates-for-west-end-return/|access-date=2021-10-02|website=Broadway.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Life and career==

Just before the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the town's patron, [[Jan Antonín Baťa]], transferred his Jewish employees, mostly physicians, to branches of his firm outside Europe.<ref>[http://www.cet.ac.il/terezin/dk9e6.htm+tom+stoppard+mother+beck&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&client=safari Theresienstadt memorial archive ''Tom Stoppard Discloses his Past'']</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/22/books.featuresreviews "And now the real thing"] ''The Guardian'', 22 June 2002. Retrieved 10 October 2010</ref> On 15 March 1939, the day the [[Nazism|Nazis]] invaded Czechoslovakia, the Sträussler<ref name="Kois"/> family fled to Singapore, where Baťa had a factory.

Before the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]], Stoppard, his brother, and their mother fled to India. Stoppard's father remained in Singapore as a British army volunteer, knowing that, as a doctor, he would be needed in its defence.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> Stoppard was four years old when his father died.<ref>Bloom, p.13</ref> In the book ''Tom Stoppard in Conversation'', Stoppard tells how his father died in Japanese captivity, a [[Prisoner of war#Empire of Japan|prisoner of war]]<ref name="Tom Stoppard 1994 p91"/><ref Name="BBC">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/johntusainterview/ram/ajtstoppard.ram BBC] [[John Tusa]] Interview (Audio 43 mins).

In 1941, when Tomáš was five, the three were evacuated to [[Darjeeling]], India. The boys attended [[Mount Hermon School, Darjeeling|Mount Hermon School]], an American multi-racial school,<ref name="Tom Stoppard 1994 p91">Tom Stoppard, Paul Delaney (1994). ''Tom Stoppard in Conversation'',  p. 91, University of Michigan Press</ref> where Tomáš became Tom and his brother Petr became Peter.

In 1945, his mother, Martha, married British army major Kenneth Stoppard, who gave the boys his English surname and, in 1946, moved the family to England.<ref name=sal/> Stoppard's stepfather believed strongly that "to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life"—a quote from [[Cecil Rhodes]]—telling his  9-year-old stepson: "Don't you realise that I made you British?"<ref Name="Write"/> setting up Stoppard's desire as a child to become "an honorary Englishman". "I fairly often find I'm with people who forget I don't quite belong in the world we're in", he says. "I find I put a foot wrong—it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history—and suddenly I'm there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket." This is reflected in his characters, he notes, who are "constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails to do with the confusion of having two names".<ref Name="Write"/> Stoppard attended the Dolphin School in Nottinghamshire, and later completed his education at [[Pocklington School]] in [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]], Yorkshire, which he hated.<ref Name="BBC"/>

Stoppard left school at seventeen and began work as a journalist for the ''[[Western Daily Press]]'' in Bristol, never receiving a university education.<ref Name="BBC"/> Years later, he came to regret not going to university, but at the time he loved his work as a journalist and felt passionately about his career.<ref Name="BBC"/> He worked at the paper from 1954 until 1958, when the ''[[Bristol Post|Bristol Evening World]]'' offered Stoppard the position of feature writer, humour columnist, and secondary drama critic, which took Stoppard into the world of theatre. At the [[Bristol Old Vic]], at the time a well-regarded regional [[Repertory theatre|repertory company]], Stoppard formed friendships with director [[John Boorman]] and actor [[Peter O'Toole]] early in their careers. In Bristol, he became known more for his strained attempts at humour and unstylish clothes than for his writing.<ref name=sal/>

===Career===
Stoppard wrote short radio plays in 1953–54 and by 1960 he had completed his first stage play, ''A Walk on the Water'', which was later re-titled ''Enter a Free Man'' (1968).<ref Name="BBC"/>
He noted that the work owed much to [[Robert Bolt]]'s ''Flowering Cherry'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. Within a week after sending ''A Walk on the Water'' to an agent, Stoppard received his version of the "Hollywood-style telegrams that change struggling young artists' lives." His first play was optioned, staged in [[Hamburg]], then broadcast on British Independent Television in 1963.<ref name=sal/> From September 1962 until April 1963, Stoppard worked in London as a drama critic for ''Scene'' magazine, writing reviews and interviews both under his name and the pseudonym [[William Boot]] (taken from [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''Scoop''). In 1964, a [[Ford Foundation]] grant enabled Stoppard to spend 5 months writing in a Berlin mansion, emerging with a one-act play titled ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Meet King Lear'', which later evolved into his Tony-winning play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.<ref name=sal/>

In the following years, Stoppard produced several works for radio, television and the theatre, including ''"M" is for Moon Among Other Things'' (1964), ''A Separate Peace'' (1966) and ''If You're Glad I'll Be Frank'' (1966). On 11 April 1967&nbsp;– following acclaim at the 1966 [[Edinburgh Festival]]&nbsp;– the opening of ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' in a [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] production at the [[Old Vic]] made Stoppard an overnight success. ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]'' (1972) places a professor of moral philosophy in a murder mystery thriller alongside a slew of radical gymnasts. ''[[Travesties]]'' (1974) explored the '[[Oscar Wilde|Wildean]]' possibilities arising from the fact that [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Tristan Tzara]] had all been in [[Zürich]] during the First World War.<ref Name="OCTP"/>

''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'' (1993) explores the interaction between two modern academics and the residents of a [[Derbyshire]] country house in the early 19th century, including aristocrats, tutors and the fleeting presence, unseen on stage, of [[Lord Byron]]. The themes of the play include the philosophical implications of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], [[Romantic literature in English|Romantic literature]], and the [[English landscape garden|English picturesque style of garden design]].<ref name =act>{{cite web| url = https://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/education_department/words_on_plays/Arcadia%20Words%20on%20Plays%20(2013).pdf | title = Words on Plays: Arcadia| author = Perloff, Carey| date = 2013| access-date = October 11, 2020 | website = act.sf }}</ref>

''[[The Coast of Utopia]]'' (2002) was a trilogy of plays Stoppard wrote about the philosophical arguments among Russian revolutionary figures in the late 19th century. The trilogy comprises ''Voyage'', ''Shipwreck'', and ''Salvage''. Major figures in the play include [[Michael Bakunin]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Alexander Herzen]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Coast of Utopia: Voyage | url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/The%20Coast%20of%20Utopia%3A%20Voyage+1334.twl | publisher=Royal National Theatre | date=2008 | access-date=12 October 2020 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518091558/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/The%20Coast%20of%20Utopia:%20Voyage+1334.twl | archive-date=18 May 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

''[[Rock 'n' Roll (play)|Rock'n'Roll]]'' (2006) was set in both [[Cambridge]], England and [[Prague]]. The play explored the culture of 1960s rock music, especially the persona of [[Syd Barrett]] and the political challenge of the Czech band [[The Plastic People of the Universe]], mirroring the contrast between liberal society in England and the repressive Czech state [[History of Czechoslovakia#Aftermath|after the Warsaw Pact intervention]] in the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name =rnr>{{cite web| url = https://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/Words%20on%20Plays/PDFs/Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20Words%20on%20Plays%20(2008).pdf | title = Words on Plays: Rock'n'Roll| author = Broderson, Elizabeth| date = 2008| access-date = October 11, 2020 | website = act.sf }}</ref>

In his early years, Stoppard wrote extensively for [[BBC]] radio, often introducing surrealist themes. He has also adapted many of his stage works for radio, film and television winning extensive awards and honours from the start of his career. His radio production, ''[[Darkside (radio play)|Darkside]]'' (2013), was written for BBC Radio 2 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of [[Pink Floyd]]'s album, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.<ref Name="DarkSide"/>

Stoppard has written one novel, ''Lord Malquist and Mr Moon'' (1966), set in contemporary London. Its cast includes the 18th-century figure of the dandified Malquist and his ineffectual [[James Boswell|Boswell]], Moon, and also cowboys, a lion (banned from [[The Ritz London Hotel|the Ritz]]) and a donkey-borne Irishman claiming to be the Risen Christ.

In the 1980s, in addition to writing his own works, Stoppard translated many plays into English, including works by [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[Johann Nestroy]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]], and [[Václav Havel]]. It was at this time that Stoppard became influenced by the works of Polish and Czech absurdists. He has been co-opted into the [[Outrapo]] group, a far-from-serious French movement to improve actors' stage technique through science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outrapo.voila.net/page4/index.html|title=L'acteur cérébral|last=von Bariter|first=Milie |work=Contrainte du moment|publisher=Outrapo|access-date=6 September 2008}}</ref>

Stoppard has also co-written screenplays including ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. [[Steven Spielberg]] states that though Stoppard was uncredited for the latter, "he was responsible for almost every line of dialogue in the film".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/indy/day17/ |title=Empire: Features |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> Stoppard also worked on ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', though again Stoppard received no official or formal credit in this role.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/tom-stoppard-interview-ive-always-been-strangely-eclectic TimeOut New York interview]</ref><ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith-20050519 ''Rolling Stone'' magazine article].

In July 2017, Stoppard was elected an [[Fellow of the British Academy|Honorary Fellow]] of the [[British Academy]] (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/elections-british-academy-celebrate-diversity-uk-research|title=Elections to the British Academy celebrate the diversity of UK research|date=21 Jul 2017}}</ref>

Stoppard was appointed Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre, [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]], for the academic year 2017–2018.

==Themes==
''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' (1966–67) was Stoppard's first major play to gain recognition. The story of ''[[Hamlet]]'' as told from the viewpoint of two courtiers echoes [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]] in its double act repartee, existential themes and language play.<ref Name="OCTP">"Stoppard, Tom"  ''The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance''. Edited by Dennis Kennedy. Oxford University Press Inc.</ref> "Stoppardian" became a term describing works using wit and comedy while addressing philosophical concepts.<ref Name="OCTP"/> Critic Dennis Kennedy notes "It established several characteristics of Stoppard's dramaturgy: his word-playing intellectuality, audacious, paradoxical, and self-conscious theatricality, and preference for reworking pre-existing narratives... Stoppard's plays have been sometimes dismissed as pieces of clever showmanship, lacking in substance, social commitment, or emotional weight. His theatrical surfaces serve to conceal rather than reveal their author's views, and his fondness for towers of paradox spirals away from social comment. This is seen most clearly in his comedies ''[[The Real Inspector Hound]]'' (1968) and ''[[After Magritte]]'' (1970), which create their humour through highly formal devices of reframing and juxtaposition."<ref Name="OCTP"/>  Stoppard himself went so far as to declare  "I must stop compromising my plays with this whiff of social application. They must be entirely untouched by any suspicion of usefulness."<ref name=sal/> He acknowledges that he started off "as a language nerd", primarily enjoying linguistic and ideological playfulness, feeling early in his career that journalism was far better suited for presaging political change, than playwriting.<ref Name="BBC"/>

The accusations of favouring intellectuality over political commitment or commentary were met with a change of tack, as Stoppard produced increasingly socially engaged work.<ref Name="OCTP"/> From 1977, he became personally involved with human-rights issues, in particular with the situation of political dissidents in Central and Eastern Europe. In February 1977, he visited the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries with a member of [[Amnesty International]].<ref name=sal/> In June, Stoppard met [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] in London and travelled to Czechoslovakia (then under communist control), where he met dissident playwright and future president [[Václav Havel]], whose writing he greatly admires.<ref name=sal/><ref Name="BBC"/> Stoppard became involved with ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', Amnesty International, and the [[Committee Against Psychiatric Abuse]] and wrote various newspaper articles and letters about human rights. He was instrumental in translating Havel's works into English. ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (play)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' (1977), "a play for actors and orchestra" was based on a request by conductor/composer [[André Previn]] and was inspired by a meeting with a Russian exile. This play as well as ''[[Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth]]'' (1979), ''The Coast of Utopia'' (2002),  ''Rock 'n' Roll'' (2006), and two works for television ''Professional Foul'' (1977) and ''Squaring the Circle'' (1984) all concern themes of censorship, rights abuses, and state repression.<ref Name="OCTP"/>

Stoppard's later works have sought greater inter-personal depths, whilst maintaining their intellectual playfulness. Stoppard acknowledges that around 1982 he moved away from the "argumentative" works and more towards plays of the heart, as he became "less shy" about emotional openness. Discussing the later integration of heart and mind in his work, he commented "I think I was too concerned when I set off, to have a firework go off every few seconds... I think I was always looking for the entertainer in myself and I seem to be able to entertain through manipulating language... [but] it's really about human beings, it's not really about language at all." ''The Real Thing'' (1982) uses a [[Metatheatre|meta-theatrical]] structure to explore the suffering that adultery can produce and ''The Invention of Love'' (1997) also investigates the pain of passion. ''Arcadia'' (1993) explores the meeting of [[chaos theory]], historiography, and landscape gardening.<ref Name="OCTP"/> He was inspired by a [[Trevor Nunn]] production of [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]]'s ''[[Summerfolk]]'' to write a trilogy of "human" plays: ''The Coast of Utopia'' (''Voyage'', ''Shipwreck'', and ''Salvage'', 2002).<ref Name="BBC"/>

Stoppard has commented that he loves the medium of theatre for how 'adjustable' it is at every point, how unfrozen it is, continuously growing and developing through each rehearsal, free from the text. His experience of writing for film is similar, offering the liberating opportunity to 'play God', in control of creative reality. It often takes four to five years from the first idea of a play to staging, taking pains to be as profoundly accurate in his research as he can be.<ref Name="BBC"/>

Stoppard's mother died in 1996.

In 1998, following the deaths of his parents, he returned to Zlín for the first time in over 50 years.<ref Name="BBC"/> He has expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, but he has no sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove.

==Political views==
