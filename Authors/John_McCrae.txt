He is best known for writing the famous war memorial poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]". McCrae died of [[pneumonia]] near the end of the war.

==Biography==
McCrae was born in [[McCrae House]] in [[Guelph]], Ontario to Lieutenant-Colonel David McCrae and Janet Simpson Eckford; he was the grandson of Scottish immigrants from [[Balmaghie]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]]. His brother, Dr. [[Thomas McCrae (physician)|Thomas McCrae]], became professor of medicine at [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins Medical School]] in [[Baltimore]] and close associate of Sir [[William Osler]]. His sister Geills married James Kilgour, a justice of the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba|Court of King's Bench]], and moved to Winnipeg.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Dianne|title= A Crown of Life: The World of John McCrae|publisher=Spellmount|date=1997|isbn=1873376863|oclc=39342779|pages= 3–8}}</ref>

McCrae attended the Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute but took a year off his studies due to recurring problems with asthma.

Among his papers in the John McCrae House in Guelph is a letter he wrote on July 18, 1893, to [[Laura Kains]] while he trained as an artilleryman at Tête-de-Pont barracks, today's Fort Frontenac, in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. "I have a manservant ... Quite a nobby place it is, in fact ... My windows look right out across the bay, and are just near the water's edge; there is a good deal of shipping at present in the port; and the river looks very pretty."

He was a resident master in English and Mathematics in 1894 at the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] in Guelph.<ref name="peddie">Peddie</ref>

McCrae returned to the [[University of Toronto]] and completed his B.A., then returned again to study medicine on a scholarship.

At medical school, McCrae had tutored other students to help pay his tuition. Two of his students were among the first female doctors in Ontario.<ref name="VAC">{{Cite web

McCrae graduated in 1898. He was first a resident house-officer at Toronto General Hospital, then in 1899 at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore, Maryland.<ref>''A Cyclopedia of American Medical Biography'', p. 733. Howard Atwood Kelley. 1920.</ref> In 1900 McCrae served in South Africa as a lieutenant in the [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery|Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA)]] during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899 to 1902), and upon his return was appointed professor of pathology at the [[University of Vermont]], where he taught until 1911; he also taught at [[McGill University]] in Montreal, [[Quebec]].

In 1902, he was appointed resident [[pathologist]] at [[Montreal General Hospital]] and later became assistant pathologist to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal)|Royal Victoria Hospital]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec. In 1904, he was appointed an associate in medicine at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. Later that year, he went to England where he studied for several months and became a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

In 1905, McCrae set up his own practice although he continued to work and lecture at several hospitals. The same year, he was appointed pathologist to the [[Montreal Foundling and Baby Hospital]]. In 1908, he was appointed physician to the [[Alexandra Hospital for Contagious Diseases]]. In 1910, he accompanied [[Albert Henry George Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], on a [[canoe]] trip to [[Hudson Bay]] to serve as expedition physician.

McCrae was the co-author, with J.G. Adami, of a medical textbook, ''A Text-Book of Pathology for College Students of Medicine'' (1912; 2nd ed., 1914).

==World War I==

When Britain declared war on Germany because of the latter's invasion of neutral Belgium at the beginning of [[World War I]] (1914), Canada, as a [[Dominion]] within the British Empire, was at war as well. McCrae was appointed as Medical Officer and Major of the 1st Brigade CFA (Canadian Field Artillery).<ref>{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Dianne|title= A Crown of Life: The World of John McCrae|publisher=Spellmount|date=1997|isbn=1873376863|oclc=39342779|pages= 154–171}}.</ref> He treated the wounded during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in 1915, from a hastily dug {{convert|8|x|8|ft|m|adj=on}} bunker in the back of the dyke along the Yser Canal about 2 miles north of Ypres.<ref name="ReferenceA">Bonfire – The Chestnut Gentleman by Susan Raby-Dunne, 2012</ref> McCrae's friend and former militia member, Lt.

From June 1, 1915, McCrae was ordered away from the artillery to set up No. 3 Canadian General Hospital at [[Dannes-Camiers]] near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], northern France. For eight months the hospital operated in [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] tents (donated by the [[Kaikhusrau Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Begum of Bhopal]] and shipped from [[British Raj|India]]), but after suffering from storms, floods, and frosts it was moved in February 1916 into the old Jesuit College in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. C.L.C. Allinson reported that McCrae "most unmilitarily told [me] what he thought of being transferred to the medicals and being pulled away from his beloved guns. His last words to me were: 'Allinson, all the goddamn doctors in the world will not win this bloody war: what we need is more and more fighting men.'"<ref>Prescott, p. 99</ref>

"In Flanders Fields" first appeared anonymously in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on December 8, 1915,<ref>{{cite magazine | last=McCrae | first=John | date= 8 December 1915 | title=In Flanders Fields | url= https://archive.org/details/punchvol148a149lemouoft/page/994/mode/1up | magazine=Punch, or the London Charivari | location=London | publisher=Punch Office | access-date =3 May 2021}}</ref> but in the index to that year, McCrae was named as the author (misspelt as McCree).<ref>{{cite magazine | date= 29 December 1915 | title=Index | url= https://archive.org/details/punchvol148a149lemouoft/page/n1159/mode/1up | magazine=Punch, or the London Charivari | location=London | publisher=Punch Office | access-date =3 May 2021}}</ref> The verses swiftly became one of the most popular poems of the war, used in countless fund-raising campaigns and frequently translated (a [[Latin]] version begins ''In agro belgico...''). "In Flanders Fields" was also extensively printed in the United States, whose government was contemplating joining the war, alongside a 'reply' by [[R. W. Lillard]], ("...Fear not that you have died for naught, / The torch ye threw to us we caught...").
[[Image: John McCrae grave.JPG|thumb|upright|McCrae's grave at [[Wimereux]] cemetery]]

McCrae, now "a household name, albeit a frequently misspelt one",<ref>Prescott, p. 106.</ref> regarded his sudden fame with some amusement, wishing that "they would get to printing 'In F.F.' correctly: it never is nowadays"; but (writes his biographer) "he was satisfied if the poem enabled men to see where their duty lay."<ref>Prescott, p. 107.</ref>

On January 28, 1918, while still commanding No. 3 Canadian General Hospital (McGill) at Boulogne, McCrae died of [[pneumonia]] with "extensive pneumococcus [[meningitis]]"<ref name ="Holt">Holt, pp. 54–62</ref> at the British General Hospital in [[Wimereux]], France. He was buried the following day in the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] section of Wimereux Cemetery,<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/84214/McCRAE,%20JOHN CWGC: John McCrae]</ref> just a couple of kilometres up the coast from Boulogne, with full military honours.<ref name="Composite1">Busch, p. 75; Holt, p. 62. Prescott, p. 129.</ref> His flag-draped coffin was borne on a [[Limbers and caissons|gun carriage]] and the mourners – who included [[Sir Arthur Currie]] and many of McCrae's friends and staff – were preceded by McCrae's charger, "Bonfire", with McCrae's boots reversed in the stirrups. Bonfire was with McCrae from [[Camp Valcartier|Valcartier, Quebec]] until his death and was much loved.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Composite1"/> McCrae's gravestone is placed flat, as are all the others in the section, because of the unstable sandy soil.<ref>Busch, p. 75.</ref>

[[File:Boezinge - Site John McCrae 3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|"In Flanders Fields" memorial on the [[Site John McCrae|John McCrae Memorial Site]], [[Boezinge]], [[Ypres]], [[West Flanders]], Belgium]]
A collection of his poetry, ''In Flanders Fields and Other Poems''<ref>{{gutenberg|no=353|name=''In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems''|bullet=none}}</ref> (1918), was published after his death.

<poem>
                 '''In Flanders Fields'''
    In Flanders Fields, the poppies blow<!-- the cited book says "blow"; DON'T change the text here to "grow" -->
          Between the crosses, row on row, 
       That mark our place; and in the sky
       The larks, still bravely singing, fly
    Scarce heard amid the guns below.

        We are the dead, short days ago 
      We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
       Loved and were loved, and now we lie
             In Flanders fields.

    Take up our quarrel with the foe:
    To you from failing hands we throw
       The torch; be yours to hold it high.
       If ye break faith with us who die
    We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
             In Flanders fields.
</poem>                             –John McCrae
[[File:I0016153.jpg|alt=A soldier looking down at a grave marked by a cross surrounded by poppies. |thumb|“If ye break faith – we shall not sleep” war poster created [ca. 1918] from the Archives of Ontario poster collection.]]


Though various legends have developed as to the inspiration for the poem, the most commonly held belief is that McCrae wrote "In Flanders Fields" on May 3, 1915, the day after presiding over the funeral and burial of his friend Lieutenant [[Alexis Helmer]], who had been killed during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. The poem was written as he sat upon the back of a medical field ambulance near an advance dressing post at Essex Farm, just north of Ypres. The [[Papaver rhoeas|poppy]], which was a central feature of the poem, grew in great numbers in the spoiled earth of the battlefields and cemeteries of Flanders. An article by Veteran's Administration Canada provides this account:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war-memorial/Detail/84214 |title=In memory of Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae |date=7 November 2019 |publisher=VAC |access-date=11 December 2019 }}</ref><blockquote>The day before he wrote his famous poem, one of McCrae's closest friends was killed in the fighting and buried in a makeshift grave with a simple wooden cross. Wild poppies were already beginning to bloom between the crosses marking the many graves.</blockquote> 

The Canadian government has placed a memorial to John McCrae that features "In Flanders Fields" at the site of the dressing station which sits beside the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]'s [[Essex Farm Cemetery]]. The Belgian government has named this site the "[[Site John McCrae|John McCrae Memorial Site]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-cemeteries-and-memorials/15800/essex-farm-cemetery |title=ESSEX FARM CEMETERY |date=7 November 2012 |publisher=CWGC |access-date=11 December 2019 }}</ref>

McCrae was designated a [[Person of National Historic Significance]] in 1946.<ref>{{DFHD|1206|McCrae, Lieutenant-Colonel John National Historic Person|April 24, 2012}}</ref>

McCrae was the great-uncle of former Alberta [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[David Kilgour]] and of Kilgour's sister [[Geills Turner]], who married former Canadian Prime Minister [[John Turner]]. Marie Christie Geills Kilgour (née McCrae) was the sister of John McCrae.

In May 2015, a statue of McCrae by Ruth Abernathy was erected on [[Green Island (Rideau River)]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]]. McCrae is dressed as an artillery officer and his medical bag nearby, as he writes. The statue shows the destruction of the battlefield and, at his feet, the poppies which are a symbol of Remembrance of World War I and all armed conflict since. A copy of that statue was erected at [[Guelph Civic Museum]] in Guelph in 2015.

The street next to the cemetery where he is buried is named in his honour, although the street is called "Rue Mac Crae".

[[Mount McCrae]] in British Columbia, is named for him.<ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last1 =Akrigg | first1 =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|167}}
