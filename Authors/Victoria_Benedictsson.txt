'''Victoria Benedictsson''' (March 6, 1850 in [[Trelleborg Municipality|Domme]] – July 21, 1888) was a Swedish author. She was born as '''Victoria Maria Bruzelius''' in Domme, a village in the province of [[Skåne]]. She wrote under the pen name '''Ernst Ahlgren'''. Notable works include ''Pengar'' (1885) and ''Fru Marianne'' (1887).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Benedictsson, Victoria (pseud.

== Life ==
Benedictsson grew up on a farm in Sweden. At 21 she married a 49-year-old widower from [[Hörby]]. After an illness left her bed-bound, Benedictsson turned to writing, publishing her first collection of stories, ''Från Skåne,'' in 1884.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Victoria Benedictsson {{!}} Swedish author|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victoria-Benedictsson|access-date=2020-11-09|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> 
She is, together with [[August Strindberg]], regarded as one of the greatest proponents of the [[Swedish realism|Swedish realist]] writing style. In her novels she described the inequality of marriage and often debated women's rights issues in her writings. Current critics see her as an early feminist; earlier the focus was on her love affair with [[Georg Brandes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skbl.se/en/article/VictoriaBenedictsson|title=skbl.se – Victoria Maria Benedictsson|website=skbl.se|access-date=September 13, 2019}}</ref>

She committed suicide in a room in Leopold's Hotel on Hovedvagtsgade – near [[Kongens Nytorv]] in Copenhagen.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/67Hufmmp1?url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/swedish/vb/biog.html A Brief Biography of Victoria Benedictsson]</ref>
