'''Jacqueline Cecilia Sturm''' (born '''Te Kare Papuni''', also known as '''Jacquie Baxter'''; 17 May 1927 – 30 December 2009) was a [[List of New Zealand poets|New Zealand poet]], short story writer and librarian.

Sturm was one of the first [[Māori people|Māori]] women to complete an undergraduate university degree, at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College]], followed by a [[Masters of Arts]] in Philosophy. She was also the first Māori writer to have her work published in an English anthology. Her short stories were published in several collections and student magazines in the 1950s and early 1960s, and in 1983 a women's publishing collective printed a collection of her short stories as ''The House of the Talking Cat''. She continued to write short stories and poetry well into the early 2000s, and is regarded today as a pioneer of [[New Zealand literature]].

==Early life==
Sturm was born on 17 May 1927 in [[Ōpunake]], [[Taranaki]], New Zealand. Her birth name was Te Kare Papuni. Her father, John Raymond Papuni, was part of the [[Whakatōhea]] [[iwi]] from [[Ōpōtiki]] in the [[Bay of Plenty]] region, and her mother, Mary Kingsley Harrison, was the daughter of Moewaka Tautokai, an adopted daughter of [[Taranaki (iwi)|Taranaki]] chief [[Wiremu Kingi Moki Te Matakatea]], and Te Whare Matangi Harrison, a nephew of the English novelist [[Charles Kingsley]].<ref name="DNZB">{{DNZB|last=Millar |first=Paul |id=6s1|title=Sturm, Jacqueline Cecilia |access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref>

Sturm's mother died of [[septicaemia]] shortly after her birth. Her father took her older sister Evadne back to the Bay of Plenty to be raised by his family, but Sturm's maternal grandmother Tautokai insisted on raising her in Taranaki.<ref name="DNZB" /> Tautokai became ill when Sturm was four and believed she was dying, so Sturm was fostered by a local nurse and her husband, Ethel and Bert Sturm, who renamed her Jacqueline Cecilia Sturm and formally adopted her in 1941.<ref name="DNZB" /> Ethel was [[Pākehā]], while Bert was [[Ngāti Kahungunu]] and [[Ngāti Porou]], and a greengrocer.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="ka mate">{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Paul |title=Jacquie Baxter / J.C.

Sturm began writing poetry at age 11, while recovering from what may have been [[rheumatic fever]] and living in [[Pukerua Bay]].<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="WCL" />{{rp|3}} She excelled at school both academically and in sport, becoming [[dux (education)|school dux]] and swimming champion of [[Napier Girls' High School]].<ref name="DNZB" /> In her late teens, she visited Māori communities in [[Urewera]] and the Bay of Plenty, where her father was from, and after this experience had ambitions of becoming a doctor.<ref name="ka mate" /> [[Manuhuia Bennett|Reverend Manuhuia Bennett]] (later the [[Bishop of Aotearoa]]) was impressed by her educational achievements and was instrumental in encouraging her parents to allow her to enrol at the [[University of Otago]].<ref name="WCL" />{{rp|5}}<ref name="Complete V4">{{cite book |last1=Baxter |first1=James K. |editor-last=Weir |editor-first=John |title=James K.

In late 1947 Sturm moved to [[The University of Canterbury|Canterbury University College]] in [[Christchurch]] to study [[anthropology]] under the well-known social psychologist [[I. L. G. Sutherland|Ivan Sutherland]].<ref name="ka mate" /> By this time she and Baxter were in a relationship and he moved to Christchurch with her.<ref name="DNZB" /> Sturm later recalled feeling disconcerted when he turned up in her lectures.<ref name="Between"/> He suffered from alcoholism during this time and his behaviour was often erratic.<ref name="DNZB Baxter">{{DNZB|last=Millar|first=Paul|id=5b14|title=Baxter, James Keir|access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> Baxter became the literary editor of the student magazine [[Canta (magazine)|''Canta'']], but did not publish any poems written by Sturm, and her first poems in the magazine were published by [[Bill Pearson (New Zealand writer)|Bill Pearson]] when he took over the role from Baxter in 1948.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="ka mate" /> 

When Sturm and Baxter began speaking of marriage in late 1948, both sets of parents tried to dissuade them, given that they were only 21 and 22 respectively.<ref name="Between"/><ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|36}} Despite this parental opposition, Sturm and Baxter married on 9 December 1948 at the [[Waiapu Cathedral of Saint John the Evangelist, Napier|Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Napier]], then moved to [[Wellington]].<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="DNZB Baxter" />

In 1949, Sturm graduated from Victoria University College with a Bachelor of Arts, becoming one of the first Māori women to complete an undergraduate university degree.<ref name="Victoria">{{cite news |title=Maori author to receive Honorary Doctorate |url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED0301/S00017.htm |access-date=5 November 2020 |work=Scoop Independent News |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington |date=28 January 2003}}</ref><ref name="OCNZL">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Millar |first1=Paul |last2=McLeod |first2=Aorewa |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Roger |editor2-last=Wattie |editor2-first=Nelson |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature |title=Sturm, J.C. |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001/acref-9780195583489-e-1182 |access-date=5 November 2020 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-3519-6 |oclc=865265749 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001}}</ref> That same year she gave birth to her and Baxter's daughter, Hilary.<ref name="DNZB" /> Hilary's [[godparent|godfather]] was the painter [[Colin McCahon]].<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|37}} In 1952, Sturm graduated from Victoria University College with a Masters of Arts in Philosophy, one of the first masters' degrees awarded to a Māori woman.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="Victoria" /> Her dissertation, "New Zealand National Character as Exemplified in Three New Zealand Novelists",<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Baxter |first=Jacqueline Cecilia |date=1952 |title=New Zealand national character as exemplified by three New Zealand novelists |type=MA |publisher=University of New Zealand |url=https://viewer.waireto.victoria.ac.nz/client/viewer/IE948735/rep/REP948746/FL948748?dps_dvs=1604662913797~626 |access-date=9 November 2020}}</ref> was commended as being of exceptional merit, and she was awarded [[first class honours]].<ref name="OCNZL" /> In that same year, Sturm and Baxter had a son, John.<ref name="DNZB" />

==1950s to 1970s==
Early in the 1950s, Sturm began to write short stories, partly to distinguish her own writing from her husband's poetry.<ref name="DNZB"/><ref name="Dom Post"/> For similar reasons, she wrote under the name J.C. Sturm rather than using her married name.<ref name="ka mate" />  Her first short story, "The Old Coat", was published in the journal ''Numbers'' in 1954.<ref name="DNZB" /> The following year, "For All the Saints" was published in the journal ''[[Te Ao Hou / The New World]]''.<ref name="DNZB" /> She featured regularly in both journals through the 1950s and 1960s,<ref name="DNZB" /> and in 1966 [[C. K. Stead]] selected "For All the Saints" for inclusion in his anthology of New Zealand short stories published by the [[Oxford University Press]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stead |first1=C.K. |title=New Zealand short stories : second series |date=1966 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/21826664 |access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref> She was the first Māori writer whose work was selected for a New Zealand anthology.<ref name="DNZB" /> The ''Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'' said of her work:<ref name="OCNZL" />

{{Blockquote |text=The stories are succinct and lucid and on first reading they appear to embrace the era's dominant ethos—that New Zealanders were one nation—by avoiding specific reference to Māori. However, read against the grain of thought that expected, in Sturm's words, all Māori "to become respectable middle-class citizens, a lighter shade of brown, as it were", it becomes clear that the society she depicts fosters inequality, and her work conveys a strong and poignant sense of alienation. Her female narrators, although rarely defined by their race, are marginalised figures that give a vivid sense of the constriction and restrictions of a young woman's life in Wellington in the 1950s.}}

In the 1950s and until 1968, Sturm was active in [[Ngāti Poneke]], a local cultural club for young Māori, and the [[Māori Women's Welfare League]].<ref name="DNZB" /> She was secretary of the Wellington Branch of the League, and acted as the League's representative on the Māori Education Foundation Board for many years.<ref name="Nana" /><ref>{{cite journal |title=Mrs J.K.

In late 1954, Baxter joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], successfully achieving sobriety, and in 1955, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Victoria University College.<ref name="DNZB Baxter" /> He received a substantial inheritance from a great-aunt in the same year, so he and Sturm were able to purchase a house in [[Ngaio, New Zealand|Ngaio]], Wellington.<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|45}} In 1957 Sturm and Baxter separated briefly after his conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]], in part because she was a committed [[Anglican]].<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="DNZB Baxter" /><ref name="Nana">{{cite news |last1=McDonald |first1=Jack |title=Baxter Week: My Nana, Jacquie Sturm |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/books/15-02-2019/baxter-week-my-nana-jacqui-sturm/ |access-date=5 November 2020 |work=The Spinoff |date=15 February 2019}}</ref> Baxter admitted in a letter to a friend that his conversion was "just one more event in a series of injuries, alcoholism, and gross mistakes".<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|51}} They reunited the following year in Delhi, India, after Baxter accepted a [[UNESCO]] fellowship.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="WCL" />{{rp|9}} After the family returned to New Zealand, Baxter worked for some years as a postman, and the family moved to [[Dunedin]] in 1966 so he could take up the [[Robert Burns Fellowship]].<ref name="Between"/>

In 1968, and following the family's return to Wellington, Sturm and Baxter began living apart once again, as Baxter had founded and moved to a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] at [[Jerusalem, New Zealand]] (also known by its Māori transliteration, Hiruhārama) on the [[Whanganui River]].<ref name="Between"/><ref name="DNZB Baxter" /> Baxter wrote in a letter to his friend [[John Weir (New Zealand writer)|John Weir]]: "I must become a Maori in my heart – as I am already a little by love of my Maori wife – to help both Maori and [[pakeha]]. My wife will not come at first, for she has not seen the seed with the eyes of her soul. When the tree has grown, she will come to shelter under it."<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|80}} Sturm did not join Baxter at Jerusalem, and around this time began raising her granddaughter Stephanie, who was born in 1968.<ref name="DNZB" /> In an interview in 2006, Sturm said of this time: "...{{nbsp}}because of factors beyond my control, my private life took a right angle turn and I became a solo mum. And I thought, right, it's time to do a bit of pruning with your life and trim off all the fancy bits. So I pulled out of all the Māori activities that I was involved in – which included Ngāti Poneke and the Māori Education Foundation and the Māori Women's Welfare League. And the other thing that I had to drop was any writing, because survival was the name of the game and I had to get out and get a job."<ref name="Potiki">{{cite journal |last1=Potiki |first1=Roma |title=Interview with J.

In 1969, Sturm began working at the [[Wellington Public Library]], where she continued working for 27 years.<ref name="DNZB" /> She was the librarian in charge of the New Zealand collection from 1969 to 1982.<ref name="Victoria" /> As one of the first Māori librarians, she was an advocate for other Māori librarians and spoke out against the (then) common practice of requiring Māori staff to be unofficial cultural advisers to their employers.<ref name="WCL" />{{rp|17}} After Baxter died in 1972, Sturm acted as his [[literary executor]]: collecting and cataloguing his prolific writing, arranging new and revised publications of his work, and negotiating the use and adaptation of his works.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="Victoria" /> She set up the James K. Baxter Charitable Trust, which supported causes he had supported, for example prison reform and drug addiction rehabilitation programmes, and ensured that all proceeds of his work went to the trust.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="WCL" />{{rp|9}}

==Return to writing==
In 1982, well-known New Zealand author [[Witi Ihimaera]] selected two of Sturm's stories for inclusion in his anthology of Māori writing, ''Into the World of Light'' (1982).<ref name="Dom Post" /> He had met her and come to know her through her work at the Wellington Public Library.<ref name="ka mate" /> In 1983, Sturm's collected short stories were published as ''The House of the Talking Cat'' by the women's publishing collective [[Spiral (publisher)|Spiral]].<ref name="DNZB" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sturm |first1=J.C. |title=House of the Talking Cat |date=1983 |publisher=Spiral |location=Wellington, New Zealand |url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/21736989 |access-date=5 November 2020 |isbn=978-0-3409-7593-0}}</ref> 

''The House of the Talking Cat'' was shortlisted in the [[New Zealand Book Awards]] and the stories were translated into German and Japanese.<ref name="DNZB" /> The stories had been written in the 1960s but Sturm had been unable to find a publisher for the collection.

A [[Tangihanga|tangi]] was held at Orimupiko marae and she is buried at [[Ōpunake]] alongside her mother and great-grandmother.<ref name="DNZB" /> In January 2010, a memorial service was held at Paekākāriki Memorial Hall, attended by nearly 200 people and with tributes from a number of well-known New Zealand artists including [[Glenn Colquhoun]], [[Patricia Grace]], [[Apirana Taylor]] and [[Hinemoana Baker]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tristam |first1=Alan |title=Huge Turnout for Jacquie Baxter: Memorial Service in Paekakariki |url=https://kapitiindependentnews.net.nz/january-2010/jacquie-baxter-honoured/ |access-date=7 November 2020 |work=Kāpiti and Coast Independent News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>

Sturm was a pioneer of New Zealand literature, and paved the way for later female Māori writers like [[Patricia Grace]] and [[Keri Hulme]].<ref name="DNZB" /> Witi Ihimaera described her as one of the three women he considered his elders when he began writing; they were "like spinners working on a loom" who began "spinning the tradition from which all contemporary Maori writers come".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ihimaera |first1=Witi |title=Spinner of Maori tradition |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/spinner-of-maori-tradition/PZWNWGTZDPQCBZ2GXP7BTHZRNQ/ |access-date=28 November 2021 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=11 August 2002}}</ref> Her entry in the ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]'' notes that, despite being overshadowed for much of her life by her first husband, she "emerged in later life as a unique and important voice in New Zealand literature in her own right".<ref name="DNZB" /> In an obituary, New Zealand poet and scholar [[Paul Millar (poet)|Paul Millar]] wrote: "Her output may seem modest on paper, but it becomes substantial when set against the obstacles placed before her as a woman, wife, and mother and, for many years, her family’s primary earner. Although Jacquie Baxter never wanted to be a role model, she never shirked her responsibility as a voice for Maori people and a campaigner against racial inequality. Her life and writing are testament to a woman of great integrity and quiet courage who helped clear the path that younger writers have followed to greater success and recognition."<ref name="ka mate" />

In December 2019, Wellington artists [[Mata Aho Collective]] and [[Andre Te Hira]] installed artwork over temporary fencing at the [[Wellington Central Library]] featuring Sturm's poem "On The Building Site for a New Library", published in ''Dedications'' (1996). The work was printed on adhesive vinyl, and installed in vertical strips along the temporary fencing. It was designed to remain in place for at least a year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Kate |title=Central library fencing celebrates local Māori poet through art |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/118294096/central-library-fencing-celebrates-local-mori-woman-author-through-art |access-date=5 November 2020 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |date=19 December 2019}}</ref>

In February 2021, the website ''Poetry Shelf'' published an audio recording of New Zealand poet [[Karlo Mila]] reading her poem "Letter to J.C. Sturm" from her collection ''Goddess Muscle'' (2020).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Paula |title=Poetry Shelf celebrates the Ockham NZ Book Awards Poetry longlist: Karlo Mila reads from Goddess Muscle |url=https://nzpoetryshelf.com/2021/02/26/poetry-shelf-celebrates-the-ockham-nz-book-awards-poetry-longlist-karlo-mila-reads-from-goddess-muscle/ |website=Poetry Shelf |access-date=26 February 2021 |date=26 February 2021}}</ref>

In May 2021, Paul Millar, together with Sturm's son John Baxter and publisher Roger Steele, found some of Sturm's early work from the 1940s, including unpublished poems. The poem "Brown Optimism", which may have been published in a student newspaper, was subsequently published on the website ''[[The Spinoff]]''. Millar noted that the poem "rejects the status quo and demands equality for Māori".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Millar |first1=Paul |title=Today we publish a poem by J.C.
