'''Jakob Ayrer''' (c. 1543 &ndash; March 26, 1605 or in 1625<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrer, Jakob der Jüngere|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd124413625.html|website=Deutsche Bibliographie|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref>) was a [[Germany|German]] [[playwright]] and author of ''[[Fastnachtsspiel]]e'' ([[carnival]] or [[Shrovetide]] plays).

==Life==
Little is known of Ayrer's living circumstances. He lived as an [[ironmonger]] in [[Nuremberg]], probably studying [[theology]] and [[law]] in [[Bamberg]] before returning in 1593 to Nuremberg, where he was Imperial [[Civil law notary|notary]] and legal [[prosecutor]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Ayrer was the last significant composer of ''Fastnachtsspiele'' and a very prolific author: of his 106 plays, sixty-nine survive. He took his material from [[Greek mythology]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[fables]] and German [[chapbook]]s and stories; he also translated plays of [[Shakespeare]]. Ayrer died in 1605 in his birth city of Nuremberg. ''[[Opus Theatricum]]'', a six-volume selection of his plays, ''Fastnachtsspiele'' and farces, appeared in 1618.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

As a dramatist, Ayrer is virtually the successor of [[Hans Sachs]], but he came under the influence of the so-called ''Englische Komodianten'', that is, troupes of English actors, who, at the close of the 16th century and during the 17th, repeatedly visited the [[Europe|Continent]], bringing with them the repertory of the [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] theatre. From those actors Ayrer learned how to enliven his dramas with sensational incidents and spectacular effects, and from them he borrowed the character of the [[clown]]. Influence may have operated in the other direction as well; ''Comedia von der schönen Sidea'' (ca. 1600; “Comedy of the Beautiful Sidea”) is often cited as the plot model used by [[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[The Tempest]]''. Ayrer's plays, however, are in spite of his foreign models, hardly more dramatic, in the true sense of the word, than those of Sachs, and they are inferior to the latter in poetic qualities.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
