==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Essex Hemphill was born April 16, 1957, in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/a-poet-who-spoke-to-the-black-gay-experience-and-a-quest-to-make-him-heard/2014/08/03/91307a2a-1ac6-11e4-9e3b-7f2f110c6265_story.html?noredirect=on|title=A poet who spoke to the black gay experience, and a quest to make him heard|date=2014-08-03|website=The Washington Post|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> to Warren and Mantalene Hemphill, and was the second eldest of five children. Early in his life, he moved to Washington D.C. where he attended [[Ballou High School]].<ref name=":0" /> He began writing poetry at the age of fourteen, writing about his own thoughts, family life, and budding sexuality. After graduation, he enrolled at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1975 to study [[journalism]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill and the Battlefield of AIDS|last=Duberman|first=Martin|publisher=The New Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-59558-945-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holdtightgentlym0000dube/page/18 18–42]|url=https://archive.org/details/holdtightgentlym0000dube/page/18}}</ref> Though he left college after his freshman year, he continued to interact with the D.C. art scene: performing spoken word, working on journals, and beginning to publish his first poetry chapbooks.<ref name=":0" />  He would go on to achieve his degree in English at the [[University of the District of Columbia]].<ref>Dickel, Simon.

=== Career ===
In 1979, Hemphill and his colleagues started the ''Nethula Journal of Contemporary Literature'', a publication aimed at showcasing the works of modern black artists.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">Steward, Douglas. "Essex Hemphill (1957-1995)."  ''Contemporary Gay American Poets & Playwrights''. Ed. Emmanuel S. Nelson. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2003, pp. 198–204.</ref>  One of his first public readings was arranged by ''Nethula'' co-editor [[E. Ethelbert Miller]] at [[Howard University]]’s Founder Library where he performed beside and befriended filmmaker [[Michelle Parkerson]].<ref name=":0" />  He also performed at other institutions, including [[Harvard University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California at Los Angeles]] to name a few.<ref name=":1">James, Winston G. "Hemphill, Essex (1957-1995)". ''Encyclopedia of African-American Literature''. Ed. Wilfred D. Samuels.  New York: Fact on File, 2007, pp. 240–242.</ref>

In 1982, Essex Hemphill, Larry Duckett, his close friend, and Wayson Jones, his university roommate, founded the spoken word group called "Cinque," which performed in the Washington D.C. area.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />  Hemphill continued performing his rhythmic, spoken word poetry, and in 1983, received a grant from [[Washington Project for the Arts]] to perform an "experimental dramatization" of poetry entitled ''Murder on Glass,'' alongside Parkerson and Jones.<ref name=":0" />  Hemphill also began publishing his own collections of poetry during this time, beginning with ''Diamonds Was in the Kitty'' and ''Some of the People We Love'' (1982), and followed by the more favorably reviewed ''Earth Life'' (1985) and ''Conditions'' (1986).<ref name=":0" />  He would garner more national attention when his work was included in ''In the Life'' (1986), an anthology of poems from black, gay artists, compiled by Hemphill's good friend, lover,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African-American literature|last=D.|first=Samuels, Wilfred|isbn=9781438140599|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=882543290|date = 2015-04-22}}</ref> and fellow author, [[Joseph F. Beam]].<ref name=":2" />  His poetry has been published widely in journals, and his essays have appeared in ''Obsidian'', ''[[Black Scholar]]'', ''[[Callaloo (journal)|CALLALOO]]'', and ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' among others.<ref name=":1" /> In 1986, Hemphill received a fellowship in poetry from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].<ref name=":2" />

Essex Hemphill also made appearances in a number of documentaries between 1989 and 1992. In 1989, he appeared in ''[[Looking for Langston]]'', a film directed by [[Isaac Julien]] about poet [[Langston Hughes]] and the [[Harlem Renaissance]].<ref>Chi-Yun Shin, Carl. "Reclaiming The Corporeal: The Black Male Body And The 'Racial' Mountain In Looking For Langston." ''Paragraph'' 26.1/2 (2003): 201.''Humanities International Complete''. Web. May 5, 2016.</ref> Hemphill also worked with Emmy award-winning filmmaker [[Marlon Riggs]] on two documentaries:''[[Tongues Untied]]'' (1989) which looked into the complex overlapping of black and queer identities, and ''[[Black is... Black Ain't]]'' (1992) which discussed what exactly constitutes "blackness."<ref name=":3" />

After Beam's death from AIDS in 1988, Essex Hemphill and Beam's mother worked conjointly in order to publish his sequel to ''In the Life''.  The second manuscript was published in 1991 under the title ''Brother to Brother: New Writings by Black Gay Men'', which archived the works of about three dozen authors, including Hemphill himself.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hold Tight Gently|url=https://archive.org/details/holdtightgentlym0000dube|url-access=registration|last=Duberman|year=2014|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holdtightgentlym0000dube/page/166 166]–182}}</ref> Writing about Hemphill and Beam in his book, ''Evidence of Being'': ''The Black Gay Cultural Renaissance and the Politics of Violence'', Darius Bost notes that Hemphill moved in with Beam's mother to help finish the anthology, taking on domestic tasks in exchange for room and board. He writes that Hemphill said in an interview that the anthology “was produced in the ‘context of confronting AIDS and the death around us. It’s almost like a fierce resistance that says, ‘Before I die, I’m going to say these things.’’” Hemphill also wrote a poem dedicated to Beam after his death titled “When My Brother Fell,” and dedicated his 1986 poem “Heavy Corners” to him. In 1990, he gave a speech at the OutWrite conference (where he was the only Black panelist), which eventually became the introduction to the anthology. ''Brother to Brother'' would go on to win a [[Lambda Literary Award]].<ref name=":1" />

In 1992, Hemphill published his largest collection of poetry and short stories, entitled ''Ceremonies: Prose and Poetry,''<ref name=":2" /> which included recent work, but also selection from his earlier poetry collections, ''Earth Life'' and ''Conditions''.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Hold Tight Gently|url=https://archive.org/details/holdtightgentlym0000dube|url-access=registration|last=Duberman|year=2014|pages=[https://archive.org/details/holdtightgentlym0000dube/page/231 231]–246}}</ref> The next year, the anthology would be awarded the National Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual New Author Award<ref name=":2" /> and a [[Pew Fellowship in the Arts|Pew Charitable Trust Fellowship in the Arts]].<ref name=":3" /> In 1993, he was a visiting scholar at the [[Getty Center]].<ref name=":3" />

=== Death ===
In the 1990s, Hemphill would rarely give information about his health, although he would occasionally talk about "being a person with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]."<ref>Duberman (2014), ''Hold Tight Gently'', pp. 113–114.</ref>  It was not until 1994 that he wrote about his experiences with the disease in his poem "Vital Signs."<ref name=":4">Duberman (2014) ,''Hold Tight Gently'', pp. 291–304.</ref> He died on November 4, 1995, of AIDS-related complications.<ref name=":4" />

== Legacy ==
After his death, December 10, 1995 was announced by three organizations ([[Gay Men of African Descent]] (GMAD), Other Countries, and Black Nations/Queer Nations?) to be a National Day of Remembrance for Essex Hemphill at [[New York City]]'s Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center. [[Cheryl Dunye]] dedicated her 1996 film [[Watermelon Woman]] to Hemphill.

In his essay "(Re)- Recalling Essex Hemphill" in ''Words to Our Now'', [[Thomas Glave]], pays tribute to Hemphill's life, focusing on the lasting effects of his actions.<ref name=Glave>Glave, Thomas. "(Re)- Recalling Essex Hemphill." ''Words to Our Now''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005. 23–30.</ref> Glave writes:<blockquote>In this now, we celebrate your life and language Essex. So celebrating, we know that we re-call you in what is largely, to borrow from another visionary, a 'giantless time.' The sheer giantry of your breathing presence has passed. Now present and future warriors—ourselves and others—will be compelled to learn, as you did and made manifest, that all hauls toward truth—toward venality; ardor, not arrogance; forthrightness, not cowardice.<ref name=Glave /></blockquote>In 2014, [[Martin Duberman]] wrote ''Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill, and the Battlefield of AIDS'' in which Duberman documents the life of Essex Hemphill, along with author and activist, [[Michael Callen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/reviews/memoir/03/22/hold-tight-gently-michael-callen-essex-hemphill-and-the-battlefield-of-aids-by-martin-duberman/|title='Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill and the Battlefield of AIDS' by Martin Duberman (review)|last=Kerr|first=Theodore|date=March 22, 2014|website=lambdaliterary.org|publisher=Lambda Literary|access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref> The book would go on to win the Lambda Literary Award for [[LGBT]] Nonfiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/06/02/lambda-literary-announces-2015-winners|title="Lambda Literary Announces 2015 Winners|last=Kellaway|first=Mitch|date=June 2, 2015|website=advocate.com|publisher=Advocate|access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref>

In June 2019, Hemphill was one of the inaugural fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the [[National LGBTQ Wall of Honor]] within the [[Stonewall National Monument]] (SNM) in [[New York City]]’s [[Stonewall Inn]].<ref name=":23">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro.us/news/local-news/new-york/stonewall-inn-lgbtq-wall-honor|title=National LGBTQ Wall of Honor unveiled at Stonewall Inn|last=Glasses-Baker|first=Becca|date=June 27, 2019|website=www.metro.us|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref><ref name="SDGLN">{{Cite web|url=https://sdgln.com/news/2019/06/19/national-lgbtq-wall-honor-be-unveiled-historic-stonewall-inn|title=National LGBTQ Wall of Honor to be unveiled at historic Stonewall Inn|last=SDGLN|first=Timothy Rawles-Community Editor for|date=2019-06-19|website=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News|language=en|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> The SNM is the first [[National monument (United States)|U.S. national monument]] dedicated to [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBTQ rights]] and [[History of LGBT people|history]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebar.com/news/news//272833|title=Groups seek names for Stonewall 50 honor wall|website=The Bay Area Reporter / B.A.R.

==Works==

=== Themes ===
Much of Hemphill's poetry and spoken word was autobiographical, and portrayed his experiences as a minority in both the African-American and LGBT communities.<ref>"Essex Hemphill." ''Contemporary Authors Online''. Detroit: Gale, 2010. ''Literature Resource Center''.</ref>

He wrote pieces such as "[http://www.colorado.edu/journals/standards/V5N2/HEMPHILL/hemphill3.html Family Jewels]," which conveyed his frustrations about white bigotry, specifically within the gay community.<ref>Duberman (2014), ''Hold Tight Gently'', pp. 75–88.</ref> In his essay "Does Your Momma Know About me?" Hemphill criticizes photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]'s ''The Black Book'', which showcased pictures of the penises of black men.<ref name=":2" />  Hemphill argued that excluding the faces of the black male subjects demonstrated the fetishism of African Americans by whites in the gay community.<ref name=":2" />

The poems and essays in ''Ceremonies'' address the sexual objectification of black men in white culture, relationships among gay black men and non-gay black men, [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in the black community and the meaning of family. He also goes on to critique both the institutionalized patriarchy, and dominant gender identities within society.<ref>Thomas, Greg. "Brother To Brother/Ceremonies (Book)." ''Educational Studies'' 24.3 (1993): 277. ''Academic Search Complete''.</ref>

Hemphill repeatedly invoked loneliness throughout his work. Loneliness in Hemphill's work is a traumatic feeling, a constant sense of rejection. Many of the men returned home after being rejected by white gay communities, only to be rejected within black communities as well. In Hemphill's poetry, he portrays loneliness as a collective feeling. He defined loneliness as a sense of being, marked by suffering without public recognition. A sense of separation from the public creates a social longing because even though the journey is lonesome, fighting against that journey not to kill you, as Hemphill said in one of his poems,  makes you yearn for community and support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Evidence of Being|last=Bost|first=Darius|date=2019|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226589824|doi = 10.7208/chicago/9780226589961.001.0001}}</ref>
