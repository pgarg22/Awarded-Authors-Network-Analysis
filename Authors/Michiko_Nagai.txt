Born in [[Tokyo]], Nagai graduated from the [[Tokyo Women's University]] with a degree in [[Japanese literature]] in 1944. She also studied economy history at the [[University of Tokyo]] from 1947 to 1948. After her marriage to the Nobuo Kuroita, the son of historian [[Kuroita Katsumi]], she went to work for the Shogakukan Publishing Company as an editor, but began to write her own stories with historical settings on the side.<ref name=schierbeck271/>

In 1952, she submitted her debut work, ''Sanjoin ki'' ("History of Lady Sanjo") to the ''Sunday Mainichi'', where it was awarded second place in the 30th anniversary commemorative edition of that publication.<ref name=schierbeck271/> This encouraged her to pursue a career in literature full-time,{{cn|date=November 2021}} winning the prestigious [[Naoki Award]] in 1964,<ref name=schierbeck271/> the 21st Women's Culture Award in 1982,<ref name=schierbeck272>{{harvtxt|Schierbeck|1994|page=272}}</ref> the 32nd [[Kikuchi Kan Prize]] in 1984,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bunshun.co.jp/shinkoukai/award/kikuchi/list.html|lang=ja|trans-title=List of Kikuchi Award Winners (as of October 2021)|title=菊池賞受賞者一覧 （2021年10月現在）|url-status=live|website=bunshun.co.jp}}</ref> and the [[Yoshikawa Eiji Literary Award]].<ref name=interview1>{{cite interview|first=Michiko|last=Nagai|title=○インタビュー　永井路子　歴史小説の周辺|date=May 10, 1999|url=https://www.yurindo.co.jp/static/yurin/back/378_1.html|access-date=16 November 2021}}</ref>

She is noted for [[historical novel]]s reassessing the role of women in [[Japanese history]], deviating from the traditional narrative.<ref name=schierbeck273>{{harvtxt|Schierbeck|1994|page=273}}</ref> She has been praised{{by whom|date=November 2021}} for combining historical accuracy with translating her characters emotions into modern terms. In ''Masako'', she countered popular image of [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]'s jealous, power-grasping wife [[Hōjō Masako]] (1157–1225) with a more human, sympathetic personality. Her novel was the basis for a yearlong [[television drama]] on the Japanese government [[television network]] [[NHK]], in 1979.

Likewise, in ''Gin no yakata'' ("Silver Mansion", 1980) she rehabilitated the image of [[Hino Tomiko]] (1440–1496), wife of the ineffectual ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]]. Historically scorned as an "evil money-grubbing woman" who dragged the country into war, Nagai's portrayal is of a woman who is savior of the government, and who is skilled at finance and politics.
However, her writing was not entirely on the role of women. In 1997, NHK aired a [[Taiga drama|year-long historical drama]] in 50 episodes, [[Mōri Motonari]], on the life of the [[Sengoku period|Sengoku-period]] ''[[daimyō]]'', based on Nagai's book of the same name.
