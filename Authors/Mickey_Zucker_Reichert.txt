'''Mickey Zucker Reichert''' (born as Miriam Susan Zucker in 1962<ref name="isfdb" />) is an American [[fantasy fiction]] author<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/62533383.html?dids=62533383:62533383&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+07%2C+1995&author=Matt+Nesvisky&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=Never+judge+a+book+by+its+cover%2C+or+its+title&pqatl=google|title=Never judge a book by its cover, or its title|last=Nesvisky|first=Matt|date=April 7, 1995|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|page=4|access-date=29 July 2011|location=And dont forget Mickey Zucker Reichert's Beyond Ragnarok with this intriguing description...}}</ref> of several best selling novels.

== Personal life ==
Reichert is a [[pediatrician]],<ref name="About" /> and holds a [[Doctorate of Medicine]] (M.D.). She is from a town in [[Iowa]].<ref name="Kalona" /> She and her husband have fostered and adopted children, as well as a variety of animals "from mice to horses".<ref name="About" />

Her novels are published by [[DAW Books]]; the organisation published her first novel via Sheila Gilbert, who is still Reichert's editor over 25 years later.<ref name="Kalona" />

Zucker-Reichert is an experienced and passionate wildlife rescuer. Her snaring techniques were involved in the rescue the endangered gopher tortoise. Seeing that it could outrun her, she created advanced snaring methodology and techniques that are now utilized to save the species from extinction.

== Notable works ==
Reichert has published over 22 novels; an illustrated [[novella]]; and over 50 short stories.<ref name="About" />

=== Renshai series ===
She is known for her ''Renshai'' series, which provides a different perspective on traditional [[Norse mythology]]. It is the story of a battle between good vs evil vs neutrality. It focuses around Norse mythology. The story largely centers around the survivors from a tribe of master swordsmen that are decimated in a coordinated attack by the majority of their neighboring countries, and a few other characters.

These three books focus on the character of Colbey Calistinsson in addition to other characters that play central roles in the storyline. Colbey is the most skilled swordsman the Renshai tribe has ever known. Yet, after his tribe is almost completely eradicated, he is forced to search for purpose and also determine a new course for his existence. Otherwise the evil forces of the East will destroy the neutral forces of the West in the Great War that is prophesied to plunge more than half of the continent in a violent war.

Later in the series Colbey acquires powerful telepathic and psychic abilities. This, he discovers in the third book, stems from his heritage. Colbey is in fact the son of [[Thor]], the Norse God of Thunder, and the grandson of [[Odin]], King of the Norse Gods. He is the son of a god and a mortal woman from a mighty warrior tribe (Renshai). However, true to character, he is undaunted by this knowledge, and soldiers on through many quests with his sense of purpose and his dedication to only do what he feels is right regardless of the consequences - even if it may possibly result in the Ragnarok and bring about the end of the world. Eventually, he marries the goddess [[Freya]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== I, Robot ===
Reichert was asked to write three<ref name="Guardian" /> prequels of ''[[I, Robot]]'' by ''[[Isaac Asimov]]'''s estate. She first met Asimov when she was 23, although she did not know him well.<ref name="Kalona" /> She is the first female author to be authorised to write stories based on Asimov's novels;<ref name="Kalona" /> follow-ups to his Foundation series were written by [[Gregory Benford]], [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]].<ref name="Guardian" /> The prequels were ordered by [[Berkley Books]].<ref name="Guardian" />
