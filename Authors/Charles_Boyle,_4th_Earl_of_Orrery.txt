'''Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery''' [[Order of the Thistle|KT]] [[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (28 July 1674 &ndash; 28 August 1731) was an [[England|English]] nobleman, [[politician|statesman]] and patron of the sciences.

==Early life==
The second son of [[Roger Boyle, 2nd Earl of Orrery]], and his wife Lady Mary Sackville (1647–1710), daughter of [[Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset]], he was born at [[Little Chelsea]], [[London]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=3124|title=Boyle, Charles, fourth earl of Orrery (1674–1731)}}</ref>  He was educated at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and soon distinguished himself by his learning and abilities. 

==Career==
Like [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery|the first earl]], he was an author, soldier and statesman. He translated [[Plutarch]]'s life of [[Lysander]], and published an edition of the epistles of [[Phalaris]], which engaged him in the famous controversy with [[Richard Bentley|Bentley]].<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Orrery, Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of|volume=20|page=329}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and sat for [[Charleville (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Charleville]] between 1695 and 1699.  He was three times member for the town of [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]; and on the death of his brother, Lionel, 3rd earl, in 1703, he succeeded to the title.

In 1706, he married Lady Elizabeth Cecil, daughter of [[John Cecil, 5th Earl of Exeter]] and Lady Anne Cavendish, at [[Burghley House]]. Their son and heir, John, was born the following year.

He entered the army, and in 1709 was raised to the rank of major-general, and sworn one of Her Majesty's [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. He was appointed to the [[Order of the Thistle]] and appointed queen's envoy to the states of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Flanders]]; and having discharged this trust with ability, he was created an English peer, as Baron Boyle of Marston, in [[Somerset]]. He inherited the [[Marston Bigot#House|estate]] in 1714.

Boyle became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1706. In 1713, under the patronage of Boyle, clockmaker [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] created the first mechanical [[solar system model]] that could demonstrate proportional motion of the planets around the Sun. The device was named the [[orrery]] in the Earl's honour.

Charles Boyle received several additional honours in the reign of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]; but having had the misfortune to fall under the suspicion of the government for playing a part in the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Atterbury Plot]], he was committed to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] in 1722, where he remained six months, and was then admitted to bail. On a subsequent inquiry he was discharged.<ref name="EB1911" />

Boyle wrote a comedy, ''[[As You Find It]]'', printed in 1703 and later published together with the plays of the first earl.

In 1728, he was listed as one of the subscribers to the ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' of [[Ephraim Chambers]].<ref>[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240045&isize=M List of Subscribers to the Cyclopaedia] at library.wisc.edu</ref>

==Later life==
Boyle died at his house in [[Westminster]] in 1731 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]]. He bequeathed his personal library and collection of scientific instruments to [[Christ Church Library]]; the instruments are now on display in the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]].

His son [[John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork|John, the 5th Earl of Orrery]], succeeded to the [[earl of Cork|earldom of Cork]] on the failure of the elder branch of the Boyle family, as earl of Cork and Orrery.
