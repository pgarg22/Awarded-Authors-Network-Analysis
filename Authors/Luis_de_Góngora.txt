'''Luis de Góngora y Argote''' (''born'' '''Luis de Argote y Góngora''')<ref> Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana. J. Espasa. 1907.</ref> ({{IPA-es|lwiz ðe ˈɣoŋɡoɾa}}; 11 July 1561 –  24 May 1627) was a [[Spanish Baroque literature|Spanish Baroque]] lyric poet. Góngora and his lifelong rival, [[Francisco de Quevedo]], are widely considered the most prominent Spanish poets of all time.  His style is characterized by what was called ''[[culteranismo]]'', also known as ''Gongorismo''.  This style existed in stark contrast to Quevedo's ''[[conceptismo]]''.

==Biography==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
Góngora was born to a noble family in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], where his father, Francisco de Argote, was ''corregidor,'' or judge. In a Spanish era when purity of Christian lineage ([[limpieza de sangre]]) was needed to gain access to education or official appointments, he adopted the surname of his mother, Leonor de Góngora.<ref name="nueva-acropolis.es">[http://www.nueva-acropolis.es/gandia/pagina.asp?art=3968 Asociación Cultural Nueva Acrópolis en Gandía.

Part II'' (Pergamon Press, 1968), 19.</ref>
 
As a [[canon (priest)|canon]] associated with this cathedral, Luis de Góngora traveled on diverse commissions to [[Navarre]], Andalusia and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. The cities that he visited included [[Madrid]], [[Salamanca]], [[Granada]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Around 1605, he was ordained priest, and afterwards lived at [[Valladolid]] and [[Madrid]].

While his circle of admirers grew, patrons were grudging in their admiration. Ultimately, in 1617 through the influence of the [[Duke of Lerma]], he was appointed honorary chaplain to King [[Philip III of Spain]], but did not enjoy the honour long.

He maintained a long feud with [[Francisco de Quevedo]], who matched him in talent and wit.{{POV statement|date=June 2020}} Both poets composed many bitter, satirical pieces attacking one another, with Quevedo criticizing Góngora's penchant for flattery, his large nose, and his passion for gambling. Quevedo even accused his enemy of [[sodomy]], which was a [[capital crime]] in 17th century Spain. In his "Contra el mismo (Góngora)", Quevedo writes of Góngora: ''No altar, garito sí; poco cristiano, / mucho tahúr, no clérigo, sí arpía.'' (English: There's no altar, but there's a gambling den; not much of a Christian, / but he's very much a [[cardsharp]], not a cleric, definitely a [[harpy]]). <ref>"There's no altar, but there's a gambling den; not much of a Christian, / but he's very much a [[cardsharp]], not a cleric, definitely a [[harpy]]."{{cite web |url=http://centros5.pntic.mec.es/cpr.de.ciudad.real/Textos/Quevedo.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217172245/http://centros5.pntic.mec.es/cpr.de.ciudad.real/Textos/Quevedo.htm |archive-date=17 February 2008 }}</ref> Góngora's nose, the subject of Quevedo's "A una nariz", begins with the lines: ''Érase un hombre a una nariz pegado, / érase una nariz superlativa, / érase una nariz sayón y escriba, / érase un peje espada muy barbado'' (English: Once there was a man stuck to a nose, / it was a nose more marvellous than weird, / it was a nearly living web of tubes, / it was a swordfish with an awful beard).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonnets.spanish.sbc.edu/Quevedo_Nariz.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309121448/http://sonnets.spanish.sbc.edu/Quevedo_Nariz.html |archive-date=9 March 2001 }}. Translation: "Once there was a man stuck to a nose, / it was a nose more marvellous than weird, / it was a nearly living web of tubes, / it was a swordfish with an awful beard."</ref>

This angry feud came to a nasty end for Góngora when Quevedo bought the house Góngora lived in for the sole purpose of ejecting him from it. In 1626 a severe illness, which seriously impaired the poet's memory, forced him to return to Córdoba, where he died the following year. By then he was broke from trying to obtain positions and win lawsuits for all his relatives.

An edition of his poems was published almost immediately after his death by Juan López de Vicuña; the frequently reprinted edition by Hozes did not appear until 1633. The collection consists of numerous sonnets, odes, ballads, songs for guitar, and of some larger poems, such as the ''[[Soledades]]'' and the ''[[Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea]]'' (''Fable of [[Polyphemus]] and [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]]'') (1612), the two landmark works of the highly refined style called "culteranismo" or "Gongorismo". [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', catalogued the good and bad poets of his time.  He considered Góngora to be one of the good ones.

[[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] painted his portrait.  Numerous documents, lawsuits and satires by his rival Quevedo paint a picture of a man jovial, sociable, and talkative, who loved [[card games|card-playing]] and [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfights]]. His bishop accused him of rarely attending [[choir]], and of praying less than fervently when he did go.<ref name="nueva-acropolis.es"/> Góngora's passion for card-playing ultimately contributed to his ruin.<ref name="Bartolomé Bennassar 1979">[[Bartolomé Bennassar]], ''The Spanish Character: Attitudes and Mentalities from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century'' (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), 167.</ref>  Frequent allusions and metaphors associated with card-playing in Góngora's poetry reveal that cards formed part of his daily life.<ref name="Bartolomé Bennassar 1979"/>  He was often reproached for activities beneath the dignity of a churchman.

==Style==
''Culteranismo'' existed in stark contrast with ''[[conceptismo]]'', another movement of the Baroque period which is characterized by a witty style, wordplay, simple vocabulary, and conveying multiple meanings in as few words as possible. The best-known representative of Spanish ''conceptismo'', Francisco de Quevedo, had an ongoing feud with Luis de Góngora in which each criticized the other's writing and personal life.

The word culteranismo blends ''culto'' ("cultivated") and ''luteranismo'' ("[[Lutheranism]]") and was coined by its opponents to present it as a [[heresy]] of "true" poetry.  The movement aimed to use as many words as possible to convey little meaning or to conceal meaning.  "Góngora's poetry is inclusive rather than exclusive", one scholar has written, "willing to create and incorporate the new, literally in the form of [[neologisms]]."<ref>[[Roberto González Echevarría]], ''Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature'' (Duke University Press,1993), 197.</ref>
[[File:Luis Góngora Sign.svg|left|thumb|180px|Góngora's signature.]] 
Góngora had a penchant for highly Latinate and Greek neologisms, which his opponents mocked.  Quevedo lampooned his rival by writing a [[sonnet]], "Aguja de navegar cultos," which listed words from Góngora's [[lexicon]]: "He would like to be a culto poet in just one day, / must the following jargon learn: / ''Fulgores, arrogar, joven, presiente / candor, construye, métrica, armonía...''"<ref>Quoted in Dámaso Alonso, ''La lengua poética de Góngora'' (Madrid: Revista de Filología Española, 1950), 114.</ref>  Quevedo actually mocked Góngora's style in several sonnets, including "Sulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo."<ref name="cvc.cervantes.es">[http://cvc.cervantes.es/obref/quevedo_critica/satiras/arellano.htm CVC. Las sátiras de Quevedo. El soneto de Quevedo: «Sulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo»: ensayo de interpretación<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This anti-Gongorist sonnet mocks the unintelligibility of culteranismo and its widespread use of flowery neologisms, including ''sulquivagante'' (he who plies the seas; to travel without a clear destination); ''speluncas'' ("caves"); ''surculos'' (sprouts, [[Grafting|scions]]).<ref name="cvc.cervantes.es"/> He was also the first to write poems imitating the speech of blacks.<ref>Roberto González Echevarría, ''Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature'' (Duke University Press, 1993), 197.</ref>
Góngora also had a penchant for apparent breaks in [[syntactical]] flow, as he overturned the limitations of syntax, making the [[hyperbaton]] the most prominent feature of his poetry.<ref name="Roberto González Echevarría 1993">Roberto González Echevarría, ''Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature'' (Duke University Press,1993), 197.</ref>

He has been called a man of "unquestioned genius and almost limitless culture, an initiator who enriched his language with the vast power, beauty, and scope of a mighty pen."<ref>John Armstrong Crow, ''The Epic of Latin America'' (University of California Press, 1992), 300.</ref>  As far away as [[Peru]], he received the praise of [[Juan de Espinosa Medrano]] (ca. 1629–1688), who wrote a piece defending Góngora's poetry from criticism called ''Apologético en favor de Don Luis de Góngora, Príncipe de los poetas lyricos de España: contra Manuel de Faria y Sousa, Cavallero portugués'' (1662).<ref>[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/e/espinosa_medrano.htm Biografia de Juan de Espinosa Medrano<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

As [[Dámaso Alonso]] has pointed out, Gongora's contribution to the Spanish language should not be underestimated, as he picked up what were in his time obscure or little-used words and used them in his poetry again and again, thereby reviving or popularizing them.  Many of these words are quite common today, such as ''adolescente'', ''asunto'', ''brillante'', ''construir'', ''eclipse'', ''emular'', ''erigir'', ''fragmento'', ''frustrar'', ''joven'', ''meta'', and ''porción''.<ref>Dámaso Alonso, ''La lengua poética de Góngora'' (Madrid: Revista de Filología Española, 1950), 112.</ref>

[[Image:Portada Manuscrito Chacón.jpg|thumb|250px|Title page of the Chacon Manuscript.]]
Góngora's poems are usually grouped into two blocks, corresponding more or less to two successive poetic stages.  His ''[[Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea]]'' (''Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea'') and his ''[[Soledades]]'' (1613) are his best-known compositions and the most studied.<ref>[http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html Personas que escriben bonito<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902093517/http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html |date=2 September 2006 }}</ref> The ''Fábula'' is written in [[royal octaves]] (''octavas reales'') and his ''Soledades'' is written in a variety of metres and strophes, but principally in [[stanzas]] and [[Silva (Spanish strophe)|''silvas'']] interspersed with choruses.<ref>[http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html Personas que escriben bonito<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902093517/http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html |date=2 September 2006 }}</ref>

Góngora's ''[[Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea]]'' (1612) narrates a mythological episode described in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'': the love of [[Polyphemus]], one of the [[Cyclopes]], for the [[nymph]] [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], who rejects him.  In the poem's end, [[Acis]], enamored with Galatea, is turned into a river.<ref>[http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html Personas que escriben bonito<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902093517/http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html |date=2 September 2006 }}</ref>

Góngora's ''Fábula de Píramo y Tisbe'' (''Fable of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'') (1618) is a complex poem that mocks gossiping and avaricious women.  Góngora also wrote sonnets concerning various subjects of an amatory, satirical, moral, philosophical, religious, controversial, laudatory, and funereal nature.  As well as the usual topics (''[[carpe diem]]'' etc.) the sonnets include autobiographical elements, describing, for example, the increasing decrepitude and advancing age of the author. In addition, Góngora composed one of his most ambitions works, ''El Panegírico al Duque de Lerma'' (1617), a poem in 79 royal octaves. Cervantes, after reading "El Panegírico", said: "the [work] I most esteem from those I've read of his."<ref>Jesús Ponce Cárdenas: [http://www.upf.edu/todogongora/_pdf/Ponce_Cxrdenas_El_Panegxrico_al_duque_de_Lerma_Trascendencia_de_un_modelo_gongorino.pdf El Panegírico al duque de Lerma. Trascendencia de un modelo gongorino (1617-1705)]</ref>

He also wrote plays, which include ''La destrucción de Troya'', ''Las firmezas de Isabela'', and the unfinished ''Doctor Carlino''.<ref>[http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html Personas que escriben bonito<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902093517/http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html |date=2 September 2006 }}</ref>

Although Góngora did not publish his works (he had attempted to do so in 1623), manuscript copies were circulated and compiled in cancioneros (songbooks), and anthologies published with or without his permission.  In 1627, Juan Lopez Vicuña published ''Verse Works of the Spanish [[Homer]]'', which is also considered very trustworthy and important in establishing the Góngora's corpus of work.  Vicuña's work was appropriated by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and was later surpassed by an edition by Gonzalo de Hozes in 1633.

==Góngora and the Generation of '27==
The [[Generation of '27]] took its name from the year 1927 in which the tricentennial of Góngora's death, ignored by official academic circles, was celebrated with recitals, avant-garde happenings, and an ambitious plan to publish a new critical edition of his work, as well as books and articles on aspects of his work that had not been fully researched.<ref>César Augusto Salgado, ''From Modernism to Neobaroque: Joyce and Lezama Lima'' (2001, Bucknell University Press), 37.</ref>

The Generation of '27 was the first to attempt to self-consciously revive baroque literature.<ref name="Roberto González Echevarría 1993"/> [[Dámaso Alonso]] wrote that Góngora's complex language conveyed meaning in that it created a world of pure beauty.<ref name="Roberto González Echevarría 1993"/>  Alonso explored his work exhaustively and called Góngora a "mystic of words."<ref>[http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html Personas que escriben bonito<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902093517/http://www.conevyt.org.mx/cursos/enciclope/luis_de_gongora.html |date=2 September 2006 }}</ref> Alonso dispelled the notion that Góngora had two separate styles –"simple" and "difficult" poems- that were also divided chronologically between his early and later years. He argued that Góngora's more complex poems built on stylistic devices that had been created in Góngora's early career as a poet. He also argued that the apparent simplicity of some of Góngora's early poems is often deceptive.<ref>Arthur Terry, ''An Anthology of Spanish Poetry 1500–1700.  Part II'' (Pergamon Press, 1968), 20.</ref>

[[Rafael Alberti]] added his own ''Soledad tercera'' (''Paráfrasis incompleta'').<ref>[http://argos.cucsh.udg.mx/16oct-dic00/16emercado.htm Argos 16/ Ensayo/ Guadalupe Mercado<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1961, Alberti declared, "I am a visual poet, like all of the poets from [[Andalusia]], from Góngora to García Lorca."<ref>Quoted in C.B. Morris, ''This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920–1936'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), 87.</ref>

[[Federico García Lorca|García Lorca]] presented a lecture called "La imagen poética en don Luís de Góngora" at the Ateneo in [[Seville]] in 1927.<ref>[http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=1300&cat=biografiasuelta Garcia Lorca, Federico – CanalSocial – Enciclopedia GER<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113905/http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=1300&cat=biografiasuelta |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> In this lecture, García Lorca paid [[Jean Epstein]] the compliment of comparing the film director with Góngora as an authority on images.<ref>C.B. Morris, ''This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920–1936'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), 47.</ref>

==References in fiction and philosophy==
The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] proposed in his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' (1677) that a man can die before his body stops moving. As an example he mentioned "a Spanish poet who suffered an illness; though he recovered, he was left so oblivious to his past life that he did not believe the tales and tragedies he had written were his own".<ref>Spinoza (1677/1985), p. 569 (scholium to proposition 39 of part 4)</ref> The historian [[:de:Carl Gebhardt|Carl Gebhardt]] wrote that "this was probably Góngora, whose works [[Spinoza]] possessed, and who lost his memory a year before his death".<ref>Spinoza (1677/1985), p. 569, footnote 22</ref>

The narrator of the [[Captain Alatriste]] series, a friend of [[Francisco de Quevedo]] within the stories, illustrates Góngora's feuding with Quevedo, both by quoting poetry from each as well as describing Quevedo's attitude toward Góngora through the course of the story.  Excerpts of poetry from one against the other are included within the story itself and poetry from each is included at the back of some of the books.

[[Lawrence Durrell]] in his novel ''[[Clea (novel)|Clea]]'' (1960), part of ''[[The Alexandria Quartet]]'', includes a passage from the journal of his fictional novelist Pursewarden: "Why should the artist always be trying to saturate the world with his own anguish…emotional Gongorism!"

In [[Giannina Braschi]]'s bilingual novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' (1998) contemporary Latin American poets have a heated debate about Góngora's and Quevedo's role in defining the Spanish empire through their works.

The musical group [[Dead Can Dance]] used an English translation of Góngora's ''Da bienes Fortuna''  as the lyrics for the song "Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Book" on their 1990 album [[Aion (Dead Can Dance album)|Aion]].

In the second of the five parts of [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''2666'' (published posthumously in 2004), "The Part about Amalfitano", one of the characters (the poet, whose name is never explicitly stated) quotes a verse from Góngora: ''Ande yo caliente y ríase la gente''.

John Crowley's novel "The Solitudes" (1987) repeatedly refers to and quotes from Gongora's poem "Soledades."
