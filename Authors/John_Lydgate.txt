'''John Lydgate of Bury''' (c. 1370 – c. 1451)<ref name="platt">{{cite book |last=Platt |first=Colin |title=King Death: The Black Death and its aftermath in late-medieval England |year=1996 |publisher=UCL Press Limited |location=London |isbn=1-85728-313-9 }}</ref> was an English monk and poet, born in [[Lidgate]], near [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]], [[Suffolk]], England.

Lydgate's poetic output is prodigious, amounting, at a conservative count, to about 145,000 lines. He explored and established every major [[Chaucerian]] genre, except such as were manifestly unsuited to his profession, like the ''[[fabliau]]''. In the ''[[Troy Book]]'' (30,117 lines), an amplified translation of the Trojan history of the thirteenth-century Latin writer [[Guido delle Colonne]], commissioned by Prince Henry (later Henry V), he moved deliberately beyond Chaucer's ''[[Knight's Tale]]'' and his ''[[Troilus and Criseyde|Troilus]]'', to provide a full-scale epic.

The ''[[Siege of Thebes (poem)|Siege of Thebes]]'' (4716 lines) is a shorter excursion in the same field of chivalric epic. Chaucer's ''[[The Monk's Tale]]'', a brief catalog of the vicissitudes of Fortune, gives a hint of what is to come in Lydgate's massive ''[[Fall of Princes]]'' (36,365 lines), which is also derived, though not directly, from [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]''.<ref>Mortimer, Nigel, ''John Lydgate's 'Fall of Princes': Narrative Tragedy in its Literary and Political Contexts'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005).</ref>

''[[The Man of Law's Tale]]'', with its rhetorical elaboration of apostrophe, invocation, and digression in what is essentially a saint's legend, is the model for Lydgate's legends of [[Edmund the Martyr|St. Edmund]] (3693 lines) and [[Saint Alban|St. Alban]] (4734 lines), both local monastic patrons, as well as for many shorter saints' lives, though not for the richer and more genuinely devout ''Life of Our Lady'' (5932 lines).

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
In a graffito written towards the end of his life, Lydgate admitted to all manner of childhood sins: "I lied to excuse myself. I stole apples … I made mouths at people like a wanton ape. I gambled at cherry stones. I was late to rise and dirty at meals. I was chief shammer of illness".<ref name="stummer">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/29/john-lydgate-graffiti-chaucer-monk-literary-talent|title=The message of love hidden in medieval graffiti|last=Stummer|first=Robin|date=29 March 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=12 April 2014}}</ref> He was admitted to the Benedictine monastery of [[Bury St Edmunds Abbey]] in 1382, took novice vows soon after and was ordained as a [[Subdeacon#Subdeacons in the Roman Catholic Church|subdeacon]] in 1389. Based on a letter from [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], Lydgate was a student at [[Oxford University]], probably [[Gloucester College, Oxford|Gloucester College]] (now [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]]), between 1406 and 1408.<ref>{{Cite book|title=John Lydgate|last=Ebin|first=Lois|publisher=Twayne Publishing|year=1985|isbn=0-8057-6898-X|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnlydgate0000ebin/page/2 2]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/johnlydgate0000ebin/page/2}}</ref> It was during this period that Lydgate wrote his early work, ''Isopes Fabules'', with its broad range of scholastic references.<ref>Edward Wheatley, Middle English Text Series, Kalamazoo MI 2013, [http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/wheatley-lydgate-isopes-fabules-introduction Introduction]</ref>

=== Career ===
[[File:Houghton MS Eng 530 - Lydgate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Manuscript of ''Damage and destruction in realmes'' by John Lydgate, ca. 1450, in the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]].]]
Having literary ambitions (he was an admirer of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and a friend to his son, [[Thomas Chaucer|Thomas]]) he sought and obtained patronage for his literary work at the courts of [[Henry IV of England]], [[Henry V of England]] and [[Henry VI of England]]. His patrons included, amongst many others, the mayor and [[Alderman|aldermen]] of [[London]], the chapter of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]] and Henry V and VI. His main supporter from 1422 was [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]].

In 1423 Lydgate was made prior of [[Hatfield Broad Oak]], [[Essex]]. He soon resigned the office to concentrate on his travels and writing. He was a prolific writer of poems, allegories, fables and romances. His most famous works were his longer and more moralistic ''[[Troy Book]]'' (1412–20), a 30,000 line translation of the Latin prose narrative by [[Guido delle Colonne]], ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (poem)|Siege of Thebes]]'' which was translated from a French prose redaction of the [[Romance of Thebes|''Roman de Thebes'']] and the ''Fall of Princes''. The ''Fall of Princes'' (1431-8), is the last and longest of Lydgate's works.<ref>The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 p.616</ref>

Of his more accessible poems, most were written in the first decade of the fifteenth century in a Chaucerian vein: ''The Complaint of the Black Knight'' (originally called ''A Complaynt of a Loveres Lyfe'' and modelled on Chaucer's ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''); ''The Temple of Glas'' (indebted to ''[[The House of Fame]]''); ''The Floure of Curtesy'' (like the ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', a Valentine's Day Poem); and the allegorical ''Reason and Sensuality''.<ref name="English Literature p.617">The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 p.617</ref>

His short poems tend to be the best; as he grew older his poems grew progressively longer, and it is regarding Lydgate's later poetry that [[Joseph Ritson]]'s harsh characterization of him is based: 'A voluminous, prosaick and drivelling monk'.<ref name="English Literature p.617"/> Similarly, one twentieth-century historian has described Lydgate's verse as "banal".<ref>Wolffe, B. P. (2001). Henry VI. Yale Monarchs (repr. ed.). London: Yale University Press., p.312</ref>

At one time, the long allegorical poem ''[[The Assembly of Gods]]'' was attributed to him,<ref>See the edition of Oscar Lovell Triggs ([https://archive.org/details/assemblygodsora01lydggoog 1896]).</ref> but the work is now considered anonymous. Lydgate was also believed to have written ''London Lickpenny,'' a well-known satirical work; however, his authorship of this piece has been thoroughly discredited. He also translated the poems of [[Guillaume de Deguileville]] into English.

In his later years he lived and probably died at the monastery of [[Bury St. Edmunds]]. At some point in his life he returned to the village of his birth and added his signature and a coded message<ref name="stummer" /> in a [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] onto a wall<ref>{{cite news|title=John Lydgate linked to Suffolk church graffiti|work=BBC News|date=31 March 2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-26816502|access-date=1 April 2014}}</ref> at St Mary's Church, Lidgate, discovered as recently as 2014.
