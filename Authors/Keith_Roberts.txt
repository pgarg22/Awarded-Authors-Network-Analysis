'''Keith John Kingston Roberts''' (20 September 1935 – 5 October 2000) was an English [[science fiction author]]. He began publishing with two stories in the September 1964 issue of ''[[Science Fantasy (magazine)|Science Fantasy]]'' magazine, "Anita" (the first of a series of stories featuring a teenage modern [[witch]] and her eccentric granny) and "Escapism".<ref name=Encyclopedia /><ref name=Twentieth />

Several of his early stories were written using the pseudonym Alistair Bevan. His second novel, ''[[Pavane (novel)|Pavane]]'', which is a collection of linked stories, may be his most famous work: an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel in which the [[Catholic Church]] takes control of England following the assassination of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].<ref name="fbc">Cox, F. Brett. "Keith Roberts". 
''British fantasy and science-fiction writers since 1960''. 261 (2002): 336.</ref>

Roberts wrote numerous novels and short stories and worked as an illustrator. His artistic contributions include covers and interior artwork for ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' and ''Science Fantasy'', later renamed ''Impulse''. He also edited the last few issues of ''Impulse'' although the nominal editor was [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]].<ref name="fbc" />

Roberts' first novel, ''[[The Furies (1966 novel)|The Furies]]'', makes an appearance in the American TV series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' in the third season's third episode "Death in the Saddle" (9 October 2007).

Roberts described himself as a political conservative and 
an [[anti-communist]].<ref name="fbc" />

In later life, Roberts lived in [[Salisbury]]. He was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1990, and died of its complications in October 2000. Obituaries recalled him as a talented but personally "difficult" author, with a history of disputes with publishers, editors and colleagues.<ref>{{cite news| title=Obituary: Keith Roberts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/16/guardianobituaries.books| last=Holland| first=Steve| newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 October 2000| access-date=31 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="independent">{{cite news|last=Adrian|first=Jack|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=17 October 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref name="ansible">[http://news.ansible.co.uk/a160.html David Langford – Keith Roberts, 1935–2000 [[David Langford|Ansible #160]] (November 2000)]</ref><ref name="epitaphs">[http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/sfx073.html David Langford – A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs [[SFX magazine|SFX magazine #73]] (January 2001)]</ref>
