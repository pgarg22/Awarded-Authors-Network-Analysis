'''Romain Rolland''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɔlɑ̃|lang}}; 29 January 1866 – 30 December 1944) was a French dramatist, novelist, essayist, [[art historian]] and [[Mysticism|mystic]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1915 "as a tribute to the lofty idealism of his literary production and to the sympathy and love of truth with which he has described different types of human beings".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rolland.htm |title=Romain Rolland |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924043017/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rolland.htm |archive-date=24 September 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

He was a leading supporter of [[Josef Stalin]] in France and is also noted for his correspondence with and influence on [[Sigmund Freud]].

==Biography==
Rolland was born in [[Clamecy, Nièvre]] into a family that had both wealthy townspeople and farmers in its lineage. Writing introspectively in his ''Voyage intérieur'' (1942), he sees himself as a representative of an "antique species". He would cast these ancestors in ''Colas Breugnon'' (1919).

Accepted to the [[École normale supérieure]] in 1886, he first studied philosophy, but his independence of spirit led him to abandon that so as not to submit to the dominant ideology. He received his degree in history in 1889 and spent two years in Rome, where his encounter with [[Malwida von Meysenbug]]–who had been a friend of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]–and his discovery of Italian masterpieces were decisive for the development of his thought. When he returned to France in 1895, he received his doctoral degree with his thesis ''Les origines du théâtre lyrique moderne. Histoire de l’opéra en Europe avant Lulli et Scarlatti'' (''The origins of modern lyric theatre. A History of Opera in Europe before Lully and Scarlatti''). For the next two decades, he taught at various lycées in Paris before directing the newly established music school of the École des Hautes Études Sociales from 1902–11. In 1903 he was appointed to the first chair of music history at the [[Sorbonne]], he also directed briefly in 1911 the musical section at the [[French Institute in Florence]].<ref>{{Cite Grove |last=Henderson |first=Robert |title=Romain Rolland}}</ref>

His first book was published in 1902, when he was 36 years old. Through his advocacy for a 'people's theatre', he made a significant contribution towards the [[democratization]] of the theatre. As a humanist, he embraced the work of the philosophers of India ("Conversations with [[Rabindranath Tagore]]" and [[Mohandas Gandhi]]). Rolland was strongly influenced by the [[Vedanta]] philosophy of India, primarily through the works of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vedanta-newyork.org/thoughtson_rk.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904205419/http://www.vedanta-newyork.org/thoughtson_rk.htm |archive-date=4 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A demanding, yet timid, young man, he did not like teaching. He was not indifferent to youth: Jean-Christophe, Olivier and their friends, the heroes of his novels, are young people. But with real-life persons, youths as well as adults, Rolland maintained only a distant relationship. He was first and foremost a writer. Assured that literature would provide him with a modest income, he resigned from the university in 1912.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Romain Rolland was a lifelong pacifist. He was one of the few major French writers to retain his pacifist internationalist values; he moved to Switzerland.  He protested against the first World War in ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Au-dessus de la mêlée|fr|3=Au-dessus de la mêlée (texte)}}'' (1915), ''Above the Battle'' (Chicago, 1916). In 1924, his book on [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] contributed to the Indian [[nonviolent]] leader's reputation and the two men met in 1931. Rolland was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref>Walters, Kerry S; Portmess, Lisa. (1999). ''Ethical Vegetarianism: From Pythagoras to Peter Singer''. State University of New York Press. pp. 135-138. {{ISBN|0-7914-4044-3}}</ref><ref>[https://ivu.org/people/writers/rolland.html "Romain Rolland (1866-1944)"]. International Vegetarian Union.</ref>

In May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the "Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists".<ref name="Review">{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, "A Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists' Groups" (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |access-date=30 November 2018|date=22 October 2010 }}</ref>

In 1928 Rolland and Hungarian scholar, philosopher and natural living experimenter [[Edmund Bordeaux Szekely]] founded the International Biogenic Society to promote and expand on their ideas of the integration of mind, body and spirit.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
In 1932 Rolland was among the first members of the [[World Committee Against War and Fascism]], organized by [[Willi Münzenberg]]. Rolland criticized the control Münzenberg assumed over the committee and was against it being based in [[Berlin]].<ref>{{cite book|page=80 |last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=Under the Shadow of War: Fascism, Anti-Fascism, and Marxists, 1918–1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ccjJauxjlIC&pg=PA79|access-date=6 March 2015 |date=1987|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-06532-0}}</ref>

Rolland moved to [[Villeneuve, Vaud|Villeneuve]], on the shores of ''Lac Léman'' ([[Lake Geneva]]) to devote himself to writing. His life was interrupted by health problems, and by travels to art exhibitions. His voyage to Moscow (1935), on the invitation of [[Maxim Gorky]], was an opportunity to meet [[Joseph Stalin]], whom he considered the greatest man of his time.<ref>Michael David-Fox, . "The 'Heroic Life' of a Friend of Stalinism: Romain Rolland and Soviet Culture." ''Slavonica'' 11.1 (2005): 3-29.</ref>  Rolland served unofficially as ambassador of French artists to the [[Soviet Union]]. Although he admired Stalin, he attempted to intervene against the persecution of his friends. He attempted to discuss his concerns with Stalin, and was involved in the campaign for the release of the [[Left Opposition]] activist and writer [[Victor Serge]] and wrote to Stalin begging clemency for [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. During Serge's imprisonment (1933–1936), Rolland had agreed to handle the publications of Serge's writings in France, despite their political disagreements.

In 1937, he came back to live in [[Vézelay]], which, in 1940, was occupied by the Germans. During the occupation, he isolated himself in complete solitude.  Never stopping his work, in 1940, he finished his memoirs. He also placed the finishing touches on his musical research on the life of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Shortly before his death, he wrote ''[[Péguy]]'' (1944), in which he examines religion and socialism through the context of his memories. He died on 30 December 1944 in Vézelay.

In 1921, his close friend the Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]] published his biography (in English ''Romain Rolland: The Man and His Works''). Zweig profoundly admired Rolland, whom he once described as "the moral consciousness of Europe" during the years of turmoil and War in Europe. Zweig wrote at length about his friendship with Rolland in his own autobiography (in English ''[[The World of Yesterday]]'').

Victor Serge was appreciative of Rolland's interventions on his behalf but ultimately thoroughly disappointed by Rolland's refusal to break publicly with Stalin and the repressive Soviet regime.  The entry for 4 May 1945, a few weeks after Rolland's death, in Serge's ''Notebooks: 1936-1947'' notes acidly that "At age seventy the author of ''Jean-Christophe'' allowed himself to be covered with the blood spilled by a tyranny of which he was a faithful adulator."  <ref>{{cite book |last=Serge |first=Victor |date=2019 |title=Notebooks: 1936-1947 |publisher=[[New York Review Books]] | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-68137-270-9 |pages=506–509}}</ref>

[[Hermann Hesse]] dedicated ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' to Romain Rolland "my dear friend".

==People's theatre==
Rolland's most significant contribution to the theatre lies in his advocacy for a "popular theatre" in his essay ''The People's Theatre'' (''Le Théâtre du peuple'', 1902).<ref name="David Bradby 1998 p.930">David Bradby, "Rolland, Romain". In ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.'' Ed. Martin Banham. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}. p.930.</ref> "There is only one necessary condition for the emergence of a new theatre", he wrote, "that the stage and [[auditorium]] should be open to the masses, should be able to contain a people and the actions of a people".<ref>Romain Rolland, ''Le Théâtre du peuple'' (Paris: Albin Michel) p.121. Quoted by David Bradby and John McCormick, ''People's Theatre'' (London: Croom Helm and Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1978). {{ISBN|0-8476-6073-7}}. p.16.</ref> The book was not published until 1913, but most of its contents had appeared in the ''Revue d'Art Dramatique'' between 1900 and 1903. Rolland attempted to put his theory into practice with his [[melodrama]]tic dramas about the [[French Revolution]], ''Danton'' (1900) and ''The Fourteenth of July'' (1902), but it was his ideas that formed a major reference point for subsequent [[Theatre practitioners|practitioners]].<ref name="David Bradby 1998 p.930"/>

The essay is part of a more general movement around the turn of that century towards the [[democratization]] of the theatre. The ''Revue'' had held a competition and tried to organize a "World Congress on People's Theatre", and a number of People's Theatres had opened across Europe, including the [[Volksbühne|Freie Volksbühne]] movement ('Free People's Theatre') in Germany and Maurice Pottecher's [[Théâtre du Peuple]] in France. Rolland was a disciple of Pottecher and dedicated ''The People's Theatre'' to him.

Rolland's approach is more aggressive, though, than Pottecher's poetic vision of theatre as a substitute 'social religion' bringing unity to the nation. Rolland indicts the [[bourgeoisie]] for its [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of the theatre, causing it to slide into [[decadence]], and the deleterious effects of its [[Ideology|ideological]] dominance. In proposing a suitable [[Repertory|repertoire]] for his people's theatre, Rolland rejects classical drama in the belief that it is either too difficult or too static to be of interest to the masses. Drawing on the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], he proposes instead "an epic historical theatre of 'joy, force and intelligence' which will remind the people of its revolutionary heritage and revitalize the forces working for a new society" (in the words of Bradby and McCormick, quoting Rolland).<ref>David Bradby and John McCormick, ''People's Theatre'' (London: Croom Helm and Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1978). {{ISBN|0-8476-6073-7}}. p.32.</ref> Rolland believed that the people would be improved by seeing heroic images of their past. Rousseau's influence may be detected in Rolland's conception of theatre-as-[[Festival|festivity]], an emphasis that reveals a fundamental [[anti-theatrical prejudice]]: "Theatre supposes lives that are poor and agitated, a people searching in dreams for a refuge from thought. If we were happier and freer we should not feel hungry for theatre. [...] A people that is happy and free has need of festivities more than of theatres; it will always see in itself the finest [[spectacle]]".<ref>Quoted by David Bradby and John McCormick, ''People's Theatre'' (London: Croom Helm and Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1978). {{ISBN|0-8476-6073-7}}. p.32-33.</ref>

Rolland's dramas have been staged by some of the most influential theatre directors of the twentieth century, including [[Max Reinhardt]] and [[Erwin Piscator]].<ref>See John Willett, ''The Theatre of Erwin Piscator: Half a Century of Politics in the Theatre'', London: Methuen, 1978 (p.15, 35, 46–7, 179). {{ISBN|0-413-37810-1}}.</ref> Piscator directed the world première of Rolland's pacifist drama ''The Time Will Come'' (''Le Temps viendra'', written in 1903) at [[Berlin]]'s Central-Theater, which opened on 17 November 1922 with music by K Pringsheim and [[scenic design]] by O Schmalhausen and M Meier.<ref>Piscator (1929, 353).</ref> The play addresses the connections between [[imperialism]] and capitalism, the treatment of enemy civilians, and the use of [[concentration camp]]s, all of which are dramatised via an episode in the [[Boer War]].<ref name=Rorrison>Hugh Rorrison, in Piscator (1929, 55–56).</ref> Piscator described his treatment of the play as "thoroughly [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]]", whereby he sought "to achieve the greatest possible [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] in acting and decor".<ref>Piscator (1929, 58).</ref> Despite the play's overly-[[rhetoric]]al style, the production was reviewed positively.<ref name=Rorrison/>

==Novels==
Rolland's most famous novel is the 10-volume [[novel sequence]] ''[[Jean-Christophe]]'' (1904–1912), which brings "together his interests and ideals in the story of a German musical genius who makes France his second home and becomes a vehicle for Rolland's views on music, social matters and understanding between nations".<ref>John Cruickshank, "Rolland, Romain", in Anthony Thorlby (ed.), ''[[The Penguin Companion to Literature|The Penguin Companion to Literature 2: European Literature]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1969, p. 661.</ref> His other novels are ''Colas Breugnon'' (1919), ''[[Clérambault (novel)|Clérambault]]'' (1920), ''[[Pierre et luce|Pierre et Luce]]'' (1920) and his second roman-fleuve, the 7-volume ''L'âme enchantée'' (1922–1933).

He became a history teacher at [[Lycée Henri IV]], then at the [[Lycée Louis le Grand]], and member of the [[École française de Rome]], then a professor of the History of Music at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and History Professor at the École Normale Supérieure.

==Correspondence with Freud==
1923 saw the beginning of a correspondence between psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] and Rolland, who found that the admiration that he showed for Freud was reciprocated in equal measures (Freud proclaiming in a letter to him: "That I have been allowed to exchange a greeting with you will remain a happy memory to the end of my days.").<ref>William B. Parsons, ''The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling: Revisioning the Psychoanalytic Theory of Mysticism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999) 23, {{ISBN?}} [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=78939280  2 Apr. 2007]{{dl|date=July 2021}}.</ref> This correspondence introduced Freud to the concept of the "[[oceanic feeling]]" that Rolland had developed through his study of [[Eastern mysticism]]. Freud opened his next book ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'' (1929) with a debate on the nature of this feeling, which he mentioned had been noted to him by an anonymous "friend". This friend was Rolland. Rolland would remain a major influence on Freud's work, continuing their correspondence right up to Freud's death in 1939.<ref>William B. Parsons, ''The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling: Revisioning the Psychoanalytic Theory of Mysticism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999) 19, {{ISBN?}} [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=78939276  2 Apr. 2007]{{dl|date=July 2021}}</ref>
