'''Richard Aldington''' (8 July 1892 – 27 July 1962), born '''Edward Godfree Aldington''', was an English writer and poet, and an early associate of the Imagist movement. He was married to the poet [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.) from 1911 to 1938. His 50-year writing career covered poetry, novels, criticism and biography. He edited ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'', a literary journal, and wrote for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[British Vogue|Vogue]]'', ''[[The Criterion]]'' and ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]''.<ref Name=Doyle/> His biography of ''Wellington'' (1946) won him the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]]. His contacts included writers like [[T. S. Eliot]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[C. P. Snow]]. He championed Hilda Doolittle as the major poetic voice of the Imagist movement and helped her work gain international notice.<ref Name=Doyle/>

==Early life and marriage==
Aldington was born in [[Portsmouth]], the eldest of four children and the son of a solicitor. Both his parents wrote and published books, and their home held a large library of European and classical literature. As well as reading, Aldington's interests at this time, all of which continued in later life, included butterfly-collecting, hiking, and learning languages – he went on to master French, Italian, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was educated at Mr Sweetman's Seminary for Young Gentlemen, [[St Margaret's at Cliffe|St Margaret's Bay]], near Dover. His father died of heart problems at age 56.<ref>Doyle, Charles (2016) ''Richard Aldington: A Biography'', Springer pp. 1–5</ref><ref Name=Zilboorg>Zilboorg, Caroline (ed.) (2003) ''Richard Aldington and H.D.: Their Lives in Letters, Volume 4'', Manchester University Press pp. 1-30</ref>

Aldington attended [[Dover College]], followed by the [[University of London]].<ref name = IP>Peter Jones (editor), ''Imagist Poetry'' (1972), p. 163.</ref> He was unable to complete his degree because of the financial circumstances of his family caused by his father's failed speculations and ensuing debt. Supported by a small allowance from his parents, he worked as a sports journalist, started publishing poetry in British journals, and gravitated towards literary circles that included poets [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[Walter de la Mare]].<ref Name=Zilboorg/><ref Name=PF>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/richard-aldington Poetry Foundation] biography</ref><ref Name=Brit>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Aldington Encyclopedia Britannica profile]</ref><ref Name=War>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/great-war/richard-aldington-1892-1962/ War Poets Assoc. profile]</ref>

In 1911 Aldington met society hostess [[Brigit Patmore]], with whom he had a passing affair. At the time he was described as a "tall and broad-shouldered, with a fine forehead, thick longish hair of the indefinite colour blond hair turns to in adolescence, very bright blue eyes, too small a nose and a determined mouth."<ref>Vivien Whelpton (2014) ''Richard Aldington: Poet, Soldier and Lover 1911–1929'', pp. 26-27.</ref> Through her he met American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and the poet [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.), who had been previously engaged. H.D. and Aldington grew closer and in 1913 travelled together extensively through Italy and France, just before the war. On their return to London in the summer they moved into separate flats in Churchwalk, [[Kensington]], in West London. H.D. lived at number 6, Aldington at number 8, and Pound at number 10. In the presence of Pound and the Doolittle family, over from America for the summer, the couple married (marriage 1913–1938). They moved to 5 Holland Place Chambers into a flat of their own, although Pound soon moved in across the hall.<ref Name=Zilboorg/>

The poets were caught up in the literary ferment before the war, where new politics and ideas were passionately discussed and created in [[Soho]] tearooms and society salons. The couple bonded over their visions of new forms of poetry, feminism, and philosophy, emerging from the wake of staid Victorian mores. The couple were fed by a sense of peership and mutualism between them, rejecting hierarchies, beginning to view Pound as an intruder and interloper rather than a literary igniter.<ref Name=Zilboorg/>

The couple met influential American poet [[Amy Lowell]] and she introduced them to writer D.H. Lawrence in 1914, who would become a close friend and mentor to both.<ref Name=Zilboorg/><ref Name=Brit/>

==Early career==
Aldington's poetry was associated with the [[Imagist]] group, championing minimalist free verse with stark images, seeking to banish Victorian moralism. The group was key in the emerging [[Literary modernism|Modernist movement]].<ref Name=Doyle>Doyle, Charles (2016) ''Richard Aldington: A Biography'', Springer, pp xiv – xx</ref><ref Name=PF/> [[Ezra Pound]] coined the term ''imagistes'' for H.D. and Aldington (1912).<ref Name=Doyle/><ref>Michael H. Levenson, ''A Genealogy of Modernism'' (1984), p. 69.</ref> Aldington's poetry forms almost one third of the Imagists' inaugural anthology ''Des Imagistes'' (1914). The movement was heavily inspired by Japanese and classical European art.<ref Name=PF/><ref>Robert Ferguson, ''The Short Sharp Life of T. E. Hulme'' (2002), p. 85.</ref> Aldington shared [[T. E. Hulme]]'s conviction that experimentation with [[Waka (poetry)|traditional Japanese verse forms]] could provide a way forward for [[avant-garde]] literature in English.<ref>Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

[[File:H.D._in_Tendencies_in_Modern_American_Poetry,_1917_-_cropped.jpg|thumb|[[H.D.]] in 1917]]
Pound sent three of Aldington's poems to [[Harriet Monroe]]'s magazine ''Poetry'' and they appeared in November 1912. She notes "Mr Richard Aldington is a young English poet, one of the "Imagistes", a group of ardent Hellenists who are pursuing interesting experiments in vers libre."<ref Name=LRB/>She considered the poem "Choricos" to be his finest work, "one of the most beautiful death songs in the language"<ref>Monroe, Harriet, ''A Poet's Life'', Macmillan, New York, 1938</ref> "a poem of studied and affected gravity".<ref Name=LRB>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n02/robert-crawford/lithe-pale-girls, ''LRB''] Vol. 37 No. 2 · 22 January 2015</ref><ref>Hughes, Glenn ''Imagism & The Imagists'', Stanford University Press, 1931 {{OCLC|3267558}}</ref>

H.D. became pregnant in August 1914, and in 1915 Aldington and [[H.D.]] relocated from their home in [[Holland Park]] near Ezra Pound to [[Hampstead]] close to [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Frieda von Richthofen|Frieda]].<ref>According to Lawrence biographer [[Frances Wilson (writer)|Frances Wilson]], Aldington and H.D. are portrayed by Lawrence in ''[[Aaron's Rod]]'': "Aldington is Robert Cunningham, 'a fresh, stoutish young Englishman in khaki', H.D. is his wife Julia, 'a tall stag of a thing ... hunched up like a witch.'" Wilson, Frances, ''Burning Man: The Trials of D.H. Lawrence'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021, p. 138. {{ISBN|9780374282257}}.</ref> They felt calmer out of the bustle of the city, with more space and green. The pregnancy ended in a stillborn daughter, which traumatised the couple and put a great strain on the relationship; H.D. was 28 and Aldington 22. The outbreak of war in 1914 deeply disturbed Aldington, though no draft was in place at this time. H.D. felt more distant from the melee, not having a close affinity to the European landscape, geographical or political. This rift also put pressure on the marriage. Unhappy, Aldington dreamed of escape to America and began to have affairs.<ref Name=Zilboorg/><ref>Doyle, Charles (2016) ''Richard Aldington: A Biography'', Springer, pp. 49–52.</ref>He began a relationship with Florence Fallas, who had also lost a child.<ref Name=LRB/>

Between 1914 and 1916 Aldington was literary editor and a columnist at ''The Egoist''.<ref>[[Hugh Kenner]], ''The Pound Era'' (1971), p. 279.</ref> He was assistant editor with Leonard Compton-Rickett under [[Dora Marsden]].<ref>Robert H. Ross, ''The Georgian Revolt'' (1967), p. 69.</ref> Aldington knew [[Wyndham Lewis]] well and reviewed his work in ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]''. He was also an associate of [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s, helping him with a propaganda volume for a government commission in 1914<ref>''When Blood is Their Argument: An Analysis of Prussian Culture''.</ref> and taking dictation for ''[[The Good Soldier]]''.

==First World War and aftermath==
Aldington joined up in June 1916 and was sent for training at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in Dorset. H.D. moved to be closer to her husband. He then was sent to a camp near Manchester. They found the duality of their lives harsh, and the gruelling, regimented nature of the training felt hard for the sensitive professional poet. He felt fundamentally different from the other men, more given to intellectual pursuits than unending physical labour that left him little time to write. Their sporadic meetings were emotionally wrenching and the couple could make no plans for their future together. He encouraged H.D. to return to America where she could make a safer and more stable home. They both watched news come in of heavy troop losses in France at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and on other battlefields. She could not have information given on her husband's future postings overseas, all held to be secret. Rationing and the forced draft began as the war turned against the British.<ref Name=Zilboorg/>

When Aldington was sent to the front in December 1916, the couple's relationship became epistolary. He wrote that he'd managed to complete 12 poems and three essays since joining up and wanted to work on producing a new book, in order to keep his mind on literature, despite his work of digging graves. He found the soldier's life degrading, living with [[Body louse|lice]], cold, mud and little sanitation. His encounters with [[Chlorine gas poisoning|gas]] on the front would affect him for the rest of his life. He was given leave in July 1917 and the couple enjoyed a reunion during this brief reprieve. He felt distant from old Imagist friends like Pound who had not undergone the tortuous life of the soldiers on the front and could not imagine the living conditions.<ref Name=Zilboorg/>

Aldington joined up in the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|11th Leicestershires]] and was later [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] (November 1917).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30436 |date=18 December 1917 |page=13311|supp=y}}</ref> He finished the war as a signals officer and temporary captain, being demobilised in February 1919.<ref Name=War/>He may never have completely recovered from the [[World War I|war]], writing of his own field experiences in the collections ''Images of War'' and ''Images of Desire'' (1919), which were suffused with a new melancholy. He ended the war feeling disconsolate about his own talent as a poet.<ref Name=PF/> ''Exile and Other Poems'' (1923) also dealt with the process of trauma. A collection of war stories ''Roads to Glory'', appeared in 1930. After this point he became known as a critic and biographer.<ref Name=War/>

Towards the end of the war H.D. lived with composer [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]], a friend of D. H. Lawrence's. They had a daughter together in March 1919, the pregnancy much complicated by H.D.'s catching pneumonia towards the end. Neither Gray nor Aldington wanted to accept paternity. By the time of Aldington's return H.D. was involved with the female writer [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]]. H.D. and Aldington formally separated and had relationships with other people, but they didn't divorce until 1938. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. He destroyed all the couple's pre-1918 correspondence.<ref>Vivien Whelpton (2014) ''Richard Aldington: Poet, Soldier and Lover 1911–1929'', p. 18.</ref>

Aldington helped [[T. S. Eliot]] by persuading [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] to appoint Eliot as Aldington's successor at ''The Egoist'' magazine. In 1919 he introduced Eliot to the editor [[Bruce Lyttelton Richmond|Bruce Richmond]] of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.<ref name="Carole Seymour-Jones 2001 p. 173">Carole Seymour-Jones, ''Painted Shadow'' (2001), p. 173.</ref><ref>[[Lyndall Gordon]], ''Eliot's New Life'' (1988), p. 231.</ref> Aldington was on the editorial board of [[Diwan Chaman Lall|Chaman Lall]]'s London literary quarterly ''Coterie'' (published 1919–1921), accompanied by [[Conrad Aiken]], Eliot, Lewis and [[Aldous Huxley]].<ref>Nicholas Murray, ''Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual'' (2002), p. 103</ref> Eliot had a job in the international department of [[Lloyds Bank]] and well-meaning friends wanted him full-time writing poetry. Ezra Pound, plotting a scheme to "get Eliot out of the bank", was supported by [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], [[Leonard Woolf]] and Harry Norton<ref>Carole Seymour-Jones, ''Painted Shadow'' (2001), pp. 342–6.</ref> Aldington began publishing in journals such as the Imagist ''The Chapbook''. In reply to Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'', Aldington wrote ''A Fool i' the Forest'' (1924).

==Exile==
Aldington went into self-imposed exile in 1928.<ref>[[Jonathan Bate]], Chris Baldick, ''The Oxford English Literary History: Volume 10: The Modern Movement (1910–1940)'' (2002), p. 43.</ref> He lived in Paris for years, living with Brigit Patmore and fascinated by [[Nancy Cunard]], whom he met in 1928. Following his divorce in 1938 he married Netta, née McCullough, previously Brigit's daughter-in-law.

''[[Death of a Hero]]'' (1929), which Aldington called a "jazz novel," was his semi-autobiographical response to the war. He started writing it almost immediately after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] was declared. The novel condemned Victorian materialism as a cause of the tragedy and waste of the war.<ref Name=Doyle/> Rejectionist, an "Expressionist scream",<ref Name=Hero/> it was commended by [[Lawrence Durrell]] as "the best war novel of the epoch". It was developed mostly while Aldington was living on the island of [[Port-Cros]] in Provence, building on the manuscript from a decade before. Opening with a letter to the playwright Halcott Glover, the book takes a satirical, cynical, and critical stance on Victorian and Edwardian [[Hypocrisy|cant]].<ref>Michael Copp (editor), ''An Imagist at War: The Complete War Poems of Richard Aldington'' (2002), p. 18.</ref> Published in September 1929, by Christmas it had sold more than 10,000 copies in England alone, part of a wave of war remembrances from writers such as [[Erich Maria Remarque|Remarque]], [[Siegfried Sassoon|Sassoon]], and [[Hemingway]]. The book was quickly translated into German and other European languages. In Russia the book was taken to be a wholesale attack on bourgeois politics, "the inevitable result of the life which had preceded it", as Aldington wrote. "The next one will be much worse". It was praised by [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] as revolutionary, and the book, along with Aldington's later fiction, received huge Russian distribution. Aldington was, however, fiercely non-partisan in his politics, despite his passion for iconoclasm and feminism.<ref Name=Hero>Richard Aldington (1998) ''Death of a Hero'', Dundurn Press, p. xi.</ref>

The character of George Winterbourne is loosely based on Aldington as an artist (Winterbourne a painter rather than writer), having a mistress before and through the war, and the novel portrays locations strongly resembling those he had travelled to. One of these locations, fictionally named "The Chateau de Fressin," strongly resembled a castle he wrote about in a letter to H.D.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zilboorg|first=Caroline|date=Winter 1988|title=Richard Aldington in Transition: His Pieces for The Sphere in 1919|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=34|pages=489–506|doi=10.2307/441889|jstor=441889}}</ref>

''Death of a Hero'', like many other novels published around this time about the war, suffered greatly from censorship. Instead of changing or cutting parts of his novel, he replaced objectionable words with asterisks. Although they looked awkward on the page, Aldington, among others, wanted to call attention to censoring by publishers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willis Jr.|first=J. H.|date=Winter 1999|title=The Censored Language of War: Richard Aldington's ''Death of a Hero'' and Three Other Novels of 1929|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=45|pages=467–487|doi=10.2307/441948|jstor=441948}}</ref>

In 1930 Aldington published a translation of ''[[The Decameron]]'' and then the romance ''All Men are Enemies'' (1933). In 1942, having relocated to the United States with his new wife Netta, he began to write biographies, starting with [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]: ''The Duke: Being an Account of the Life & Achievements of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington'' (1943). It was followed by works on [[D. H. Lawrence]]: ''Portrait of a Genius, But ...'' (1950), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]: ''Portrait of a Rebel'' (1957), and [[T. E. Lawrence]]:''Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry'' (1955). Under financial pressure, he also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter.

Aldington's biography of T. E. Lawrence caused a scandal on its publication in 1955 and an immediate backlash.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/te-lawrence-action-man-317983.html ''Independent'' Sunday 9 October 2005]</ref> In the spirit of iconoclasm, he was the first to bring public notice to Lawrence's illegitimacy and asserted that Lawrence was homosexual. He attacked the popular hero as a liar, a charlatan and an "impudent mythomaniac",<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', 6th Edition. Edited by [[Margaret Drabble]], Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 16</ref> claims that have coloured Lawrence's reputation ever since. Only later were confidential government files concerning Lawrence's career released, allowing the accuracy of Lawrence's own account to be gauged. Aldington's own reputation never fully recovered from what came to be seen as a venomous attack upon Lawrence's reputation. Many believed that Aldington's suffering in the bloodbath of Europe during the First World War caused him to resent Lawrence's reputation, gained in the Middle Eastern theatre. [[Robert Graves]] noted in a review of the book, "instead of a carefully considered portrait of Lawrence, I find the self-portrait of a bitter, bedridden, leering, asthmatic, elderly hangman-of-letters."<ref Name=PF/>

==Last years==
Aldington lived in [[Sury-en-Vaux]], [[Cher (department)|Cher, France]], from 1958.<ref>Gates, N.T. (ed.), 1992. ''Richard Aldington: An Autobiography in Letters.'' The University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> His last significant book was a biography of the Provençal poet and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Frédéric Mistral]] (1956).<ref Name=Doyle/>

Aldington died in [[Sury]] on 27 July 1962, shortly after being honoured in Moscow on the occasion of his seventieth birthday and the publication of some of his novels in Russian translation. He was fêted in the USSR, "even if some of the fêting was probably because he had, in his writings, sometimes suggested that the England he loved could, in certain of its aspects, be less than an earthly paradise."<ref>Thomas MacGreevy, untitled essay in ''Richard Aldington: An Intimate Portrait'' (Kershaw, Alister and Temple, Frédéric-Jacques, eds., 1965), pp. 52-64, quotation at p. 63.</ref>   He is buried in the local cemetery in Sury. He left one daughter, Catherine, the child of his second marriage; she died in 2010.<ref Name=War/>

==Legacy==
On 11 November 1985 Aldington was among 16 [[Great War]] poets commemorated in stone at [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poet's Corner]]. The inscription on the stone is a quotation from the work of a fellow Great War poet, [[Wilfred Owen]]. It reads: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."<ref>[https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/poets-of-the-first-world-war Westminster Abbey commemoration]</ref>

==Style and bitterness==
[[Alec Waugh]] described Aldington as having been embittered by the war, but took it that he worked off his spleen in novels like ''The Colonel's Daughter'' (1931) rather than letting it poison his life.<ref>[[Alec Waugh]], ''The Early Years'' (1962), p. 182 and p. 193.</ref> [[Douglas Bush]] describes his work as "a career of disillusioned bitterness."<ref Name=PF/> His novels contained thinly veiled portraits of some of his friends, including Eliot, Lawrence and Pound; the friendship not always surviving. [[Lyndall Gordon]] characterises the sketch of Eliot in Aldington's memoirs ''[[Life for Life's Sake]]'' (1941) as "snide."<ref>[[Lyndall Gordon]], ''Eliot's Early Years'' (1977), p. 167. Aldington's discussion of Eliot is on pages 217-221 of ''Life for Life's Sake''.</ref> As a young man, he was cutting about [[Yeats]], but they remained on good terms.

Aldington's obituary in ''The Times'' of London in 1962 described him as "[a]n [[Angry young men|angry young man]] of the generation before they became fashionable ... who remained something of an angry old man to the end".<ref>Jones, Peter, ''Imagist Poetry'', Penguin Books, London 1972 {{ISBN|0-14-042147-5}}</ref>
