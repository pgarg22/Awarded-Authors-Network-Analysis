'''Frances Browne'''  (16 January 1816 – 21 August 1879) was an Irish poet and novelist, best remembered for her collection of short stories for children, ''Granny's Wonderful Chair''.

==Early life==
She was born at [[Stranorlar]], in [[County Donegal]], Ireland, the seventh child in a family of twelve children. She was blind as a consequence of an attack of smallpox when she was 18 months old. In her writings, she recounts how she learned by heart the lessons which her brothers and sisters said aloud every evening, and how she bribed them to read to her by doing their chores. She then worked hard at memorising all that she had heard.

She composed her first poem, a version of "The [[Lord's Prayer]]", when she was seven years of age.<ref name=stran>[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=browne&book=chair&story=_preface Biography of Frances Brown, from the Preface to ''Granny's Wonderful Chair'']</ref>

==First publications==
In 1841, Browne's first poems were published in the ''Irish Penny Journal'' and in the ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)| ''London Athenaeum'']]''. One included in the ''Irish Penny Journal'' was the lyric "Songs of Our Land", which can be found in anthologies of Irish patriotic verse.<ref>Pádraig Breathnach: Songs of the Gael. Dublin 1922. p. 5.</ref> She published a complete volume of poems in 1844 and a second volume in 1847. The provincial newspapers, especially the Belfast-based ''Northern Whig'', reprinted many, and she became widely known as 'The Blind Poetess of Ulster'.

In 1845 she made her first contribution to the popular magazine ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'', for which she wrote for the next 25 years. The first story of hers published there, in March 1845, was "The Lost New Year's Gift", which tells of a poor dressmaker in London and exemplifies her story-telling abilities.<ref name=stran/>

She also contributed short stories to magazines with a largely female readership, for example, a number in the 1850s to the ''Ladies' Companion'', a magazine read by many well-to-do women of the Victorian era. Stories she contributed there included the amusing "Mrs Sloper's Swan" and an eerie tale set in [[County Fermanagh]], called "The Botheration of Ballymore".

==Emigration to Edinburgh==
In 1847, she left Donegal for [[Edinburgh]] with one of her sisters as her reader and [[amanuensis]]. She quickly established herself in literary circles, and wrote essays, reviews, stories, and poems, in spite of health problems. In 1852, she moved to London, where she wrote her first novel, ''My Share of the World'' (1861). Her best known work, ''Granny's Wonderful Chair'', was published in 1856, remains in print to this day, and has been translated into several languages. It is a richly imaginative collection of fairy stories. It was also in 1856 that her third volume of poetry appeared – ''Pictures and Songs of Home''. This was directed at very young children and contains beautiful illustrations. The poems focus on her childhood experiences in County Donegal and provide evocative descriptions of its countryside.<ref name=stran/>

==London and later life==
After her move to London, Browne wrote frequently for the [[Religious Tract Society]]'s periodicals ''[[The Leisure Hour]]'' and ''[[The Sunday at Home]]''. One of those in ''The Leisure Hour'' was "1776: a tale of the American War of Independence", which appeared on the centenary of that event in 1876. As well as describing some of the revolutionary events, it is a love story and beautifully illustrated.<ref name=stran/> Her last piece of writing was a poem called "The Children's Day", which appeared in ''The Sunday at Home'' in 1879.

Frances Browne died on 21 August 1879 at 19 St John's Grove, [[Richmond upon Thames]]. She was buried in [[Richmond Cemetery]] on 25 August 1879.

There is an analysis of some of her short stories in the 2008 ''Donegal Annual'': "Frances Browne and the Legends of Ulster" by Raymond Blair. Blair also edited an anthology of her poems, short stories and essays: ''The Best of Frances Browne'' (Limavady: Rathmore Books, c. 2012).

Browne's career is treated by Paul Marchbanks in ''Irish Women Writers: An A-to-Z Guide'', edited by Alexander G. Gonzalez (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood; Oxford: Harcourt Education, 2006).

Thomas McLean examines her longest poem, "The Star of Attéghéi", and its relationship to the war in [[Circassia]] in a 2012 monograph, ''The Other East and Nineteenth-Century British Literature''.<ref>{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Thomas |year=2012 |title=The Other East and Nineteenth-Century British Literature: Imagining Poland and the Russian Empire |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |ISBN=978-0-230-29400-4}}</ref>
