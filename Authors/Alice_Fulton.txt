'''Alice Fulton''' (born 1952) is an [[United States|American]] author of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. Fulton is the Ann S. Bowers Professor of English Emerita at [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.cornell.edu/alice-fulton|title = Alice Fulton &#124; Department of Literatures in English Cornell Arts & Sciences}}</ref> Her awards include the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] Award in Literature, [[Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry|Library of Congress Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Award]], and [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]] Award, as well as the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]].

== Biography ==
Fulton was born and raised in [[Troy, New York]], the youngest of three daughters. Her father was the proprietor of the historic Phoenix Hotel, and her mother was a visiting nurse. She began writing poetry in high school. In 1979 she attended a women's poetry conference in [[Amherst, Mass.]], which she would later cite as a formative experience. While an undergraduate, she received competitive scholarships to study poetry with [[Thomas Lux]] at The Writers Community in New York City.<ref name="Fanelli">{{cite news

}}</ref> In 1980 she married Hank De Leo and moved to Ithaca, New York, to study poetry under [[A. R. Ammons]], Phyllis Janowitz, Kenneth McClane, and [[Robert Morgan (poet)|Robert Morgan]] in Cornell University's Creative Writing Program. While at Cornell, her first book was selected by [[W. D. Snodgrass]] for the Associated Writing Program's publication prize. After receiving her MFA, she was a fellow at [[Fine Arts Work Center|The Fine Arts Work Center]] in Provincetown. In 1983 Fulton moved to the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for a three-year appointment as Fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows.<ref name="MichSocFellows">[http://societyoffellows.umich.edu/alumni-fellows/ Michigan Society of Fellows]</ref> [[Mark Strand]] selected Fulton's second book, ''Palladium'', for publication in the 1985 National Poetry Series. In the interdisciplinary Society of Fellows she further developed her interest in using [[scientific metaphor]] and began her lifelong friendship with [[John H. Holland]]. She has often cited Holland's writing on [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive Systems]] as being instrumental in the development of her theory on Fractal Poetics [see Fulton's prose collection]. It was also where she met the composers [[William Bolcom]] and [[Enid Sutherland]]. In 1991 Fulton was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "Genius Grant" Fellowship]].

In addition to poetry, Fulton has written essays and criticism and has been widely praised for her finely crafted and emotionally powerful short fiction. ''The Nightingales of Troy'' collects the ten stories she had published before 2008. Two of those stories were selected for inclusion in ''The Best American Short Stories''. Three contemporary authors share the distinction of appearing in both ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' and ''[[The Best American Poetry]]'' series: Alice Fulton, [[Lydia Davis]], and [[Stuart Dybek]].

Alice Fulton was a senior fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows from 1996 to 2000.<ref name="MichSocFellows" /> She remained at [[University of Michigan]] until 2002, when she returned to Ithaca as the Ann S. Bowers Distinguished Professor of English at Cornell University. In 2011 she received an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature. The Library of Congress awarded Fulton the [[Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry|Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt Award]] in 2002. In 2004 she was the Holloway Lecturer in the Practice of Poetry at University of California, Berkeley, and in 2010 she was the [[George Elliston]] Poet at [[University of Cincinnati]]. She has also been a visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and a number of other universities.

In practice, Fulton has created a poetic style that is remarkably "about things" in the sense that her poems explore their overt subject matter deeply and uphold their convictions with rigor. ''Cascade Experiment'' ... amply demonstrates not only Fulton's broad range of interests but also her continual and evolving sense of how to use the most seemingly insignificant details to illuminate the nuances of difficult moral ideas."

Alice Fulton has suggested that poetry is a "model of the way the world works."

One senses there is something startling about to be revealed in these poems, and indeed that mystery or tension often resolves in powerful acts of linguistic reckoning, as if a piece of psychological origami were unfolding before our eyes."<ref>{{cite news

In his introduction to Fulton's first book, ''Dance Script With Electric Ballerina'', W. D. Snodgrass reads Fulton's poetry as a rare example of ''logopoeia'' ("the dance of the intellect among words") and writes that "we are always engaged by ... the sense of linguistic virtuosity ... a constant delight ... in language textures, the every-shifting shock and jolt of an electric surface."<ref>{{cite news

Her second collection consolidated the "polyphonic textures," shifts in diction, and signature enjambments that have become hallmarks of her poetry. ''Palladium'' is structured in six parts, each focused on the etymology of "palladium" with the trope carried to Ellen Foscue Johnson's palladium photographic print on the cover. One review explained the organizing structure this way: "Etymology breeds metaphor; palladium generates the imagery and energy of the poems, informing them all without necessarily intruding upon them. The organizing principle of an Alice Fulton poem allows for cohesiveness yet is not so narrow or restrictive as to inhibit the flow of associations and ideas. It's as though the world itself were endowed with a centrifugal force, enabling the poet to branch out in numerous directions — parallel lines that manage to intersect on their separate paths to infinity."<ref>{{cite news

''Sensual Math'' introduced Fulton's invention of the double-equal or bride sign (see Poetics below).

Donald Riggs writes helpfully about Fulton's translation from the Latin and concludes, "It is within this larger and deeper context that Ovid's tale of Daphne and Apollo takes on, in Fulton's version, an expanded significance: that of the suppression of women's power by the Indo-Aryan patriarchal culture."

Writing about ''Felt'' in ''The New York Times Book Review,'' Megan Harlan also commented on how Fulton's poems are "aurally rich with slant rhymes and musical rhythms." The wordplay present in Fulton's earliest poems has by now become thoroughly suffused:

<blockquote>In Alice Fulton's poetry, those charged instances when the literal and the metaphysical (and the sensual and the philosophical) overlap are often mediated by wordplay — a pun, a double entendre, a witty turn of phrase. The title of her marvelous fifth collection, ''Felt,'' is meant to signify both an emotion once experienced [and] the fabric constructed by fibers that are forcibly pressed, rather than woven, together.<ref>{{cite magazine

Jackson's film, ''[[The Greatest Silence]],'' for the 2008 "Revolution" writers conference and film festival at University of North Dakota, Fulton had this to say about her poetics:

<blockquote>As a poet and writer, I'm committed to undermining postures of arrogance and entitlement, the context of "impunity" [depicted in ''The Greatest Silence'']. Silence — especially enforced silence – has been one of my deep subjects, as has resistance, a quality as important to poetics as to revolutions. I've tried to engage with the background rather than the figure, to find new linguistic ways of confronting disenfranchisement, cruelty, and suffering, while retaining the uncanny qualities of poetry. I've tried to be a student of inconvenient knowledge — the sort of knowledge that, when taken to heart, forces us to change our lives in revolutionary ways.<ref>{{cite news

Susan Duhig in the ''Chicago Tribune'' noted that "For Fulton, the fractal serves as a potent metaphor for a poetry with a form that exists somewhere between utter shapelessness and the Euclidean order of regular meter and genre, a poetry whose volatile, irregular patterning exists on the threshold of structure." Duhig concluded that Fulton's essays explicate "one possible language for understanding poetry in the age of quantum mechanics."<ref>{{cite news

Fulton elaborated on her conceptualization of fractal verse in her 1996 essay, "Fractal Amplifications: Writing in Three Dimensions," in which she posits a "poem plane," a concept analogous to the picture plane in painting. She suggests that "By juxtaposing transparent with textured passages, fractal poetry constructs a linguistic screen that alternately dissolves and clouds." This later fractal essay shows evidence of her conversations with Holland on the subject of complexity.<ref>{{cite news

Holland]]'s work in complexity theory "greatly affected my poetics in the nineties."<ref name="Fanelli" /> A full description of Fractal Verse is beyond the scope of this article; both of the seminal essays are reprinted in Fulton's prose collection. A third essay titled "Fractal Poetics: Adaptation and Complexity" was published in 2005 in ''[[Interdisciplinary Science Reviews]]'' (UK) with this summary:

{{quote|In the 1980s, American poets argued over the validity of free verse. One vocal faction claimed that vers libre was formless and lacking in the devices of poetry. In this context I elaborated a poetics I called 'fractal poetry'. Over the last twenty years this poetics has evolved through engagement with complexity studies that provide ways of understanding irregular, chaotic or turbulent systems. The writings of John H. Holland offer examples of open, exploratory and inclusive complex adaptive systems that lack a centre, hierarchy or equilibrium. These dynamic examples may be analogous to a sublime poetry with an ongoing plurality of optimum states located among a multiplicity of textures and gestures. This departure from the traditional 'transcendent lyric ultimate' suggests a maximalist approach giving equal weight to figure and ground, form and content. Physicist Karen Barad's conceptualisation of 'agential realism' provides added dimension to fractal poetics by offering a model for locating meaning in the space between traditional dualisms.<ref>{{cite news

Barbara Fischer's analysis of Fulton's ekphrastic poem "Close" in ''Felt'' explains this maximalist approach:

<blockquote>Fulton's mixture of media is edgy and experimental — "This is not an illustration." She stands close enough to her subjects to see that art, visual or verbal, is adulterated by evidence of the processes that have made it. The museum-goer notes that "In person, [the painting] looked a little dirty. / I could see the artist's hairs / in the pigment—traces of her / head or dog or brush." She sees "gooey gobs of / process painted in," and notes Mitchell's knifework, which has "left some gesso showing through, / a home for lessness that— / ... / is a form of excess." This paradoxical excess of absence describes a characteristic feature in Fulton's work, here and in earlier books — a lavish and roiling expenditure of imagery and wordplay that draws attention to the means by which any representational illusion of plenitude is sustained. Critics have emphasized the "excesses" of Fulton's vivacious artifice, digressiveness, and heterogeneous diction (I would agree with those who do not consider such "excess" pejorative), and ''Felt'' ... powerfully investigates the emotional stakes of this "form of excess" as a poetics.

Reviewing ''Powers Of Congress'' in 1991, [[Eavan Boland]] was the first to liken Fulton to [[Emily Dickinson]].<ref name="Boland"/> With the 1995 publication of ''Sensual Math,'' [[Publishers Weekly]] suggested "[Fulton] may be Dickinson's postmodern heir."<ref>{{cite magazine
 | title = Sensual Math
 | magazine = Publishers Weekly
 | page = 97
 | date = Feb 27, 1995
}}</ref> Critic and Dickinson scholar [[Cristanne Miller]] further expounded on similarities between Dickinson and Fulton: "Like Dickinson, Fulton crosses the boundaries of popular and highly experimental genres of poetry writing ... Even in long poems and sequences of poems, Fulton's verse has the tight constructedness and multiple layered qualities of Dickinson's poetry ... Fulton shares Dickinson's outrageous sense of play with both cultural icons and aspects of English normally taken for granted."<ref name="Miller 1996">{{cite news

}}</ref> and was the first critic to note similarities in punctuation.

<blockquote>Where Dickinson makes the dash key to the rhythms and expression of her poetry, Fulton introduces a new sign of punctuation that she calls 'a bride / after the recessive threads in lace' [= =]. This double-equal sign, which 'might mean immersion,' is 'the unconsidered // mortar' between bricks; it makes 'visible the acoustic signals / of things about to flame,' 'hinging one phrase to the next,' throwing the reader into the same kind of adventurous uncertainty as Dickinson's dash.</blockquote>

Miller goes on to say, "For both poets, this interest in hinges, in connections, in incongruities and contiguities reveals itself in verbal and syntactical structures as well as in themes. In short, while these are poets of big ideas, they also are very much poets of language ... Like Dickinson, Fulton makes us see the pomposity, ridiculousness, and fragility of our beliefs, hopes, and attitudes as well as the sometimes terrible wonder of human interaction and the universe beyond ourselves."<ref name="Miller 1996" /> In addition to Dickinson's influence, [[Mark Jarman]] and Cristanne Miller have noted the influence of [[Marianne Moore]]. [[Rita Dove]] has written that "Nabokov is one of Alice Fulton's literary mentors: The sheer delight in language's subterfuges, the knotty avenues of recollections and desire, the human need for 'significance' that forms narratives even where there are none — these themes are the very bone and gristle of Fulton's prodigal, energetic poetry."<ref name="Dove X12"/>

Many critics have commented on Fulton's command of [[scientific metaphor]]. Marti-Subirana asserted that "Alice Fulton's poetry stands as one of the most representative examples of intellectual exchange between contemporary experimental poetics and modern science — as represented by quantum physics, chaos theory and complexity theory." Marti-Subirana has elaborated on Fulton's use of "Complexity theory and Darwinism‚" and has identified a dimension of Fulton's work that she calls "Fulton's ''poetry of emergence.''" "This dimension examines individual and collective emotions (such as detachment and compassion), and behavioral patterns (such as cruelty) from the perspective of emergence and emergent patterns."<ref name="Marti-Subirana" /> "Emergence‚" is a central tenet of [[John H. Holland]]'s description of [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive Systems]].

Harvard mathematician [[Barry Mazur]] has written about Fulton's poetics and its relation to the "science of connections bridging differences." Mazur claims that Fulton engages with mathematics as the "science of the subtle glues ... that bind different ideas together, and yet keep them distinguished." He noted that "The very connectors themselves come out into the open in the poem entitled '= =.' "<ref>{{cite news

''Sensual Math'' contains a number of poems that deploy and define her "bride sign." As with all of Fulton's books, including her fiction and nonfiction prose, ''Sensual Math'' is a carefully constructed web of interrelated parts that form an organic whole. One critic predicted that "''Sensual Math'' might well come to be seen as one of the most significant volumes of the 1990s."<ref>{{cite news

Writing about the double-equal sign, Lynn Keller commented,

<blockquote>Her inventive work, which stretches the linguistic, tonal, vocal, and emotional range of contemporary lyric, points ultimately to resources that lie between recognized categories, in liminal states, and at the cultural margins as offering hope for significant social and aesthetic change. Her double equal sign and other rejections of patriarchal binaries aim ... to counter the destructive othering that pervades all aspects of our lives ...<ref>{{cite news

Physicist [[Karen Barad]]'s book, ''Meeting the Universe Halfway,'' takes its title from Alice Fulton's poem "Cascade Experiment," first published in 1989. Gabriel Mckee, comments that the poem "contains this compelling passage:

{{poemquote|
Because truths we don't suspect have a hard time
making themselves felt, as when thirteen species
of whiptail lizards composed entirely of females
stay undiscovered due to bias
against such things existing,
we have to meet the universe halfway.
Nothing will unfold for us unless we move toward what
looks to us like nothing: faith is a cascade.}}

"The poem is a wonderful combination of science and faith, and finds mystery in empiricism." Mckee continues, saying that the poem reminds him "of the 14th-century mystical text [[The Cloud of Unknowing]], the title of which offers perhaps the most famous illustration of [[apophatic theology]] ... Fulton's poem makes an eloquent and moving case for science that seeks the unknowable, the unbelievable, and the impossible."<ref>{{cite news

Fulton's formal inventions invariably employ "form" in the service of content. She has stated that "During the act of writing, technique and meaning are inextricably linked, and it is only for the convenience of critical discussion that one could wish to separate them. The realization that craft depends on content leads to the concept of organic form and the idea that whatever elements help us experience a poem as a whole can be called its form."<ref>{{cite news

Throughout her career, Fulton has juxtaposed references to popular culture with allusions to literary and high culture. Ernest Smith has argued that a "significant theme in Fulton's work is the relationship among the individual, imagination, and culture, both historically constructed aspects of culture and contemporary, popular culture." Smith also comments on Fulton's "polyphonic texture" as "a sense of multiplying resonance akin to the use of counterpoint in music."<ref>{{cite news
