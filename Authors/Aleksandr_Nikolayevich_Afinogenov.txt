== Biography ==
Alexander was born in the town of Skopin, in [[Ryazan Oblast]]. He joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] in 1922. He obtained a degree in journalism in 1924, the year that he published his first play. In the 1920s he was a member and later director of the [[Proletkult]]'s theatre. He turned away from the Proletkult in the late 1920s, and became in the early 1930s the chief drama theoretician of the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. He wrote 26 plays, but he is best known for ''Fear'' (1931) and ''Mashenka'' (1941). His work was attacked in 1936 and he was expelled from the CPSU in 1937, but he was never [[Great Purge|purged]], and was rehabilitated in 1938. He continued writing until his death in a German air raid in 1941.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Soviet Union: A Biographical Dictionary |last=Brown |first=Archie |year=1991 |publisher=Macmillan |location=NY |isbn=0-02-897071-3 |page=3}}</ref> He was married with American ballerina Jenny Marling (Schwartz).
