Having taught adult students wanting to return to education when her children where young, she later decided to use her teaching skills to work with marginalised communities, including recovering addicts, mental health service users, gypsies and, in Labrador, aboriginal peoples. She taught and mentored creative writing and performance, focusing on developing skills and self-esteem, and, always, the writer's own original voice. In 2018 she founded The Outsiders Project a company giving voice to the unheard.

== The Outsiders Project ==
In 2018 Leyshon founded The Outsiders Project, a company that gives voice to the unheard and marginalised through working with outsider artists and supporting their creativity. They work with members of the community of Boscombe, and the work is shown locally then shared with a wider world. The work is designed to develop authentic voices and is of exceptional quality.

Their vision is to show that people sidelined from society can write, perform and create work at the highest level. They support the outsider community to push boundaries to prove they can create work of outstanding quality and worth.

The Outsiders Project has produced three works for the stage; ''Vodka Hunte''rs, ''Secret Voices''  and ''The Truth About Men'', all three as part of BEAF – Bournemouth Emerging Arts Fringe Festival 2018 and 2019.

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic they launched the Tattoo Project<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outsidersproject-tattoo.com/|title=Tattoos|website=Mysite 1|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> an online initiative to gather, tell stories and find new outsider artists.

She has also worked with the Gypsy community, and has led many partnership courses for [[Arvon Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arvon.org/tutors/nell-leyshon/|title=Nell Leyshon|website=Arvon|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>
