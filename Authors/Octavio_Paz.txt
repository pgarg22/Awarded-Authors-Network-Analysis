'''Octavio Paz Lozano'''{{efn|Spanish pronunciation: {{IPA-es|okˈtaβjo pas loˈsano|}}, <small>{{Audio|Octavio Paz.ogg|audio}}</small>.}} (March 31, 1914 – April 19, 1998) was a Mexican poet and diplomat. For his body of work, he was awarded the 1977 [[Jerusalem Prize]], the 1981 [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], the 1982 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], and the 1990 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

==Early life==
Octavio Paz was born near [[Mexico City]]. His family was a prominent political family in Mexico,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2020-06-07|title=Octavio Paz|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/octavio-paz|access-date=2020-06-07|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref> with [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous Mexican]] roots.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|title=About Octavio Paz {{!}} Academy of American Poets|url=https://poets.org/poet/octavio-paz|access-date=2020-06-07|website=poets.org}}</ref> His father had been an assistant to [[Emiliano Zapata]]. The family experienced financial ruin after the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the exile of [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapata supporters]] (known as Zapatistas). The family briefly relocated to Los Angeles before returning to Mexico.<ref name=":1" />

Paz was introduced to literature early in his life through the influence of his grandfather's library, filled with classic [[Mexican literature|Mexican]] and [[Western literature|European literature]].<ref>[[Guillermo Sheridan]]: ''Poeta con paisaje: ensayos sobre la vida de Octavio Paz''. México: ERA, 2004. p. 27. {{ISBN|968411575X}}</ref> During the 1920s, he discovered [[Gerardo Diego]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], and [[Antonio Machado]]. These Spanish writers had a great influence on his early writings.<ref>[[Jaime Perales Contreras]]: "Octavio Paz y el circulo de la revista Vuelta". Ann Arbor, Michigan: Proquest, 2007. pp.46&ndash;47. UMI Number 3256542</ref>

As a teenager in 1931, Paz published his first poems, including "Cabellera". Two years later, at the age of 19, he published ''Luna Silvestre'' ("Wild Moon"), a collection of poems. In 1932, with some friends, he funded his first literary review, ''Barandal''.

For a few years, Paz studied law and literature at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University of Mexico]].<ref name=":0" /> During this time, he became familiar with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] poets, such as [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref name=":1" /> In 1936, Paz abandoned his law studies and left Mexico City for [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to work at a school in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]]. The school was set up for the sons of [[peasant]]s and workers.<ref>Sheridan: ''Poeta con paisaje'', p. 163</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Quiroga|first1=Jose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJOqj6Sm2p8C&q=octavio+paz+merida&pg=PA25|title=Understanding Octavio Paz|last2=Hardin|first2=James|date=1999|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-263-9|language=en}}</ref> There, he began working on the first of his long, ambitious poems, "Entre la piedra y la flor" ("Between the Stone and the Flower") (1941, revised in 1976). Influenced by the work of [[T. S. Eliot]], it explores the situation of the Mexican peasant under the domineering landlords of the day.<ref>{{cite book |title= Octavio Paz |last= Wilson |first= Jason |year= 1986 |publisher= G. K. Hall |location= Boston }}</ref>

In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain, held in [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] and attended by many writers including [[André Malraux]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-141-01161-5 |page=678 |edition=50th Anniversary}}</ref> Paz showed his solidarity with the Republican side and against [[fascism]]. He also visited Paris while in Europe. There, he encountered the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] movement, which left a profound impact upon him.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1994-06-11|title=Octavio Paz Goes Looking for His Old Friend Eros|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/books/octavio-paz-goes-looking-for-his-old-friend-eros.html|access-date=2020-06-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> After his return to Mexico, Paz co-funded a literary journal, ''Taller'' ("Workshop") in 1938, and wrote for the magazine until 1941. In 1937 he married [[Elena Garro]], who is considered one of Mexico's finest writers. They had met in 1935. They had one daughter, Helena, and were divorced in 1959.

In 1943, Paz received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and used it to study at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] in the United States. Two years later he entered the Mexican diplomatic service, and was assigned for a time to New York City. In 1945, he was sent to Paris, where he wrote ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude|El Laberinto de la Soledad]]'' ("The Labyrinth of Solitude"). ''The New York Times'' later described it as "an analysis of modern Mexico and the Mexican personality in which he described his fellow countrymen as instinctive nihilists who hide behind masks of solitude and ceremoniousness."<ref>{{cite news|title=Octavio Paz, Mexican Poet, Wins Nobel Prize|last= Rule|first=Sheila|work=New York Times|location=New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/12/books/octavio-paz-mexican-poet-wins-nobel-prize.html|date=October 12, 1990}}</ref> In 1952, he travelled to India for the first time. That same year, he went to Tokyo, as [[chargé d'affaires]]. He next was assigned to [[Geneva]], Switzerland. He returned to Mexico City in 1954, where he wrote his great poem "Piedra de sol" ("Sunstone") in 1957, and published ''Libertad bajo palabra'' (''Liberty under Oath''), a compilation of his poetry up to that time. He was sent again to Paris in 1959. In 1962, he was named Mexico's ambassador to India.

==Later life==
In [[New Delhi]], as Ambassador of Mexico to [[India]], Paz completed several works, including ''El mono gramático'' (''The Monkey Grammarian'') and ''Ladera este'' (''Eastern Slope''). While in India, he met numerous writers of a group known as the [[Hungry Generation]] and had a profound influence on them.

In 1965, he married Marie-José Tramini, a French woman who would be his wife for the rest of his life. In 1968, he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest of the Mexican government's [[Tlatelolco massacre|massacre of student demonstrators in Tlatelolco]].<ref>Preface to ''The Collected Poems of Octavio Paz: 1957–1987'' by Eliot Weignberger</ref>
That fall in 1965 he went to Cornell and taught two courses, one in Spanish and one in English. The magazine LIFE en Español published a piece about his stay at Cornell in their July 4, 1966 issue. There are several pictures in the article.  After this he returned to Mexico.
After staying in Paris for refuge, he returned to Mexico in 1969. He founded his magazine ''Plural'' (1970–1976) with a group of liberal Mexican and Latin American writers.

From 1969 to 1970 he was [[Simón Bolívar Professor of Latin-American Studies|Simón Bolívar Professor]] at [[Cambridge University]]. He was also a visiting lecturer during the late 1960s and the [[A. D. White]] Professor-at-Large from 1972 to 1974 at [[Cornell University]]. In 1974 he lectured at [[Harvard University]] as [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer]]. His book ''Los hijos del limo'' ("Children of the Mire") was the result of those lectures. After the Mexican government closed ''Plural'' in 1975, Paz founded ''[[Vuelta (magazine)|Vuelta]]'', another cultural magazine. He was editor of that until his death in 1998, when the magazine closed.

He won the 1977 [[Jerusalem Prize]] for literature on the theme of individual freedom. In 1980, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard, and in 1982, he won the [[Neustadt Prize]]. Once good friends with novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]], Paz became estranged from him in the 1980s in a disagreement over the [[Sandinistas]], whom Paz opposed and Fuentes supported.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/books/carlos-fuentes-mexican-novelist-dies-at-83.html |title=Carlos Fuentes, Mexican Man of Letters, Dies at 83 |author=Anthony DePalma |date=May 15, 2012 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 16, 2012}}</ref> In 1988, Paz's magazine ''[[Vuelta (magazine)|Vuelta]]'' published criticism of Fuentes by [[Enrique Krauze]], resulting in estrangement between Paz and Fuentes, who had long been friends.<ref name=WP>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/carlos-fuentes-mexican-novelist-dies-at-83/2012/05/15/gIQAx7dxRU_story.html |title=Carlos Fuentes, Mexican novelist, dies at 83 |author=Marcela Valdes |date=May 16, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=May 16, 2012}}</ref>

A collection of Paz's poems (written between 1957 and 1987) was published in 1990. In 1990, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].<ref name="Nobel Prize Literature 1990">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref>

He died of cancer on April 19, 1998, in Mexico City.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1951-23163-24439-71?cc=1923424&wc=M9W1-L3L:1513580468 |title=Civil Death Registration |author=México, Distrito Federal, Registro Civil |date=20 Apr 1998 |website=FamilySearch.org  |publisher=Genealogical Society of Utah. 2002 |access-date=22 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Arana-Ward |first1=Marie |year=1998 |title=Octavio Paz, Mexico's Great Idea Man  |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/paz.htm |access-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kandell |first1=Jonathan |year=1998 |title=Octavio Paz, Mexico's Man of Letters, Dies at 84  |journal=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/21/books/octavio-paz-mexico-s-man-of-letters-dies-at-84.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |access-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>

[[Guillermo Sheridan]], who was named by Paz as director of the Octavio Paz Foundation in 1998, published a book, ''Poeta con paisaje'' (2004) with several biographical essays about the poet's life up to 1998, when he died.

==Aesthetics==
"The poetry of Octavio Paz", wrote the critic [[Ramón Xirau]], "does not hesitate between language and silence; it leads into the realm of silence where true language lives."<ref>Xirau, Ramón (2004) ''Entre La Poesia y El Conocimiento: Antologia de Ensayos Criticos Sobre Poetas y Poesia Iberoamericanos''. Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Económica p. 219.</ref>

==Writings==
A prolific author and poet, Paz published scores of works during his lifetime, many of which have been translated into other languages. His poetry has been translated into English by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Charles Tomlinson]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Muriel Rukeyser]] and [[Mark Strand]]. His early poetry was influenced by [[Marxism]], [[surrealism]], and [[existentialism]], as well as religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. His poem, "Piedra de sol" ("Sunstone"), written in 1957, was praised as a "magnificent" example of surrealist poetry in the presentation speech of his Nobel Prize.

His later poetry dealt with love and eroticism, the nature of time, and Buddhism. He also wrote poetry about his other passion, modern painting, dedicating poems to the work of [[Balthus]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Roberto Matta]]. As an essayist Paz wrote on topics such as [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican politics]] and [[Economy of Mexico|economics]], [[Pre-Columbian art|Aztec art]], [[anthropology]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. His book-length essay, ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'' (Spanish: ''El laberinto de la soledad''), delves into the minds of his countrymen, describing them as hidden behind masks of solitude. Due to their [[History of Mexico|history]], their identity is lost between a pre-Columbian and a Spanish culture, negating either. A key work in understanding [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]], it greatly influenced other Mexican writers, such as [[Carlos Fuentes]]. Ilan Stavans wrote that he was "the quintessential surveyor, a [[Dante]]'s Virgil, a Renaissance man".<ref>{{cite book

[[File:Paz0.jpg|thumb|upright|Octavio Paz]]
Paz wrote the play ''La hija de Rappaccini'' in 1956. The plot centers around a young Italian student who wanders about Professor Rappaccini's beautiful gardens where he spies the professor's daughter Beatrice. He is horrified to discover the poisonous nature of the garden's beauty. Paz adapted the play from an 1844 short story by American writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], which was also entitled "[[Rappaccini's Daughter]]". He combined Hawthorne's story with sources from the Indian poet [[Vishakadatta]] and influences from Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, Spanish ''[[autos sacramentales]]'', and the poetry of [[William Butler Yeats]]. The play's opening performance was designed by the Mexican painter [[Leonora Carrington]]. In 1972, Surrealist author [[André Pieyre de Mandiargues]] translated the play into French as ''La fille de Rappaccini '' (Editions Mercure de France). First performed in English in 1996 at the [[Gate Theatre]] in London, the play was translated and directed by [[Sebastian Doggart]] and starred [[Sarah Alexander]] as Beatrice. The Mexican composer Daniel Catán adapted the play as an opera in 1992.

Paz's other works translated into English include several volumes of essays, some of the more prominent of which are ''Alternating Current'' (tr. 1973), ''Configurations'' (tr. 1971), in the [[UNESCO Collection of Representative Works]],<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/culture/lit/rep/pop.php?fnc=record&lng=en_GB&record=5821 Configurations], Historical Collection: UNESCO Culture Sector, [[UNESCO]] official website</ref> ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'' (tr. 1963), ''The Other Mexico'' (tr. 1972); and ''El Arco y la Lira'' (1956; tr. ''The Bow and the Lyre'', 1973). In the United States, [[Helen Lane]]'s translation of ''Alternating Current'' won a [[National Book Award]].<ref name=nba1974>

There was a [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Translation|National Book Award category Translation]] from 1967 to 1983.</ref>
Along with these are volumes of critical studies and biographies, including of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] (both, tr. 1970), and ''The Traps of Faith'', an analytical biography of [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]], the Mexican 17th-century nun, [[List of feminist poets|feminist poet]], mathematician, and thinker.

His works include the poetry collections ''¿Águila o sol?'' (1951), ''La Estación Violenta'', (1956), ''Piedra de Sol'' (1957). In English, ''Early Poems: 1935–1955'' (tr. 1974) and ''Collected Poems, 1957–1987'' (1987) have been edited and translated by [[Eliot Weinberger]], who is Paz's principal translator into American English.

==Political thought==
[[File:II_Congreso_internacional_de_escritores_para_la_defensa_de_la_cultura,_1937.jpg|thumb|left|250px|II International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture.]]
Originally Paz supported the Republicans during the [[Spanish Civil War]], but after learning of the murder of one of his friends by the stalinist secret police, he became gradually disillusioned. While in Paris in the early 1950s, influenced by [[David Rousset]], [[André Breton]] and [[Albert Camus]], he started publishing his critical views on totalitarianism in general, and particularly against [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union.

In his magazines ''Plural'' and ''Vuelta'', Paz exposed the [[Human rights|violations of human rights]] in communist regimes, including [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] [[Cuba]]. This brought him much animosity from sectors of the Latin American left. In the prologue to Volume IX of his complete works, Paz stated that from the time when he abandoned communist dogma, the mistrust of many in the Mexican [[intelligentsia]] started to transform into an intense and open enmity. Paz continued to consider himself a man of the left, the democratic, "liberal" left, not the dogmatic and illiberal one. He also criticized the Mexican government and leading party that dominated the nation for most of the 20th century.

Politically, Paz was basically a [[social democracy|social democrat]], who became increasingly supportive of liberal ideas without ever renouncing to his initial leftist and romantic views. In fact, Paz was "very slippery for anyone thinking in rigid ideological categories," Yvon Grenier wrote in his book on Paz's political thought. "Paz was simultaneously a romantic who spurned materialism and reason, a liberal who championed freedom and democracy, a conservative who respected tradition, and a socialist who lamented the withering of fraternity and equality. An advocate of fundamental transformation in the way we see ourselves and modern society, Paz was also a promoter of incremental change, not revolution."<ref>Yvon Grenier, ''From Art to Politics: Octavio Paz and the Pursuit of Freedom'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 1991); Spanish trans. ''Del arte a la política, Octavio Paz y la busquedad de la libertad'' (Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1994).</ref>

In 1990, during the aftermath of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin wall]], Paz and his ''Vuelta'' colleagues invited several of the world's writers and intellectuals to Mexico City to discuss the collapse of communism. Writers included [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], [[Daniel Bell]], [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[Jean-François Revel]], [[Michael Ignatieff]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Jorge Edwards]] and [[Carlos Franqui]]. The encounter was called ''The experience of freedom'' (Spanish: ''La experiencia de la libertad'') and broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letraslibres.com/revista/convivio/memorias-del-encuentro-la-experiencia-de-la-libertad |title=Memorias del encuentro: "La experiencia de la libertad" |author=Christopher Domínguez Michael |date=November 2009 |work=Letras Libres (in Spanish)| access-date=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

Paz criticized the [[Zapatista uprising]] in 1994.<ref>Huffschmid (2004) pp127-151</ref> He spoke broadly in favor of a "military solution" to the uprising of January 1994, and hoped that the "army would soon restore order in the region". With respect to President Zedillo's offensive in February 1995, he signed an open letter that described the offensive as a "legitimate government action" to reestablish the "sovereignty of the nation" and to bring "[[Chiapas]] peace and Mexicans tranquility".<ref>Huffschmid (2004) p145</ref>

=== First literary experiences ===
Paz was dazzled by ''[[The Waste Land]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]], in Enrique Munguia's translation as ''El Páramo'' which was published in the magazine ''Contemporaries'' in 1930. As a result of this, although he maintained his primary interest in poetry, he had an unavoidable outlook on prose: "Literally, this dual practice was for me a game of reflections between poetry and prose".

Worried about confirming the existence of a link between [[morals]] and [[poetry]], in 1931, at the age of 16, he wrote what would be his first published article, "Ethics of the Artist", where he planted the question about the duty of an artist among what would be deemed art of thesis, or pure art, which disqualifies the second as a result of the teaching of tradition. Assimilating a language that resembles a religious style and, paradoxically, a [[Marxism|Marxist]] style, finds the true value of art in its purpose and meaning, for which, the followers of pure art, of which he's not one, are found in an isolated position and favor the [[Kantianism|Kantian]] idea of the "man that loses all relation with the world".<ref>{{Cite book|last= Paz|first= Octavio|title= Primeras letras (1931–1943)|year= 1988|publisher= Vuelta|page= 114}}</ref>

The magazine ''Barandal'' appeared in August 1931, put together by [[Rafael López Malo]], Salvador Toscano, [[Arnulfo Martínez Lavalle]] and Octavio Paz. All of them were not yet in their youth except for Salvador Toscano, who was a renowned writer thanks to his parents. Rafael López participated in the magazine, "Modern" and, as well as [[Miguel D. Martínez Rendón]], in the [[movimiento de los agoristas]], although it was more commented on and known by the high school students, over all for his poem, "''The Golden Beast''". Octavio Paz Solórzano became known in his circle as the occasional author of literary narratives that appeared in the Sunday newspaper add-in [[El Universal (México)|El Universal]], as well as [[Ireneo Paz]] which was the name that gave a street in [[Mixcoac]] identity.
