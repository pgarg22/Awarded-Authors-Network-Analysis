'''Edwin Muir''' (15 May 1887&nbsp;– 3 January 1959) was a Scottish<ref>Edwin Muir, an Autobiography, Canongate Press, Edinburgh 1993, {{ISBN|0-86241-423-7}})</ref> poet, novelist and translator. Born on a farm in [[Deerness]], a parish of [[Orkney]], Scotland, he is remembered for his deeply felt and vivid poetry written in plain language and with few stylistic preoccupations.

==Biography==
Muir was born at the farm of Folly in Deerness, the same parish in which his mother was born. The family then moved to the [[Wyre, Orkney|island of Wyre]], followed by a return to the [[Mainland, Orkney]]. In 1901, when he was 14, his father lost his farm, and the family moved to [[Glasgow]]. In quick succession his father, two brothers, and his mother died within the space of a few years. His life as a young man was a depressing experience, and involved a raft of unpleasant jobs in factories and offices, including working in a factory that turned bones into charcoal.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story and The Fable|first=Edwin|last=Muir|page=132|year=1930|publisher=[[George G. Harrap and Co.|Harrap]]|location=London|isbn=978-0937672228}}</ref> "He suffered psychologically in a most destructive way, although perhaps the poet of later years benefitted from these experiences as much as from his Orkney 'Eden'."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Poetry of the Scots|first=Duncan Munro|last=Glen|page=92|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|date=19 September 1991|isbn=978-0748602971}}</ref>

In 1919, Muir married [[Willa Muir|Willa Anderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/writingscotland/writers/willa_muir/works.shtml|title=Willa Muir|work=[[BBC Scotland]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2021}}</ref> and the couple moved to London. About this, Muir wrote simply 'My marriage was the most fortunate event in my life'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&EventId=830|title=Light from the Orkneys: Edwin Muir and George Mackay Brown|first=Richard|last=Harries|author-link=Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth}}{{dead link|date=October 2021}}</ref> Willa and her new husband worked together on many translations. Notable among them were their translation of works by [[Franz Kafka]]. They had translated [[The Castle (novel)|''The Castle'']] within six years of Kafka's death. Willa was the more able linguist and she was the major contributor. Willa recorded in her journal that "It was ME" and that Edwin "only helped". Between 1924 and the start of the Second World War her (their) translation financed their life together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/3337/willa-anderson-mrs-edwin-muir-1890-1970-writer-and-translator|work=[[National Galleries Scotland]]|title=Willa Anderson, Mrs Edwin Muir, 1890-1970. Writer and translator|author=Nigel McIsaac|access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> He would help her translate highly acclaimed English translations of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Sholem Asch]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[Hermann Broch]].

Between 1921 and 1923, Muir lived in [[Prague]], [[Dresden]], Italy, Salzburg and [[Vienna]]; he returned to the UK in 1924. Between 1925 and 1956, Muir published seven volumes of poetry which were collected after his death and published in 1991 as ''The Complete Poems of Edwin Muir''. From 1927 to 1932 he published three novels, and in 1935 he came to [[St Andrews]], where he produced his controversial ''Scott and Scotland'' (1936). In 1939 in St Andrews, Muir had a religious experience and from then onwards thought of himself as [[Christians|Christian]], seeing Christianity as being as revolutionary as socialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poet/edwin-muir|work=Scottish Poetry Library|title=Edwin Muir 1887 - 1959|access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> From 1946 to 1949 he was Director of the [[British Council]] in Prague and Rome. 1950 saw his appointment as Warden of [[Newbattle Abbey College]] (a college for working-class men) in [[Midlothian]], where he met fellow Orcadian poet, [[George Mackay Brown]]. In 1955 he was made Norton Professor of English at [[Harvard University]]. He returned to Britain in 1956 but died in 1959 at [[Swaffham Prior]], [[Cambridgeshire]], and was buried there.

A [[memorial bench]] was erected in 1962 to Muir in the idyllic village of [[Swanston, Edinburgh|Swanston]], Edinburgh, where he spent time during the 1950s. His wife wrote a memoir of their life together in 1967. She lived for another eleven years and died on the Isle of Bute.

==Work==
His childhood in remote and unspoiled Orkney represented an idyllic [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] to Muir, while his family's move to the city corresponded in his mind to a deeply disturbing encounter with the "fallen" world. Muir came to regard his family's movement from Orkney to Glasgow as a movement from Eden to Hell. The emotional tensions of that dichotomy shaped much of his work and deeply influenced his life. The following quotation expresses the basic existential dilemma of Edwin Muir's life:

<blockquote>"I was born before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and am now about two hundred years old. But I have skipped a hundred and fifty of them. I was really born in 1737, and till I was fourteen no time-accidents happened to me. Then in 1751 I set out from Orkney for Glasgow. When I arrived I found that it was not 1751, but 1901, and that a hundred and fifty years had been burned
 up in my two-days' journey. But I myself was still in 1751, and remained there for a long time. All my life since I have been trying to overhaul that invisible leeway. No wonder I am obsessed with Time."  (Extract from Diary 1937–39.)</blockquote>

His psychological distress led him to undergo [[Jungian analysis]] in London. A vision in which he witnessed the [[Creation myth|creation]] strengthened the Edenic myth in his mind, leading him to see his life and career as the working-out of an [[archetypal]] fable. In his ''Autobiography'' he wrote, "the life of every man is an endlessly repeated performance of the life of man...". He also expressed his feeling that our deeds on Earth constitute "a myth which we act almost without knowing it". Alienation, paradox, the existential dyads of good and evil, life and death, love and hate, and images of journeys and labyrinths are key elements in his work.

His ''Scott and Scotland'' advanced the claim that Scotland can create a national literature only by writing in English, an opinion that placed him in direct opposition to the [[Lallans]] movement of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. He had little sympathy for [[Scottish independence|Scottish nationalism]].

His wife, [[Willa Muir]], translated the works of many German authors, including [[Franz Kafka]]. These were issued under their joint names, but his wife notes that he "only helped".

In 1958, Edwin and Willa were granted the first [[Johann-Heinrich-Voß-Preis für Übersetzung|Johann-Heinrich-Voss Translation Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutscheakademie.de/preise_voss.html|work=Deutsche Akademie|title=JOHANN-HEINRICH-VOSS-PREIS - PREISTRÄGER (the Johann Heinrich Voss Prize - laureates)|language=de|access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> Many of their translations of German novels are still in print.

In 1965 a volume of his selected poetry was edited and introduced by [[T. S. Eliot]].

==Legacy==
In an appreciation of Muir's poetry in ''[[Texas Quarterly]]'', the critic [[Kathleen Raine]] wrote in 1961: "Time does not fade [Muir's poems], and it becomes clear that their excellence owes nothing to the accidental circumstances of the moment at which the poet wrote, or we read, his poems; they survive, as it were, a change of background, and we begin to see that whereas the 'new' movements of this or that decade lose their significance when the scene changes and retain only a historical interest, Edwin Muir, a poet who never followed fashion, has in fact given more permanent expression to his world than other poets who deliberately set out to be the mouth-pieces of their generation."

Similarly Summers, in a retrospective assessment in the ''[[Massachusetts Review]]'', called Muir's achievement in poetry and prose "larger than the merely literary. He did not share in the modern attempts to deify poetry, or language, or even the human imagination. Implicit in all of his works is the recognition that there are things more important than literature—life and love, the physical world, the individual spirit within its body: those things in which the religious man recognizes the immediate work of God. Muir's triumph was less in the technological realm of communication than in the vastly more difficult realm of sensitivity, perception, wisdom, the things which he communicated. It was a triumph made possible only, in the familiar paradox, by humility."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/edwin-muir|work=[[Poetry Foundation]]|title=Edwin Muir 1887–1959|access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>
