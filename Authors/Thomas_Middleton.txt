'''Thomas Middleton''' (baptised 18 April 1580 – July 1627; also spelt ''Midleton'') was an English [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean playwright]] and poet. He, with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and [[Ben Jonson]], was among the most successful and prolific of playwrights at work in the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] period, and among the few to gain equal success in [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. He was also a prolific writer of [[masque]]s and [[medieval pageant|pageants]].

==Life==
Middleton was born in London and baptised on 18 April 1580. He was the son of a bricklayer, who had raised himself to the status of a gentleman and owned property adjoining the [[Curtain Theatre]] in Shoreditch. Middleton was five when his father died and his mother's subsequent remarriage dissolved into a 15-year battle over the inheritance of Thomas and his younger sister – an experience that informed him about the legal system and may have incited his repeated satire against the legal profession.

Middleton attended [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], matriculating in 1598, but he did not graduate. Before he left Oxford sometime in 1600 or 1601,<ref>Mark Eccles, "Thomas Middleton a Poett", ''Studies in Philology'' 54 (1957), p. 525.</ref> he wrote and published three long poems in popular Elizabethan styles. None of them appears to have been especially successful, and one, his book of satires, ran foul of an [[Anglicanism|Anglican church]] ban on verse satire and was burned. Nevertheless, his literary career was launched.

In the early 17th century, Middleton made a living writing topical pamphlets, including one – ''Penniless Parliament of Threadbare Poets'' – that was reprinted several times and became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. At the same time, records in the diary of [[Philip Henslowe]] show that Middleton was writing for the [[Admiral's Men]]. Unlike Shakespeare, Middleton remained a free agent, able to write for whichever company hired him. His early dramatic career was marked by controversy. His friendship with [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] brought him into conflict with [[Ben Jonson]] and [[George Chapman]] in the [[War of the Theatres]]. The grudge against Jonson continued as late as 1626, when Jonson's play ''The Staple of News'' indulges in a slur on Middleton's great success, ''A Game at Chess''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=News |website=Hollowaypages.com |url=http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1692news.htm}}</ref> It has been argued that Middleton's ''Inner Temple Masque'' (1619) sneers at Jonson (then absent in [[Scotland]]) as a "silenced bricklayer".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Limon |first1=Jerzey |year=1994 |title=A Silenc'st Bricklayer |journal=Notes and Queries |volume=41 |page=512|doi=10.1093/nq/41-4-512}}</ref>

In 1603, Middleton married. In the same year an outbreak of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] forced the London theatres to close, while [[James I of England|James I]] came to the English throne. These events marked the beginning of Middleton's greatest period as a playwright. Having passed the time during the plague composing prose pamphlets (including a continuation of [[Thomas Nashe]]'s ''[[Pierce Penniless]]''), he returned to drama with great energy, producing almost a score of plays for several companies and in several genres, notably [[city comedy]] and [[revenge tragedy]]. He continued to collaborate with Dekker: the two produced ''The Roaring Girl'', a biography of the contemporary thief [[Mary Frith]].

In the 1610s, Middleton began a fruitful collaboration with the actor [[William Rowley]], producing ''[[Wit at Several Weapons]]'' and ''[[A Fair Quarrel]]''. Working alone in 1613, Middleton produced a comic masterpiece: ''[[A Chaste Maid in Cheapside]]''. He also became increasingly involved with civic pageants, and in 1620 became officially appointed as chronologist to the [[City of London]], a post he held until his death in 1627, when it passed to Jonson.

Such official duties did not interrupt Middleton's dramatic writing; the 1620s saw the production of his and Rowley's tragedy ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'', and of several tragicomedies. In 1624, he reached a peak of notoriety when his dramatic [[allegory]] ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' was staged by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The play used the [[conceit]] of a chess game to present and satirise the recent intrigues surrounding the [[Spanish Match]]. Though Middleton's approach was strongly patriotic, the [[Privy Council]] silenced the play after nine performances, having received a complaint from the Spanish Ambassador. Middleton faced an unknown, probably frightening degree of punishment. Since no play later than ''A Game at Chess'' is recorded, it has been suggested that the sentence included a ban on writing for the stage.

==Death==
Middleton died at his home at [[Newington Butts]] in [[Southwark]] in 1627, and was buried on 4 July in St Mary's churchyard.<ref>[http://thomasmiddleton.org/finaldecade.php Thomas Middleton: the Final Decade. Accessed 1 February 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525221031/http://thomasmiddleton.org/finaldecade.php |date=25 May 2013}}</ref> The old church of St Mary's was demolished in 1876 for road-widening. Its replacement elsewhere in Kennington Park Road was destroyed in the Second World War, but rebuilt in 1958. The old churchyard where Middleton was buried survives as a public park in [[Elephant and Castle]].

==Works==
Middleton wrote in many genres, including [[tragedy]], [[history play|history]] and [[city comedy]]. His best-known plays are the tragedies ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'' (with [[William Rowley]]) and ''[[Women Beware Women]]'', and the cynically satirical city comedy ''[[A Chaste Maid in Cheapside]]''. Earlier editions of ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'' attributed the play to [[Cyril Tourneur]],<ref>''Three Jacobean Tragedies'' (Penguin, 1968) and the Revels edition (Manchester UP, 1975) stated so on the cover, although the Revels editor makes a case for Middleton inside.</ref> or refused to arbitrate between Middleton and Tourneur.<ref>The [[New Mermaids]] and [[Revels Student Edition]] leave open the question of authorship.</ref> However, since the statistical studies by David Lake<ref>''The Canon of Middleton's Plays'' (Cambridge University Press, 1975).</ref> and MacDonald P. Jackson,<ref>''Middleton and Shakespeare: Studies in Attribution'' (1979).</ref> Middleton's authorship has not been seriously contested, and no further scholar has defended the Tourneur attribution.<ref>The play is attributed to Middleton in Jackson's facsimile edition of the 1607 quarto (1983), in Bryan Loughrey and Neil Taylor's edition of ''Five Middleton Plays'' (Penguin, 1988), and in ''Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works'' (Oxford, 2007).

A summary of the evidence for Middleton's authorship is contained in ''Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture'', general editors Gary Taylor and John Lavagnino (Oxford, 2007).</ref> The Oxford Middleton and its companion piece, ''Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture'', offer extensive evidence both for Middleton's authorship of ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'', for his collaboration with Shakespeare on ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', and for his adaptation and revision of Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. It has also been argued that Middleton collaborated with Shakespeare on ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]''.<ref>Laurie Maguire and Emma Smith: 'Many Hands – A New Shakespeare Collaboration?' ''TLS'', 19 April 2012. Online: [http://www.cems-oxford.org/projects/the-authorship-of-alls-well Retrieved 26 April 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623004608/http://www.cems-oxford.org/projects/the-authorship-of-alls-well |date=23 June 2015 }}.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Coughlan |first1=Sean |title=Shakespeare's 'co-author' named by Oxford scholars |work=BBC News |date=25 April 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-17828729 |access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref> However, these latter collaborative attributions are not universally accepted by scholars.

Middleton's work is diverse even by the standards of his age. He did not have the kind of official relationship with a particular company that Shakespeare or Fletcher had. Instead he appears to have written on a [[freelance]] basis for any number of companies. His output ranges from the "snarling" satire of ''Michaelmas Term'' (performed by the [[Children of Paul's]]) to the bleak intrigues of ''The Revenger's Tragedy'' (performed by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]). His early work was informed by the flourishing of satire in the late Elizabethan period,<ref>Dorothy M. Farr, ''Thomas Middleton and the Drama of Realism,'' New York, Harper and Row, 1973, pp. 9–37.</ref> while his maturity was influenced by the ascendancy of Fletcherian [[tragicomedy]]. His later work, in which his satirical fury is tempered and broadened, includes three of his acknowledged masterpieces. ''A Chaste Maid in Cheapside'', produced by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]], skilfully combines London life with an expansive view of the power of love to effect reconciliation. ''The Changeling'', a late tragedy, returns Middleton to an Italianate setting like that of ''The Revenger's Tragedy'', except that here the central characters are more fully drawn and more compelling as individuals.<ref>Farr, pp. 50–71.</ref> Similar development can be seen in ''Women Beware Women''.<ref>Farr, pp. 72–97.</ref>

Middleton's plays are marked by often amusingly presented [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] about the human race. True heroes are a rarity: almost every character is selfish, greedy and self-absorbed. ''A Chaste Maid in Cheapside'' offers a panoramic view of a London populated entirely by sinners, in which no social rank goes unsatirised. In the tragedies ''Women Beware Women'' and ''The Revenger's Tragedy'', amoral Italian courtiers endlessly plot against each other, resulting in a climactic bloodbath. When Middleton does portray good people, the characters have small roles and are shown as flawless.

Due to a theological pamphlet attributed to him, Middleton is thought by some to have been a strong believer in [[Calvinism]].

==Reputation==
Middleton's work has long been praised by literary critics, among them [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[T. S. Eliot]]. The latter thought Middleton was second only to Shakespeare.<ref>"Thomas Middleton", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 30 June 1927, pp. 445–446 (unsigned).</ref>

Middleton's plays were staged throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, each decade offering more productions than the last. Even some less familiar works of his have been staged: ''[[A Fair Quarrel]]'' at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], and ''[[The Old Law]]'' by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'' has been adapted for film several times. The tragedy ''[[Women Beware Women]]'' remains a stage favourite. ''The Revenger's Tragedy'' was adapted for [[Alex Cox]]'s film ''[[Revengers Tragedy]]'', the opening credits of which attribute the play's authorship to Middleton.
