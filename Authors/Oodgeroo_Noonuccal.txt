==Life as a poet, artist, writer and activist==
Oodgeroo Noonuccal joined the [[Australian Women's Army Service]] in 1942, after her two brothers were captured by the Japanese at the [[fall of Singapore]]. Serving as a signaller in [[Brisbane]] she met many black American soldiers, as well as European Australians. These contacts helped to lay the foundations for her later advocacy of Aboriginal rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/indigenous|title=Indigenous defence service - The Australian War Memorial|website=www.awm.gov.au|access-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303050747/https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/indigenous|archive-date=3 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> During the 1940s, she joined the [[Communist Party of Australia]] because it was the only party which opposed the [[White Australia policy]].<ref name=":6">{{cite book |last1=Abbey |first1=Sue |title=Noonuccal, Oodgeroo (1920–1993) |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/noonuccal-oodgeroo-18057 |website=Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University |access-date=13 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513033832/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/noonuccal-oodgeroo-18057 |archive-date=13 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127247950|title=Obituary: OODGEROO NOONUCCAL (Kath Walker) A tireless fighter for land and civil rights|date=17 September 1993|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|access-date=6 November 2019|issue=21,339|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=68|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

During the 1960s Kath Walker emerged as a prominent political activist and writer. She was Queensland state secretary of the [[Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders]] (FCAATSI),<ref>Cochrane, (1994), p. 67; [[Elaine Darling]], ''They spoke out pretty good: politics and gender in the Brisbane Aboriginal Rights Movement 1958–1962'' (St Kilda, Vic.: Janoan Media Exchange, c1998.), p. 189.</ref> and was involved in a number of other political organisations. She was a key figure in the campaign for the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|reform of the Australian constitution]] to allow Aboriginal people full citizenship, lobbying [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies]] in 1965, and his successor [[Harold Holt]] in 1966.<ref>Cochrane, (1994), p. 63.</ref> At one deputation in 1963, she taught Robert Menzies a lesson in the realities of Aboriginal life.

She wrote many books, beginning with ''We Are Going'' (1964), the first book to be published by an Aboriginal woman.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qikX50RKgPgC&q=first+book+to+be+published+by+an+aboriginal+woman&pg=PA109 |title=Maori and Aboriginal Women in the Public Eye: Representing Difference, 1950-2000 |publisher=ANU E Press |access-date=23 February 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223024843/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qikX50RKgPgC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=first+book+to+be+published+by+an+aboriginal+woman&source=bl&ots=D9cRwtJXMr&sig=gmG7XHOtc5GPv7FQQ1IP5YFdpUY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eW7qVN6wOKahmgXS1YKICA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=first%20book%20to%20be%20published%20by%20an%20aboriginal%20woman&f=false |archive-date=23 February 2015 |df=dmy-all |isbn=9781921862625 |date=December 2011 }}</ref> The title poem concludes:

This first book of poetry was extraordinarily successful, selling out in several editions, and setting Oodgeroo well on the way to be Australia's highest-selling poet alongside [[C. J. Dennis]].<ref>Mitchell, (1987), pp. 200–2.</ref> Critics' responses were mixed, with some questioning whether Oodgeroo, as an Aboriginal person, could really have written it herself. Others were disturbed by the activism of the poems, and found that they were "[[propaganda]]" rather than what they considered to be real poetry.<ref>Rooney, Brigid, Literary activists: writer-intellectuals and Australian public life (St Lucia, Qld.) : University of Queensland Press, 2009, pp. 68–9</ref> Oodgeroo embraced the idea of her poetry as propaganda, and described her own style as "sloganistic, civil-writerish, plain and simple."<ref>Kath Walker, "Aboriginal Literature" ''Identity'' 2.3 (1975) pp. 39–40</ref> She wanted to convey pride in her Aboriginality to the broadest possible audience, and to popularise equality and Aboriginal rights through her writing.<ref>Cochrane, (1994), p. 37</ref>

In 1972 she bought a property on [[North Stradbroke Island]] (also known as ''Minjerribah'') which she called Moongalba ("sitting-down place"), and established the Noonuccal-Nughie Education and Cultural Centre.<ref name="awap"/> And in 1977, a documentary about her, called ''Shadow Sister'', was released. It was directed and produced by [[Frank Heimans]] and photographed by [[Geoff Burton]]. It describes her return to Moongalba and her life there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontrowvideo.com.au/details/f0031.html|title=Shadow Sister: A Film Biography of Aboriginal Poet Kath Walker (Oodgeroo Noonuccal), MBE|access-date=14 March 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719061014/http://www.frontrowvideo.com.au/details/f0031.html|archive-date=19 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In a 1987 interview, she described her education program at Moongalba, saying that over "the last seventeen years I've had 26,500 children on the island. White kids as well as black. And if there were green ones, I'd like them too ... I'm colour blind, you see. I teach them about Aboriginal culture. I teach them about the balance of nature."<ref>Mitchell, (1987), p. 206.</ref> Oodgeroo was committed to education at all levels, and collaborated with universities in creating programs for teacher education that would lead to better teaching in Australian schools.<ref>Rhonda Craven, "The role of teachers in the Year of Indigenous people: Oodgeroo of the Tribe Noonuccal (Kath Walker)", ''Aboriginal Studies Association Journal'', No. 3 (1994), p. 55-56.</ref>

On 13 June 1970, Noonuccal (as Kathleen Jean Mary Walker) received the award of [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire (Civil)]] (MBE) for her services to the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1088318|title=Mrs Kathleen Jean Mary Walker|website=It's An Honour|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106001354/https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1088318|archive-date=2019-11-06|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>

In 1974 Noonuccal was aboard a [[British Airways]] flight that was [[British Airways#Incidents and accidents|hijacked by terrorists]] campaigning for [[Palestinian liberation]]. The hijackers shot a crew member and a passenger and forced the plane to fly to several different African destinations. During her three days in captivity, she used a blunt pencil and an airline sickbag from the seat pocket to write two poems, "Commonplace" and "Yusuf (Hijacker)".<ref>{{cite web|first1=Marg |last1=Powell |first2=Jeff |last2=Rickertt |url=http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/treasures/yusuf/yusuf.html |title=Kath Walker - Sick Bag Poem - Treasures from the Fryer Library |publisher=Library.uq.edu.au |access-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331103922/http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/treasures/yusuf/yusuf.html |archive-date=31 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110789977|title=WORLD NEWS|date=27 November 1974|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|access-date=6 November 2019|issue=13,923|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=49|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110789455|title=AUSTRALIAN HOSTAGES Hijackers free 17 from British jet|date=25 November 1974|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|access-date=6 November 2019|issue=13,921|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=49|page=1|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1983 Noonuccal ran in the [[1983 Queensland state election|Queensland state election]] for the [[Australian Democrats]] political party in the [[Electoral district of Redlands]]. Her campaign focused around policies promoting the environment and Aboriginal rights.<ref>Floyd, B., ''Inside Story'', p. 71, Boolarong Press, Salisbury.</ref> Receiving 6.4% of the primary vote, she was not elected.

In 1986 she played the part of Eva in [[Bruce Beresford]]'s film, ''[[The Fringe Dwellers]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Fringe Dwellers (1986) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091081/fullcredits|access-date=2019-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806140024/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091081/fullcredits|archive-date=6 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/fringe-dwellers/clip3/|title=The Fringe Dwellers|website=australianscreen|language=en|access-date=2019-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306192436/http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/fringe-dwellers/clip3/|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 1987, she announced she would return her MBE in protest over the [[Australian Government|Australian Government's]] intention to celebrate the [[Australian Bicentenary]] which she described as "200 years of sheer unadulterated humiliation" of Aboriginal people.
