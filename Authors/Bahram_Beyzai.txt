'''Bahrām Beyzāêi''' (also spelt '''Beizāi''', '''Beyzāêi''', {{lang-fa|بهرام بیضائی}}, born 26 December 1938) is an Iranian playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, and ''[[ostad|ostād]]'' ("master") of Persian letters, arts and [[Iranian studies]].

Beyzaie is the son of the poet [[:fa:ذکایی بیضایی آرانی|Ne'matallah Beyzai]] (best known by his literary pseudonym "Zokā'i").<ref>Two thousand verse lines by ''Zokā'i Beyzāie'', of a total of six thousand, were published in 1978 (1357 [[Iranian calendar|AH]]) in a book entitled ''Yad-e Bayzā'' (The White Hand); ''Bayzā'' in Persian is the literary word for ''White''. See Arash Fanā'iān, ''Gofteman-e Iran'', 20 January 2008.

It is noteworthy that Adib Ali Beyzāie's son, Hossein Beyzāie, is also a poet; his literary pseudonym is ''Partow'' (Ray of Light).</ref> Bahram Beyzaie's paternal grandfather, Mirzā Mohammad-Rezā Ārāni ("Ebn Ruh"), and paternal great-grandfather, the mulla Mohammad-Faqih Ārāni ("Ruh'ol-Amin"), were also notable poets.<ref>Arash Fanā'iān, ''Gofteman-e Iran'', 20 January 2008.

In spite of his somewhat belated start in cinema, Beyzai is often considered a pioneer of a generation of filmmakers whose works are sometimes described as the [[Iranian New Wave]]. His ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' (1986) was voted "Best Iranian Film of all time" in November 1999 by a Persian movie magazine ''Picture World'' poll of 150 Iranian critics and professionals.<ref>''Picture World'' (''Donyaye Tassvir''), No. 74, November 1999, {{ISSN|1023-2613}}</ref> Still, even before the outset of his cinematic career in 1970, he was a leading playwright (as well as theatre historian), so much so that he is often considered the greatest playwright of the Persian language, and holds a reputation as "The [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] of Persia".{{sfn|Hasani|p=}}<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ca6jwXasY Abbas Milani's speech, Toronto, 2017.]</ref>

Since 2010, Beyzai has lived and taught at [[Stanford University]], [[United States]].

==Early years==
Beyzaie was born in [[Tehran]], to a poet, [[anthologist]] and biographer father and a housewife mother. His father made a living through a legal occupation and was able to attend to his literary interests reasonably.

[[File:دارالفنون.jpg|thumb|Beyzai attended the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar'ol-Fonoun]] high school as an adolescent, where he did not spend a good time getting along, skipped classes and went to the movies, and in his late teens composed his earliest dramatic pieces.]]
The young Bahram did not seem very interested in his family legacy, being poetry, which was pursued by his father, uncles and cousins. In high school, the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar'ol-Fonoun]],<ref>For an illustrated report on Dar'ol-Fonoun see: Hamid-Reza Hosseini, ''Dar'ol-Fonoun in want of Love'' ("Dar'ol-Fonoun dar hasrat-e eshq"), in Persian, Jadid Online, 22 September 2008, [http://www.jadidonline.com/stry/22092008/frnk/darolfonoon]. The pertinent photographs (15 in total) can be viewed here: [http://www.jadidonline.com/slideshow/695/1]. The following is the photograph of what used to be the [[amphitheatre]] of Dar'ol-Fonoun: [http://www.jadidonline.com/slideshow/695/13].</ref> he wrote two historical plays which went on to become his preferred method of writing.

At the age of 21, he did substantial research on the traditional Persian plays, particularly [[Ta'zieh]], and by 1961 he had already spent a great deal of time studying and researching other ancient [[Persians|Persian]] and pre-[[Islamic]] culture and literature. This in turn led him to studying Eastern theatre and traditional Iranian theatre and arts which would help him formulate a new non-Western identity for Iranian theatre. He also became acquainted with Persian painting.

== Career ==

===Playwriting in the 1960s===
In 1968, Beyzai was one of the nine founders of the Iranian Writers' Guild, a highly controversial organization in the face of [[censorship]]. In 1969, he was invited to teach at the Theater Department of the College of Fine Arts at University of Tehran. He chaired this department from 1972 to 1979. With his readership many prominent authors and artists started teaching at the department and created the most fruitful period in the history of that department.

[[File:Bahram Beyzayi Wedding.jpg|thumb|Beyzai in his first wedding in the company of other artists, notably [[Parviz Fannizadeh]] and [[Parviz Sayyad]], 1965]]
Beyzaie's groundbreaking ''[[A Study on Iranian Theatre]]'' (Namayesh dar Iran), published in mid-1960s is still considered the most important text on the history of Iranian theater. Beyzaie is also the first scholar in Iran to publish books on [[theatre of Japan]] and [[theatre of China]].

 |source = —[[Ehsan Yarshater]]
 |width= 22%
 |align=right
}}

Some of his plays, such as his masterpiece ''[[Death of Yazdgerd]]'', have been translated into numerous languages and have been performed around the world. ''[[Death of Yazdgerd]]'' has been performed in Iran, France, England, India and USA among other countries, and was made into a [[Death of Yazdgerd (film)|film of the same name]] by Beyzai in 1981. ''Death of Yazdgerd'' and ''[[Kalat Claimed]]'' have been translated into English by [[Manuchehr Anvar]].

===1970s and the outset of a cinematic career===
In 1969, he began his film career by directing the short film ''Amu Sibilou'' (''Uncle Moustache'') followed by "Safar" in 1970. With these films Beyzai is often considered to be a pioneer of what is called the [[Iranian New Wave]], a [[Persian cinema]] movement that is supposed to have spontaneously started in the late 1960s, i.e. ignoring earlier efforts by filmmakers such as [[Farrokh Ghaffari]] and [[Ebrahim Golestan]], and includes other outstanding directors such as [[Nasser Taghvai]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Amir Naderi]], [[Ali Hatami]], [[Sohrab Shahid Sales]], [[Dariush Mehrjui]], [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Parviz Kimiavi]], [[Masoud Kimiai]] and [[Fereydun Gole]] among others; and soon following [[Khosrow Sinai]], [[Masoud Jafari Jozani]], [[Kianoush Ayari]], [[Varuzh Karim-Masihi]], [[Ebrahim Hatamikia]] and others.

Immediately after, in 1971, he made his first feature film "Ragbar" ("[[Downpour (film)|Downpour]]") which is regarded by critics to this day as one of the most successful Iranian films ever made. The successful film addresses the late [[Parviz Fannizadeh]] as its central character and protagonist.

Since then he has produced and directed 8 films including ''Qaribe va Meh (Stranger and the Fog)'' (1974), ''[[Ballad of Tara|Cherike-ye Tara]] (Ballad of Tara)'' (1979), ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' (1986, released in 1989), ''Shāyad Vaghti digar (Maybe Another Time)'' (1988) and ''Mosaferan (Travellers)'' (1992).

===Filmmaking in the 1980s===
In 1981, the revolutionary leaders started the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]], as a result of which Beyzaie among many others was expelled from the university. He continued writing and making films though. His screenplay ''Ruz-e Vaqe'e'' (''[[The Fateful Day]]'') was adapted into a film in 1995 and another screenplay was adapted into a film named ''Fasl-e Panjom'' (The fifth season) in 1996, whilst he also made four of his finest films. He also edited [[Ebrahim Hatamikia]]'s ''Borj-e Minu (Minoo Tower)''.

===1990–present===
He married the actress and make-up artist Mozhdeh Shamsai in 1992. After ''Mosaferan'', he failed to get a permit for the production of a number of screenplays. In 1995, he left Iran for [[Strasbourg]] at the invitation of the [[International Cities of Refuge Network|International Parliament of Writers]]. Soon however he returned and staged ''[[The Lady Aoi (Bahram Beyzai production)|The Lady Aoi]]'' in Tehran.

In 2001, he made his best-selling film ''[[Killing Mad Dogs]]'', after which he managed to stage three plays as well before he left Iran for the United States.

He left Iran in 2010 at the invitation of [[Stanford University]], and has since been the Daryabari Visiting Professor of Iranian Studies, teaching courses in Persian theatre, cinema and mythology. There he has given workshops on the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the history of Iranian performing arts, Iranian as well as Semitic myths, etc. He has also staged several of his plays including his nine-hour ''[[Tarabnameh]]''.

==Cinematic style==
{{quote box
|bgcolor=#E0E6F8
 |quote = [[File:Martin Scorsese Berlinale 2010 (cropped).jpg|plain|60px]]... you can feel Bayzaie's background in Persian literature, theater and poetry. Bayzaie never received the support he deserved from the government of his home country...{{sfn|Scorsese|p=}}

}}
He is known as the most intellectual and conspicuous "author" in [[Iranian cinema]] and theater. The main theme of his works is the [[history]] and "crisis of identity" which is related to Iranian cultural and mythical symbols and paradigms. He is considered as Iran's most prominent screenwriter in terms of dramatic integrity of his works, many of which have been made into films.

==Reception and criticism==
{{quote box
|bgcolor=#E0E6F8

 |source = —[[Hamid Dabashi]]
 |width= 20%

}}

Critics have often praised Beyzai above all Persian filmmakers as well as playwrights. He was voted the best Persian filmmaker of all time in 2002, and his ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'' was voted the finest Persian film of all time. All the same, his formalism has occasionally raised criticism, even from himself. [[Ebrahim Golestan]], who had previously made objections to Beyzai's style, praised him in a letter in 2017.
