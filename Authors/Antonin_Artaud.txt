'''Antoine Marie Joseph Paul Artaud''', better known as '''Antonin Artaud''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃tɔnɛ̃ aʁto|pron}}; 4 September 1896 – 4 March 1948), was a [[French people|French]] writer, poet, dramatist, visual artist, essayist, actor and theatre director, widely recognized as one of the major figures of [[twentieth-century theatre]] and the European [[avant-garde]], and known for his raw, surreal and transgressive themes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Artaud and his doubles|last=Jannarone, Kimberly.|date=2012|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-1280880506|edition= 1st paperback |location=Ann Arbor|oclc=802057630}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The dramatic concepts of Antonin Artaud|last=Sellin, Eric, 1933-|date=2017|publisher=Quid Pro Books|others=Thompson, Peter.|isbn=9781610273718|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|oclc=988943807}}</ref><ref name=":4" /><ref name= Escholar>{{cite web| url= https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:1m2969| title= Antonin Artaud and the Avant-Garde Theatre| last= Gadoffre| first= G.

== Early life ==
Antonin Artaud was born in [[Marseille]], to Euphrasie Nalpas and Antoine-Roi Artaud.<ref name= authors>{{cite book| first= John| last= Wakeman| title= World Authors, 1950–1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth Century Authors| publisher= Wilson| year= 1975| isbn= 9780824204198| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/worldauthors195000wake}}</ref> His parents were first cousins— his grandmothers were sisters from [[Smyrna]] (modern day [[İzmir]], in [[Turkey]]). His paternal grandmother, Catherine Chilé, was raised in Marseille, where she married Marius Artaud, a Frenchman. His maternal grandmother, Mariette Chilé, grew up in Smyrna, where she married Louis Nalpas, a local [[ship chandler]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grossman |first1=Évelyne |title=Antonin Artaud, œuvres |date=2004 |publisher=Éditions Gallimard |location=Paris |isbn=978-2-07-076507-2}}</ref> He was, throughout his life, greatly affected by his [[Greek people|Greek]] ancestry.<ref name=":6" /> Euphrasie gave birth to nine children, but four were stillborn and two others died in childhood.

== Career ==
In March 1921, Artaud moved to Paris to pursue a career as a writer (against his father's wishes).<ref name= Escholar /> While training and performing with directors including [[Charles Dullin]] and [[Georges Pitoëff]], he continued to write both poetry and essays. At the age of 27, he mailed some of his poems to the journal ''[[La Nouvelle Revue Française]]'';{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}  they were rejected, but the editor, [[Jacques Rivière]], wrote back seeking to understand him, and a relationship via letters developed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}  Their compilation into an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] work, ''Correspondance avec Jacques Rivière'', was Artaud's first major publication.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

His first work in the theatre was with French theatre director [[Lugné-Poe|Lugné Poe]] who described Artaud as "a painter lost in the midst of actors".<ref name="FD772">{{cite journal|last=Deák|first=František|date=October 1977|title=Antonin Artaud and Charles Dullin: Artaud's Apprenticeship in Theatre|journal=Educational Theatre Journal|volume=29|pages=345–353|doi=10.2307/3206180|jstor=3206180|number=3}}</ref>{{rp|350}}

=== Apprenticeship with Charles Dullin ===
Dullin is one of the celebrated French "teacher-directors" with whom Artaud worked, along with [[Jacques Copeau]], [[André Antoine]], and [[Firmin Gémier]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Artaud was taken on as an apprentice by Dullin in 1921, at his Théâtre de l'Atelier.<ref name="FD772" /><sup>:345</sup> He worked as a member of Dullin's troupe for eighteen months, training ten to twelve hours a day.<ref name="Goodall2">{{cite journal|last=Goodall|first=Jane|date=Summer 1987|title=Artaud's Revision of Shelley's ''The Cenci'': The Text and its Double|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=21|pages=115–126|doi=10.1353/cdr.1987.0047|jstor=41153273|number=2}}</ref>{{rp|119}} Artaud was quoted as saying of Dullin, "Hearing Dullin teach I feel that I'm rediscovering ancient secrets and a whole forgotten mystique of production".<ref name="FD772" /><sup>:351</sup> Artaud came to disagree with many of Dullin's teachings.<ref name="FD772" /><sup>:352</sup> He left the troupe after a disagreement over his performance of the Emperor Charlemagne in [[Alexandre Arnoux|Alexandre Arnoux's]] ''Huon de Bordeaux''.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIJjDwAAQBAJ&q=Artaud+Demain&pg=PA19|title=Antonin Artaud|last=Esslin|first=Martin|date=1 January 2018|publisher=Alma Books|isbn=9780714545622|language=en}}</ref><sup>:22</sup>

=== Work in the cinema (1923–1935) ===
Artaud cultivated a great interest in cinema as well, working as a critic, actor, and writing film scenarios. Artaud's performance as [[Jean-Paul Marat]] in [[Abel Gance]]'s [[Napoléon (1927 film)|''Napoleon'']] (1927) used exaggerated movements to convey the fire of Marat's personality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} He also played the monk Massieu in [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' (1928). He wrote a number of film scenarios, and ten are listed in his ''Complete Works''. As Ros Murray points out, 'one is a fragment, four were written under a pseudonym, and one was lost altogether.'<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Ros|date=2017|title=Cruel time in Artaud's film scenarios|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/article/view/1366|journal=Image & Narrative|language=en-US|volume=17|issue=5}}</ref> Only one of Artaud's scenarios was produced, ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman]]'' (1928). Directed by [[Germaine Dulac]], it is often considered the first surrealist film.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LMKAQAAMAAJ|title=Artaud: The Screaming Body|last=Barber|first=Stephen|date=1999|publisher=Creation Books|isbn=9781840680096|language=en}}</ref> This film influenced [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Luis Buñuel]], two key Spanish surrealists, when they made ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (1929).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== Association with Surrealists ===
Artaud was briefly associated with the Surrealists, before being expelled by [[André Breton]] in 1927, shortly after the Surrealists aligned themselves with the Communist Party in France.<sup>:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qo2JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA274|title=Twentieth Century Theatre: A Sourcebook|last=Drain|first=Richard|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-86474-4|language=en}}</ref> 274</sup> Scholar Ros Murray asserts, 'Artaud was not into politics at all, writing things like: "''I shit on Marxism''."' Additionally, 'Breton was becoming very anti-theatre because he saw theatre as being bourgeois and anti-revolutionary.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://essentialdrama.com/tag/theatre-de-alfred-jarry/|title=ARTAUD'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE SURREALISTS: ARTAUD VS. BRETON – Interview with Ros Murray|date=2017|website=Essential Drama|language=en-US|access-date=29 November 2019}}</ref> Artaud ends his manifesto for the [[Theatre Alfred Jarry]], 'The Manifesto for an Abortive Theatre' (1926/27), with a direct attack on the Surrealists, who he calls 'bog-paper revolutionaries' that would 'make us believe that to produce theatre today is a counter-revolutionary endeavour'.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvbwAAAAMAAJ|title=Collected Works|last=Artaud|first=Antonin|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Alma Classics|isbn=978-0-7145-0172-7|language=en}}</ref><sup>:24</sup> He declares they are 'bowing down to Communism',<ref name=":8" /><sup>:25</sup> which is 'a lazy man's revolution',<ref name=":8" /><sup>:24</sup> and calls for a more 'essential metamorphosis' of society.<ref name=":8" /><sup>:25</sup>

=== Theatre Alfred Jarry (1926–1929) ===
In 1926, Artaud founded the [[Theatre Alfred Jarry]] with [[Robert Aron]] and expelled Surrealist [[Roger Vitrac]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Jannarone|first=Kimberly|date=2005|title=The Theatre before Its Double: Artaud Directs in the Alfred Jarry Theatre|journal=Theatre Survey|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=247–273|doi=10.1017/S0040557405000153|issn=1475-4533}}</ref> They staged four productions between June 1927 and January 1929. The Theatre was extremely short-lived, but was attended by an enormous range of European artists, including [[Arthur Adamov]], [[André Gide]], and [[Paul Valéry]].<ref name=":0" /><sup>:249</sup>

==== Productions at Theatre Alfred Jarry ====

* The theatre's inaugural production was 1 June 1927, and featured Artaud's V''entre brûlé; ou La Mère folle (Burnt Belly, or the Mad Mother)'', Vitrac's ''Les Mystères de l’amour (The Mysteries of Love)'', and Aron's ''Gigogne''.<ref name=":0" />
* The second production was 14 January 1928 and 'consisted of a screening of [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Vsevolod Pudovkin's]] 1926 film ''Mat''' (as ''La Mère''), and a performance of the last act of [[Paul Claudel|Paul Claudel’s]] ''Le Partage de midi''.'<ref name=":0" />
* The third production, on 2 and 9 June 1928, was [[August Strindberg|August Strindberg's]] ''[[A Dream Play]].'' 
*The final production was Vitrac's ''Victor; ou, Le pouvoir aux les enfants,'' which ran 24 and 29 December 1928 and 5 January 1929.<ref name=":0" />

The theatre advertised that they would produce Artaud's play ''[[Jet de sang]]'' in their 1926–1927 season, but it was never mounted and was not premiered until 40 years later.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Artaud at the Paris Colonial Exposition (1931) ===
In 1931, Artaud saw [[Balinese dance]] performed at the [[Paris Colonial Exposition]]. Although he did not fully understand the intentions and ideas behind traditional Balinese performance, it influenced many of his ideas for theatre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Scholar Adrian Curtin has noted the significance of the soundscape that accompanied the event, stating that Artaud was struck by 'the 'hypnotic' rhythms of the gamelan ensemble, its range of percussive effects, the variety of timbres that the musicians produced, and – most importantly, perhaps – the way in which the dancers' movements interacted dynamically with the musical elements instead of simply functioning as a type of background accompaniment.'<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Curtin|first=Adrian|date=2010|title=Cruel Vibrations: Sounding Out Antonin Artaud's Production of Les Cenci|journal=Theatre Research International|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=250–262|doi=10.1017/S0307883310000568|issn=0307-8833}}</ref>{{rp|253}}

Also during this year, Artaud's 'First Manifesto for a [[Theatre of Cruelty]]' was published in ''[[La Nouvelle Revue Française]]''; it would later appear as a chapter in ''[[The Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}''

=== The Cenci (1935) ===
In 1935 Artaud staged a production of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[The Cenci]]'' at the [[Théâtre des Folies-Wagram]] in Paris''.''<ref name=":2" /><sup>:250</sup> The drama contains themes of abuse, incest, violence, murder and betrayal. In Artaud's stage directions, he described the opening scene as "suggestive of extreme atmospheric turbulence, with wind-blown drapes, waves of suddenly amplified sound, and crowds of figures engaged in 'furious orgy'", accompanied by "a chorus of church bells", as well as the presence of numerous large mannequins.<ref name="Goodall2" />{{rp|120}} In this scene, which is often referred to as "the banquet scene", Dullin's influence on Artaud is very clear, as both the sounds of bells and the sounds of amplified footsteps were present, along with the strongly emphasized theme of elemental forces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Scholar Adrian Curtin has argued for the importance of the 'sonic aspects of the production, which did not merely support the action but motivated it obliquely.'<ref name=":2" /><sup>:251</sup> While Shelley's version of ''The Cenci'' conveyed the motivations and anguish of the Cenci's daughter Beatrice with her father through monologues, Artaud was much more concerned with conveying the menacing nature of the Cenci's presence and the reverberations of their incest relationship though physical discordance, as if an invisible "force-field" surrounded them.<ref name="Goodall2" />{{rp|123}}

Artaud's strong interest in oriental theater, specifically Balinese and Chinese, was in part shared by his mentor Dullin, but Dullin, unlike Artaud, did not think Western theater should be adopting oriental language and style. He was quoted as saying of Artaud's influences from oriental theater, "To want to impose on our Western theater rules of a theatre of a long tradition which has its own symbolic language would be a great mistake."<ref name="FD772" />{{rp|351}} Artaud's implementation of Dullin's sensory awareness exercises into the stage production were clearly observable in ''The Cenci'', Jane Goodall writes of the performance, <blockquote>The predominance of action over reflection accelerates the development of events...the monologues...are cut in favor of sudden, jarring transitions...so that a spasmodic effect is created. Extreme fluctuations in pace, pitch, and tone heighten sensory awareness intensify ... the here and now of performance.<ref name="Goodall2" /><sup>:119</sup></blockquote>''The Cenci'' was a commercial failure, although it employed innovative sound effects—including the first theatrical use of the electronic instrument the [[Ondes Martenot]]—and had a set designed by [[Balthus]].

=== Travels and institutionalisation ===

==== Journey to Mexico ====
In 1935 Artaud decided to go to Mexico, where he was convinced there was 'a sort of deep movement in favour of a return to civilisation before Cortez'.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Hertz|first=Uri|date=2003|title=Artaud in Mexico|url=https://periodicos.ufsc.br/index.php/fragmentos/article/viewFile/7673/7007|journal=Fragmentos|volume=25|pages=11–17}}</ref><sup>:11</sup> He received a grant to travel to [[Mexico]], where in 1936 he met his first [[Mexican people|Mexican]]-Parisian friend, the painter [[Federico Cantú]], when Cantú gave lectures on the decadence of Western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Artaud also studied and lived with the [[Tarahumara]]n people and participated in [[peyote]] rites, his writings about which were later released in a volume called ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara,<ref name=":3" /><sup>:</sup>''<sup>14</sup> published in English under the title ''The Peyote Dance'' (1976)''.'' The content of this work closely resembles the poems of his later days, concerned primarily with the [[supernatural]]. Artaud also recorded his horrific withdrawal from heroin upon entering the land of the Tarahumaras. Having deserted his last supply of the drug at a mountainside, he literally had to be hoisted onto his horse and soon resembled, in his words, "a giant, inflamed gum".{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Artaud would return to opiates later in life.

==== Ireland and repatriation to France ====
In 1937, Artaud returned to France, where he obtained a walking stick of knotted wood that he believed belonged not only to [[St. Patrick]], but also [[Lucifer]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. Artaud traveled to Ireland, landing at [[Cobh]] and travelling to [[Galway]] in an effort to return the staff. However, speaking very little English and no Irish whatsoever, he was unable to make himself understood. He would not have been admitted at Cobh, according to Irish government documents, except that he carried a letter of introduction from the Paris embassy. Most of his trip was spent in a hotel room he was unable to pay for. He was forcibly removed from the grounds of Milltown House, a [[Jesuit]] community, when he refused to leave. Before deportation he was briefly confined in the notorious [[Mountjoy Prison]]. According to Irish Government papers he was deported as "a destitute and undesirable alien".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedublinreview.com/extracts-from-the-artaud-file/ |access-date= 28 June 2012 |url-status=dead |work= [[The Dublin Review]] | title= 'An absent-minded person of the student type': Extracts from the Artaud file| first= Antonin| last= Artaud| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140545/http://thedublinreview.com/extracts-from-the-artaud-file/ |archive-date= 13 April 2014 }}</ref> On his return trip by ship, Artaud believed he was being attacked by two crew members, and he retaliated. He was arrested and put in a [[straitjacket]].

His return from Ireland brought about the beginning of the final phase of Artaud's life, which was spent in different asylums. It was at this time that his best known work ''The Theatre and Its Double'' (1938) was published. This book contained the two manifestos of the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]. There, "he proposed a theatre that was in effect a return to magic and ritual and he sought to create a new theatrical language of totem and gesture – a language of space devoid of dialogue that would appeal to all the senses."<ref name="GBotting2">{{cite book|title=The Theatre of Protest in America|url=https://archive.org/details/theatreofprotest0000bott|url-access=registration|last=Botting|first=Gary|publisher=Harden House|year=1972|place=Edmonton|author-link=Gary Botting}}</ref>{{rp|6}} "Words say little to the mind," Artaud wrote, "compared to space thundering with images and crammed with sounds." He proposed "a theatre in which violent physical images crush and hypnotize the sensibility of the spectator seized by the theatre as by a whirlwind of higher forces." He considered formal theatres with their proscenium arches and playwrights with their scripts "a hindrance to the magic of genuine ritual."<ref name="GBotting2" /><sup>:6</sup>

==== Artaud in Rodez ====
In 1943, when France was occupied by the Germans and Italians, [[Robert Desnos]] arranged to have Artaud transferred to the [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Rodez]], well inside [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territory, where he was put under the charge of Dr. [[Gaston Ferdière]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wZaCwAAQBAJ&q=Artaud+Asylum|title=Antonin Artaud: The Scum of the Soul|last=Murray|first=Ros|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781137310583|language=en}}</ref> At Rodez Artaud underwent therapy including [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock treatments]] and art therapy.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSe3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|title=Modernism and Non-Translation|last1=Harding|first1=Jason|last2=Nash|first2=John|date=30 October 2019|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198821441|language=en}}</ref><sup>:194</sup> The doctor believed that Artaud's habits of crafting magic spells, creating [[astrology]] charts, and drawing disturbing images were symptoms of [[mental illness]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lotringer |first1=Sylvere |title=Mad Like Artaud |date=2003 |publisher=Univocal Publishing |isbn=9781937561413 |page=20 |edition=1st |quote=He  was  no  less  susceptible to  all  sorts  of  delirious  ideas, which had  continuously  justified his  internment in  an  asylum.

===Career resumed===
Artaud was encouraged to write by his friends, and interest in his work was rekindled. He visited an exhibition of works by [[Vincent van Gogh]] which resulted in a study ''Van Gogh le suicidé de la société'' [''Van Gogh, The Man Suicided by Society''], published by K éditeur, Paris, 1947 which won a critics' prize.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.artseensoho.com/Life/readings/artaud.html |title=Antonin Artaud, from "Van Gogh: the Man Suicided by Society" |publisher=ARTseenSOHO |access-date= 9 October 2016}}</ref> He recorded ''{{lang|fr|Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu}} (To Have Done With the Judgment of God)'' on 22–29 November 1947. This work was shelved by Wladimir Porché, the Director of French Radio, the day before its scheduled airing on 2 February 1948, partly for its [[scatology|scatological]], [[anti-American]], and [[anti-religion|anti-religious]] references and pronouncements, but also because of its general randomness, with a cacophony of [[xylophone|xylophonic]] sounds mixed with various [[percussion]] elements. While remaining true to his Theatre of Cruelty and reducing powerful emotions and expressions into audible sounds, Artaud had utilized various, somewhat alarming cries, screams, grunts, [[onomatopoeia]] and [[glossolalia]].

As a result, Fernand Pouey, the director of dramatic and literary broadcasts for French radio, assembled a panel to consider the broadcast of ''{{lang|fr|Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu.}}'' Among approximately 50 artists, writers, musicians, and journalists present for a private listening on 5 February 1948 were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], [[René Clair]], [[Jean Paulhan]], [[Maurice Nadeau]], [[Georges Auric]], [[Claude Mauriac]], and [[René Char]]. Porché refused to broadcast it even though the panel were almost unanimously in favor of Artaud's work. Pouey left his job and the show was not heard again until 23 February 1948, at a private performance at Théâtre Washington.

==Final years==
In January 1948, Artaud was diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Gramont|first=Sanche|date=Winter 1971|title=Review: Antonin Artaud|journal=Diacritics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=25|jstor=465078}}</ref> He died shortly afterwards on 4 March 1948 in a psychiatric clinic in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]], a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Thévenin|first1=Paule|last2=Knapp|first2=Bettina|date=1965|title=A Letter on Artaud|journal=The Tulane Drama Review|volume=9|issue=3|pages=99–117|doi=10.2307/1125050|issn=0886-800X|jstor=1125050}}</ref> He was found by the gardener of the estate seated alone at the foot of his bed, and it was suspected that he died from a lethal dose of the drug [[chloral hydrate]], although it is unknown whether he was aware of its lethality.<ref name=":5" />

Twenty years after its recording and production in November 1947, French radio finally broadcast the performance of ''{{lang|fr|Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu.}}''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Media poetry : an international anthology|date=2007|publisher=Intellect|others=Kac, Eduardo.|isbn=978-1-84150-932-7|location=Bristol, UK|oclc=185144409}}</ref>

== Influence ==
Artaud has been cited as a profoundly influential figure in the history of theatre, [[avant-garde art]], literature, and other disciplines.<ref name="EncycBrit">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36724/Antonin-Artaud|title=Antonin Artaud|date=4 March 1948|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref> His work proved to be a significant influence on the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], particularly the works of [[Jean Genet]] and [[Samuel Beckett]], and helped inspire a movement away from the dominant role of language and rationalism in contemporary theatre.<ref name= EncycBrit /> Artaud also had a significant influence on the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], who borrowed Artaud's phrase "the body without organs" to describe [[Body without organs|their conception]] of the virtual dimension of the body and, ultimately, the basic substratum of reality in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''.<ref>Deleuze, Gilles and Félix Guattari (1980) "28 November 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?" In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''. Trans. Brian Massumi. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. pp. 149–166. {{ISBN|978-0816614028}}</ref> Poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] claimed that his introduction to Artaud, specifically "To Have Done with the Judgement of God", by [[Carl Solomon]] had a tremendous influence on his most famous poem "[[Howl]]".<ref>{{cite book| first= Allen| last= Ginsberg| title= "Howl" Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author, with Contemporaneous Correspondence, Account of First Public Reading, Legal Skirmishes, Precursor Texts & Bibliography| editor-first= Barry| editor-last= Miles| publisher= Harper Perennial| year= 1995| page= 130| isbn= 978-0-06-092611-3}}</ref> Artaud's ideas were adopted and vividly seen in Barrault's adaptation of Kafka's ''[[The Trial]]'' (1947).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985–1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=23|oclc=11814265}}</ref>

An extremely important study on the Artaud work comes from [[Jacques Derrida]]. According to the philosopher, as theatrical writer and actor, Artaud is the embodiment of both an aggressive and repairing gesture, which strikes, sounds out, is harsh in a dramatic way and with critical determination as well. Identifying life as art, he was critically focused on the western cultural social drama, to point out and deny the double-dealing on which the western theatrical tradition is based; he worked with the whirlpool of feelings and lunatic expressions, being subjugated to a counter-force which came from the act of gesture.<ref name="JEM7">{{cite book|title=Forcener le subjectile|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Schirmer/Mosel Publishers|year=1986|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Oeuvres completes|last=Artaud|first=Antonin|date=1956–94|publisher=Gallimard|language=fr}}</ref>

Theatrical practitioner [[Peter Brook]] took inspiration from Artaud's "Theatre of Cruelty" in a series of workshops that led up to his [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[Marat/Sade]]'' in 1964, which was performed in New York and Paris as well as London. The [[Living Theatre]] was also heavily influenced by Artaud, as was much English-language [[experimental theatre]] and [[performance art]]; [[Karen Finley]], [[Spalding Gray]], Liz LeCompte, [[Richard Foreman]], [[Charles Marowitz]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Joseph Chaikin]], and more all named Artaud as one of their influences.<ref name="GBotting2"/>{{rp|6–25}}  In the winter of 1968, Williams College offered a dedicated intersession class in Artaudian theatre, resulting in a week-long "Festival of Cruelty," under the direction of [[Keith Fowler]].  The Festival included productions of ''The Jet of Blood, All Writing is Pig Shit'', and several original ritualized performances, one based on the [[Charles Whitman|Texas Tower killings]] and another created as an ensemble catharsis called ''The Resurrection of Pig Man''.<ref>{{cite journal| title= Dark Days| journal= [[Williams Record]]| place= Williamstown, Massachusetts| date= January 1968}}</ref>

Charles Marowitz's play ''Artaud at Rodez'' is about the relationship between Artaud and Dr. Ferdière during Artaud's confinement at the psychiatric hospital in Rodez; the play was first performed in 1976 at the Teatro a Trastavere in Rome.<ref>"Marowitz, Charles (1977). ''Artaud at Rodez''. London: Marion Boyars. {{ISBN|0-7145-2632-0}}.</ref> The writer and actor Tim Dalgleish wrote and produced the play 'The Life and Theatre of Antonin Artaud' (originally called 'Pigshit') for the English physical theatre company Bare Bones in 1999. The play told Artaud's story from his early years of aspiration when he wished to be part of the establishment, through to his final years as a suffering, iconoclastic outsider. In Canada, playwright [[Gary Botting]] created a series of Artaudian "happenings" from ''The Aeolian Stringer'' to ''Zen Rock Festival'', and produced a dozen plays with an Artaudian theme, including ''Prometheus Re-Bound''.<ref>Edmonton: Harden House, 1972.</ref> The Latin American dramatic novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' by [[Giannina Braschi]] includes a debate between artists and poets concerning the merits of Artaud's "multiple talents" in comparison to the singular talents of other French writers.<ref>{{cite book| title= Yo-Yo Boing!'' by Giannina Braschi''| chapter= Introduction |first= Doris| last= Sommer| publisher= Latin American Literary Review Press| place= Pittsburgh| year= 1998|isbn=9780935480979}}</ref> The band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] included a song about the playwright, called "Antonin Artaud", on their album ''[[Burning from the Inside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waste.org/bauhaus/l/antoninartaud.html |title=bauhaus:lyrics:antonin artaud |publisher=Waste.org |access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref> Influential [[Argentina|Argentine]] hard rock band [[Pescado Rabioso]] recorded an album titled ''[[Artaud (album)|Artaud]]''.

[[All Media Network]]}}</ref> Composer [[John Zorn]] has written many works inspired by and dedicated to Artaud, including seven CDs: "[[Astronome]]", "[[Moonchild: Songs Without Words]]", "[[Six Litanies for Heliogabalus]]", "[[The Crucible]]", "[[Ipsissimus]]", "[[Templars: In Sacred Blood]]" and "The Last Judgment", a monodrama for voice and orchestra inspired by Artaud's late drawings "La Machine de l'être" (2000), "Le Momo" (1999) for violin and piano, and "Suppots et Suppliciations" (2012) for full orchestra. Filmmaker [[E. Elias Merhige]], during an interview by writer [[Scott Nicolay]], cited the writings of Artaud as a key influence for the experimental film ''[[Begotten (1991 film)|Begotten]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectiradio.com/e-elias-merhige-the-best-apple-youll-ever-eat-the-outer-dark-episode-29-january-28-2016/ |title= E.
