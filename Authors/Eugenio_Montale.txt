'''Eugenio Montale''' ({{IPA-it|euˈdʒɛːnjo monˈtaːle|lang}}; 12 October 1896 – 12 September 1981) was an Italian poet, prose writer, editor and translator, and recipient of the 1975 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1975/ | title=Nobel Prize | access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref>

==Life and works==

===Early years===
Montale was born in [[Genoa]].  His family were chemical products traders (his father supplied [[Italo Svevo]]'s firm). The poet's niece, Bianca Montale, in her ''Cronaca famigliare'' ("Family Chronicle") of 1986 portrays the family's common characteristics as "nervous fragility, shyness, concision in speaking, a tendency to see the worst in every event, a certain sense of humour".

Montale was the youngest of six sons. He recalled:

<blockquote>We were a large family.  My brothers went to the ''scagno'' ["office" in Genoese].  My only sister had a university education, but I had no such opportunity. In many families the unspoken arrangement existed that the youngest was released from the task of keeping up the family name.</blockquote>

In 1915 Montale worked as an accountant, but was left free to follow his literary passion, frequenting the city's libraries and attending his sister Marianna's private philosophy lessons. He also studied opera singing with the [[baritone]] [[Ernesto Sivori]].

Montale was largely self-taught. Growing up, his imagination was caught by several writers, including [[Dante Alighieri]], and by the study of foreign languages (especially English), as well as the landscapes of the Levante ("Eastern") [[Liguria]], where he spent holidays with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Villa+Montale/@44.1454238,9.6408574,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12d4ee0304fd1413:0x6904044f574bff4!8m2!3d44.1454238!4d9.6430461?hl=en-FR|title=Villa Montale in Monterosso}}</ref>

During [[World War I]], as a member of the Military Academy of [[Parma]], Montale asked to be sent to the front. After brief war experience as an infantry officer in [[Vallarsa]] and the [[Puster Valley]], he returned home in 1920.

===Poetic works===
Montale wrote more than ten anthologies of short lyrics, a journal of poetry translation, plus several books of prose translations, two books of literary criticism, and one of fantasy prose. Alongside his imaginative work he was a constant contributor to Italy's most important newspaper, the [[Corriere della Sera]], for which he wrote a huge number of articles on literature, music, and art.  He also wrote a foreword to Dante's "The Divine Comedy", in which he mentions the credibility of Dante, and his insight and unbiased imagination. In 1925 he was a signatory to the [[Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals]]. Montale's own politics inclined toward the liberalism of [[Piero Gobetti]] and [[Benedetto Croce]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarti |first1=Roland |title=Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present |date=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=417}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ceallachain |first1=Eanna |title=Eugenio Montale: The Poetry of the Later Years |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>

Montale's work, especially his first poetry collection ''[[Ossi di seppia]]'' ("Cuttlefish Bones"), which appeared in 1925, shows him as an antifascist who felt detached from contemporary life and found solace and refuge in the solitude of nature.

A famous poem of ''Ossi di seppia'' ends with these two verses:

Codesto solo oggi possiamo dirti,
ciò che ''non'' siamo, ciò che ''non'' vogliamo.

Translated to:
Only this is what we can tell you today,
that which we are ''not'', that which we do ''not'' want.

The Mediterranean landscape of Montale's native Liguria was a strong presence in these early poems: they gave him a sort of "personal seclusion" in the face of the depressing events around him.  These poems emphasise his personal solitude and empathy with "little" and "insignificant" things, or with the horizon, the sea.  According to Montale, nature is "rough, scanty, dazzling".  In a world filled with defeat and despair, nature alone seemed to possess dignity – the same as the reader experiences in reading his poems.

===Anticonformism of the new poetry===
Montale moved to [[Florence]] in 1927 to work as editor for the publisher [[Bemporad]]. Florence was the cradle of Italian poetry of that age, with works like the ''Canti orfici'' by [[Dino Campana]] (1914) and the first lyrics by [[Giuseppe Ungaretti|Ungaretti]] for the review ''[[Lacerba]]''. Other poets like [[Umberto Saba]] and [[Vincenzo Cardarelli]] had been highly praised. In 1929 Montale was asked to be chairman of the [[Gabinetto Vieusseux]] Library, a post from which he was expelled in 1938 by the fascist government. By this time Montale's poetry was a reaction against the literary style of the fascist regime.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Eco |author-link=Umberto Eco |first=Umberto |date=22 June 1995 |title=Ur-Fascism
 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/ |magazine= The New York Review of Books |access-date= 18 January 2018}}</ref> He collaborated with the magazine ''[[Solaria (magazine)|Solaria]]'', and (starting in 1927) frequented the literary café Le [[Giubbe Rosse]] ("Red Jackets") on the [[Piazza della Repubblica, Florence|Piazza Vittoria]] (now Piazza della Repubblica). Visiting the café often several times a day, he became a central figure among a group of writers there, including [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]], [[Arturo Loria]] and [[Elio Vittorini]] (all founders of the magazine).<ref name=jg>Eugenio Montale, ''Collected Poems 1920–1954'', translated and edited by Jonathan Galassi, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998, {{ISBN|0-374-12554-6}}</ref> He wrote for almost all the important literary magazines of the time.

Though hindered by financial problems and the literary and social conformism imposed by the authorities, in Florence Montale published his finest anthology, ''[[Le occasioni]]'' ("Occasions", 1939). From 1933 to 1938 he had a love relationship with [[Irma Brandeis]], a Jewish-American scholar of Dante who occasionally visited Italy for short periods.  After falling in love with Brandeis, Montale represented her as a [[mediatrix]] figure like Dante's [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]]. ''Le occasioni'' contains numerous allusions to Brandeis, here called Clizia (a [[senhal]]). [[Franco Fortini]] judged Montale's ''Ossi di seppia'' and ''Le occasioni'' the high-water mark of 20th century [[Italian literature|Italian poetry]].

[[T.S. Eliot]], who shared Montale's admiration for Dante, was an important influence on his poetry at this time; in fact, the new poems of Eliot were shown to Montale by [[Mario Praz]], then teaching in Manchester. The concept of the [[objective correlative]] used by Montale in his poetry, was probably influenced by T. S. Eliot. In 1948, for Eliot's sixtieth birthday, Montale contributed a celebratory essay entitled "Eliot and Ourselves" to a collection published to mark the occasion.<ref>Montale 1948, pp. 190–195.</ref>

===Disharmony with the world===
From 1948 to his death, Montale lived in Milan. After the war, he was a member of the liberal [[Partito d'Azione]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cambon |first1=Glauco |title=Eugenio Montale's Poetry: A Dream in Reason's Presence |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=189}}</ref> As a contributor to the ''Corriere della Sera'' he was music editor and also reported from abroad, including [[Israel]], where he went as a reporter to follow [[Pope Paul VI]]'s visit there. His works as a journalist are collected in ''Fuori di casa'' ("Out of Home", 1969).

''[[La bufera e altro]]'' ("The Storm and Other Things") was published in 1956 and marks the end of Montale's most acclaimed poetry. Here his figure Clizia is joined by La Volpe ("the Fox"), based on the young poet [[Maria Luisa Spaziani]] with whom Montale had an affair during the 1950s. However, this volume also features Clizia, treated in a variety of poems as a kind of bird-goddess who defies Hitler. These are some of his greatest poems.

His later works are ''[[Xenia (poetry)|Xenia]]'' (1966), ''Satura'' (1971) and ''[[Diario del '71 e del '72]]'' (1973). Montale's later poetry is wry and ironic, musing on the critical reaction to his earlier work and on the constantly changing world around him. ''Satura'' contains a poignant elegy to his wife [[Drusilla Tanzi]]. He also wrote a series of poignant poems about Clizia shortly before his death. Montale's fame at that point had extended throughout the world. He had received honorary degrees from the Universities of Milan (1961), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1967), [[Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza|Rome]] (1974), and had been named [[senator for life|Senator-for-Life]] in the Italian Senate. In 1973 he was awarded the [[Struga Poetry Evenings|Golden Wreath of the Struga Poetry Evenings]] in [[Struga]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strugapoetryevenings.com/poets/eugenio-montale/?lang=en |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095450/http://www.strugapoetryevenings.com/poets/eugenio-montale/?lang=en |archive-date=2 February 2014 }}</ref> In 1975 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Montale died in Milan in 1981.

In 1996, a work appeared called ''[[Posthumous Diary]]'' (''Diario postumo'') that purported to have been 'compiled' by Montale before his death, with the help of the young poet Annalisa Cima; the critic [[Dante Isella]] thinks that this work is not authentic.<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/ottobre/16/DIARIO_POSTUMO_INTRIGHI_COMPLOTTI_CONGIURE_co_0_981016611.shtml Article of G. Raboni on Corriere della Sera] (archiviostorico.corriere.it)</ref> [[Joseph Brodsky]] dedicated his essay "In the Shadow of Dante" to Eugenio Montale's lyric poetry.
