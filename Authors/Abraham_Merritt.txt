'''Abraham Grace Merritt''' (January 20, 1884 – August 21, 1943) – known by his byline, '''A. Merritt''' – was an American [[Sunday magazine]] editor and a writer of [[fantasy|fantastic fiction]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Haining, Peter |author-link=Peter Haining (author) |year=1998 |title=20th Century Ghost Stories |publisher=Robinson Publishing }}</ref>

The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted him in 1999, its fourth class of two deceased and two living writers.<ref name=sfhof-old/>

==Life==
Born in [[Beverly, New Jersey]], he moved to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania in 1894.<ref>Merritt, Abraham; Levy, Michael M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sFuUvSwhY-kC&pg=PA303&dq=%22Abraham+grace+Merritt%22+beverly ''The Moon Pool''], p. 303. [[Wesleyan University Press]], 2004. {{ISBN|0819567078}}. "Abraham Grace Merritt was born on January 20, 1884, in Beverly, New Jersey, a small town outside of Philadelphia."</ref> Originally trained in law, he turned to journalism, first as a correspondent and later as editor. According to Peter Haining, Merritt survived a harrowing experience while a young reporter at ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' about which he refused to ever speak, but would, as Haining claims, mark a turning point in Merritt's life. He was assistant editor of ''[[The American Weekly]]'' from 1912 to 1937 under Morrill Goddard, then its editor from 1937 until his death. As editor, he hired the unheralded new artists [[Virgil Finlay]] and [[Hannes Bok]] and promoted the work done on [[polio]] by Sister [[Elizabeth Kenny]].

His fiction, eight complete novels and a number of short stories,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k54nLojgIrwC&pg=PA190&dq=%22Merritt,+in+fact,+turned+to+fantasy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=t2oKUtSRFufm4QTG9IDwDg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Merritt%2C%20in%20fact%2C%20turned%20to%20fantasy%22&f=false Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers]</ref> was only a sideline to his journalism career. One of the best-paid journalists of his era, Merritt made $25,000 per year by 1919, and at the end of his life was earning $100,000 yearly—exceptional sums for the period. His financial success allowed him to pursue world travel—he invested in real estate in [[Jamaica]] and [[Ecuador]]—and exotic hobbies, like cultivating [[orchid]]s and plants linked to [[witchcraft]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] ([[monkshood]], [[Aconitum|wolfbane]], blue [[datura]], [[peyote]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]).<ref>[[Sam Moskowitz|Moskowitz, Sam]]. ''A. Merritt: Reflections in the Moon Pool.'' Philadelphia, Oswald Train, 1985. {{ISBN|99962-4-760-0}}</ref>

He was described as a [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]] who talked endlessly about his medical symptoms, and showed eccentric behavior like a need to try out any food, tobacco and medicine he found on his coworkers desks. Occasionally he would dress in a kilt and play serenades for his coworkers with some of his huge collection of instruments he kept in a locked closet at work. He was well liked for his fairness and inability to fire any employees.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=MHxDhRYqANYC&pg=PA307&lpg=PA307&dq=%22A+true+eccentric,+Merritt%22&source=bl&ots=XtVdNFeq0z&sig=n7jdO31SsKAmXETCJi0buHiyIdI&hl=no&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjekpz9scPfAhWLxIsKHb4fA3UQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22A%20true%20eccentric%2C%20Merritt%22&f=false The Moon Pool]</ref>

Merritt married twice, once in the 1910s to Eleanore Ratcliffe, with whom he raised an adopted daughter, and again in the 1930s to Eleanor H. Johnson. He lived in the Hollis Park Gardens neighborhood of [[Queens]], New York City, where he accumulated collections of weapons, carvings, and primitive masks from his travels, as well as a library of occult literature that reportedly exceeded 5000 volumes. He died suddenly of a heart attack, at his winter home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, in 1943.

==Writing==
{{original research|section|date=November 2012}}

Merritt's writings were heavily influenced by [[H. Rider Haggard]],<ref>Lee Server, ''Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers'', Facts on File Inc (2002), p.131.</ref> [[Robert W. Chambers]],<ref>[[E. F. Bleiler]], "A.Merritt", in Bleiler, ed. Supernatural Fiction Writers. New York: Scribner's, 1985, pp.835–844. {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}</ref> [[Helena Blavatsky]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MHxDhRYqANYC&pg=PR37&lpg=PR37&dq=%22what+Merritt+is+essentially+doing+in+the+novel%22&source=bl&ots=XrYdODdl5v&sig=Nxns-NnPHUwTwiqgwXPfrhgGyXI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Zr8FUvTJJ6OK4ASnoYDICQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22what%20Merritt%20is%20essentially%20doing%20in%20the%20novel%22&f=false The Moon Pool – Introduction by Michael Levy]</ref> and [[Gertrude Barrows Bennett]] (writing as Francis Stevens),<ref name=PartnersWonder>''Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926–1965'' by Eric Leif Davin, Lexington Books, 2005, pages 409–10.</ref> with Merritt having "emulated Bennett's earlier style and themes."<ref name=PartnersWonder /> Merritt's stories typically revolve around conventional [[pulp magazine]] themes: lost civilizations, hideous monsters, etc. His heroes are gallant [[Ireland|Irishmen]] or [[Scandinavia]]ns, his villains treacherous [[Germany|Germans]] or Russians and his heroines often virginal, mysterious and scantily clad.

What sets Merritt apart from the typical pulp author, however, is his lush, florid prose style and his exhaustive, at times exhausting, penchant for adjective-laden detail. Merritt's fondness for micro-description nicely complements the [[pointillistic]] style of Bok's illustrations.
[[File:Metal monster sharp.jpg|thumb |''The Metal Monster'' inaugurated ''[[Argosy All-Story Weekly]]'' (August 7, 1920)]]
Merritt's first fantasy story was published in 1917, "Through the Dragon Glass" in the November 14 issue of Frank Munsey's ''[[All-Story Weekly]]''.<ref name=isfdb/> Other short stories and serial novels followed in the Munsey magazines ''All-Story'', ''Argosy All-Story'', and ''Argosy'':{{efn|name=argosy}} ''The People of the Pit'' (1918), "[[The Moon Pool]]" (1918), ''The Conquest of the Moon Pool'' (1919), "Three Lines of Old French" (1919), ''[[The Metal Monster]]'' (1920), ''[[The Face in the Abyss]]'' (1923), ''[[The Ship of Ishtar]]'' (1924), ''[[Seven Footprints to Satan]]'' (1927), ''The Snake Mother'' (1930), ''Burn Witch Burn!'' (1932), ''[[Dwellers in the Mirage]]'' (1932), and ''Creep, Shadow!'' (1934).<ref name=isfdb/> Meanwhile, rather few of his stories appeared elsewhere: ''The Pool of the Stone God'' (in his own ''American Weekly'', 1923), ''The Woman of the Wood'' (''[[Weird Tales]]'', 1926), ''The Metal Emperor'' (''[[Science and Invention]]'', 1927), and ''The Drone Man'' (''Fantasy Magazine'', 1934).<ref name=isfdb/><!-- edited by Merritt, Farnsworth Wright, Hugo Gernsback, and Julius Schwartz -->

Merritt also contributed to the [[Round-robin story|round robin]] story ''[[The Challenge from Beyond]]'' with Lovecraft, [[Robert E. Howard]], [[C. L. Moore]], and [[Frank Belknap Long]].

''[[The Fox Woman and the Blue Pagoda]]'' (1946) combined an unfinished story with a conclusion written by Merritt's friend Hannes Bok. ''The Fox Woman and Other Stories'' (1949) collected the same fragment, minus Bok's conclusion, with Merritt's short stories. The book ''[[The Black Wheel]]'' was published in 1948, after Merritt's death; it was written by Bok using previously unpublished material as well. Both these books were also illustrated by Bok and published by the small press The New Collectors Group in hardcover.

After Merritt's death, [[Sam Moskowitz]] discovered a number of poems among his papers. Though some may have been written by other authors, they were credited to Merritt when published.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sFuUvSwhY-kC&pg=PA296&lpg=PA296&dq=%22Reflections+in+the+Moon+Pool,+A+Biography,+but+may+in+fact+be+by+other+writers%22&source=bl&ots=JcPAjZu7nK&sig=VREupKfXFG8DS0-gCcHSqLHlx6A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Cj0LUqX-JKOD4gSJiYCYDw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Reflections%20in%20the%20Moon%20Pool%2C%20A%20Biography%2C%20but%20may%20in%20fact%20be%20by%20other%20writers%22&f=false The Moon Pool]</ref>

==Reputation==
Merritt was a major influence on [[H. P. Lovecraft]]<ref>"I was extremely glad to meet Merritt in person, for I have admired his work for 15 years. ... he has a peculiar power of working up an atmosphere and investing a region with an aura of unholy dread" H.P. Lovecraft's letter to [[R. H. Barlow]] (January 13, 1934) [http://skullsinthestars.com/2009/02/22/a-merritts-dwellers-in-the-mirage/] <!-- Presumably reprinted in ''O fortunate Floridian: H.P.

Merritt isn't read much today, but his fantasy novels were quite popular throughout the '20s and '30s. Beginning with ''[[The Moon Pool]]'' in 1919, he produced a series of novels about caverns, lost races, ancient ray machines, shell-shaped hovercraft, and other marvels. He was also a member of the original [[Fortean Society]] and the editor of ''[[The American Weekly]]'', a Sunday newspaper supplement that often featured scientific and historical oddities. Shaver thought Merritt had seen the caves but could only mention them in fiction. One might also suspect that Merritt's novels had influenced Shaver's beliefs. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823053354/http://www.fatemag.com/issues/2000s/2005-06ShaverRevival.html |archive-date=August 23, 2009}}</ref> and highly esteemed by his friend and frequent collaborator [[Hannes Bok]], a science fiction illustrator. [[Karl Edward Wagner]] included ''Burn Witch Burn'' on his list of "The Thirteen Best Supernatural Horror Novels" in the May 1983 issue of ''[[Twilight Zone literature|The Twilight Zone Magazine]]''.<ref>N.

==Adaptations==
Merritt's work has been adapted numerous times in film and television. These include:

* ''[[Seven Footprints to Satan (film)|Seven Footprints to Satan]]'' (1929), adapted from the novel of the same name and directed by [[Benjamin Christensen]].
* ''[[The Devil-Doll]]'' (1936) adapted from the novel ''[[Burn Witch Burn! (novel)|Burn Witch Burn!]]'' and directed by [[Tod Browning]].
* ''[[The Curse of the Doll People|Muñecos infernales]]'' (1961) adapted from the novel ''[[Burn Witch Burn! (novel)|Burn Witch Burn!]]'' and directed by [[Benito Alazraki]].<ref>Also known as ''[[The Curse of the Doll People]],'' this Mexican horror film is usually said to have been inspired by Tod Browning's ''The Devil-Doll.'' But a closer examination shows that it was adapted directly from Merritt's novel. The film includes many characters, situations, scenes and speeches from the novel, none of which are present in ''The Devil-Doll.'' Yet the film does not credit Merritt with the story; it gives that honor to screenplay author Alfredo Salazar instead.</ref>
