'''Osip Emilyevich Mandelstam'''<ref>Also romanized '''Osip Mandelstam''', '''Ossip Mandelstamm'''</ref> ({{lang-rus|О́сип Эми́льевич Мандельшта́м|p=ˈosʲɪp ɨˈmʲilʲjɪvʲɪtɕ mənʲdʲɪlʲˈʂtam}}; {{OldStyleDate|14 January|1891|2 January}} – 27 December 1938) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] poet. He was one of the foremost members of the [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeist]] school. 

Osip Mandelshtam was arrested during the repression of the 1930s and sent into internal exile with his wife, [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]]. Given a reprieve of sorts, they moved to [[Voronezh]] in southwestern Russia. In 1938 Mandelstam was arrested again and sentenced to five years in a [[corrective-labour camp]] in the Soviet [[Far East]]. He died that year at a transit camp near Vladivostok.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last1=Delgado|first1=Yolanda|last2=RIR|first2=specially for|date=2014-07-18|title=The final days of Russian writers: Osip Mandelstam|url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/2014/07/18/the_final_days_of_russian_writers_osip_mandelstam_36779|access-date=2020-06-08|website=www.rbth.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

In April 1908, Mandelstam decided to enter the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] to study literature and philosophy, but he left the following year to attend the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany. In 1911, he decided to continue his education at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]], from which Jews were excluded. He converted to [[Methodism]] and entered the university the same year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aalto.vbgcity.ru/node/72 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316142516/http://aalto.vbgcity.ru/node/72 |archive-date=2012-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He did not complete a formal degree.<ref name=Charny>{{Cite web |url=https://www.litvaksig.org/html/onlinejournals/mandelshtam.htm |title="Osip Emilyevich Mandelshtam (1889-1938) Russian Poet"|website=LitvakSIG Lithuanian-Jewish Special Interest Group}}</ref>

Mandelstam's poetry, acutely [[Populism|populist]] in spirit after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|first Russian revolution]] in 1905, became closely associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] imagery. In 1911, he and several other young Russian poets formed the "Poets' Guild", under the formal leadership of [[Nikolai Gumilyov]] and [[Sergei Gorodetsky]]. The nucleus of this group became known as [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeists]]. Mandelstam wrote the manifesto for the new movement: ''The Morning Of Acmeism'' (1913, published in 1919).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mandelshtam's Acmeist Manifesto|last1=Brown|first1=C.|last2=Mandelshtam|first2=O.|journal=Russian Review|volume=24|issue=1|year=1965|pages=46–51|doi=10.2307/126351|jstor=126351}}</ref> In 1913 he published his first collection of poems, ''The Stone'';<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title="It gets people killed": Osip Mandelstam and the perils of writing poetry under Stalin|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/poetry/2017/05/it-gets-people-killed-osip-mandelstam-and-perils-writing-poetry-under-stalin|access-date=2020-06-08|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en}}</ref> it was reissued in 1916 under the same title, but with additional poems included.

==Career, political persecution and death==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2020}}{{see also|Stalin Epigram}}
In 1922, Mandelstam and Nadezhda moved to [[Moscow]]. At this time, his second book of poems, ''Tristia'', was published in [[Berlin]].<ref name=":2" /> For several years after that, he almost completely abandoned poetry, concentrating on essays, literary criticism, memoirs ''The Noise Of Time'',  ''Feodosiya'' - both 1925; (''Noise of Time'' 1993 in English) and small-format prose ''The Egyptian Stamp'' (1928). As a day job, he translated literature into Russian (19 books in 6 years), then worked as a correspondent for a newspaper.

=== First arrest ===
In the autumn of 1933, Mandelstam composed the poem "[[Stalin Epigram]]", which he recited at a few small private gatherings in Moscow. The poem deliberately insulted the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the original version, the one that was handed in to the police, he called Stalin the "peasant slayer", as well as pointing out that he had fat fingers. Six months later, on the night of May 16–17, 1934, Mandelstam was arrested by three [[NKVD]] officers who arrived at his flat with a search warrant signed by [[Yakov Agranov]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shentalinsky |first1=Vitaly |title=The KGB's Literary Archive, The Discovery of the Ultimate Fate of Russia's Suppressed Writers |date=1995 |publisher=The Harvill Press |location=London |isbn=1-86046-072-0 |pages=168–69}}</ref> His wife hoped at first that this was over a fracas that had taken place in Leningrad a few days earlier, when Mandlestam slapped the writer [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Alexei Tolstoy]] because of a perceived insult to Nadezhda, but under interrogation he was confronted with a copy of the Stalin Epigram, and immediately admitted to being its author, believing that it was wrong in principle for a poet to renounce his own work. Neither he nor Nadezhda had ever risked writing it down, suggesting that one of the trusted friends to whom he recited it had memorised it, and handed a written copy to the police. It has never been established who it was.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shentalinksy |title=The KGB's Literaty Archive |page=172}}</ref>

Mandelstam anticipated that insulting Stalin would carry the death penalty, but Nadezhda and [[Anna Akhmatova]] started a campaign to save him, and succeeded in creating "a kind of special atmosphere, with people fussing and whispering to each other." The Lithuanian ambassador in Moscow, [[Jurgis Baltrušaitis]] warned delegates at a conference of journalists that the regime appeared to be on the verge of killing a renowned poet.<ref name="Fear">{{cite book |last1=McSmith |first1=Andy |title=Fear and the Muse |pages=110–11}}</ref> Boris Pasternak - who disapproved of the tone of the Epigram - nonetheless appealed to the eminent Bolshevik, [[Nikolai Bukharin]], to intervene. Bukharin, who had known the Mandelstams since the early 1920 and had frequently helped them, approached the head of the NKVD, and wrote a note to Stalin.

=== Exile ===
On 26 May, Mandelstam was sentenced neither to death, nor even the [[Gulag]], but to three years' exile in [[Cherdyn, Perm Krai|Cherdyn]] in the Northern [[Ural (region)|Ural]], where he was accompanied by his wife. This escape was looked upon as a "miracle"<ref name="Fear"/> - but the strain of his interrogation had driven Mandelstam to the verge of insanity. He later wrote that "at my side, my wife did not sleep for five nights"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandelstam |first1=Osip (translated by Richard & Elizabth McKane) |title='Kama' The Moscow & Voronezh Notebooks |date=2003 |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |location=Tarset, Northumberland |isbn=978-1-85224-631-0 |page=128}}</ref> - but when they arrived at Cherdyn, she fell asleep, in the upper floor of a hospital, and he attempted suicide by throwing himself out of the window. His brother, Alexander, appealed to the police for his brother to be given proper psychiatric care, and on 10 June, there was a second "miracle", which banished  Mandelstam from the twelve largest Soviet cities, but otherwise allowed him to choose his place of exile.<ref name="Fear"/>

Mandelstam and his wife chose [[Voronezh]], possibly, partly, because the name appealed to him. In April 1935, he wrote a four line poem that included the pun - ''Voronezh - blazh', Voronezh - voron, nozh'' meaning 'Voronezh is a whim, Voronezh - a raven, a knife.'. Just after their arrival, Boris Pasternak was startled to receive a phone call from Stalin - his only conversation with the dictator, in which Stalin wanted to know whether Mandelstam really was a talented poet. "He's a genius isn't he?" he is reputed to have asked Pasternak.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandelstam |first1=Nadezhda |title=Hope Against Hope |page=146}}</ref>

During these three years, Mandelstam wrote a collection of poems known as the ''Voronezh Notebooks'', which included the cycle ''Verses on the Unknown Soldier''. He and his wife did not know about Stalin's phone call to Pasternak until months after it took place, and did not feel safe from arrest. When Akhmatova was paying them a visit, a couple of other friends unexpectedly knocked on the door. All of them thought it was the police. This inspired the lines written by Akhmatova in March 1936:

{{quote|''But in the room of the poet in disgrace''|}}
{{quote|''Fear and the Muse keep watch by turns.''|}}
{{quote|''And the night comes on''|}}
{{quote|''That knows no dawn.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Akhmatova |first1=Anna (translated by Judith Hemschemeyer |title="Voronezh", The Complete Poems of Anna Akhmatova |date=2006 |publisher=Zephyr |location=Boston |isbn=0-939010-27-5 |page=381}}</ref>|}}

Actually, the fact that Stalin had given an order to "isolate and preserve" Mandelstam meant that he was safe from further persecution, temporarily. In Voronezh, he was even granted a face-to-face meeting with the local head of the NKVD, [[Semyon Dukelsky]], who told him "write what you like", and turned down an offer by Mandelstam to send in every poem he wrote to police headquarters. After that meeting, police agents ceased shadowing the couple.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandelstam |first1=Nadezhda |title=Hope Against Hope |pages=206–209}}</ref> There is a story, possibly apochryphal, that Mandelstam even rang Dukelsky to recite poetry over the phone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nerler |first1=Pavel |title=Пусти меня, отдай меня, Воронеж ("Let me GO, Give me Back Voronezh" |date=24 June 2004 |url=https://iz.ru/news/291445 |publisher=Izvestya |access-date=12 December 2020}}</ref>

===Second arrest and death===
[[File:NKVD Mandelstam.jpg|thumb|[[NKVD]] photo after the second arrest, 1938]]
Mandelstam's three-year period of exile ended in May 1937, when the [[Great Purge]] was under way. The previous winter, he had forced himself to write his "Ode to Stalin," hoping it would protect him against further persecution. The couple no longer had the right to live in Moscow, so lived in nearby Kalinin ([[Tver]]), and visited the capital, where they relied on friends to put them up. In the spring of 1938, Mandelstam was granted an interview with the head of the Writers' Union [[Vladimir Stavsky]], who granted him a two-week holiday for two in a rest home outside Moscow. This was a trap. The previous month, on 16 March - the day after the Mandelstams' former protector, Nikolai Bukharin had been sentenced to death - Stavsky had written to the head of the NKVD, [[Nikolay Yezhov]], denouncing Mandelstam. Getting him out of Moscow made it possible to arrest him without setting off a reaction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McSmith |first1=Andy |title=Fear and the Muse |pages=194–195}}</ref> He was arrested while on holiday, on 5 May (ref. camp document of 12 October 1938, signed by Mandelstam), and charged with "[[counter-revolutionary]] activities." 

Four months later, on 2 August 1938,<ref>Extract from court protocol No. 19390/Ts</ref> Mandelstam was sentenced to five years in correction camps. He arrived at the Vtoraya Rechka (Second River) transit camp near [[Vladivostok]] in Russia's Far East. From the Vladperpunkt transit camp he sent his last letter to his brother and his wife:<ref>at 6 Gagarinsky Lane, Moscow.

|text=Dear Shura!

I'm in Vladivostok, [[Sevvostlag|SVITL]], barracks 11. I got 5 years for K.R.D.[counterrevolutionary activity] by the decision of the OSO [Special Committee of the NKVD]. From Moscow, left from [[Butyrka prison|Butyrok]] on September 9, arrived on October 12. Health is very poor. Exhausted to the extreme. Have lost weight, we're almost unrecognizable. But I don't know if there is any sense in sending clothes, food and money. Try it, all the same. I'm freezing without proper things. Nadinka, I don't know if you're alive, my dove. You, Shura, write to me about Nadia right away. There's a transit point here. They didn't take me to Kolyma. Wintering is possible.

My relatives, kiss you.

Aaxe.

Shurochka, I'm writing more. I've been going to work in recent days, and it's uplifting.

From our camp, a transit camp, they send one to the permanent camp. I obviously got caught in the "dropout" and we have to prepare for the winter.

On December 27, 1938, before his 48th birthday, Osip Mandelstam died in a transit camp of typhoid fever. His death was described later in a short story "Sherry Brandy" by [[Varlam Shalamov]].{{cn|date=July 2021}} Mandelstam's body lay unburied until spring, along with the other deceased. Then the entire "winter stack" was buried in a mass grave.<ref>Izvestia, January 8, 1991. Reproduced according to ed. - Osip Mandelstam and his time: Sat. memories. - Publisher L'Age d'Homme -Nash Dom, 1995 480 p. - p. 402. [https://imwerden.de/pdf/mandelstam_i_ego_vremya_1995__ocr.pdf]</ref>

Mandelstam's own prophecy was fulfilled: "Only in Russia is poetry respected, it gets people killed. Is there anywhere else where poetry is so common a motive for murder?" Nadezhda wrote memoirs about her life and times with her husband in ''Hope against Hope'' (1970)<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and ''Hope Abandoned''.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> She also managed to preserve a significant part of Mandelstam's unpublished work.

==Marriage and family==
In 1916, Mandelstam was passionately involved with the poet [[Marina Tsvetaeva|Marina Tsvetayeva]]. According to her biographer, "Of the many love affairs with men that Marina embarked upon with such intensity during this period, it was probably the only one that was physically consummated."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Feinstein |first1=Elaine |title=Marina Tsvetayeva |date=1989 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |page=56}}</ref> Mandelstam was said to have had an affair with the poet [[Anna Akhmatova]]. She insisted throughout her life that their relationship had always been a very deep friendship, rather than a sexual affair.<ref>Feinstein, Elaine. ''Anna of All the Russias'', New York: Vintage Press, 2007.</ref> In the 1910s, he was in love, secretly and unrequitedly, with a Georgian princess and St. Petersburg socialite [[Salomea Andronikova]], to whom Mandelstam dedicated his poem "Solominka" (1916).<ref>Zholkovsky, Alexander (1996), ''Text Counter Text: Rereadings in Russian Literary History'', p. 165. Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0-8047-2703-1}}.</ref>

In 1922, Mandelstam married [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]] in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], where she lived with her family,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dHbK0HT2I7gC&pg=PA75&dq=%22osip+mandelstam%22+married&hl=en&ei=eW7YTIi2Msa3hQflgPH1Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22osip%20mandelstam%22%20married&f=false Morley, David] (1991) ''Mandelstam Variations'' Littlewood Press p75 {{ISBN|978-0-946407-60-6}}</ref> but the coupled settled in Moscow.<ref name=":1" /> He continued to be attracted to other women, sometimes seriously. Their marriage was threatened by his falling in love with other women, notably Olga Vaksel in 1924-25 and [[Mariya Petrovykh]] in 1933–34.<ref>Clarence Brown, ''Mandelstam'', Cambridge University Press, 1973</ref> Nadezha Mandelstam formed a lifelong friendship with Anna Akhmatova, who was a guest in the Mandelstam's apartment when he was arrested for the first time, but complained that she could never be friendly with Tsvetayeva, partly because "I had decided on Akhmatova as 'top' woman poet". She also complained that Tsvetayeva could not take her eyes off her husband, and that "she accused me of being jealous of her."<ref name="ReferenceB">[[Nadezhda Mandelstam]] ''Hope Abandoned'' {{ISBN|0-689-10549-5}}</ref>

During Mandelstam's years of imprisonment, 1934–38, Nadezhda accompanied him into exile. Given the real danger that all copies of Osip's poetry would be destroyed, she worked to memorize his entire corpus, as well as to hide and preserve select paper manuscripts, all the while dodging her own arrest.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Nadezhda Mandelstam]] (1970, 1999) ''Hope against Hope'' {{ISBN|1-86046-635-4}}</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s, as the political climate thawed, she was largely responsible for arranging clandestine republication of Mandelstam's poetry.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
