'''Aki Ville Yrjänä''' (born 30 July 1967 in [[Kemi]]), better known by the [[stage name]], '''A.&nbsp;W. Yrjänä''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈɑːʋeː ˈyrjænæ}}), is a [[poet]] and the singer, [[bassist]], and primary [[songwriter]] of the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[CMX (band)|CMX]]. In addition to his musical work, he has published five collections of poems.

== Music ==

Yrjänä has studied [[theology]] and [[comparative religion]],<ref>[http://www.apu.fi/ajassa/article123342-1.html Apu<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012043405/http://www.apu.fi/ajassa/article123342-1.html |date=October 12, 2006 }}</ref> and his texts often contain strong [[Mythology|mythological]] imagery.<ref>[http://www.ylioppilaslehti.fi/2002/020920/juttu_aw.html Y L I O P P I L A S L E H T I 20. syyskuuta 2002<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226020201/http://www.ylioppilaslehti.fi/2002/020920/juttu_aw.html |date=December 26, 2005 }}</ref> His [[symbol]]ic texts are considered to be a major part of CMX's appeal. Yrjänä himself has said: "I've never tried to write cryptic text, but it seems I just think in a complicated manner."<ref>[http://nyt.hs.fi/musiikki/artikkeli/1135229913255 CMX: Epäkaupallinen avaruusooppera - nyt.hs.fi - Musiikki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Yrjänä also plays the guitar, and usually [[Musical composition|composes]] on the guitar rather than his primary instrument, the [[bass guitar]].<ref name="elvis">[http://www.elvisry.fi/022006/awyrjana.html SÄVELTÄJÄT JA SANOITTAJAT ELVIS ry. - A.

He has produced ''[[Rautakantele]]'' and co-produced a number of other CMX albums as well as albums by other artists, such as [[Pohjannaula]], Wilma and Little Mary Mixup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inkfish.fi/henkilot_yrjana.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827031846/http://www.inkfish.fi/henkilot_yrjana.php |archivedate=2007-08-27 }}</ref>

In 1997, Yrjänä wrote ''Silta Niilin yli'' that consisted of 18 songs for a seven-piece orchestra. It was performed on the Joensuun Laulujuhlat festival.<ref name="elvis"/> He has also collaborated with Sanna Kurki-Suonio and [[Henrik Otto Donner]] in composing a musical piece for the celebration of the 150th birthday of the Finnish [[national epic]] [[Kalevala]]. It was performed in the [[Helsinki Ice Hall]] in February 1999.<ref name="elvis"/>

== Poems ==

=== ''Arcana'' ===
In 1997, Yrjänä released his first poem book, ''Arcana''. [[Tommy Tabermann]], one of Finland's most popular contemporary poets, commented that the book "surprised him" and referred to Yrjänä as a "very promising fellow".<ref>[http://www.city.fi/artikkeli/Tommy+Tabermann/1977/ City.fi - Tommy Tabermann<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In response to criticism that the book contained too much obscure references for the average reader, Yrjänä published an [[Addendum#Books|appendix]] to ''Arcana'' on the CMX web site. He wrote that he "did not explain the poems - a poem can't be explained - only clarified the background of some expressions."<ref>[http://www.cmx.fi/arkisto/reader.php?file=liite_arcanaan CMX<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224095025/http://www.cmx.fi/arkisto/reader.php?file=liite_arcanaan |date=February 24, 2008 }}</ref>

=== ''Rota'' ===
''Rota'' was published in 2000 and divided the opinions of critics: some criticized his language as not being mature enough for serious poetry, and argued that he makes "very simple mistakes, the kind they warn you about on writing courses."<ref>[http://www.ylioppilaslehti.fi/2000/10/20/arvostelu-rokkarin-runous-ei-kolahda/ Arvostelu: Rokkarin runous ei kolahda › Ylioppilaslehti<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Others praised Yrjänä for his mythological visions and the massive [[intertextuality]] of the poems.<ref>[http://www.uta.fi/~anne.puumala/yrjana.htm Yrjänä, Rota<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212152848/http://www.uta.fi/~anne.puumala/yrjana.htm |date=February 12, 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.aamulehti.fi/vasara/lehdet/20020201/Arvostelut2.html Vasara | 01.02.2002 | mielipide | Kirja-arvostelu<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223022704/http://www.aamulehti.fi/vasara/lehdet/20020201/Arvostelut2.html |date=February 23, 2007 }}</ref> ''Arcana'' and ''Rota'' were later published as a [[Compact Disc|CD]] [[audiobook]] ''Arcana & Rota'', performed by Yrjänä himself.

=== ''Somnia'' ===
Yrjänä's third book, ''Somnia'', was a similar success. Jukka Koskelainen of [[Helsingin Sanomat]] appreciated Yrjänä's exotic imagery and knowledge of different philosophies and religions, although he felt that the writer's language lacks the finer nuances of some of his more experienced colleagues.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kirjat/artikkeli/Kolmetuhatta++kirjaa+vailla++hienovirityst%C3%A4/HS20031116SI1KU02n4q Yrjänä A. W. - Somnia - Johnny Kniga 2003 - Kirjat - HS.fi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Yrjänä has said in an interview that when ''Somnia'' was finished, he thought it was great, but half a year later he started thinking that half of the poems could have been left out.<ref name="turunsanomat">[http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kulttuuri/?ts=1,3:1005:0:0,4:5:0:1:2006-09-05,104:5:402927,1:0:0:0:0:0 Turun Sanomat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Published in 2003, it was Yrjänä's first book for Johnny Kniga [[publishing]] company. The first two collections were published by Like.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kirjailijat.kirjastot.fi/fi-fi/kirjailija.aspx?PersonId=1003&PageContent=-2 |title=Helsingin kaupunginkirjasto - Sanojen Aika - Kirjailija<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185539/http://kirjailijat.kirjastot.fi/fi-fi/kirjailija.aspx?PersonId=1003&PageContent=-2 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== ''Mechanema'' ===
In ''Mechanema'' (2006), the themes of [[alchemy]], [[metaphysics]] and ancient [[mythology]] were largely put to the background and accompanied by a melancholy everyday tone. Helsingin Sanomat regarded it as Yrjänä's best work so far.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kirjat/artikkeli/Profeetasta+tuli+runoilija/HS20060925SI1KU03kxx Yrjänä A.W. – Mechanema – Johnny Kniga 2006 – Kirjat – HS.fi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The poet himself has stated that there will be another four (or possibly five) books to the same series, and that the starting letters of the books will form a word. According to him, ''Mechanema'' started its life as a single epic poem, but the idea was later abandoned because he considered the book would become too hard for both the writer and the reader.<ref name="turunsanomat"/>
