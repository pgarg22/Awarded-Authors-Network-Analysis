'''Samuel Wagan Watson''' (born 1972) is a contemporary [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] [[Australian]] [[poet]].

==Early life==
Samuel Wagan Watson was born in 1972 in [[Brisbane]], to an Indigenous Australian father, the novelist and political activist, [[Sam Watson (activist)|Sam Watson]], and an Anglo-Australian mother. Watson grew up in Caboolture West and completed his secondary studies at [[Morayfield State High School]], with his sister Nicole, a lawyer. Watson is of [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans|German]], [[Bundjalung people|Bundjalung]] and [[Birri Gubba]] descent. In his youth, Watson enjoyed fishing and diving off the end of a jetty in Brisbane with friends.

==Career==
Watson originally was known as an author of short stories, however changed focus to poetry after many rejections from companies. Watson's shift was inspired by one such company noting that his writing contained good poetic elements. Watson's first poems were in [[sonnet]] form, in contrast to the [[free verse]] of his current style. The themes of his poetry range from observations of everyday experience, to the effects of colonisation in a vividly direct, almost tactile, language. 

In the late 1990s, Watson was invited to participate in a [[Brisbane City Council]] project to raise awareness of the [[Boondall Wetlands]], alongside fellow poets Brett Dionysius and Liz Hall-Downs. The project was set up to bring together historians, poets, photographers, environmentalists and designers and show the cultural history of the Wetlands, both the local indigenous history and the experiences of European settlers.<ref name = "bris">{{cite news |title= Brisbane City Council: Blackfellas Whitefellas Wetlands |url= http://www.ccd.net/projects/search.html?projectID=1015204304 |date= 4 July 2007 |access-date= 3 July 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070831075257/http://www.ccd.net/projects/search.html?projectID=1015204304 |archive-date= 31 August 2007 |url-status= dead|df= dmy-all }}</ref>  In 2000 an audio CD was produced of the three poets' work, called ''Blackfellas Whitefellas Wetlands''.  The very different voices and focus of the poets worked together to create a sense or place and of history.<ref name = "wetlands">{{cite news |title= The Cortland Review by David Kennedy |url= http://www.cortlandreview.com/features/02/04/kennedy.html |date=Spring 2002}}</ref>

His 2004 poetry collection ''Smoke Encrypted Whispers'' has been set to music by 23 Brisbane-based composers, who each wrote a two-minute piece to respond to a particular poem.  The project was commissioned by the clarinetist [[Paul Dean (clarinetist)|Paul Dean]], who conducted a recording of the work featuring soprano Margaret Schindler and the Southern Cross Soloists, with [[Ron Haddrick]] narrating.<ref name=lime>"Fine Australian poems in lovingly crafted musical settings", ''[[Limelight (magazine)|Limelight]]'', June 2013, p. 79</ref>

The [[JAXA|Japanese Aeronautical Exploration Agency]] has commissioned Watson to write some [[haiku]] to keep Japanese astronauts amused on the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=lime/>

Watson is sharing a house with his brother, who has been described in an interview as 'someone who loves to play music', and his spouse. 

Watson is currently touring Australia and delivering poetry courses in various schools, such as [[Brisbane Grammar School]], as a [[writer in residence]]. 

==Influences==
Watson recognises the influence of his parents in his work, and also cited [[Nick Cave]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Charles Bukowski]] and [[Robert Adamson (poet)|Robert Adamson]] as influences.<ref>{{cite news|title=Booked Out Speaker's Agency |url=http://www.bookedout.com.au/queensland/Samuel_Wagan_Watson/index.html |date=4 July 2007 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901005306/http://www.bookedout.com.au/queensland/Samuel_Wagan_Watson/index.html |archive-date=1 September 2007  }}</ref>
Watson says that music helps him write, and says that it 'is a major influence on (his) poetry'. He also says that music helps to block out outside noise, especially from his brother.
