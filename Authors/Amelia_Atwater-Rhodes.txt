==1999–2002: ''The Den of Shadows Quartet''==
[[File:Amelia Atwater-Rhodes books.jpg|thumb|250px|Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' novels from 1999-2012.]]
Atwater was born in 1984 to Susan Atwater-Rhodes, a vice principal of [[Acton-Boxborough Regional High School]].<ref name=fx>[http://www.teenfx.com/interview.cfm?prod=&sec=&inter_id=332 TeenFX.com, Interview with Amelia Atwater-Rhodes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814060838/http://www.teenfx.com/interview.cfm?prod=&sec=&inter_id=332 |date=2007-08-14 }} Retrieved on July 22, 2009.</ref>

Atwater-Rhodes wrote her first novel at the age of thirteen,<ref name=mirror/> which earned her the title of "teen successor to [[Anne Rice]]." At the time, she said she had over a dozen stories in various stages sitting on her shelves.

In middle school, Atwater-Rhodes was questioned by an English teacher when a girl she knew proceeded to brag that Atwater-Rhodes was trying to get a book published. As it turns out, the English teacher was also a literary agent and asked to read some of her work. This teacher later represented Atwater-Rhodes.<ref name=salon/><ref name=faq>[http://nyeusigrube.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.TheAuthor NyeusiWiki: FAQ: About the Author.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714215911/http://nyeusigrube.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.TheAuthor |date=2011-07-14 }} Published January 22, 2009.</ref>

She began writing her first novel'', [[In the Forests of the Night]]'', under the working title ''White Wine''. On May 11, 1997, after her best friend, Jessica, had picked the William Blake poem, "[[The Tyger|The Tiger]]", the book's final title was derived. The first draft of the novel was completed in August of that year. During the writing process, Atwater-Rhodes suffered from a case of [[writer's block]] and a [[computer virus]] crashed her computer.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://nyeusiwiki.blogspot.com/2009/12/in-forests-of-night.html|title=NyeusiWiki: In the Forest of the Night|work=Blogspot.com|publisher=Amelia Atwater-Rhodes|date=2009-12-08|accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> Atwater-Rhodes spent the next four months revising the novel before she submitted the manuscript on December 31.

In mid-February 1998, Atwater-Rhodes met her agent, [[Tom Hart (literary agent)|Tom Hart]], and he would go on to contact her to announce that Random House had accepted her manuscript for publication. Hart also stated that it would be published on April 14, 1998, her fourteenth birthday. The novel, however, was not published until May 11, 1999,<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Forests of the Night (Den of Shadows) (9780385326742): Amelia Atwater-Rhodes: Books|isbn = 0385326742}}</ref> two years after she began working on the manuscript. The novel was written in [[first-person narrative]], a feat she did not repeat in the three later novels. Hart stated that the novel was "the fastest sale [he] ever had."<ref name=mirror/>

''In the Forests of the Night'' was a huge success, gaining the attention of millions of young readers. Atwater-Rhodes spent the year making appearances in magazines and on talk shows, including ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''. The novel was praised highly by critics such as ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' who called it "Insightful...and imaginative".<ref name="demon">{{cite book |title=Demon in My View|author=[http://www.ameliaatwaterrhodes.com/ Amelia Atwater-Rhodes]|date=2000 |publisher=Delacorte Press, a Division of [[Random House]] |location=First page in book after the poem. |isbn=038532720X |page=ii }}</ref> Also during the year Atwater-Rhodes was working on the follow up to ''Forests'' called ''[[Demon in My View]]'' which was under the then working title ''Bitter Life''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyeusigrube.com/5books/pub/demon.php |title=The Book: Demon in My View |work=Amelia Atwater-Rhodes |publisher=Nyeusigrube.com |accessdate=2012-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312222835/http://www.nyeusigrube.com/5books/pub/demon.php |archivedate=2012-03-12 }}</ref> It was published in May 2000.<ref>{{cite book|title=Demon in My View (Den of Shadows) (9780385327206)|isbn = 038532720X|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2000}}</ref> The novel was well received by critics and was made an [[American Library Association|ALA]] Quick Pick for Young Adults.

Atwater-Rhodes graduated Concord-Carlisle High in 2001, a year early <ref name=mirror/> because she completed her junior and senior years simultaneously.<ref name=daily>[http://www.dailynewstranscript.com/archive/x1572629409 Daily News Transcript.com ''Writing their own tickets: Driven by an inexplicable urge, writers find success and failure along the path to publication.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214920/http://www.dailynewstranscript.com/archive/x1572629409 |date=2007-09-28 }} By Chris Bergeron. Posted Mar 16, 2002. Last update Jul 19, 2007</ref> In September 2001, she released her third novel, ''[[Shattered Mirror]]''<ref>{{cite book|title=Shattered Mirror (Den of Shadows) (9780385327930)|isbn = 0385327935|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2001}}</ref> and in May 2002 she released her fourth novel, ''[[Midnight Predator]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Midnight Predator (Den of Shadows) (9780385327947)|isbn = 0385327943|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2002}}</ref> Both novels were made an ALA Quick Pick.

==2003–2007: The Kiesha'ra Series==
In 2003, Atwater-Rhodes, who so far had published novels about vampires, took a change of course and began a series of books based on a world of [[shapeshifters]] that Atwater-Rhodes would call [[The Kiesha'ra Series]]. All the novels in the series are told in [[first-person narrative]], a feat she had not done since her first novel. The first volume in the set of novels was released in July 2003, titled ''[[Hawksong]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hawksong: The Kiesha'ra: Volume One (9780385730716)|isbn = 0385730713|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2003}}</ref> Despite the change in the subject topic the book was just as successful as her previous novels being made an ALA Quick Pick, it also won the  ''[[School Library Journal]]'' Best Book of the Year, and was selected by ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'' for their "Best Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror". ''Hawksong'' tells the story of a young woman named Danica Shardae, who is a princess and hawk shapeshifter of the Avian court, who also narrates the story. She tells of how all she has known all her life is war and all that she wants is to put an end to it.

The second novel in The Kiesha'ra Series, ''[[Snakecharm]]'' was released in September 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005Q6ALLQ/|title=Snakecharm: The Kiesha'ra: Volume Two|accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> The novel is told by Danica's husband, Zane Cobriana, and continues where ''Hawksong'' left off. The third novel in the series, ''[[Falcondance]]'' was released in September 2005<ref>{{cite book|title=Falcondance: The Kiesha'ra: Volume Three (9780385731942)|isbn = 0385731949|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2005}}</ref> and is told by Nicias Silvermead. The story takes place nineteen years after the events of ''Snakecharm''.

The fourth novel in the series, ''[[Wolfcry]]'' was released in September 2006.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wolcry: The Kiesha'ra Series (9780385731959)|isbn = 0385731957|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2006}}</ref> The story is told by Oliza Shardae Cobriana, the daughter of Zane and Danica. The events tell the story of her struggle trying to maintain the peace that her parents had started but she is abducted and the journey takes her through a transformation which causes her to abdicate the throne of Wyvern's Court. The fifth and final novel in the Kiesha'ra series, ''[[Wyvernhail]]'', was released in September 2007<ref>{{cite book|title=Wyvernhail: The Kiesha'ra: Volume Five (9780385734363)|isbn = 978-0385734363|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2007}}</ref> and takes place shortly after the events of ''Wolfcry''. The story is told by Hai and reveals everything that was hinted at in the prior novels.

All the novels in the Kiesha'ra series were well received by critics with the ''School Library Journey'' calling ''Hawksong'' "A stunning adventure." and praising ''Falcondance'' as "Uniquely drawn and...vividly described". ''Voice of Youth Advocates'' called ''Snakecharm'' "Amazing." and praised Atwater-Rhodes' writing abilities in ''Wolfcry'' stating that she "is a fantastic storyteller." while calling ''Wyvernhail'' "Compelling and well-developed." ''Wolfcry'' was giving the IRA-CBC Young Adult's Choice.<ref>{{cite book|title=Persistence of Memory|author=[http://www.ameliaatwaterrhodes.com/ Amelia Atwater-Rhodes]|date=2008|publisher=Delacorte Press, a Division of [[Random House]]|location=Back of dust jacket|isbn=978-0-385-73437-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/persistenceofmem00atwa}}</ref>

==2008–2013: Return to Den of Shadows==

To mark this, her first four novels, ''In the Forests of the Night'', ''Demon in My View'', ''Shattered Mirror'' and ''Midnight Predator'' respectively, were re-issued with new cover art for the Den of Shadows and the same four novels were released in an [[Omnibus edition|omnibus]] called ''The Den of Shadows Quartet'' on August 11, 2009.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Den of Shadows Quartet (9780385738941): Amelia Atwater-Rhodes: Books|isbn = 978-0385738941|last1 = Atwater-Rhodes|first1 = Amelia|year = 2009}}</ref>

A previous site, [[The Den of Shadows]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometonyeusigrube.blogspot.com/p/den-of-shadows.html|title=The Blog: The Den of Shadows|work=Amelia Atwater-Rhodes|publisher=Blogspot.com|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref> became defunct in late 2015.<ref name="blogpost20151022">{{cite web|url=http://welcometonyeusigrube.blogspot.com/2015/10/sitemessage-board-outage.html|title=The Blog: The Den of Shadows|work=Amelia Atwater-Rhodes|publisher=Blogspot.com|accessdate=2015-12-12}}</ref> The original name of the site, [[Nyeusigrube]], translates in the language of her characters as "Den of Shadows."

==Common themes and traits==
*The books often have misunderstood, quiet, lonesome protagonists who often have supernatural abilities along with a tough exterior and interior. (''[[Demon in My View]]'', ''[[Midnight Predator]]'', ''[[Persistence of Memory]]'')
*The protagonists are usually not pristine and clean of all evil traits. They usually have had difficult or unpredictable pasts. (''Demon in My View'', ''Midnight Predator'', ''[[Falcondance]]'', ''[[Wolfcry]]'', ''[[Wyvernhail]]'')
*The antagonists are often extremely violent, politically powerful, possess supernatural powers, think highly of themselves, and have "short fuses." A prime example of this would be Jeshickah from ''Midnight Predator'' or Fala from ''Demon in My View''.
*Atwater-Rhodes often describes architecture and art in her work. (''Wolfcry'', ''Persistence of Memory'')
*Characters are often nonchalant about death and usually end up in a complicated romance by the story's end. (D''emon in My View'', ''[[Shattered Mirror]]'', ''[[Hawksong]]'', ''Falcondance'', ''Wolfcry'', ''Persistence of Memory'')
