'''Edith Ogden Harrison''' (16 November 1862 &ndash; 22 May 1955) was a well-known and prolific author of [[Children's literature|children's books]] and [[fairy tale]]s in the early decades of the 20th century. She was also the wife of [[Carter Harrison, Jr.]], five-term [[List of mayors of Chicago|mayor]] of [[Chicago]].

==Biography==
Edith Ogden was born to [[Robert N. Ogden, Jr.]] and Sarah L Beattie,<ref name=b>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA468&dq=Edith+Ogden+Harrison%22&id=L3JVAAAAMAAJ&output=html Wheeler, William Ogden, Lawrence Van Alstyne, and Charles Burr Ogden. 1907. ''The Ogden family in America, Elizabethtown branch, and their English ancestry; John Ogden, the Pilgrim, and his descendants,'' 1640-1906. Philadelphia: Printed for private circulation by J.B. Lippincott Co. pp 468-70]</ref> and raised in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]; she was a "belle of cultured, aristocratic habits who acquitted herself well in the parlors of the [[Potter Palmer]]s and [[Marshall Field]]s" and other Chicago notables.<ref>Edward R. Kantowicz, "Carter Harrison II: The Politics of Balance," in ''The Mayors: The Chicago Political Tradition,'' ed. by Paul Michael Green and Melvin G. Holli, Carbondale, IL, Southern Illinois University Press, 2005; p. 20.</ref> She married Carter Harrison on December 14, 1887. Their first child died in infancy in 1889; they had two surviving children, Carter Henry Harrison V, born June 28, 1891, and Edith Ogden Harrison II, born January 21, 1896. (Their son was the fifth of that name because his father was, formally, Carter Henry Harrison IV. He was known in his political career as "Junior" because his father, [[Carter Harrison, Sr.|Carter Henry Harrison III]], had preceded him in office and had been one of Chicago's most famous mayors.<ref>Erik Larsen, ''The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America'', New York, Crown, 2003.</ref> Confusion arises when "Junior" is erroneously referred to as "Carter Harrison II.") The couple celebrated the fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1937.

In the first phase of her literary career, Edith O. Harrison concentrated on children's literature; later she wrote travel books and autobiographical works. Her early book ''[[Prince Silverwings]]'' was adapted by family acquaintance [[L. Frank Baum]] for a dramatization that never made it to the stage.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn]], David L. Greene, and Peter E. Hanff, "The Faltering Flight of Prince Silverwings," ''[[The Baum Bugle]]'', Vol. 18 No. 2 (Autumn 1974), pp. 4-10.</ref> (All Chicago theaters were closed after the [[Iroquois Theater fire]] on 30 December 1903 caused 570 fatalities.) In the process, influences from Harrison's book appear to have found their way into Baum's works.<ref>Katharine Rogers, ''L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography,'' New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; pp. 102-3.</ref>

She did not abandon her theatrical ambitions: over a number of years Harrison and Baum tried to establish a children's theater in Chicago. They were still working on the project as late as 1915, but without success.<ref>L. Frank Baum, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; Introduction, pp. lxix-lxx.</ref>

Harrison's 1912 novel ''The Lady of the Snows'' was made into a film of the same title in 1915. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110520015921/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/228980/The-Lady-of-the-Snows/overview]
