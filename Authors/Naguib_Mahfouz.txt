'''Naguib Mahfouz Abdelaziz Ibrahim Ahmed Al-Basha''' ({{lang-arz|نجيب محفوظ عبد العزيز ابراهيم احمد الباشا}}), {{IPA-arz|næˈɡiːb mɑħˈfuːzˤ|IPA}}; 11 December 1911 &ndash; 30 August 2006) was an Egyptian writer who won the 1988 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Mahfouz is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of [[Arabic literature]], along with [[Taha Hussein]], to explore themes of [[existentialism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Haim Gordon|title=Naguib Mahfouz's Egypt: Existential Themes in His Writings|url=http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336/0313268762|accessdate=2007-04-26|doi=10.1336/0313268762|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042834/http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336%2F0313268762|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref> He is the only Egyptian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. He published 35 novels, over 350 short stories, 26 movie scripts, hundreds of op-ed columns for Egyptian newspapers, and seven plays over a 70-year career, from the 1930s until 2004. All of his novels take place in Egypt, and always mentions the [[lane]], which equals the world. His most famous works include ''[[Cairo Trilogy|The Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]''. Many of Mahfouz's works have been made into [[Egyptian cinema|Egyptian]] and foreign films; no Arab writer exceeds Mahfouz in number of works that have been adapted for cinema and television. While Mahfouz's literature is classified as [[Literary realism|realist]] literature, [[Existentialism|existential]] themes appear in it.<ref>{{cite web|author=حايم غوردون|title=مصر نجيب محفوظ: الثيمات الوجودية في كتاباته|url=https://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336/0313268762|access-date=2007-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015303/http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336%2F0313268762|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Mahfouz was born in a lower middle-class Muslim Egyptian family in [[Old Cairo]] in 1911. The first part of his compound given name was chosen in appreciation of the well-known obstetrician, [[Naguib Pasha Mahfouz]], who oversaw his difficult birth.<ref name="حياة نجيب محفوظ">[https://www.naguib-mahfouz.com/life.htm حياة نجيب محفوظ]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722130132/https://www.naguib-mahfouz.com/life.htm |date=22 July 2015}}</ref> Mahfouz was the seventh and the youngest child, with four brothers and two sisters, all of them much older than him. (Experientially, he grew up an "only child.") The family lived in two popular districts of Cairo: first, in the Bayt al-Qadi neighborhood in the Gamaleya quarter in the old city, from where they moved in 1924 to [[Abbassia|Abbaseya]], then a new Cairo suburb north of the old city, locations that would provide the backdrop for many of Mahfouz's later writings. His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been "old-fashioned", was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934. Mahfouz's mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an [[Al-Azhar]] sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations such as the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Egyptian Pyramids|Pyramids]].<ref name="El-Enany7"/>

The Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing. In an interview, he elaborated on the stern religious climate at home during his childhood. He stated that "You would never have thought that an artist would emerge from that family."<ref name="El-Enany7">{{cite book|author=Rasheed El-Enany|author-link=Rasheed El-Enany|title=Naguib Mahfouz: The Pursuit of Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hit7oPTOKf0C|access-date=25 September 2012|date=25 June 1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-07395-0}}</ref>

The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old. From the window he saw British soldiers firing at the demonstrators in an effort to disperse them.<ref>Stock, A Mummy Awakens: The Pharaonic Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz, pg. 13-14</ref> According to Mahfouz, "You could say ... that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution", he later said.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In his early years, Mahfouz read extensively and was influenced by Hafiz Najib, [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Salama Moussa]], the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual.<ref name="paris">{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2062/the-art-of-fiction-no-129-naguib-mahfouz|journal=The Paris Review|title=Naguib Mahfouz, The Art of Fiction No. 129|date=Summer 1992|author=Charlotte El Shabrawy|volume=Summer 1992|issue=123|access-date=25 September 2012}}</ref>

After completing his secondary education, Mahfouz was admitted in 1930 to the Egyptian University (now [[Cairo University]]), where he studied philosophy, graduating in 1934. By 1936, having spent a year working on an M.A. in philosophy, he decided to discontinue his studies and become a professional writer. Mahfouz then worked as a journalist for al-Risala, and contributed short stories to ''Al-Hilal'' and ''[[Al-Ahram]]''.{{fact|date=August 2021}}

== Civil service ==
After receiving his bachelor's degree in Philosophy from [[Cairo University]] in 1934, Mahfouz joined the Egyptian civil service, where he continued to work in various positions and ministries until retirement in 1971. He served first as a clerk at Cairo University, then, in 1938, in the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Ministry of Islamic Endowments (Awqaf)]] as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Islamic Endowments. In 1945, he requested a transfer to the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|al-Ghuri Mausoleum]] library, where he interviewed residents of his childhood neighborhood as part of the "Good Loans Project."<ref>El-Enany, Rasheed. "Naguib Mahfouz: His Life and Times". [[Cairo]]:AUC Press, 2007. pp 170–174</ref> In the 1950s, he worked as Director of Censorship in the Bureau of Arts, as Director of the Foundation for the Support of the Cinema, and finally as a consultant to the Ministry of Culture.<ref name="nobel">{{cite book|author1=Tore Frängsmyr|author2=Sture Allén|title=Nobel Lectures: Literature, 1981–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrSuBE6OckgC&pg=PA121|access-date=26 September 2012|year=1993|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-1177-6|page=121}}</ref>

== Writing career ==
[[File:Naguib Mahfouz in 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Mahfouz in 1960s]]
Mahfouz published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts and five plays over a 70-year career. Possibly his most famous work, [[Cairo Trilogy|''The Cairo Trilogy'']], depicts the lives of three generations of different families in Cairo from [[Eastern Front (World War I)|World War I]] until after the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 military coup]] that overthrew [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. He was a board member of the publisher ''Dar el-Ma'aref''. Many of his novels were serialized in ''Al-Ahram'', and his writings also appeared in his weekly column, "Point of View". Before the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Novel~Tea Book Club discussion|url=http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/394616-september-2010-the-palace-walk-by-naguib-mahfouz|website=GoodReads|access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Writing style and themes ===
Most of Mahfouz's early works were set in [[Cairo]]. ''Abath Al-Aqdar (Mockery of the Fates)'' (1939), ''Rhadopis'' (1943), and ''Kifah Tibah (The Struggle of Thebes)'' (1944) were historical novels written as part of a larger unfulfilled 30-novel project. Inspired by [[Sir Walter Scott]] (1771–1832), Mahfouz planned to cover the entire [[history of Egypt]] in a series of books. However, following the third volume, his interest shifted to current settings and issues, as well as the psychological impact of [[social change]] on ordinary people.<ref name="aucp">{{cite web|title=Naguib Mahfouz (1911–2006)|url=http://www.aucpress.com/t-aboutnm.aspx|website=The American University in Cairo Press|publisher=AUC Press|access-date=26 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602051825/http://www.aucpress.com/t-aboutnm.aspx|archive-date=2 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Mahfouz's [[prose]] is characterised by the blunt expression of his ideas. His written works cover a broad range of topics, including the controversial and taboo such as [[socialism]], homosexuality, and God. Writing about some of these subjects was prohibited in Egypt.<ref name="aucp"/>

Mahfouz's works often deal with [[History of modern Egypt|Egypt's development during the 20th century]], and combined intellectual and cultural influences from both East and West. His own exposure to [[World literature|foreign literature]] began in his youth with the enthusiastic consumption of [[Detective fiction|Western detective stories]], [[Russian literature|Russian classics]], and [[Modernism|modernist writers]] as [[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[James Joyce]]. Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, usually ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of [[Values (Western philosophy)|Western values]].<ref name="aucp"/>

Mahfouz's central work in the 1950s was the ''[[Cairo Trilogy]]'', which he completed before the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|July Revolution]]. The novels were titled with the street names ''[[Palace Walk]]'', ''[[Palace of Desire (novel)|Palace of Desire]]'', and ''[[Sugar Street (Cairo)|Sugar Street]]''. Mahfouz set the story in the parts of Cairo where he grew up. The novels depict the life of the patriarch el-Sayyed Ahmed Abdel Gawad and his family over three generations, from [[World War I]] to the 1950s, when [[King Farouk I]] was overthrown. Mahfouz stopped writing for some years after finishing the trilogy.

Disappointed in the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] régime, which had overthrown the monarchy in 1952, he started publishing again in 1959, now prolifically pouring out novels, short stories, journalism, memoirs, essays, and screenplays.<ref name="aucp"/> He stated in a 1998 interview that he "long felt that Nasser was one of the greatest political leaders in modern history. I only began to fully appreciate him after he nationalized the [[Suez Canal]]."<ref>Hamad, Mahmoud. (2008) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lswOvpmvUwMC&pg=PA95&dq=Non-Aligned+Movement+Nasser&hl=en&sa=X&ei=W0DKUc_WD_Gn4APb0YGYDg&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Mahfouz&f=false When the Gavel Speaks: Judicial Politics in Modern Egypt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522022843/https://books.google.com/books?id=lswOvpmvUwMC&pg=PA95&dq=Non-Aligned+Movement+Nasser&hl=en&sa=X&ei=W0DKUc_WD_Gn4APb0YGYDg&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Mahfouz&f=false |date=22 May 2016 }}''. p. 96 (Hamad cites an interview of Mahfouz by ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' in September 1998.)</ref> His  non-fiction, including his journalism and essays and his writing on literature and philosophy, were published in four volumes from 2016.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mahfouz|first=Naguib|title=The Non-Fiction Writing of Mahfouz 1930–1994|publisher=Gingko Library|year=2020|isbn=9781909942523|location=London}}</ref>

His 1966 novel ''Tharthara Fawq Al-Nīl'' ([[Adrift on the Nile]]) is one of his most popular works. It was later made into a film called ''[[Chitchat on the Nile]]'' during the régime of [[Anwar al-Sadat]]. The story criticizes the decadence of Egyptian society during the Nasser era. It was [[List of books banned by governments|banned]] by [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] to avoid provoking Egyptians who still loved former president Nasser. Copies of the [[Book censorship|banned book]] were hard to find prior to the late 1990s.

The ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]'' (1959, also known as ''Children of the Alley'') one of Mahfouz's best known works, portrayed the patriarch Gebelaawi and his children, average Egyptians living the lives of [[Cain]] and [[Abel]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Mohammed]]. Gebelawi builds a mansion in an [[oasis]] in the middle of a barren desert; his estate becomes the scene of a family feud that continues for generations. "Whenever someone is depressed, suffering or humiliated, he points to the mansion at the top of the alley at the end opening out to the desert, and says sadly, 'That is our ancestor's house, we are all his children, and we have a right to his property. Why are we starving? What have we done?'" The book was [[Censorship in Islamic societies|banned throughout the Arab world]] except in [[Lebanon]] until 2006 when it was first published in Egypt. The work was prohibited because of its alleged [[Blasphemy law in Egypt|blasphemy]] through the [[Allegory|allegorical]] portrayal of God and the [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic]] faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and [[Islam]].

In the 1960s, Mahfouz further developed the theme that humanity is moving further away from God in his [[existentialism|existentialist]] novels. In ''[[The Thief and the Dogs]]'' (1961) he depicted the fate of a [[Marxism|Marxist]] thief who has been released from prison and plans revenge.<ref name="aucp"/>

In the 1960s and 1970s Mahfouz began to construct his novels more freely and often used [[Internal monologue|interior monologues]]. In [[Miramar (novel)|''Miramar'']] (1967) he employed a form of multiple [[First-person narrative]]s. Four narrators, among them a Socialist and a [[Nasserism|Nasserite]] opportunist, represent different political views. In the center of the story is an attractive servant girl. In ''[[Arabian Nights and Days]]'' (1979) and in [[The Journey of Ibn Fattouma|''The Journey of Ibn Fatouma'']] (1983) he drew on traditional Arabic narratives as [[subtext]]s. [[Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth|''Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth'']] (1985) deals with conflict between old and new religious truths.

Many of his novels were first published in serialized form, including ''Children of Gebelawi'' and ''[[Midaq Alley (novel)|Midaq Alley]]'' which was also adapted into a [[cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] starring [[Salma Hayek]] called [[Midaq Alley (film)|''El callejón de los milagros'']].

=== Political influence ===
[[File:Necip Mahfuz.jpg|thumb|upright|Mahfouz in the 1990s]]
Most of Mahfouz's writings deal mainly with politics, a fact he acknowledged: "In all my writings, you will find politics. You may find a story which ignores love or any other subject, but not politics; it is the very axis of our thinking".<ref name="El-Enany23">Rasheed El-Enany, ''Naguib Mahfouz: The Pursuit of Meaning'', Routledge, 1992, p. 23.</ref>

He espoused [[Egyptian nationalism]] in many of his works, and expressed sympathies for the post-World-War-era [[Wafd Party]].<ref name="paris"/> He was also attracted to socialist and [[democratic ideals]] early in his youth. The influence of socialist ideals is strongly reflected in his first two novels, ''Al-Khalili'' and ''New Cairo'', as well as many of his later works. Parallel to his sympathy for socialism and democracy was his [[antipathy]] towards [[Islamic extremism]].<ref name="aucp"/>

In his youth, Mahfouz had personally known [[Sayyid Qutb]] when Qutb was showing a greater interest in [[literary criticism]] than in [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; Qutb later became a significant influence on the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. In the mid-1940s, Qutb was one of the first critics to recognize Mahfouz's talent, and by the 1960s, near the end of Qutb's life, Mahfouz even visited him in the hospital. But later, in the semi-autobiographical novel ''Mirrors'', Mahfouz drew a negative portrait of Qutb. He was disillusioned with the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]] and by Egypt's defeat in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. He had supported the principles of the revolution, but became disenchanted, saying that the practices failed to live up to the original ideals.

Mahfouz's writing influenced a new generation of Egyptian lawyers, including Nabil Mounir and Reda Aslan.<ref name="El-Enany23"/>

=== Reception ===
Mahfouz's translated works received praise from American critics:

"The alleys, the houses, the palaces and mosques and the people who live among them are evoked as vividly in Mahfouz's work as the streets of London were conjured by Dickens."
—''[[Newsweek]]''<ref name="aucp"/>

"Throughout Naguib Mahfouz's fiction there is a pervasive sense of metaphor, of a literary artist who is using his fiction to speak directly and unequivocally to the condition of his country. His work is imbued with love for Egypt and its people, but it is also utterly honest and unsentimental."
—''[[Washington Post]]''<ref name="aucp"/>

"Mahfouz's work is freshly nuanced and hauntingly lyrical. The Nobel Prize acknowledges the universal significance of [his] fiction."
—''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref name="aucp"/>

"Mr. Mahfouz embodied the essence of what makes the bruising, raucous, chaotic human anthill of Cairo possible."
—''[[The Economist]]''<ref name="aucp"/>

==== Nobel Prize for Literature ====
Mahfouz was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Arab writer to have won the award. Shortly after winning the prize Mahfouz was quoted as saying: 
{{quote|The Nobel Prize has given me, for the first time in my life, the feeling that my literature could be appreciated on an international level. The Arab world also won the Nobel with me. I believe that international doors have opened, and that from now on, literate people will consider Arab literature also. We deserve that recognition.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Luxner |first=Larry |date=March–April 1988 |title=A Nobel for the Arab Nation |url=https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/198902/a.nobel.for.the.arab.nation.htm |magazine=Aramco World |location=Houston |publisher=Aramco Services Company |access-date=June 21, 2020 }}</ref>}}

The Swedish letter to Mahfouz praised his "rich and complex work":

{{quote|[It] invites us to reconsider the fundamental things in life. Themes like the nature of time and love, society and norms, knowledge and faith recur in a variety of situations and are presented in thought-provoking, evocative, and clearly daring ways. And the poetic quality of your prose can be felt across the language barrier. In the prize citation you are credited with the forming of an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.<ref>{{cite web|title=Award Ceremony Speech|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1988/presentation-speech.html|website=Nobel Prize.org|publisher=Nobel Media|access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>}}

Because Mahfouz found traveling to Sweden difficult at his age, he did not attend the award ceremony.

=== Political involvement ===
Mahfouz did not shrink from controversy outside of his work. As a consequence of his support for Sadat's [[Camp David Accords|Camp David peace treaty]] with Israel in 1978, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel Prize. Like many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on an Islamic fundamentalist "death list".

He defended British-Indian writer [[Salman Rushdie]] after Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] condemned Rushdie to death in a 1989 [[The Satanic Verses controversy|fatwa]], but also criticized Rushdie's novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' as "insulting" to Islam. Mahfouz believed in [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], and, although he did not personally agree with Rushdie's work, he spoke out against the ''fatwa'' condemning him to death for it.

In 1989, after Ayatollah Khomeini's ''fatwa'' calling for Rushdie and his publishers to be killed, Mahfouz called Khomeini a terrorist.<ref>{{cite news|author=Deseret Morning News editorial |title=The legacy of a laureate |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060907/ai_n16725709 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628114203/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060907/ai_n16725709 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2009 |work=Deseret News |date=7 September 2006 |access-date=20 September 2007 }}</ref> Shortly after, Mahfouz joined 80 other intellectuals in declaring that "no [[blasphemy]] harms Islam and Muslims so much as the call for murdering a writer."<ref>''Le Monde'', 8 March 1989</ref>

== Assassination attempt and aftermath ==
The publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' revived the controversy surrounding Mahfouz's novel ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]''. Death threats against Mahfouz followed, including one from the "blind sheikh," Egyptian-born [[Omar Abdul-Rahman]].  Mahfouz was given police protection, but in 1994 an extremist succeeded in attacking the 82-year-old novelist by stabbing him in the neck outside his Cairo home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5297470.stm|work=BBC News|title=President pays tribute to Mahfouz|date=30 August 2006}}</ref>

He survived, permanently affected by damage to nerves of his right upper limb. After the incident Mahfouz was unable to write for more than a few minutes a day and consequently produced fewer and fewer works. Subsequently, he lived under constant bodyguard protection. Finally, in the beginning of 2006, the novel was published in Egypt with a preface written by Ahmad Kamal Aboul-Magd. After the threats, Mahfouz stayed in Cairo with his lawyer, Nabil Mounir Habib. Mahfouz and Mounir would spend most of their time in Mounir's office; Mahfouz used Mounir's library as a reference for most of his books. Mahfouz stayed with Mounir until his death.<ref name="nobelprize">{{cite web|title=Naguib Mahfouz – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1988/mahfouz-bio.html|website=nobelprize.org}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Mahfouz remained a bachelor until age 43 because he believed that, with its numerous restrictions and limitations, marriage would hamper his literary future.<ref name="paris"/> "I was afraid of marriage . . . especially when I saw how busy my brothers and sisters were with social events because of it. This one went to visit people, that one invited people. I had the impression that married life would take up all my time. I saw myself drowning in visits and parties. No freedom."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=El Shabrawy|first=Charlotte|title=Naguib Mahfouz, The Art of Fiction No. 129|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2062/the-art-of-fiction-no-129-naguib-mahfouz|magazine=The Paris Review|access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>

However, in 1954, he quietly married a [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] woman from [[Alexandria]], Atiyyatallah Ibrahim,<ref>El-Enany, Rasheed. "Naguib Mahfouz: His Life and Times". [[Cairo]]:AUC Press, 2007. p 172</ref> with whom he had two daughters, Fatima and Umm Kalthum. The couple initially lived on a houseboat in the [[Agouza]] section of Cairo on the west bank of the [[Nile]], then moved to an apartment along the river in the same area. Mahfouz avoided public exposure, especially inquiries into his private life, which might have become, as he put it, "a silly topic in journals and radio programs."<ref name="aucp"/>

Mahfouz distinctly did not like to travel. [[Belgrade]] was one of the few cities in which he gladly went and he expressed great respect for [[Serbia]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Serbia|first=RTS, Radio televizija Srbije, Radio Television of|title=Нагиб Махфуз, нобеловац који није волео да путује, осим у Београд|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/ci/kulturno/story/3149/vest/4222952/nagib-mahfuz-adligat-srpsko-egipatsko-prijateljstvo.html|access-date=2021-01-17|website=www.rts.rs}}</ref>
