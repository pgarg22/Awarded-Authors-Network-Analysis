'''Samuel Percival Maitland Hunt''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM|QSM}} (born 4 July 1946, Castor Bay, [[Auckland]]) is a New Zealand poet, especially known for his [[performance poetry|public performances of poetry]], not only his own poems, but also the poems of many other poets.<ref>[http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/huntsam.html HUNT, Sam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has been referred to as New Zealand's best-known poet.<ref>[http://www.hazard.co.nz/samhunt.html Making Tracks – Hazard Online<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311003114/http://www.hazard.co.nz/samhunt.html |date=11 March 2008 }}</ref>

==Background==
Hunt's father, a [[barrister]], was sixty when Hunt was born (his mother was 30). Hunt grew up at [[Castor Bay]] on the [[North Shore City|North Shore]] of [[Auckland]]. He became interested in poetry because of his mother. Hunt loved his unconventional parents and " ... early poems featuring his father remain amongst his best".<ref name="Robinson&Wattie">Paul Miller, "Sam Hunt", in Roger Robinson and Nelson Wattie (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'', Oxford University Press, Auckland, 1998, pp. 249 and 250.</ref> Hunt has an older brother, Jonathan, and they have an older half-brother, Alexander Hunt.

==Education==
Hunt was educated at [[St Peter's College, Auckland]] which he attended from 1958-63. At St Peter's<ref>Matt Elliott, ''On This Rock: 75 Years of St Peter's College, Mountain Road'', St Peter's College, Auckland, 2015, pp. 299-308.</ref> Hunt chafed under the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers in New Zealand|Christian Brothers']] authoritarianism. He would later recount on numerous occasions an incident in which he was strapped for reciting a poem by [[James K. Baxter]], which had sexual imagery, in the classroom. He was 14 at the time.<ref>Hunt's classmate and fellow poet [[Terry Locke]] has commented on this incident in [https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194833/http://www.hyperpoetics.ac.nz/Genres/LockeReviews/BaxterHunt.htm his review of ''James K. Baxter: Poems selected and introduced by Sam Hunt'', Auckland University Press, Auckland, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194833/http://www.hyperpoetics.ac.nz/Genres/LockeReviews/BaxterHunt.htm |date=26 April 2011 }} (retrieved 20 February 2012)</ref>

He had a pronounced stutter and an original style of dress and deportment which did not help. He expressed his individuality and the pressures of adolescence in poems. Some of his earliest poems were published in the St Peter's College annual magazines.<ref>''St Peter's College Magazines, 1963 and 1964''</ref> However, Hunt was good at some sports (running and diving) and had academic success. He has said that at the end of his sixth form year (he was 16) it was indicated to him by the headmaster of the school that he was not expected to return for the upper sixth form year. Hunt interpreted this as a request to leave school, which he did. In his final year at St Peter's his English master had been the poet [[K. O. Arvidson|Ken Arvidson]] and he had obtained University Entrance.<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/> 

Hunt has said that "if Mr Arvidson ... had not come to the school, I would not have lasted [at St Peter's] as long as I did, and I'd just turned sixteen when I left. He introduced me to poets like [[Gordon Challis]], who I've gone on loving ever since".<ref>Sam Hunt, ''Backroads, Charting a Poet's Life'', Craig Potton Publishing, Nelson, 2009, p. 24.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Arvidson endowed a poetry prize at St Peter's that was awarded to Hunt in 1963. One of Hunt's most reproduced poems is ''Brother Lynch'', a poem about a St Peter's College teacher, Brother J B Lynch, who was sympathetic to the young Hunt.<ref>''Sam Hunt: Selected Poems'', Penguin Books, Auckland, 1987, p. 63.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> An annual literature competition at St Peter's College is named after Hunt, and he has acted as its judge.<ref>Bronwen Sell, "From black sheep to honoured guest", ''NZ Herald'', 20 October 1999</ref>

In the period 1964-67, Hunt led a restless wandering life around New Zealand but particularly between Auckland and Wellington, attending university in both cities. He spent brief periods truck-driving and panel-beating, but he graduated from teachers college and taught briefly in a secondary school ([[Mana College]]) before deciding, in the late 1960s, to devote himself to poetry writing.<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/>

==Poet==
Hunt was among the younger New Zealand poets who began to be published in the late 1960s. He was first published in ''[[Landfall (journal)|Landfall]]'' in 1967.<ref>Elizabeth Caffin, "Poetry 1945–1990", in Terry Sturm (ed), ''The Oxford History of New Zealand Literature'', Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 418.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Hunt and other young poets were interested in daily linguistic usage and in the natural units of speech rather than any special poetic language. This expressed itself in a restoration of oral aspects of poetry and a stress on performance.<ref>Caffin, p. 420.</ref>

Many of his poems are characteristically expressions of feeling in a single surface line which leads to a poignant close. His own experience is his single subject; moments in his life, love and its loss, and poems about his father, mother and sons. A number of Hunt's works share common themes and characters, such as the poems ''[[Porirua]] Friday Night'' and ''Girl with Black Eye in Grocer's Shop'', both of which feature the same female character. "Everything Hunt writes is geared for personal performance: his lyrics are deliberately uncomplicated and colloquial; their traditional forms and regular rhythms allow 'the stories and myths [to be] fleshed and invested with energy and power'".<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/> Critics have noted Hunt's "unabashed [[romanticism]]". As Hunt wrote, ''Romantics, so they say,/ don't ever die!'' (second "Song"). Hunt has been called "a kind of ["[[Laconic phrase|laconic]]"] [[Jack Kerouac]]" – whose poems (he has called them "roadsongs") are direct and simple, "surprised by their own powerful emotion".<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/><ref name="Matthews">[https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/105913989/sam-hunt-the-last-outlaw-poet Philip Matthews, "Sam Hunt: The last outlaw poet", ''Stuff'', 11 August 2018] (Retrieved 21 October 2018)</ref> 

His romanticism has been compared with that of another New Zealand poet, [[Hone Tuwhare]] and their romanticism has been credited with contributing to the popularity of both poets.<ref>Caffin, p. 406.</ref> From the late 1960s until 1997, Hunt lived in a number of locations around the [[Pauatahanui]] inlet near Wellington. Many of the events in each dwelling are described in his verse, notably Bottle Creek (where he was joined by his famous black and white sheepdog, "Minstrel"), [[Battle of Battle Hill|Battle Hill]] (where his older son, Tom, was born), Death's Corner (formerly the farmhouse of a Mr Death) and then back to a boatshed in [[Paremata]]. Other poems (see above) are set in Porirua nearby. In the 1980s Hunt with [[Jack Lasenby]] and Ian Riggir (who both lived in Paremata) published poems on an 1886 upright press obtained from the Government Printing Office.   

In 1997 Hunt moved to [[Waiheke Island]] near Auckland.<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/> He later moved to [[Kaipara District|Kaipara]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]] with his younger son, Alf.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10650201">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10650201|title=Unassuming poet finds he's in good company|date=7 June 2010|agency=[[NZPA]]|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|access-date=7 November 2011}}</ref>

Hunt has been a central figure in New Zealand literature since the publication of his first mature work ''From Bottle Creek: Selected Poems 1967–69'' in 1969, published when the poet was aged just 23. He was a prolific writer in the 1970s–1990s. By focusing on the public performance aspects of poetry, Hunt was the "young poet" who most successfully reached a wider audience. Hunt pointed out how his poetry showed up the intellectuality of his contemporaries and their inclination to see popular culture as input rather than output.<ref name="Caffin">Caffin, pp. 427-28.</ref> Much of Hunt's output is in a style similar to those of [[Denis Glover]], [[Alistair Campbell (poet)|Alistair Campbell]], and [[James K. Baxter]].<ref name="Caffin"/><ref name="bookcouncil.org.nz">{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/huntsam.html |title=&#124; New Zealand Book Council |publisher=Bookcouncil.org.nz |date=1988-12-21 |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref> These poets were personal friends as well as influences on Hunt. Baxter was particularly important to, and wrote many poems for, Hunt. In one of the most important of these poems, ''Letter to Sam Hunt'', Baxter provided advice to the young Hunt.<ref name="bookcouncil.org.nz"/> Hunt frequently delivers Baxter poems in his performances and has claimed to have committed 200 of them to memory. Many of Hunt's performance tours have been undertaken with another poet and "fellow exuberant", [[Gary McCormick]].<ref name="Matthews"/>

Hunt has a high regard for other twentieth-century English language poets such as [[William Butler Yeats]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] (Hunt particularly loves Thomas' poem, ''[[In my Craft or Sullen Art]]'', which he sees as speaking to his own mission as a poet; he has said that he sometimes gives his occupation (to Customs Officers and such) as "sullen artist"). He also loves foreign language poets such as the Italian, [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], and the Hungarian poet [[Attila József|Jozsef Attila]] (Hunt often recites Attila's poem ''A Hetedik'' or ''The Seventh''<ref>[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/seventh-hetedik Attila József, The Seventh (A hetedik)] (Retrieved 24 April 2019)</ref> with which he is familiar in both English and Hungarian (having heard it as a child often delivered by a Hungarian friend of his family)). Hunt also admires the work of [[Bob Dylan]] amongst many other poets.<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/> As well as his own poems, Hunt, in his performances, recites poems by all these poets, whether famous, obscure or anonymous (from sometimes unlikely sources, for example ''[[The War Cry]]''). It is the quality of poems that is most important to him. After a publishing gap of nearly a decade, Hunt has published in most years since 2007. Hunt's book sales far exceed most New Zealand poets.<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/><ref name="Matthews"/>

In April 2009, New Zealand musician [[David Kilgour (musician)|David Kilgour]], of cult band [[The Clean]], released an album on which poems by Hunt were reinvented as song lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidkilgour.com/falling.htm |title=The Music And Art Of David Kilgour - davidkilgour.com - Falling Debris album with Sam Hunt |publisher=davidkilgour.com |date=2009-04-20 |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref> In 2014, Hunt and Kilgour reunited with The Heavy 8s, to create a second album. Unlike the first album, where Kilgour was lead vocalist, Hunt is the lead vocalist on "The 9th". The album was released in May 2015 to critical acclaim<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon Sweetman |url=http://www.offthetracks.co.nz/sam-hunt-with-david-kilgour-the-heavy-8s-the-9th/ |title=Sam Hunt with David Kilgour & The Heavy 8s: The 9th |publisher=Offthetracks.co.nz |date=2015-06-24 |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref> and was supported by gigs in Queenstown, Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland following its release.

==Iconic status==
Hunt's distinctive appearance – tall and thin, usually wearing long, tight, trousers ("[[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]] straights" he has called them) with vests and open-chested shirts, with long hair curling wildly above a well-worn face – is complemented by the familiar gravelly drawl, the rhythmic, sometimes [[staccato]] and sometimes [[incantation|incantatory quality]] of his recitation (often tapping his fingers or flicking a hand to emphasise the poetic beat) and the execution of occasional small dance-like steps of concentration. These have all made him one of New Zealand's most recognisable figures.<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/> Once, almost as well-known was his long-time travelling companion, the dog Minstrel. "A [[bard]] in the truest sense of the itinerant [[minstrel]], Hunt's [[Māori influence on New Zealand English#Word list|turangawaewae]] [i.e. 'one's own turf', literally: 'a place to stand'] is the public bar. Touring the pubs with bands of musos<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/muso "a musician, especially one overly concerned with technique; an avid music fan, especially one who has expensive stereo equipment", Oxford English Dictionaries definition of "muso"] (Retrieved 20 August 2013)</ref> and poets, he is himself one of the national icons".<ref name="Stead_White_Hunt">Oliver Stead, ''Art Icons of New Zealand:Lines in the Sand'', David Bateman, 2008, p. 71.</ref> Hunt is also a familiar figure in New Zealand figurative art, notably in paintings by [[Robin White (artist)|Robin White]], such as in ''Sam Hunt at the Portobello Pub'',<ref>[http://pogostick.co.nz/would-you-let-a-baby-wee-on-you/ Robin White, ''Sam Hunt at the Portobello Pub'', Pogostick website] (retrieved 17 January 2012).</ref> painted in 1978.<ref name="Stead_White_Hunt"/> In 2012, the artist [[Dick Frizzell]] completed a series of paintings of Sam Hunt poems. At the opening of the exhibition of those paintings on 7 February 2012, Frizzell said that he and Hunt had, in their respective paintings and poems, committed the ultimate "sin", the "sin of being understood".<ref>[http://www.pageblackiegallery.co.nz/exhibition.php?exhibitionid=124 Page Blackie Gallery, Exhibition: Dick Frizzell, ''Painting The Hunt'']{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (retrieved 7 February 2012)</ref>

==Honours and awards==
Hunt was awarded a [[Robert Burns Fellowship]] at the [[University of Otago]] in 1975, and spent 1976 in [[Dunedin]].<ref name="Robinson&Wattie"/> In the [[1985 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|1985 Queen's Birthday Honours]], he was awarded the [[Queen's Service Medal]] for community service,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50155 |date=15 June 1985 |page=3 |supp=2}}</ref> and in the [[2010 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|2010 Queen's Birthday Honours]], he was appointed a [[Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services to poetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dpmc.govt.nz/publications/queens-birthday-honours-list-2010 |title=Queen's Birthday honours list 2010 |date=7 June 2010 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> In 2012 he received a [[Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/en/results-of-our-work/award-winners/prime-minister-s-awards-for-literary-achievement |title=Previous winners |publisher=[[Creative New Zealand]] |access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>

==Sam Hunt Wine==
In June 2015, Hunt released his own range of wines, under the ''Sam Hunt'' wine label. The range was developed in association with Auckland-based fine wine retailer and distributor, La Cantina Wines.<ref>[http://www.lacantina.co.nz ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717081015/http://www.lacantina.co.nz/ |date=17 July 2015 }}</ref> Each of the five wine varieties (Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Merlot Malbec) features poetry from Hunt on the label and has a [[QR code]] that enable users to listen Hunt, Kilgour and The Heavy 8s performing brief excerpts of the poems.
