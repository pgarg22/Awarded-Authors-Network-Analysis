'''Sir John Clanvowe''' (c. 1341 – 17 October 1391) was a Welsh diplomat, poet and chamber knight to [[Richard II]]. He was born to a [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] family and was possibly of mixed Anglo-Welsh origin, holding lands that would lie in the present-day [[Radnorshire]] district of [[Powys]] and in [[Herefordshire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=McFarlane |first1=K.B. |title=Lancastrian Kings and Lollard Knights |date=1972 |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=163-165, 231}} McFarlane believed that his mother was a Talbot from the diocese of Hereford.</ref>

==Career==
Clanvowe was born in Hergest, [[Herefordshire]],{{efn|There are two Herefordshire villages called Hergest: [[Lower Hergest]] and [[Upper Hergest]], It is unclear which was his birthplace.}} and was a descendant of Hywel ap Meurig of Radnorshire.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CLANVOWE, Thomas (died 1410), of Hergest and Yazor, Herefs |url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/clanvowe-thomas-1410 |website=History of Parliament Online |publisher=The Institute of Historical Research |accessdate=17 October 2020}}</ref> His royal career began in 1373 with service to [[Edward III]], probably through family connections after his father served as a squire to the royal household.<ref> K. B. McFarlane, 1972, pp. 163–165.</ref> Clanvowe then built up relations in the royal court, notably with [[William Neville (Lollard knight)|William Neville]], who also became a chamber knight.<ref>K. B. McFarlane, 1975, pp. 165–166.</ref> In Richard II's reign (1377–1399), however, Clanvowe started to gain more political notoriety, gaining royal trust that made him a chamber knight in 1381.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Scattergood |first1=V.J. |title=The Works of Sir John Clanvowe |date=1975 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |page=26 |url=https://archive.org/details/worksofsirjohncl0000scat/page/24/mode/2up}}</ref> The role mainly involved maintaining the peace in his home county of Herefordshire, while using his local following to increase the king's popularity.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hefferan |first1=Matthew |title=Household knights, chamber knights and king’s knights: the development of the royal knight in fourteenth-century England |journal=Journal of Medieval History |date=2019 |volume=45 |issue=1 |page=92 |doi=10.1080/03044181.2018.1551811}}</ref><ref>V.

Outside the royal chamber, Clanvowe was a personal friend of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Clanvowe, John |url=https://medieval_literature.enacademic.com/133/Clanvowe%2C_John |website=Encyclopaedia of Medieval Literature |accessdate=17 October 2020}}</ref><ref>Thomas Garbaty, ''Medieval English Literature'', 1984.</ref> He is believed to be one of the first to hear [[The Knight's Tale]] in its free-standing form in 1380, before Chaucer included it in [[The Canterbury Tales]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bowers |first1=J.M |title=Three Readings of The Knight's Tale: Sir John Clanvowe, Geoffrey Chaucer, and James I of Scotland |journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies |date=2004 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=279-280}}</ref> Historian John Bowers has suggested that the main Knight's Tale theme may have been written about the brotherhood and knightly love between Clanvowe and his companion Neville.<ref>J. M. Bowers, 2004, p. 284.</ref> In 1386 Clanvowe and Chaucer gave evidence in Scrope's favour in the [[Scrope v. Grosvenor]] case in the Court of Chivalry, when [[Richard Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope of Bolton]] and Sir Robert Grosvenor fell out over the right to bear a certain coat of arms.<ref>Edith Rickert, ''Chaucer's World'', 1962, p. 147.</ref>

Clanvowe's death came on 17 October 1391, on the way to [[Constantinople]] with a sworn companion, William Neville, perhaps on pilgrimage to the holy city. Neville died two days later (19 October 1391), apparently inconsolable after the passing of his sworn companion Clanvowe.<ref>J. M. Bowers, 2004, p. 283.</ref> They were buried together in a joint tomb discovered in 1913 in [[Istanbul]]'s [[Arap Mosque]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dull |first1=S |last2=Luttrell |first2=A |last3=Keen |first3=M |title=Faithful Unto Death: The Tomb Slab of Sir William Neville and Sir John Clanvowe, Constantinople 1391 |journal=The Antiquaries Journal |date=1991 |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=177-182.}}</ref> Their tomb slab also suggests a close relationship, with their coats of arms [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] on both shields in a way usually reserved for married couples.<ref>S. Dull, A. Luttrell and M. Keen, 1991, p. 183.</ref>   

===Military life===
Clanvowe was probably an apprentice of [[Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford|Humphrey Du Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford]], also from Herefordshire, whom he may have joined on the [[Alexandrian Crusade|crusade to Alexandria]] in 1365, when the city was sacked by the crusading party.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Guard |first1=Timothy |title=Chivalry, Kingship and Crusade: The English Experience in the Fourteenth Century |date=2013 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |page=142}}</ref> Early in his career, Clanvowe was involved in military campaigns to France during [[The Hundred Years War]], first as being posted in Brittany in 1364.<ref>V. J. Scattergood, 1975, p. 25.</ref>

Clanvowe was later involved in 1373 and 1378 expeditions to France led by [[John of Gaunt]].<ref>V. J. Scattergood, 1975, p. 25.</ref> In 1390, he enlisted on the [[Barbary Crusade]] led by [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]] against [[Tunis]], for which traditional crusading indulgences were offered.<ref>Timothy Guard, 2013, p. 58.</ref> This ended in a peace treaty after a nine-week siege.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Housley |first1=Norman |title=The Later Crusades, 1274-1580: from Lyons to Alcazar |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=286}}</ref>

==Religion==
Sir John Clanvowe has been noted for unorthodox, potentially heretical religious views. The English chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] included him as one of the seven "[[lollard knights]]" in Richard II's reign.<ref>Thomas Walsingham, 2005. ''The Chronica Maiora of Thomas Walsingham'', translated by D. Preest, Boydell Press, p. 250. Originally appeared in 1422.</ref>

Yet historians have debated the extent of Clanvowe's heresies. Studying Clanvowe's devotional treatise "The Two Ways", McFarlane has argued that heresy can be seen where the knight fails to discuss many parts of the English Church he would in that case have rejected, for example the efficacy of the [[sacrament]]. Clanvowe's reliance here on biblical texts suggests he needed no intermediary between him and God.<ref>K. B. McFarlane, 1972, p. 205.</ref> Anne Hudson, on the other hand, claimed that the work contains nothing derived from [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] and reflects [[Puritanical]] views, not those of a heretic.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hudson |first1=Anne |title=The Premature Reformation: Wycliffite Texts and Lollard History |date=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=387}}</ref> 
 
==Works==
Clanvowe probably wrote ''The Two Ways'' while on his 1391 expedition to Constantinople, beyond the authority of the English Church.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Scattergood |first1=V.J |title=The Date of Sir John Clanvowe's 'The Two Ways' and the 'Reinvention of Lollardy' |journal=Medium Ævum |date=2010 |volume=79 |issue=1 |page=117 |url=https://doi.org/10.2307/43632386}}</ref> The work describes how one can follow the narrow way to heaven and avoid the broad way to hell. Here he condemns his own knightly class, claiming they (and other Christians) should live a meek life and avoid indulging in the pleasures of this world, which can only lead to hell.<ref>John Clanvowe, 1975. "The Two Ways". In J. Scattergood, ed., ''The Works of Sir John Clanvowe''. Rowman and Littlefield, pp. 55 and 70. Originally appeared in 1391</ref> 

Clanvowe's best-known work was ''The Book of Cupid, God of Love'' or ''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale'', a debate poem influenced by Chaucer's ''Parliament of Fowls''. Here the nightingale praises love, but the cuckoo mocks it for causing more trouble than joy. Staley too has claimed the poem can be seen as a criticism of elaborate courtly language under [[Richard II]], with the nightingale complaining that the cuckoo is too hard to understand.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Staley |first1=L |title=Gower, Richard II, Henry of Derby, and the Business of Making Culture |journal=Speculum |date=2000 |volume=75 |issue=1 |page=75 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2887425}}</ref> It is written as a literary [[dream vision]] and serves as an example of [[medieval debate literature|medieval debate poetry]].

Clanvowe was first mentioned in modern times in 1896, in the ''History of English Literature'' by F. S. Ellis. ''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale'' had previously been attributed to Chaucer, but the ''Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature'' notes the absence of direct evidence of that when linking Clanvowe with the work.<ref>Robert T. and Laura C. Lambdin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A_fAzqriYGoC&pg=PA104 Clanvowe, Sir John] ''Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature'' (2000), pp. 104–105.</ref>
