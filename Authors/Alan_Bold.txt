'''Alan Norman Bold''' (1943–1998) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[poet]], biographer, journalist and saxophonist.<ref>"co-leader and alto-saxophonist in a modern jazz group", Penguin Modern Poets 15, poet descriptions p. 1</ref> He was born in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>Alan Bold, ed., ''The Penguin Book of Socialist Verse'' (Penguin Books, 1970), p. [1].</ref>

He edited [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s ''Letters'' and wrote the influential biography ''MacDiarmid''. Bold had acquainted himself with MacDiarmid in 1963 while still an English Literature student at [[Edinburgh University]]. His debut work, ''Society Inebrious'', with a lengthy introduction by MacDiarmid, was published in 1965, during Bold's final university year. This early publication kick-started a prolific poetic career with Bold publishing another three books of verse before the end of the decade, including the ambitious book-length poem ''The State of the Nation''.  He also edited ''The Penguin Book of Socialist Verse'' (1970) and published a 1973 biography of [[Robert Burns]].

Alan Bold married an art teacher, Alice. Their daughter Valentina is [[Robert Burns]] scholar like her father,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/familytree/frank/burns_lives89.htm |title=Robert Burns Lives!: Merry Muses |last=Shaw |first=Frank R.}}</ref> who teaches at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/interdisciplinary/staff/valentinabold/ |title=Dr. Valentina Bold |publisher=School of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of Glasgow |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906011843/http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/interdisciplinary/staff/valentinabold/ |archivedate=6 September 2015 }}</ref> A lifelong heavy drinker who dealt with the boozy life of the poet in such collections as ''A Pint of Bitter'', Bold died after a short illness in a hospital in [[Kirkcaldy]] at the age of 54.
