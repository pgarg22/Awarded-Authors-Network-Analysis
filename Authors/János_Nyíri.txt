He wrote several highly acclaimed plays and novels, including ''Battlefields and Playgrounds'' (London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], 1990), recognized by ''[[The Observer]]'' as the most important novel written by a survivor of the [[Holocaust]].<ref name=magyarnarancs>{{cite web |url=http://www.hlo.hu/news/a_witness_who_needs_to_be_heard_janos_nyiri_1932_2002 |title=A witness who needs to be heard: János Nyíri |last1=Kiss |first1=Yudit |date=2 October 2014 |website=hlo.hu (Hungarian literature online)}} — Translated from: {{cite journal |last=Kiss |first=Yudit |date=16 January 2014 |title=Egy meg sem hallgatott tanú - Nyíri János és életműve |url=http://magyarnarancs.hu/konyv/egy-meg-sem-hallgatott-tanu-88312 |language=hu |journal=[[Magyar Narancs]]}}</ref>

==Early life==
János Nyíri was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary, in 1932.  His parents were Tibor Nyíri and Julia Spitz, respected Hungarian Jewish writers.<ref name=timesonline/> His father's most famous work was the novel ''Katona, Karácsony'' and the screenplay of the Hungarian film ''Díszmagyar'' ("Gala Suit") (Budapest, 1949).<ref name=IMDb-Tibor>{{IMDb name | 1442285 | Tibor Nyíri}}</ref>  Nyíri's parents divorced when he was a small boy, and János went to live on his grandparents' vineyard in rural [[Tokaj]]. At the beginning of World War II, he went into hiding from the Nazis and Hungarian anti-Semites, with his mother and his older brother, András Nyíri. While most of his family and classmates were murdered in the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Mauthausen-Gusen]] concentration camps, Nyiri survived and was liberated by the Red Army in May 1945.  After his military service and officer training as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Hungarian Army, Nyíri completed his studies at the [[Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest|Színház- és Filmművészeti Főiskola]], the Academy of Cinema and Dramatic Art in Budapest in 1954, and rose to fame as a theatre director, in Kecskemét, Szeged, and Budapest.<ref name=magyarnarancs/>

==Move to France==
Shortly after the failed [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] against Soviet occupation in 1956, Nyíri decided to escape to Vienna, and later to Paris, instead of staying in Hungary and facing a probable death sentence, which was the fate of many of his fellow revolutionaries. Nyíri was forbidden to return to Hungary until the [[amnesty]] of 1973, when he was commissioned by the ''[[New Statesman]]'' to return to his native country and write an article, which was published under the title ''A Chilly Spring in Budapest''.<ref group=n>{{cite journal |last=Nyíri |first=János |date=8 June 1973 |title=A Chilly Spring in Budapest |url=http://nyir2u.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/a-chilly-spring-in-budapest-by-janos-nyiri/ |journal=[[New Statesman]] |location=London}}</ref>

During the 1950s, Nyíri settled in Paris and started working in the theatre again, with such respected dramatists as [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Anouilh]] and [[Jean Genet]].  Nyíri also taught at the [[Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique|Conservatoire]] and studied at the [[Comédie-Française]]. Having secured a position as assistant director to [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Odéon|Odéon]], he met his future wife, Jenny Hippisley, the daughter of British actors Lindisfarne Hamilton and Christopher Quest,<ref name=timesonline/> and the great–granddaughter (on her mother's side of the family) of [[Heinrich Simon]], the Jewish scientist, social democrat and leader of the Frankfurt revolutionary parliament of 1848. The Nyíris founded their first theatre company together, Le Jeune Théâtre de Marseille, in 1960. For several years, Nyíri directed successful stage productions of classic French and English plays by [[Molière]], [[Beaumarchais]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], and went on to adapt ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' in Marseille and ''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'' at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]].<ref group=n>''The Imaginary Invalid'' (Theatre Programme), Vaudeville, London, 1968</ref> He also directed ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[Phèdre]]'', ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (play)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' and his own works, all over Europe.<ref name=timesonline/> During this time he and his wife established their family home in southwest [[London]]. He and his wife continued to spend time in their homes in England, Ireland and France until his death.

==Life as a playwright==
''If Winter Comes'', a love story set "somewhere behind the iron curtain", was Nyíri's first outing as a playwright.  He personally directed the first few productions of all his plays, and dedicated ''If Winter Comes'' to his "comrades of Budapest and [[Prague]]",<ref name=timesonline/> which caused some controversy, in the sensitive political climate, coming so soon after the Paris riots of 1968.<ref name=magyarnarancs/>  The original Paris production was entitled ''Le Ciel est en bas'', and presented at the [[Théâtre de l'Athénée]] in 1970, starring [[Jean Servais]]<ref group=n>''Le Ciel est en bas'' (Theatre Programme), L'Athénée, Paris, 1970</ref><ref name=timesonline/>  The play was both a critical and commercial success,<ref name=magyarnarancs/> with subsequent stage productions in major theatres as far afield as Austria, Germany, England, Scotland, Wales, Australia, the United States, and even in Hungary, over the following thirty years.  Nyíri's work was often adapted for the screen, in England, Germany, and Hungary.<ref group=n>''Ha már itt a tél'' (Film), Magyar Televízió/MaFilm, Budapest, 1985</ref> In 1980 ''If Winter Comes'' was turned into a television film for [[BBC Films]], starring [[Paul Scofield]], [[Denis Lawson]] and [[Cherie Lunghi]].<ref group=n>''If Winter Comes'' (Film), BBC, London, 1980</ref><ref name=timesonline/>

==Novels==
Nyíri's first novel to be published in English, ''Streets'' (London: [[Wildwood House (publisher)|Wildwood House]]),<ref group=n>''Streets'' (Book), London: Wildwood House, 1979.</ref> was widely praised in the British press, for its depiction of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] against the [[Soviet occupation]] of the 1950s.<ref name=timesonline/> ''Streets'' was on most book of the year lists for 1979 and quickly attracted critical success. His second novel ''Battlefields and Playgrounds'', was ten years in the writing. ''Battlefields and Playgrounds'' (London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], and New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]),<ref group=n>''Battlefields and Playgrounds'' (Book), Macmillan, London, 1989; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 1992</ref> has been published in several languages, all over the world.<ref group=n>''Madárország'' (Book), Makkábi Könyvkiadó-Téka Könyvkiadó, Budapest, 1990; Corvina Kiadó, Budapest, 2014; ''Awakening The Day'' (Book), Tel Aviv, 1993; ''Die Juden Schule'' (Book), Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt, 1993, 2018</ref> His third novel, ''Curtain Up!'', is set in Spain, France and England during the 1960s.  It was completed in 2002, shortly before his death.<ref name=timesonline/>

It was his second novel, of which the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote: "Although hardly a month passes without some new account surfacing about a writer’s childhood during the Holocaust, nothing in recent memory approaches the greatness — the narrative beauty, the sublime character portraits and the cliff-hanging tension and drama — of ''Battlefields and Playgrounds''".<ref name=timesonline/> The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' praised the book as: "a panorama of historic events, a cross-section of society’s attitudes at the point of an ultimate test of its values, an exploration of a growing child’s consciousness, a story of a family’s struggle to survive, a dramatic novel of suspense, is also, perhaps most importantly, a treatise on the nature and limits of liberty… At the same time, it is a gigantic portion of what we all… secretly dream of finding in any novel: a riveting story, an engaging protagonist, an enthralling narrative, a convincing portrayal of a human predicament". ''Battlefields and Playgrounds'' was also Book of the Year in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and chosen by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as one of the best books of 1995 in the USA.
