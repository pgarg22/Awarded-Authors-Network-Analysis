Later on, he was commissioned in the [[US Coast Guard]] Reserve and served as a [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in New York City where he worked law enforcement and search-and-rescue boat operations.<ref name = intergalactic /> His work with the Coast Guard included working as a responder to [[Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill]] and [[Hurricane Irene]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrison |first1=Thea |title=Men Reading Romance: Meet Author Myke Cole & Giveaway! |url=https://theaharrison.com/men-reading-romance-meet-author-myke-cole/ |website=TheaHarrison.com |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref> Cole later worked with the NYPD as part of a defensive cyber unit focused on protecting the department from hackers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKeon |first1=Amanda |title=Speaking With Analyst and Fantasy Author Myke Cole |url=https://www.recordedfuture.com/podcast-episode-23/ |website=Recorded Future Podcast |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
Cole’s first professional breakthrough in his writing career came in 2003 when his short story ''Blood And Horses'' won third prize in the [[Writers of the Future]] contest, with his story published in volume XIX of the anthology.<ref>{{cite web |title=Writer Winners |url=http://www.writersofthefuture.com/writer-winners/ |website=Writers of the Future |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref> He then published several short stories in magazines and anthologies including [[Weird Tales]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Weird Tales #334 |url=https://bookmate.com/books/OobhvAo1 |website=Book Mate |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref> where he went on to be a submission screener.<ref name = intergalactic />
His first publishing deal came in 2012 with his debut novel, ''Shadow Ops: Control Point'' published by [[Ace Books]] which won the 2013 [[Compton Crook Award]].<ref name="BSFS's Compton Crook Award"/> The series straddles genres incorporating elements of urban fantasy and military fantasy. He has said it took him 15 years of writing nights and weekends to finish it. The next two books in the series were published in as many years before the premiere in 2015 of ''The Reawakening Trilogy'', a prequel set in the same universe as ''Shadow Ops''. Installments of ''The Reawakening Trilogy'' were also released annually.<ref>{{cite web |title=Myke Cole Interview |url=http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2017/02/myke-cole-interview_24.html |website=Pat's Fantasy Hotlist |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref>
 
His career grew to include television starting in 2017 when Cole was recruited for the CBS reality show ''[[Hunted (2017 TV series)|Hunted]]''. The premise of the show was contestants attempting to hide for a month from professional man hunters. Cole was chosen for the show due to his background in military intelligence operations; his role on the show was as one of the investigators tasked with tracking contestants.<ref name = hunted />

In 2018 ''The Armoured Saint'', the first book of ''The Sacred Throne Trilogy'' was published by [[Tor Books|Tor]]. The series is a “grimdark” medieval fantasy, centering around a young girl leading a revolution in a theocratic state. Cole describes the series as being a difficult sell, with the first novel taking him three years to get it accepted by a publisher.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gartenberg |first1=Chaim |title=Fantasy author Myke Cole talks about writing novellas and ending an epic fantasy series in The Killing Light |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18204127/myke-cole-the-killing-light-sacred-throne-interview-fantasy-novella-cover-reveal |website=The Verge |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=Jan 31, 2019}}</ref> 2018 also saw the publishing of Cole’s first non-fiction book, ''Legion Versus Phalanx'', a military history book examining the military tactics of the Hellenistic phalanx and the Roman legion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Retherford |first1=David |title=SWJ Book Review: Legion Versus Phalanx: The Epic Struggle for Infantry Supremacy in the Ancient World by Myke Cole |url=https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/swj-book-review-legion-versus-phalanx-epic-struggle-infantry-supremacy-ancient-world-myke |website=Small Wars Journal |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=March 23, 2019}}</ref> In late 2018, ''Queen of Crows'', the second Sacred Throne trilogy was released.

Also in 2018, a survey on sexual harassment in children’s publishing, related to activism around the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], was conducted by author [[Anne Ursu]]. Cole was one of several male authors anonymously accused of sexism in the comments of an article that discussed the results. Cole offered a public apology on his own blog, describing his recognition of the negative impact of his behavior. He committed to rectifying his behavior, donated $500 to the ''Time's Up'' Legal Defense Fund, and stepped down from managing a writer's happy hour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Himmelstein |first1=Drew |title=Unpacking Anne Ursu's Survey and the Fallout, with Changes Coming to Events |url=https://www.slj.com/?detailStory=unpacking-anne-ursus-survey-fallout-changes-coming-events-sexual-harassment-childrens-publishing |website=School Library Journal |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref> In response to this, one of his accusers publicly accepted his apology and related that she accused him because of unwanted flirting from him at an industry dinner.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Patterson |first1=Janci |title=Sexual Harassment, Apologies, and Forgiveness |url=http://www.jancipatterson.com/2018/02/19/sexual-harassment-apologies-and-forgiveness/ |website=JanciPatterson.com |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=February 19, 2018}}</ref>

In 2019 Cole returned to TV co-starring on the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''Contact'', which explores evidence of UFO activity. While his role on the show involved credulity of the team’s discoveries, he maintains that he is a skeptic and the show did not change his opinion about the existence of extraterrestrials.<ref>{{cite web |title=Actually, the Spartans Weren't All That Great |url=https://www.wired.com/2020/03/geeks-guide-spartans/ |website=Wired.com |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

A vocal critic of the Trump administration, Cole began publishing political commentary articles for various publishers. These include ''How the Far Right Perverts Ancient History – And Why it Matters'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Myke |title=How the Far Right Perverts Ancient History—And Why It Matters |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-far-right-perverts-ancient-historyand-why-it-matters |website=The Daily Beast |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=March 2, 2019}}</ref> and ''America’s Militarized Police Can’t Fight Coronavirus''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Myke |title=America’s Police Prepared for the Wrong Enemy |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/06/police-coronavirus-social-distancing-enforcement-nypd/ |website=Foreign Policy |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=May 6, 2020}}</ref> One of these articles titled ''The Sparta Fetish Is a Cultural Cancer'' published in [[the New Republic]] in 2019 discussed various myths about [[Sparta]] and their use by the Republican party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Myke |title=The Sparta Fetish Is a Cultural Cancer |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/154563/sparta-myth-rise-fascism-trumpism |website=The New Republic |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=August 1, 2019}}</ref> In the spring of 2020, Cole drew criticism from the Greek media and the Mayor of Sparta in response to the article.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peter Doukas' Answer To Myke Cole What Was Sparta After All? |url=https://www.flynews.gr/apantisi-petrou-douka-myke-cole-sparti/ |website=Fly News |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=Mar 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The American writer Myke Cole challenges modern Spartans: "Your story is a myth!" |url=https://notospress.gr/article.php?id=48167 |website=Notos Press |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=Mar 30, 2020}}</ref>
His flash science fiction piece, also a political commentary, ''Congress Must Pass the Living Artists Act'' appeared in The New York Times in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Myke |title=Congress Must Pass the Living Artists Act |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/opinion/musician-simulation.html |website=NY Times |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=Mar 30, 2020}}</ref>

Cole’s first graphic novel ''Hundred Wolves'' was announced in early 2020 with [[Tony Akins]] as the artist. It was set in 17th century Ukraine with the story revolving around a mercenary husband/wife couple searching for their kidnapped daughter.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McMillan |first1=Grant |title=Novelist Myke Cole Making Comics Debut With 'Hundred Wolves' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/novelist-myke-cole-making-comics-debut-hundred-wolves-1272465 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

Cole also published his 11th book, ''Sixteenth Watch'' with publisher [[Angry Robot]] in 2020. Tapping in to his service with the US Coast Guard, the novel is a scifi imagining of a future where the coast guard operates in space.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview: Sixteenth Watch Author Myke Cole |url=https://paulsemel.com/exclusive-interview-sixteenth-watch-author-myke-cole/ |website=PaulSemel.com |accessdate=27 September 2020}}</ref>

In the summer of 2020, a comic artist alleged sexual harassment from Cole at a convention afterparty. Cole stated that while he recalled meeting the accuser six years prior at the convention in question, he had no memory of the alleged behavior. Due to public pressure following the allegation, Angry Robot announced they would not move forward with a sequel to ''Sixteenth Watch'', and Vault Comics announced that the ''Hundred Wolves'' comic would no longer be released. His agent also announced he would no longer represent Cole as a client following the allegations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Puc |first1=Samantha |title=Vault Comics Drops Myke Cole Project After Sexual Misconduct Allegations |url=https://www.cbr.com/vault-comics-drops-myke-cole-sexual-misconduct-allegations/ |website=CBR.com |accessdate=27 September 2020 |date=June 25, 2020}}</ref>
