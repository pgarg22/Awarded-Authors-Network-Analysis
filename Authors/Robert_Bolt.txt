'''Robert Oxton Bolt''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (15 August 1924 – 21 February 1995) was an English playwright and a two-time [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning screenwriter, known for writing the screenplays for ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', and ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'', the latter two of which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].

==Career==
He was born in [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], Cheshire, to Methodist parents; his father owned a small furniture shop.<ref>A Man For All Seasons by Robert Bolt, Leonard Smith, Macmillan Master Guides, 1985, p. 3</ref> At [[Manchester Grammar School]] his affinity for Sir [[Thomas More]] first developed. After leaving school aged sixteen, he worked in an insurance office, which he disliked; after studying in the evening for five weeks he passed three A-levels and went on to attend the [[University of Manchester]], from which, after a year, he undertook wartime service, initially as a pilot officer candidate in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] (air-sickness preventing him from continuing past training) from 1943 to 1946. He then served as an Army officer in West Africa until 1947, when he returned to the University of Manchester and spent three years completing his honours degree in History.<ref>A Man For All Seasons by Robert Bolt, Leonard Smith, Macmillan Master Guides, 1985, p. 4</ref> Following this, he took a teaching diploma from the [[University of Exeter]].<ref>Robert Bolt: Scenes from two lives, Adrian Turner, Hutchinson, 1998, p. 66</ref> For many years he taught [[English studies|English]] and history at [[Millfield School]] and only became a full-time writer at the age of 33 when his play ''[[The Flowering Cherry]]'' was staged in London in 1958, with [[Celia Johnson]] and [[Ralph Richardson]].

He first earned notice for his original play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'' – a depiction of Sir Thomas More's clash with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] over his divorce from [[Catherine of Aragon]] – which won awards on the stage and in its film version, though subsequently most of his writing was screenplays for films or television.

Bolt's writing included primarily dramatic works that placed their protagonists in tension with the prevailing society. He won praise for ''A Man for All Seasons'', his first iteration of this theme, but he developed it in his existential script for ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962). In ''Lawrence'', he succeeded where several before him had failed at turning [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' into a cogent screenplay by transforming the entire book into a search for the identity of its author, presenting Lawrence as a misfit both in English and Arab society.

It was at this time that Bolt himself fell foul of the law, and as part of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] he was arrested and imprisoned for protesting against nuclear proliferation. He refused to be "bound over" (i.e., to sign a declaration that he would not engage in such activities again) and was sentenced to one month in prison because of this.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-robert-bolt-1574410.html |title=Obituary: Robert Bolt |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |last=Calder |first=John |date=23 February 1995 |access-date=21 July 2016}}</ref> [[Sam Spiegel]], the producer of ''Lawrence'', persuaded Bolt to sign after he had served only two weeks. Bolt later regretted his actions and did not speak to Spiegel again after the film was completed.

Later in ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', Bolt invested [[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel with his own characteristic sense of narrative and dialogue – human, short and telling. ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' was Bolt's first project after a stroke, which affected not only his movement but also his speech. In it, Fletcher Christian takes the "Lawrence" role of a man in tension with his society who in the process loses touch with his own identity. ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' was Bolt's final film project, and it once again represented his thematic preoccupations, this time with 18th-century [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in South America.

Bolt's final produced script was ''Political Animal'', later made into the TV movie ''Without Warning: The James Brady Story'' (1991), about the attempted assassination of [[Ronald Reagan]] and the struggles of his press secretary [[James Brady]] to recover from a near-fatal gunshot injury he received in the process. Bolt was initially reluctant to make the film, but after meeting Brady he felt he could relate to Brady's struggles with a head injury, and many of his own experiences recovering from his stroke found their way into the script.

==Personal life==
Bolt was married four times, twice to British actress [[Sarah Miles]]. His first wife was Celia Ann "Jo" Roberts, by whom he had three children:  Sally (died 1982), Ben, and Joanna.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Turner, Adrian.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39009655|title=Robert Bolt : scenes from two lives|date=1998|publisher=Hutchinson|isbn=0-09-180176-1|location=London|oclc=39009655}}</ref> They divorced in 1963. He was married to Miles from 1967 until 1976; Bolt had his fourth child, Thomas, with Miles. In the early 1980s, he had a short-lived third marriage, to the actress Ann Queensberry (former wife of [[David Douglas, 12th Marquess of Queensberry]]), before remarrying Sarah Miles in 1988, with whom he remained until his death in 1995.<ref>{{Cite book

After the war, Bolt joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], but he left it in the late 1960s after the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="LA Times">[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-06-09-ca-670-story.html Twelve years ago Robert Bolt, right,... ] ''www.latimes.com'', accessed 31 October 2020</ref>

==Death==
Bolt suffered a heart attack and a stroke that left him paralysed in 1979. He died aged 70 in 1995, in [[Petersfield]], [[Hampshire]], England, following a long illness.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-10-22|title=OBITUARY : Robert Bolt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-robert-bolt-1574410.html|access-date=2021-01-12|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

==Honours==
Robert Bolt was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1972.

===Plays===
Bolt wrote several plays for [[BBC Radio]] in the '50s, as well as several unproduced plays, so this list is incomplete. Many of his early radio plays were for children, and only a few (see below) were adapted for the stage.

* ''The Last of the Wine'' (1955) – A play showcasing the reactions of ordinary Englishmen to the advent of nuclear armageddon, one of Bolt's pet political issues. One of Bolt's radio plays which Bolt tried to adapt to the stage. However, the play was either never performed or performed a few times and then cancelled. ''Wine'' has never been published or performed since. First broadcast late March, or early April 1955 on the BBC Third Programme.<ref>Trewin, J. C. "Critic on the Hearth." ''Listener'' [London, England] 5 August 1954: 224.</ref>
* ''Mr Sampson's Sunday'' (1955) – First broadcast by the BBC Home Service and reviewed by [[J. C. Trewin]] in the ''Listener'' 21 July 1955.
* ''The Critic and the Heart'' (1957) – Bolt's first professionally produced work, it involves Winifred Blazer, a middle-aged spinster whose life is ruined by the arrival of a mean-spirited art critic. It was a very modest success, with a two-week run at the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. Bolt was never satisfied with this play, and later re-wrote it, retitled ''Brother and Sister'', in a version produced in 1967 with [[Flora Robson]].
* ''The Drunken Sailor''  (1958) – Broadcast on the BBC in March 1958 and reviewed in the ''Listener'' by Roy Walker 20 March 1958.
* ''[[Flowering Cherry]]'' (1958) – concerns a middle-aged man, an insurance salesman dissatisfied with his life who retreats into his fantasies of owning a cherry orchard. His erratic behaviour alienates family and friends and threatens his financial ruin. Ran on the West End starring [[Ralph Richardson]] and [[Celia Johnson]] (succeeded by [[Wendy Hiller]]) to success but mixed reviews. Many critics felt it too closely resembled [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', and had a brief but unsuccessful run on Broadway starring Hiller and [[Eric Portman]].
* ''[[The Tiger and the Horse]]'' (1960) – is the first of Bolt's plays to develop his themes of individualism, society, authority, and politics. It concerns an ageing college professor, John Dean, who is running for Vice-Chancellor of a prestigious university, but finds his election undermined by his daughter's love affair, a political petition, and his wife's deteriorating mental state. The play starred [[Michael Redgrave|Michael]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], among others, and was directed by [[Frith Banbury]].
* ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1960) – involves Sir Thomas More's conflict with Henry VIII over the latter's break with the Catholic Church. Adapted from a radio play Bolt had written in 1954, it is generally regarded as Bolt's finest work – and certainly his most successful. The BBC production was reviewed in the ''Listener'' on 5 August 1954. The play develops in full his themes of individuality versus society and authority as corrupt. The strain of [[Brecht]]ianism which would pervade many of his later works is first present here, in the character of the 'Common Man', who both narrates and takes part in the action as various minor characters. The original run starred [[Paul Scofield]] as Thomas More, as well as [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] as Henry VIII, [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]] as the Common Man, [[Leo McKern]] as the Common Man in the West End production and [[Thomas Cromwell]] in the Broadway show (a role originated in London by [[Andrew Keir]] and later taken over by [[Thomas Gomez]]), and [[Albert Dekker]] as the [[Duke of Norfolk]]. It was a huge critical and commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic, has had several revivals, and was made into an equally acclaimed film in 1966.
* ''Gentle Jack'' (1963) – an unusual work by Bolt, a comedy contrasting humanity's material world with nature. A banker, Jacko, is sent to the countryside on vacation, and becomes influenced by a [[Nature]] spirit who convinces him to abandon his office life and live in a state of nature, indulging in base pleasures such as murder, sex, and general mischief. Jacko, however, is torn between his desire to inhabit both the "Natural" and "Logical" Worlds. It was one of Bolt's few unsuccessful plays; Bolt, who considered the play his best work for the stage, regretted this, feeling that perhaps he had not articulated his points well enough. The play starred [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Michael Bryant (actor)|Michael Bryant]], [[Siân Phillips]], [[Edith Evans]], [[Timothy West]] and [[Bernard Kay]] in its run; the play has not been professionally produced since.
* ''The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew'' (1964) – a children's play, involving a heroic knight, Oblong Fitz-Oblong, sent to slay a vicious dragon on a far-away island, leading him to face off with the crooked Baron Bolligrew, who controls the island, and an evil wizard he recruits to help him. The work contains many of Bolt's favourite themes of integrity and honour – as well as Brechtian devices which fit naturally within the story's fantasy setting. The show was commissioned by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] for a showing at Christmastime, 1964. Among the original cast were [[John Normington]] as Fitz-Oblong, [[Michael Jayston]] as the play's narrator, Bolt perennial [[Leo McKern]] as the title character, and [[Terence Rigby]] and a young [[Malcolm McDowell]] in supporting roles. A revival in the late 1960s featured [[Roy Kinnear]] as Fitz-Oblong. [[Paul Scofield]] provided a voice recording for the dragon. Like ''A Man for All Seasons'', the play had been written for the BBC, and in 1995 was re-written into a children's book. The play was extremely popular, and throughout the 1960s/70s, it had a yearly revival at Christmas in Britain. In the early 60s, the [[Augsburger Puppenkiste]] puppet theatre produced the play for German television in six sequels titled ''Der kleine dicke Ritter''.
* ''[[Vivat! Vivat Regina!]]'' (1971) – Bolt's most successful show after ''A Man for All Seasons'', a historical account of the reigns of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and [[Elizabeth I]] of England, comparing and contrasting the personalities and reigns of the two female rulers. Highly successful, it ran for several months on Broadway, earning several [[Tony Awards|Tony]] nominations. The original cast included [[Eileen Atkins]] as Elizabeth and Bolt's wife [[Sarah Miles]] as Mary. The play has experienced several revivals, most notably a 1985 [[Off-Broadway]] production starring [[Geraldine Page]] as Elizabeth.
* ''[[State of Revolution]]'' (1977) – An in-depth political depiction of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], focusing on [[Vladimir Lenin]] as "a great man possessed by a terrible idea", and the struggles of [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] to gain power under him. It is told from the point of view of [[Anatoly Lunacharsky|Lunacharsky]], Lenin's Minister of Education. The original cast included [[Michael Bryant (actor)|Michael Bryant]] as Lenin, [[Terence Rigby]] as Stalin, [[Brian Blessed]] as [[Maxim Gorky]], and [[Michael Kitchen]] as Trotsky. Though meticulously researched, the play received mixed reviews and had a short run before being shelved. Bolt himself felt that he had not written the play as well as he might have done.

''State of Revolution'' was Bolt's final produced play, though he wrote several others that were never published or produced. He spent much of the mid-to-late 1970s working on a play about portrait artist [[Augustus John]] (famous for a series of portraits of [[T. E. Lawrence]]), but his work on ''The Bounty'', and later his failing health, forced him to abandon it.

===Screenplays===
Bolt may be best remembered for his work on film and television screenplays. His work for director [[David Lean]] garnered him particular acclaim and recognition, and Bolt tried his hand at directing with the unsuccessful ''[[Lady Caroline Lamb (film)|Lady Caroline Lamb]]'' (1972). While some criticised Bolt for focusing more on the personal aspects of his protagonists than the broader political context (particularly with "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Man for All Seasons"), most critics and audiences alike praised his screenplays. Bolt won two [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], two [[BAFTA Awards]], and won or was nominated for several others.

* ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (with [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]]) (1962) – despite disputes between Wilson and Bolt over who contributed what to the script, Bolt provided most of the film's dialogue and the interpretation of the characters while Wilson provided the story and outline. Wilson was uncredited, and Bolt alone was nominated for, but did not win, an Academy Award. Bolt and Lean refused to recognise Wilson's contribution to the film, and Wilson was not credited until 1995.
* ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965) – Bolt won an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]
* ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966) – Bolt won the Oscar again, adapting his own play to the screen.
* ''[[Krasnaya Palatka]]'', released in the US as "The Red Tent", (1969) (uncredited additional dialogue)
* ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' (1970)
* ''[[Lady Caroline Lamb (film)|Lady Caroline Lamb]]'' (1972) (also directed)
* ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' (1984)
* ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' (1986) (originally published as a novel)
* ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1988)
* ''[[A Dry White Season]]'' (1989) (uncredited revisions of screenplay)
* ''[[Without Warning: The James Brady Story]]'' (1991) (TV)

Bolt also worked on the early drafts of the script for ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', but his script was considered unsatisfactory and he was replaced by John Briley. Bolt also had several unrealised projects, including a TV miniseries of [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel
''[[Burr (novel)|Burr]]'' and an adaptation of [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' for [[Norman Lear]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marcus|first1=Leonard S.|title=Listening for Madeleine (Excerpt)|url=http://www.tor.com/2012/11/29/listening-for-madeleine-excerpt/|website=TOR.com|publisher=TOR|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>

After being paid $US400,000 plus ten per cent of profits for his ''Ryan's Daughter'' screenplay, Bolt became, for a time, the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood.
