'''Thomas William Robertson''' (9 January 1829 – 3 February 1871) was an English dramatist and stage director.

Born to a theatrical family, Robertson began as an actor, but he was not a success and gave up acting in his late 20s. After earning a modest living writing articles for the press, translating and adapting foreign plays and writing several of his own plays he achieved success in 1865 with his play ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', which the actor-manager [[Marie Wilton]] presented at a small London theatre, the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's]]. Over the next five years Robertson wrote five more plays for the Prince of Wales's. Their naturalistic style and treatment of contemporary social issues was in strong contrast to the [[melodrama]]s and exaggerated theatricality to which the public had been accustomed, and Robertson's plays were box-office and critical successes. Robertson supervised their productions and was a pioneer of modern stage directing.

Among later theatrical figures influenced by Robertson's Prince of Wales's plays and productions were [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] and [[Harley Granville-Barker]]. Robertson wrote numerous plays for other theatres, and adapted many foreign plays for the English stage, but few of these made a strong or lasting impression. He strove successfully to improve the financial condition of dramatists, securing payment per performance, a basis that became the norm after his death.

Robertson suffered from heart disease and died at the age of 42 at the height of his fame and popularity.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Robertson was born in [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark-upon-Trent]], Nottinghamshire on 9 January 1829.<ref name=odnb/> He came from a long-established theatrical family, active on the English stage since the early 18th century,<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 1</ref> and was the eldest son of [[William Shaftoe Robertson]] and his wife, Margharetta Elisabetta (''née'' Marinus), a Danish-born actress. Robertson senior had been articled to a lawyer, but abandoned the law to become an actor, and was taken on by his uncle's Lincoln Circuit Company, of which he afterwards became manager.<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 5</ref> Many of Robertson's large family of siblings went on the stage, including his brothers Frederick and Edward, and his sisters Fanny, Elizabeth and Margaret, the last subsequently famous as [[Madge Kendal]].<ref>"This Evening's News", ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 9 October 1871, p. 7; Pemberton (1893), p. 29; and Robertson, p. xvii</ref> He made his first appearance on the stage in June 1834 at the age of five as Hamish, the son of the title character in ''[[Rob Roy (play)|Rob Roy]]'',<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 27</ref> and played roles including Cora's child in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''Pizarro'' and the Count's child in [[August von Kotzebue|Kotzebue]]'s ''The Stranger''.<ref name=stedman> Stedman, Jane W.

At the age of seven Robertson was sent to [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] Academy, and then to a school in [[Whittlesey]], acting with the family's theatrical company during the school holidays. When he was about 15 his schooling ceased and he rejoined the company full-time,<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 33</ref>  not only as an actor, but also, according to his biographer Michael R. Booth, "as a scene painter, songwriter, playwright, prompter, and stage-manager".<ref name=odnb/> He wrote stage adaptations of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] stories for the company: "The Battle of Life" and "The Haunted Man".<ref name=tyde/> Apart from a brief and unsuccessful spell in the Netherlands as an English teacher, he remained with the company until its disbandment in 1849.<ref>Pemberton (1893), pp. 36–39</ref>

===London===
Robertson moved to London, earning a meagre living, writing and taking such acting parts as he could get. His biographer [[Thomas Edgar Pemberton|T. Edgar Pemberton]] wrote, "The amount of work that he did there during his early struggling days was prodigious. In addition to writing and adapting plays he contributed stories, essays, and verses to many magazines: dramatic criticisms to several newspapers: and ephemeral work to numerous comic journals".<ref>Pemberton (1905), p. vi</ref>

In 1851 Robertson had a new play presented in the [[West End theatre|West End]], ''A  Night's Adventure'', a comic drama set in the time of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. He hoped this would be start of a successful career as a dramatist, but the play was not a success, closing after four nights, and he continued to scratch a living as a writer and actor.<ref name=dnb>Knight, Joseph.

W. Robertson", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1893, p. 125</ref>

Robertson's farcical sketch ''The Cantab'', staged as an after-piece at the Strand Theatre in February 1861, attracted the attention of a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] literary set, and led to his becoming a member of the [[Savage Club|Savage]], Arundel and Reunion Clubs, where, in the words of his biographer [[Joseph Knight (critic)|Joseph Knight]], "he enlarged his observation of human nature, and whence he drew some curious types".<ref name=dnb/> Among the up-and-coming writers with whom he mixed were [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Tom Hood]] and [[Clement Scott]]. When Byron founded the magazine ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' in 1861, Robertson was a contributor from the outset.<ref name=dnb/> Writers for magazines and papers were seldom well paid, and to maintain a modest income Robertson wrote copiously: Pemberton lists a dozen publications to which he contributed in this period, ranging from ''Beeton's Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine'' and ''The Boy's Own Magazine'' to ''London Society'' and ''The Illustrated Times''.<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 84</ref> Success remained elusive, and Robertson considered giving up writing and becoming a tobacconist.<ref name=dnb/>

===Success===

An important step to success came in 1864, when Robertson wrote ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', an adaptation of [[Mélesville]]'s comedy ''[[Sullivan (play)|Sullivan]]''. [[Edward Askew Sothern|Edward Sothern]] staged the piece and starred in it. The actor was at the height of his popularity, and although the notices paid more attention to his performance than to Robertson's writing,<ref>"Haymarket Theatre", ''The Morning Post'', 2 May 1864, p. 3; "Haymarket Theatre", ''The Standard'', 2 May 1864, p.2; "Whitsuntide and its Amusements", ''The Era'', 15 May 1864, p. 7;"Drama", ''London Daily News'', 2 May 1864, p. 3; and "The Theatrical and Musical Examiner", ''The Examiner'', 18 June 1864, p. 393</ref> the success of the production advanced the author's career.<ref name=dnb/> Encouraged by this professional achievement, he wrote a new play, ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', a comedy depicting what one critic called "the efforts of an illiterate millionaire to introduce his son into 'society', and the equally vigorous efforts of 'society' to repel the intruder".<ref name=mercury>"The Prince of Wales Theatre", ''Liverpool Mercury'', 9 May 1865, p, 6</ref> This play was his breakthrough. London managements turned it down, but through Byron's influence it was produced in [[Liverpool]],<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 167</ref> where it was a critical and popular success.<ref name=mercury/>

Byron was a professional associate of [[Marie Wilton]], who had recently taken over the management of one of London's smaller theatres, the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's]].{{refn|According to a list published in 1870, the average capacity of London's 37 theatres was slightly over 1,900 seats. With a capacity of 814 the Prince of Wales's was the sixth-smallest.<ref>"Capacity of London Theatres", ''The Orchestra'', 17 June 1870, p. 199</ref>|group=n}} At his instigation ''Society'' was presented there on 11 November 1865. In a highly favourable notice the reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "The piece was vehemently applauded from beginning to end. Success could not be more unequivocal".<ref name=timessociety>"Prince of Wales's Theatre", ''The Times'', 14 November 1865, p. 7</ref> ''Society'' ran for 26 weeks – 150 performances – a notable run for the time, establishing the fortunes of the theatre, as well as those of the author. It was revived several times during the next two decades, and was given nearly 500 performances under Wilton's (later the [[Effie Bancroft|Bancrofts']]) management.<ref name=dnb/><ref>Savin, p. 128</ref>  Between the Liverpool and London openings, Robertson suffered the loss of his wife, who died on 14 August after months of ill health.<ref name=dnb/>

Robertson wrote the libretto of the 1865 one-act [[comic opera]] ''Constance'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]]. It was well reviewed when presented at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]],<ref>"Royal English Opera", ''The Morning Post'', 24  March 1862, p. 6; "Royal English Opera", ''The Standard'', 24 March 1862, p. 3; "Music." ''The Daily News'', 24 January 1865, p. 2; "Royal English Opera", ''The Standard'', 24 January 1865, p. 3; and "Royal English Opera", ''The Times'', 24 January 1865, p. 9</ref> but ran only briefly, and Robertson did not return to the musical theatre. In 1869 Clay asked him for a second libretto, but he declined and instead gave Clay an introduction to "a better man than I shall ever be", namely Gilbert, who collaborated with Clay on the successful ''[[Ages Ago]]''.<ref>"Mr Frederic Clay at Clarence Chambers", ''[[The Yorkshire Post]]'', 18 April 1883, p. 6</ref>

The success of ''Society'' established Robertson as a playwright and enabled him have a decisive voice in the staging of his subsequent plays. His next, the comedy ''Ours'', was first given in August 1866 at the Prince of Wales's, Liverpool under his personal direction with a cast that included Wilton, [[Squire Bancroft]] (her future husband and partner) and [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]]. The play transferred to the Prince of Wales's in London the following month and ran for 150 performances.<ref name=tyde>Tydeman, pp. 32–34</ref> ''The Times'' remarked on the "ultra-real" nature of the piece and of its staging.<ref>" Prince of Wales's Theatre", ''The Times'', 19 September 1866, p. 10</ref>

==="A complete reformation of the modern drama"===
During the run of ''Ours'', Robertson, Gilbert, Scott and others contributed short stories to a collection edited by Tom Hood.  Robertson's, "The Poor-Rate Unfolds a Tale", formed the basis for his next play at the Prince of Wales's, but before that he had two plays staged at other London theatres: ''Shadow-Tree Shaft'', a drama, at the [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's]], and ''A Rapid Thaw'', an adaptation of a [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]] comedy, at the [[St James's Theatre|St James's]].<ref name=tyde/>{{refn|''A Rapid Thaw'' was adapted from Sardou's 1864 play ''Le Dégel'', received dreadful reviews and closed within a week.<ref>"St James's Theatre", ''The Morning Post'', 4 March 1867, p. 2; and "The Theatrical Examiner", ''The Examiner'', 23 March 1867, p. 7</ref>|group=n}} In April 1867 his stage version of the short story opened at the Prince of Wales's under the title ''Caste''. In this piece Robertson developed the naturalistic, unexaggerated style for which he was becoming famous. Both as author and director he avoided the over-theatrical bombast of the early Victorian theatre. After the first night of ''Caste'' one critic wrote:
[[File:Marie-Wilton-as-Polly-Eccles.jpg|[[Marie Wilton]] as Polly Eccles in Robertson's ''Caste''|thumb|alt=Young white woman in Victorian clothes, brandishing a kettle]]
{{blockindent|''Society'' and ''Ours'' prepared the way for a complete reformation of the modern drama, and until the curtain fell on Saturday night it remained a question whether Mr Robertson would be able to hold the great reputation which those pieces conferred upon him. The production of ''Caste'' has thrown aside all doubt. The reformation is complete, and Mr Robertson stands pre-eminent as the dramatist of this generation. The scene-painter, the carpenter, and the costumier no longer usurp the place of the author and actor. With the aid of only two simple scenes – a boudoir in Mayfair and a humble lodging in Lambeth – Mr Robertson has succeeded in concentrating an accumulation of incident and satire more interesting and more poignant than might be found in all the sensational dramas of the last half-century. The whole secret of his success is – truth!<ref>Press review, unsigned, ''quoted'' in Pemberton (1893), pp. 205–206, Thorndike, p. 353, and Savin, p. viii</ref>|}}

Gilbert, looking back in 1901, considered ''Caste'' Robertson's masterpiece,<ref name=archer>Archer, p. 114</ref> a judgement with which analysts in the 20th and 21st centuries have concurred.<ref name=odnb/><ref name=dnb/><ref name=coc/> The play ran for 156 performances and was revived for several further runs during the rest of the 19th century.<ref name=tyde/>

In 1867 Robertson remarried. His second wife was Rosetta Elizabeth Rodmill Feist (1844–1912), whom he had met at a party in London in 1866.<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 224</ref> They became engaged in August 1867, married at the British consulate in [[Frankfurt]] on 17 October,<ref name=tyde/> and honeymooned in Paris.<ref>Pemberton (1893), p. 236</ref> They had a daughter and a son.{{refn|Their children were Rosette Caroline (1869–1897) and Dion William Moritz Jacob (1871–1908).<ref name=ancestry/>|group=n}} Once back in London, Robertson continued to write and direct. In February 1868 ''Play'' was produced at the Prince of Wales's. It ran for 106 performances and was followed by a successful revival of ''Society''.<ref name=tyde/> In the same year Robertson adapted [[Alfred de Musset]]'s 1834 play ''On ne badine pas avec l'amour'' for his sister Madge. As ''Passion Flowers'' it was staged under Robertson's direction at the Theatre Royal, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and on tour.<ref>"Amusements", ''Hull Packet'', 23 October 1868, p. 5; "Public Notices", ''Newcastle Chronicle'', 7 November 1868, p. 1; and "The Theatre", ''Nottingham Journal'', 17 November 1868, p. 2</ref>

Robertson had written ''Society'' with Sothern in mind, but the actor had been unavailable.<ref>Pemberton (1893), pp. 165–166</ref> In late 1868 Robertson adapted [[Émile Augier]]'s comedy '' L'Aventurière'', presented at the Haymarket as ''Home'', with Sothern in the lead role in January 1869. It had a good run of 136 performances,<ref>"Mr Sothern in 'Home'", ''Northern Whig'', 4 December 1869, p. 3</ref> but was outstripped by Robertson's ''School'' – loosely based on [[Roderich Benedix]]'s ''Aschenbrödel'' – which opened at the Prince of Wales's in the same month and ran for 381 performances.<ref name=tyde/>

===Last years===

Robertson's last Liverpool premiere was on 22 February 1869. ''My Lady Clara'' was given at the Alexandra Theatre. The play was restaged in London on 27 March 1869 at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], retitled ''Dreams''. The London production featured Madge Robertson; it ran for 96 performances. Later in the same year ''A Breach of Promise'' ("An Extravagant Farce") was staged at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]], London, and ''Dublin Bay'' (a "comedietta") was performed at the [[Theatre Royal, Manchester]].<ref name=tyde/>

In January 1870 Robertson was diagnosed as suffering from heart disease. He continued to write, and 1870 saw the production of ''Progress'' (adapted from Sardou) at the Globe, ''The Nightingale'', a drama, at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] and his final work for the Prince of Wales's – ''M. P.''. Robertson was an early beneficiary of improved financial terms for playwrights; the practice of payment by royalties was not widespread until the 1880s, but the management of the Prince of Wales's had paid him £1 a night for ''Society'' in 1865, and by the time of this final piece his nightly fee had risen to £5. He was also – most unusually for the period – paid for revivals.<ref>Booth, Michael R.

P.'' or even to attend the first night. The company went to his house and gave him a private performance.<ref name=odnb/>

A comedy called ''Birth'' was presented by Sothern at the [[Theatre Royal, Bristol]], followed by a provincial tour.<ref name=tyde/> Against medical advice Robertson attended the first night of a revival of ''Ours'' at the Prince of Wales's on 26 November. The following month he travelled to [[Torquay]] on doctor's orders, but found no improvement in his health and returned to London after two weeks. He was too ill to have any hand in the production of his last play, ''War'', a drama staged at the St James's Theatre on 16 January 1871.<ref name=tyde/>

Robertson died at his home in [[Chalk Farm]], London on 3 February 1871, aged 42. He was buried in [[Abney Park Cemetery]]. More than a thousand people attended the funeral, including the entire company of the Prince of Wales's, led by Marie Wilton, who placed a chaplet of flowers on the coffin.<ref name=funeral>"Funeral of T. W. Robertson", ''The Era'', 12 February 1871, p. 12</ref>{{refn|Among others at the graveside were Gilbert, Hood, Scott, [[Dion Boucicault]], [[William Hunter Kendal|W. H.

{{blockindent|We cannot call to mind any precedent in this capital for so singular a compliment to a dramatic author; but, perhaps, there was never an instance of a dramatist ... being so intimately associated with the fortunes of a particular theatre as Mr Robertson was with the stage and company governed by Miss Marie Wilton".<ref>"Prince of Wales's Theatre", ''The Times'', 10 February 1871, p. 10</ref>|}}

==Plays==
[[File:Programme-Society-Robertson-1865.jpg|thumb|Playbill for ''Society'', 1865|alt=Theatre playbill giving names of cast]]
Robertson's reputation rests on his series of plays for Marie Wilton's company at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.<ref name=dnb/> They were seen as "problem plays", because they dealt seriously and sensitively with social issues of the day. ''Caste'' was about marriage across the class barrier and ''Society'' explored prejudice against social mobility.<ref name=dnb/><ref name=Cup>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/0-9/19th-century-theatre/ "Cup and Saucer drama,"] 19th Century Theatre, Victoria and Albert Museum. Retrieved 12 February 2021</ref> The plays were notable for what the critic [[Thomas Purnell (critic)|Thomas Purnell]] dubbed their "cup and saucer" realism, treating contemporary British subjects in settings that were recognisable, unlike the oversized acting in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s that were popular at the time.<ref name=dnb/> The characters spoke in normal language rather than declaiming their lines.<ref name=Cup/> Looking back thirty years later at the original production, [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] called Robertson's play ''Caste'' "epoch making ... After years of sham heroics and superhuman balderdash, ''Caste'' delighted everyone by its freshness, its nature, its humanity".<ref>Shaw, p. 283</ref>

Shaw was mistaken in supposing everyone was delighted: some critics wrote that there was nothing in Robertson's plays but commonplace life represented without a trace of wit and sparkle, and absurdly realistic.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Robertson, Thomas William|volume=23|page=406}}</ref> More typical was the comment by a correspondent in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' shortly after Robertson's death, asking who else could "successfully break, as he did,  the trammels of conventionalism, and show us upon the stage living, breathing figures of flesh and blood, who walk, talk, act and think as tangible men and women really do in this work-a-day world of ours".<ref>Hays, F. H. "The Late Mr T. W. Robertson and the Drama", ''The Era'', 12 February 1871, p. 12</ref>

Some later analysts have disputed whether Robertson really originated some of the innovations attributed to him. In a 1972 study Errol Durbach suggests that "the 'revolution' had been initiated in France years before by [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and  Sardou, those forerunners of the bourgeois domestic theatre and the [[well-made play]]".<ref name=durbach/> Durbach adds that in England, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Vestris]] was staging plays "with a scrupulous concern for realistic detail", and [[Edward Bulwer Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]] was already writing "the sort of play that would later be called  'Robertsonian'".<ref name=durbach>Durbach, Errol.

Robertson insisted on retaining control over his scripts and casting and required that his actors follow his directions – a novel concept at that time. [[Dion Boucicault]] had been a forerunner, directing spectacular productions of his own plays, but Robertson applied the directorial precept to English domestic drama for the first time.<ref name=r80/> Unlike Boucicault he did not act in his plays but applied himself exclusively to directing (or as it was called at the time "stage management"){{refn|In the 19th century, the term "stage-manager" covered the artistic functions now ascribed to directors as well as the purely technical aspects of staging to which "stage-manager" has subsequently come to be restricted.<ref>[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/188662 "stage-manager"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 2020.

He said of Robertson:
{{blockindent|Why, he invented stage management. It was an unknown art before his time. Formerly, in a conversation scene for instance, you simply brought down two or three chairs, and people sat down and talked, and when the conversation was ended the chairs were replaced. Robertson showed how to give life and variety and nature to the scene, by breaking it up with all sorts of little incidents and delicate by-play. I have been at many of his rehearsals and learnt a great deal from them.<ref>Archer, p. 114</ref>|}}
The actor-manager John Hare, who appeared under Robertson's direction at the Prince of Wales's, wrote:
{{blockindent|My opinion of Robertson as a stage-manager is of the very highest. He had a gift peculiar to himself, and which I have never seen in any other author, of conveying by some rapid and almost electrical suggestion to the actor an insight into the character assigned to him. As nature was the basis of his own work, so he sought to make actors understand it should be theirs. He thus founded a school of natural acting which completely revolutionized the then existing methods, and by so doing did incalculable good to the stage.<ref>''Quoted'' in Rowell, p. 82</ref>|}}

As well as Gilbert, Hare and Shaw, leading theatrical figures who were influenced by Robertson included [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and [[Harley Granville-Barker]].<ref name=odnb/> The idealistic young playwright Tom Wrench in Pinero's ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells']]'' (1898) is an affectionate portrait of Robertson, of whom Pinero said, "If it hadn't been for Robertson I should never have been able to do what I have done, and that applies to the other fellows".<ref>''Quoted'' in Hamilton, p. 11</ref>
