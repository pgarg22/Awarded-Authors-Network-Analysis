He has lived in [[London]], [[Nashville]], [[Bridgton, Maine|Bridgton]] (Maine) and now resides in [[Winchester, Virginia]].

==Life and writing career==
Kacian was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], then adopted and raised in [[Gardner, Massachusetts|Gardner]], Massachusetts. He wrote his first mainstream poems in his teens, and published them in small poetry magazines beginning in 1970. He also wrote, recorded, and sold songs while living in Nashville in the 1980s. Upon his return to Virginia in 1985 he discovered [[Haiku in English|English-language haiku]], for which he is best known.
 
In 1993, he founded Red Moon Press, and in the same year began editing the haiku journal ''South by Southeast''.<ref>[http://www.hsa-haiku.org/archives/ann-pubs.htm#southbysoutheast Pub. information, ''South by Southeast'']</ref> Kacian's Red Moon Press is the largest publisher of haiku and haiku-related books outside Japan,<ref>Breen, N. & Lyman, L. ''2004 Poet's Market: 1800+ Places to Publish Your Poetry'', F & W Publications, 2003, {{ISBN|1582971870}}, p. 314.</ref> with a current catalog of over 60 titles in print, and producing some dozen titles a year, including 12 years of the award-winning annual ''Red Moon Anthology''.<ref>[http://www.redmoonpress.com/about_rmp.html About Red Moon Press]</ref> This was followed in 1998 with the editorship of ''Frogpond'', the journal of the [[Haiku Society of America]].

Having proposed a new global haiku association in 1999, Kacian co-founded the World Haiku Association with Ban'ya Natsuishi and Dimitar Anakiev.<ref>[http://www.worldhaiku.net/who_we_are/who.htm Who We Are] on the WHA website</ref> In September 2000 the WHA held its inaugural conference in Tolmin, Slovenia.<ref>[http://www.worldhaiku.net/about/articles.htm WHA Articles of Association] on the WHA website</ref>
  
From August to November 2000, Kacian traveled to nine countries — the UK, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan promoting a global haiku.<ref>Gilbert, Richard. [http://www.gendaihaiku.com/kacian/globalhaiku.html ''Global Haiku and the Work of Jim Kacian''] at http://kacian.gendaihaiku.com</ref><ref name=mh001 /> Having invited haiku poets from around the world to submit their haiku to Frogpond, Kacian compiled and edited 2001's XXIV:1 issue, featuring haiku from 24 countries.

In late 2008 Kacian formed and created The Haiku Foundation, a non-profit organization which focuses on archiving English-language haiku's first century while expanding its second, with an official start-date of January 6, 2009.<ref>[http://haiku.mannlib.cornell.edu/category/author/jim-kacian/page/5 Mann Library’s Daily Haiku » Jim Kacian]</ref>

In August 2013 his comprehensive anthology ''Haiku in English: The First Hundred Years'' was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Kacian served as editor-in-chief for the decade-long project, with Allan Burns and Philip Rowland as associate editors, and with a general introduction by former poet laureate Billy Collins. The anthology tells the story of English-language haiku from its first recognized example—Ezra Pound's “In a Station of the Metro”—to current practice, and offers selections from well over 200 poets in a chronological format. It also features Kacian's 70-page overview of the genre.

==Poetry collections==

Kacian has written sixteen books of poetry, fourteen of which are dedicated to haiku or haiku-related genres. His poems have been translated into many languages.

==Featured work==

Kacian's haiku,

:clouds seen
:through clouds

(along with 29 other chosen haiku) is etched in a stone along the Katikati Haiku Pathway beside the Uretara Stream in New Zealand.<ref>[http://simplyhaiku.com/SHv3n2/features/mair_haikuPathway/CatherineMair_intrvw.html Interview with Catherine Mair about The Haiku Pathway] in Simply Haiku v3n2 Summer 2005</ref> (Poems were selected by the Katikati Haiku Pathway Focus Committee, New Zealand Poetry Society, and Catherine Mair.)

==Theorist==
His advocacy, along with that of such poets as [[Marlene Mountain]] and Janice Bostok, of single-line haiku in English has initiated renewed interest in this form following its rare usage during the 20th century. His work also champions several innovative techniques (as cited by Richard Gilbert in ''The Disjunctive Dragonfly'' and in his book ''Poems of Consciousness''). Kacian's own critical writings elaborate some of these aesthetic innovations.
