He developed a reputation as a religious radical, working actively against poverty and on changing the relationship between priests and lay people. While at Le Moyne, he founded its International House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinsonline.org/s/445/index-1Col.aspx?sid=445&gid=43&pgid=15&cid=292&ecid=292&ciid=0&crid=0&newsid=78|title=International House – Alumni News}}</ref>

While on a sabbatical from Le Moyne in 1963, Berrigan traveled to Paris and met French Jesuits who criticized the social and political conditions in Indochina. Taking inspiration from this, he and his brother Philip founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, a group that organized protests against the war in Vietnam.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/daniel-berrigan-priest-and-peace-activist-dies-aged-94|title= Daniel Berrigan, priest and anti-Vietnam war peace activist, dies|work=The Guardian|date= May 2016}}</ref>

On October 28, 1965, Berrigan, along with the Rev. [[Richard John Neuhaus]] and Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], founded an organization known as '''Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam''' (CALCAV). The organization, founded at the [[Church Center for the United Nations]], was joined by the likes of Dr. [[Hans Morgenthau]], the Rev. [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], the Rev. [[William Sloane Coffin]], and the Rev. [[Philip Berrigan]], among many others. The Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who delivered his 1967 speech ''[[Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence]]'' under sponsorship from CALCAV, served as the national co-chairman of the organization.

From 1966 to 1970, Berrigan was the assistant director of the [[Cornell University]] United Religious Work (CURW), the umbrella organization for all religious groups on campus, including the Cornell Newman Club (later the [[Cornell Catholic Community]]), eventually becoming the group's pastor.<ref name="CornellChron-Cornell-2006">{{cite web | first1=Daniel | last1=Aloi | url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/berrigan.0406.html|title=From Vietnam to Redbud Woods: Daniel Berrigan launches events commemorating five decades of activism at Cornell|date=April 4, 2006|work=[[Cornell Chronicle]]|access-date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> Berrigan was the first faculty advisor of Cornell University's first gay rights student group, the Student Homophile League, in 1968.<ref name="CUGALA online presentation on LGBT student activism on 6/6/2020">{{cite web | first1=Brenda | last1=Marston | url=https://alumni.cornell.edu/event/cugala-reunion-2020-the-first-american-university/|title=CUGALA Reunion 2020 The First American University|date=June 6, 2020|work=[[Cornell University]]|access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref>
