'''Dezső Kosztolányi''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈdɛʒøː ˈkostolaːɲi}}; March 29, 1885 – November 3, 1936) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[writer]], [[journalist]], and [[translator]]. He wrote in all literary genres, from [[poetry]] to [[essays]] to theatre plays. Building his own style, he used French [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]] and psychological [[Literary realism|realism]].  He is considered the father of [[futurism]] in Hungarian literature.

==Biography==
[[File:Tihanyi Kosztolányi 1914.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Lajos Tihanyi]] from 1914]]
Kosztolányi was born in [[Subotica|Szabadka]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (today Subotica, [[Serbia]]) in 1885. The city served as a model for the fictional town of Sárszeg, in which he set his novella ''Skylark'' as well as ''The Golden Kite''. He was the child of Árpád Kosztolányi (1859–1926), physics and chemistry professor and headmaster of a school, and Eulália Brenner (1866–1948), who was of [[French people|French]] origin. 
He started high school in [[Subotica|Szabadka]] but because of a conflict with his teachers he was expelled, and so he graduated as a private student in [[Szeged]]. Kosztolányi moved to [[Budapest]] in 1903, where he studied at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] and met the poets [[Mihály Babits]] and [[Gyula Juhász (poet)|Gyula Juhász]], and later for a short time in [[Vienna]] before becoming a [[journalist]]—a profession he continued for the rest of his life.

In 1908, Kosztolányi replaced the poet [[Endre Ady]], who had left for [[Paris]], as a reporter for a [[Budapest]] daily. In 1910, his first volume of poems, ''The Complaints of a Poor Little Child'', brought nationwide success and marked the beginning of a prolific period in which he published a book nearly every year.  He met the actress Ilona Harmos in the winter of 1910; they were married on 8 May 1913. They had one son. Kosztolányi died in 1936 from [[cancer]] of the [[larynx]].

==Writings==
The literary journal ''[[Nyugat]]'' (Hungarian for "West"), which played an invaluable role in the revitalization of Hungarian literature, was founded in 1908 and Kosztolányi was an early contributor, one of what is often called the "first ''Nyugat'' generation", publishing mainly poetry.

Starting in the 1920s he wrote [[novels]], [[short stories]], and short prose works, including ''Nero, the Bloody Poet'' (to the German edition to which [[Thomas Mann]] wrote the introduction), ''Skylark'', ''The Golden Kite'', ''Kornél Esti'' and ''Anna Édes''. In 1924 he published a volume of verse harkening back to his early work, entitled ''The Complaints of the Sad Man''.

Kosztolányi also produced literary translations in Hungarian, such as [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'', [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]' memoirs on [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s "[[If—]]". He was the first authentic{{clarify|date=December 2015}} translator of [[Rilke]]'s poetry, and he worked a Hungarian masterpiece after [[Paul Valéry]]'s ''[[Cimetiere Marin]]''.
