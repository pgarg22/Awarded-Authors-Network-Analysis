==Biography==
Born in [[Exeter]], she was the youngest of nine children of Emma Marshall, [[née]] Martin (1828–1899), novelist, and Hugh Graham Marshall (c.1825–1899), manager of the West of England Bank. She changed her name on her conversion to Catholicism in adulthood.<ref name=ODNB>Cockin, Katharine.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57057 "St John, Christopher Marie (1871–1960)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 11 March 2010</ref> Having taken a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Modern History]] at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[Oxford]], Marshall became the secretary to [[Mrs Humphry Ward]], [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] and, occasionally, to her son [[Winston Churchill]].

In order to pursue her aim of becoming a dramatist, Marshall went on the stage for three years to learn stagecraft, and occasionally acted as secretary to [[Ellen Terry]]. She lived with Terry's daughter [[Edith Craig]] from 1899 to Craig's death in 1947.  They lived together at [[Smith Square]] and then 31 Bedford Street, [[Covent Garden]] as well as Priest's House, [[Tenterden]], [[Kent]].<ref name=Craig>Cockin, Katharine. ''Edith Craig (1869-1947): Dramatic Lives'', Cassell (1998)</ref> Their relationship became temporarily strained when Craig received, and accepted, a marriage proposal from the composer [[Martin Shaw (composer)|Martin Shaw]] in 1903, and Marshall attempted suicide.<ref name=ODNB/>  In 1916 Marshall and Craig were joined by the artist [[Clare Atwood|Clare 'Tony' Atwood]], living in a [[ménage à trois]] until Craig died in 1947, according to [[Michael Holroyd]] in his book ''A Strange Eventful History''.<ref name=strange/> In 1900 Marshall published her first novel, ''The Crimson Weed'', which takes its title from a transformation of the traditional symbol of the red rose. A feminist, in 1909 she joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), having previously worked for the [[Women Writers' Suffrage League]] and the [[Actresses' Franchise League]].<ref name=Crawford>Crawford, Elizabeth. ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866-1928'' UCL Press (1999)</ref>

In 1909 Marshall turned [[Cicely Hamilton]]'s short story ''How The Vote Was Won'' into a play that became popular with [[women's suffrage]] groups throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. Also in 1909, Marshall joined a WSPU deputation to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], contributing an article ''Why I Went on the Deputation'' to the journal ''Votes for Women'' in July 1909. In November 1909 Marshall appeared as the woman-soldier Hannah Snell in Cicely Hamilton's ''Pageant of Great Women'', directed by Edith Craig. With Hamilton she also wrote ''The Pot and the Kettle'' (1909), and with Charles Thursby,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meanjin.com.au/articles/post/a-curious-encounter-at-st-ives/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102004758/http://meanjin.com.au/articles/post/a-curious-encounter-at-st-ives/ |archivedate=2 January 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> ''The Coronation'' (1912). In May 1911 her play ''The First Actress'' was one of the three plays in the first production of Craig's theatre society, the Pioneer Players.<ref name=Crawford/>  Marshall's plays ''Macrena'' and ''On the East Side'' were produced by the Pioneer Players, as well as her translation (with Marie Potapenko) of ''The Theatre of the Soul'' by [[Nikolai Evreinov]].<ref name=Pioneer>Cockin, Katharine. ''Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players 1911-25'', Palgrave, 2001</ref>

Marshall converted to [[Roman Catholic|Catholicism]] in 1912 and took the name St John.  She, [[Edith Craig]] and [[Clare Atwood]] were friends with many artists and writers including lesbian novelist [[Radclyffe Hall]], who lived nearby in Rye.<ref name="Craig"/>  As Christopher St John in 1915, she published her [[autobiography|autobiographical]] novel ''Hungerheart'', which she had started in 1899, and which she based on her relationship with Edith Craig and her own involvement in the [[women's suffrage]] movement.  St John was contracted by Ellen Terry to assist on various publications.   After Terry's death in 1928, St John published the ''[[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]–Terry Correspondence'' (1931) and Terry's ''Four Lectures on Shakespeare'' (1932). St John and Craig revised and edited Terry's ''Memoirs'' (1933).<ref name=Spheres>Ellen Terry, Spheres of Influence, edited by Katharine Cockin, Pickering & Chatto 2011</ref>  After Edith Craig's death in 1947, St John and Atwood helped to keep the Ellen Terry Memorial Museum in operation.  Some of St John's papers have survived in the National Trust's Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Archive.<ref name=Archive>[http://www.ellenterryarchive.hull.ac.uk AHRC Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Archive Database]</ref>

Marshall died from [[pneumonia]] connected with heart disease at Tenterden in 1960. Marshall and Atwood are buried alongside each other at St John the Baptist's Church, [[Small Hythe]]. Craig's ashes were supposed to be buried there as well, but at the time of Marshall and Atwood's deaths, the ashes got lost and a memorial was placed in the cemetery instead.<ref>''Edy was a Lady'', by Ann Rachlin, Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2011, pg 62</ref>
