'''Michael Peter Scott''' (born 28 September 1959) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] writer of science fiction, fantasy, horror and, under the name '''Anna Dillon''', [[romance novels]].  He is also a collector and editor of folklore. Scott is best known for his [[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]] book series.

==Career==
===Early career===
Scott traveled across Ireland as a dealer of rare and antique books before beginning his writing career.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===Writing===
Scott has produced over 100 books in more than 30 years of active writing. He has written short stories and novels for adults, young adults, and children, in many genres including science fiction, fantasy, horror, folklore, and romance.

His first book (inspired by his fascination with Irish mythology), ''Irish Folk and Fairy Tales, volume 1'', was published in 1983 and became part of a trilogy documenting a large number of Irish folk tales that had, in some cases, only been told verbally prior to his collection.{{citation needed| date=August 2012}} The Irish Folk and Fairy Tales volumes were the culmination of Scott's extensive travels across Ireland whilst working as a book dealer, documenting the tales he found along the way.

When reviewing Scott's ''The De Danann Tales'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'' described him as "the King of Fantasy in these Isles," and the Irish Children's Book Trust in their Definitive Guide to Children's Books recognized him, for his "unparalleled contribution to Children's Literature". ''The De Danann Tales'' was scheduled to be a series of five books but only three were ever published.  He also co-authored two books of a projected trilogy with [[Morgan Llywelyn]], and one standalone book.

He is best known for his six-book young adult series, [[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]].

Scott is also an experienced scriptwriter for stage and screen, having written for a number of projects including documentaries and drama. He once headed up the drama department in Tyrone Productions, the creators of [[Riverdance]]. While working there he scripted high-profile events such as the [[2003 Special Olympics]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Special Olympics boosts sponsors on a social level |first=Catherine |last= O'Mahony |url= http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/05/04/story348992498.asp |website=The Post.Ie |accessdate=25 November 2009 |date=4 May 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020042910/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/05/04/story348992498.asp |archivedate=20 October 2008 }}</ref> which were held in Ireland, and the [[Irish Film and Television Awards]].

Scott has also written a number of drama/romance novels under the pseudonym Anna Dillon.

===Doctor Who===

It was released on 23 February 2013 as an ebook initially, and featured a special celebratory printed anthology which was released alongside the final e-story on 23 November 2013 by [[Puffin Books]]<ref name=Puffin>{{cite web|title=Puffin to celebrate 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who |url=http://pressoffice.penguin.co.uk/static/downloads/releases2012/DoctorWho50thAnniversaryPuffineshortseries.pdf |publisher=Puffin |author= |accessdate=5 February 2013 |date=3 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130130193924/http://pressoffice.penguin.co.uk/static/downloads/releases2012/DoctorWho50thAnniversaryPuffineshortseries.pdf |archivedate=30 January 2013 }}</ref>

===Styles and genres===
Scott's stated first love is mythology. He says that his background, growing up in Ireland with its rich mythology, led him to be naturally drawn to myths. Irish mythology emerged through history relatively unscathed and uninfluenced as they were not invaded by the Romans or Greeks. History also has a strong impact on his style, as it was his favourite subject in school. However, while he has a special taste for mythology, Scott writes what purely interests him, which has led him to write across many genres and styles. He doesn't restrict himself with genre labelling - he says is only interested in being a writer, not a writer of any specific genre.<ref name=Hortorian.com>{{Cite web|title=Questions and Answers with Michael Scott - Hortorian.com |url=http://hortorian.com/2010/11/questions-and-answers-with-michael-scott/ |author=Fiachra Reilly |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201103233/http://hortorian.com/2010/11/questions-and-answers-with-michael-scott/ |archivedate=1 December 2010 }}</ref>

===Online games===
''[[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]'' series has spawned online games, the first related online game to be launched was ''The Codex Master''<ref>{{cite web |first=Teens|last=Random House|title=The Codex Master Game |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/teens/alchemyst/ |publisher=Random House, U.S.A|accessdate=25 November 2009|year= 2007}}</ref> The game is to guess a secret code consisting of a sequence of coloured orbs by inputting various sequences and using logic. When a sequence is entered, indicators show when the player has the right colour and also when a colour is in the right or wrong position to enable them to apply logic and guess the correct sequence.

To celebrate the release of ''The Sorceress'' an online game was created.<ref>{{cite web|first=Shannon |last=Maughan |title=The Sorceress' Heats Up with Marketing Muscle |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6655416.html |work=Publishers Weekly |accessdate=25 November 2009 |date=30 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610173023/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6655416.html |archivedate=10 June 2009 }}</ref> It was called ''The Challenges of the Elder''<ref>{{cite web|first=Creative |last=Asylum |title=The Challenges of the Elder |url=http://www.alchemystgame.com/ |publisher=RHCB |accessdate=25 November 2009 |date=22 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206162916/http://www.alchemystgame.com/ |archivedate=6 December 2009 }}</ref> and launched on 21 April 2009. Players are guided through the game, which is a set of four challenges, by video scenes featuring Michael Scott. The first task, the Alchemyst's challenge, required players to assemble a moving jigsaw of the series' logo against a countdown clock. The second task, the Magician's challenge, required players to turn over two books from a series of books and find matching symbols, when a matching pair was found both books burst into flames and disappeared. The task was complete when all the books had been matched. The third task, the Sorceress' challenge was a colour sequencing game where players chose coloured flasks and would have to repeat the sequence that they were shown in. Players then advanced to meet The Elder, who asked them a set of knowledge questions about the books and were given a 'coloured aura ranking' calculated from their scores and time taken to complete the tasks.

===Film adaptation===
The film rights to ''The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel'' series became available in late 2009, and on 19 November 2009 it was announced in Variety Magazine<ref name=Variety.com>{{cite web |first=Dave|last=McNary|title=DiBonaventura sets up 'Secret' Company to produce 'Nicholas Flamel' series |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118011546.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|date=18 November 2009|publisher=Variety|accessdate=22 November 2009}}</ref> that [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] had bought the film rights to the series. Michael Scott and Barry Krost will be the executive producers. The script writer has yet to be announced.
