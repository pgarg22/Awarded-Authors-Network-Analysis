==Career==

===Theatre===
At the beginning of her career, Smith appeared in a wide range of stage productions, including the role of [[Mistress Quickly]] in an [[Off-Broadway]] production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' with the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=How many liberties can you take with the Bard?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0721/072102.html|access-date=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=July 21, 1983}}</ref> produced by [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. This production was set in [[New Orleans]] in post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] America. For the role, Smith transformed herself into a "Cajun voodoo woman." She used her ability to take on other characters in her future work.<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Haire|first=Patricia|title="Wives of Windsor" make merry in city parks|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=July 26, 1983}}</ref> From being in a variety of situations and in a kind of outsider status, she was a close observer of people and their language. She later told [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], when appearing on his show ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', that she had difficulty getting jobs at the beginning of her acting career because people did not know how to categorize her in terms of ethnicity for casting.<ref name="gates"/>

Smith is best known as a playwright and actress for her "[[documentary theatre]]" style, also called [[verbatim theatre]], in plays such as ''[[Fires in the Mirror]]'' (1992) and ''[[Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992]]'' (1993). Both featured Smith as the sole performer of multiple and diverse characters, based on interviews she had conducted with numerous residents and commentators in the two cities where riots took place. For these works, she won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]] two years in a row. She interviewed more than 100 people as part of her creation of ''Fires in the Mirror'', which dealt with the 1991 [[Crown Heights riot]]. In 1992, she interviewed some 300 people as part of her research for creating ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992'', which dealt with the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] after the acquittal of police officers who beat [[Rodney King]], in events captured on tape.<ref name="Revisit">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Reed|title=Anna Deavere Smith revisits 'Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/25/entertainment/la-et-cm-anna-deavere-smith-20120425|access-date=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 25, 2012}}</ref> Both of these plays were constructed using material solely from interviews.<ref name="Revisit"/>

Smith's plays ''House Arrest'' (2000) and ''Let Me Down Easy'' (2008) were also created in this style.

In 2015, Smith appeared as a guest of Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., on the PBS television show ''[[Finding Your Roots]]''. Her ancestry in America was revealed to her for the first time. She was descended from a long line of free people of color. The most striking facts were linked to her great, great grandfather, Basil Biggs, born 1820 in Maryland. He and his wife Mary were listed in the 1850 U.S. census to be free.  His occupation was listed as veterinarian. In 1858, he moved his wife and four children to the Pennsylvania. He chose to settle in Gettysburg. Another newsworthy article was found in the Cleveland Gazette (1892) which referred to Basil Biggs as the "wealthiest Afro-American in Gettysburg," mentioning his great home on 120 acres.<ref>Public Broadcasting System television series, Season 2, Episode 3:  Finding Your Roots</ref> 41% of Smith's European ancestry is from Great Britain, with remote Scandinavian, Finnish, Russian, Italian, and Greek.<ref>{{cite book|author = Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|title = Finding Your Roots, Season 2: The Official Companion to the PBS Series|publisher = University of North Carolina Press}}</ref>
