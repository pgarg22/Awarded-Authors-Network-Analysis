''Friends'' was hugely successful, and Perry, along with his co-stars, became international celebrities – something Perry had long hoped for. "There was steam coming out of my ears, I wanted to be famous so badly," he told ''The New York Times'' in 2002. "You want the attention, you want the bucks, and you want the best seat in the restaurant."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/arts/film-the-fame-he-craved-came-but-it-wasn-t-enough.html |title=FILM; The Fame He Craved Came, but It Wasn't Enough |last=Kennedy |first=Dana |work=The New York Times |date=August 18, 2002 |access-date=June 21, 2021 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> The program earned him an [[Emmy]] nomination<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/matthew-perry |title=Matthew Perry |work=Television Academy}}</ref> in 2002 for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor - Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]], along with [[Matt LeBlanc]], but the two lost to [[Ray Romano]]. Perry appeared in films such as ''[[Fools Rush In (1997 film)|Fools Rush In]]'' (alongside father [[John Bennett Perry]] and [[Salma Hayek]]), ''[[Almost Heroes]]'', ''[[Three to Tango]]'', ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]'' (alongside [[Bruce Willis]]) and its sequel ''[[The Whole Ten Yards]]'', and ''[[Serving Sara]]''.<ref name="yahoo1"/>

While known primarily for his comic roles, Perry has carved out a career in drama as well, particularly in his portrayal of Associate [[White House Counsel]] Joe Quincy in [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''. His three appearances in that series (twice in the fourth season and once in the fifth) earned him two [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2003 and 2004. Perry is referred to in the show prior to his guest appearance – Donna Moss seeks him out (off-screen) in the episode "20 Hours in LA." He also appeared as attorney Todd Merrick in two episodes near the end of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'''s five-season run, including a two-hour special intended to revive the legal comedy-drama.<ref name="yahoo1"/>

After ''[[Friends]]'' wrapped up, Perry made his directorial debut in an episode of the 4th season of the American comedy-drama ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', in which he also guest starred as "Murray Marks", an operator of a small airport's traffic control team. Murray is asked to donate a kidney to his father Gregory (played by Perry's real father).<ref name="yahoo1"/>

He starred in the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] movie, ''[[The Ron Clark Story]]'' also known as "The Triumph" which premiered August 13, 2006.

From 2006 to 2007, Perry appeared in [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s drama ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. Perry played Matt Albie alongside [[Bradley Whitford]]'s Danny Tripp, a writer-director duo brought in to help save a failing [[Sketch comedy|sketch show]]. Perry's character was considered to be substantially based on Sorkin's own personal experiences, particularly in television.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117936967?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title='Variety' announces Matthew Perry in 'Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip' |newspaper=Variety |date=January 26, 2006 |access-date=September 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183532/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117936967?categoryid=14&cs=1 |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>[[File:Matthew Perry 2010 Emmy.jpg|thumb|Perry in 2010|alt=|left]] In 2006, he began filming ''[[Numb (2007 film)|Numb]]'', a film based on a man suffering from [[depersonalization disorder]].
