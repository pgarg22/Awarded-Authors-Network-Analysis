'''George Sutherland Fraser''' (8 November 1915 â€“ 3 January 1980) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet, literary critic and academic.

== Biography ==
Fraser was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, later moving with his family to [[Aberdeen]]. He attended the [[University of St. Andrews]].

During [[World War II]] he served in the [[British Army]] in [[Cairo]] and [[Eritrea]]. He was published as a poet in ''[[Salamander: A Miscellany of Poetry|Salamander]]'', a Cairo literary magazine. At the same time he was involved with the [[New Apocalyptics]] group, writing an introductory essay for the anthology ''The White Horseman'', and formulating as well as anyone did the idea that they were successors to [[surrealism]].

After the war he became a prominent figure in London's literary circles, working as a journalist and critic. Together with his wife Paddy he made friends with a gamut of literary figures, from the intellectual leader [[William Empson]] to the eccentric [[John Gawsworth]]. He worked with [[Ian Fletcher (literary critic)|Ian Fletcher]] to have Gawsworth's ''Collected Poems'' (1949) published. His direction was that of the traditional [[man of letters]] (soon to become extinct).

In 1948, Fraser contributed an [[essay]] entitled "A Language by Itself" to a [[book|biblio]]-[[symposium]] honouring the sixtieth [[birthday]] of [[T. S. Eliot]]. Drawing comparisons with [[John Donne]], he praised the poet's profound refreshment (particularly in ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'') of the English poetic tongue, together with his subtle facility for transitional verse and his potent effect on the poetic youth; but, more importantly for present purposes, he also confessed, "I am not a very original writer myself; I am lost, on the whole, without a convention of some sort [...]."<ref>Fraser 1948, p. 172.</ref>

In 1949 he accepted the job of replacing [[Edmund Blunden]] as Cultural Adviser to the UK Liaison Mission in [[Tokyo]]. This ended badly when he suffered a breakdown in 1951 while in [[Japan]]. Subsequently he was much less the poet than the all-purpose writer.

He became a lecturer at the [[University of Leicester]] in 1959, where he was an inspiring teacher, remaining there until retirement in 1979.

He married Eileen Lucy Andrew (who was known as Paddy from birth) in 1946. She wrote a brief memoir of her life with Fraser: ''[http://jacketmagazine.com/20/fraser.html G. S. Fraser: A Memoir]''. Together they had two daughters, including [[Helen Fraser (executive)|Helen Fraser]], and a son.<ref name="Paddy obit">{{cite web|last1=Fraser|first1=Helen|title=Paddy Fraser obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/21/paddy-fraser-obituary|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gallacher|first1=Cathryn|title=Helen Fraser, CBE|url=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-degrees/hondeg10/fraser.html|website=University of Bristol|accessdate=20 November 2017|date=14 July 2010}}</ref> Paddy died in 2013.<ref name="Paddy obit" />
