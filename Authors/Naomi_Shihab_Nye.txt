==Early life==

He and his family became refugees in 1948, when the state of Israel was created. She has said her father "seemed a little shell-shocked when I was a child."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/|title=- The Washington Post|website=Washington Post}}</ref> She grew up initially in Ferguson, St. Louis County, Missouri. In 1966, when Nye was 14, the family moved to the [[West Bank]], Palestine when her father's mother was sick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2014/09/palestinian-american-poet-naomi-shihab-nye-grew-up-in-ferguson-and-the-west-bank/|title=Poet Naomi Shihab Nye Grew Up in Ferguson and the West Bank|date=September 1, 2014}}</ref> After less than a year,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2017/06/poem-of-the-week-darling-by-naomi-shihab-nye/532377/|title=Poem of the Week: 'Darling' by Naomi Shihab Nye - The Atlantic|first=Annika|last=Neklason|website=www.theatlantic.com}}</ref> before the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] occurred,<ref name="auto"/> they moved to San Antonio, Texas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary American women poets : an A-to-Z guide|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=Cucinella, Catherine.|isbn=978-0313317835|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=144590762}}</ref>

She earned a BA in English and world religions from Trinity University<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poets.org/poet/naomi-shihab-nye|title=About Naomi Shihab Nye &#124; Academy of American Poets|first=Academy of American|last=Poets|website=poets.org}}</ref> in 1974 and has lived in San Antonio ever since.<ref name="auto"/>

==Career==

===Teaching writing===
After graduation, Nye worked as a writer-in-schools with the Texas Commission on the Arts. She has continued to teach writing workshops, mostly to kids.<ref name="auto"/> Currently, she teaches creative writing at Texas State University.<ref name="Department of English 2021">{{cite web | title=Permanent Faculty | website=Department of English | date=9 Mar 2021 | url=//www.english.txstate.edu/mfa/Faculty/Permanent-Faculty-.html | access-date=9 Jun 2021}}</ref>

===Writing===
Nye characterizes herself as a "wandering poet," and says that much of her poetry is inspired by her childhood memories and her travels. She considers San Antonio her current home, "San Antonio feels most like home as I have lived here the longest. But everywhere can be home the moment you unpack, make a tiny space that feels agreeable". San Antonio is the inspiration behind many of her poems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kate|last2=Nye|first2=Naomi Shihab|date=2009|title=Roots: On Language and Heritage: A Conversation with Naomi Shihab Nye|jstor=20621789|journal=World Literature Today|volume=83|issue=6|pages=31–34}}</ref> Both roots and sense of place are major themes in her body of work. Her poems are frank and accessible, often making use of ordinary images in startling ways. Her ability to enter into foreign experiences and chronicle them from the inside is reminiscent of [[Elizabeth Bishop]], while her simple and direct "voice" is akin to that of her mentor [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]].

Her first collection of poems, ''Different Ways to Pray'', explored the theme of similarities and differences between cultures, which would become one of her lifelong areas of focus. Her other books include poetry collections ''[[19 Varieties of Gazelle|19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems of the Middle East]]'', ''Red Suitcase'', and ''Fuel''; a collection of essays entitled ''Never in a Hurry''; a young-adult novel called ''[[Habibi (novel)|Habibi]]'' (the autobiographical story of an Arab-American teenager who moves to Jerusalem in the 1970s) and picture book ''Lullaby Raft'', which is also the title of one of her two albums of music. (The other is called Rutabaga-Roo; both were limited-edition.)

Nye's first two chapter books, ''Tattooed Feet'' (1977) and ''Eye-to-Eye'' (1978), are written in free verse and possess themes of questing. Nye's first full-length collection, ''Different Ways to Pray'' (1980), explores the differences between and shared experiences of cultures from California to Texas and from South America to Mexico. ''Hugging the Jukebox'' (1982), a full-length collection that won the Voertman Poetry Prize, focuses on the connections between diverse peoples and on the perspectives of those in other lands. ''Yellow Glove'' (1986) presents poems with more tragic and sorrowful themes. According to the [[Poetry Foundation]], ''Fuel'' (1998) may be Nye's most acclaimed volume and ranges over a variety of subjects, scenes and settings.<ref name="Poetry Foundation">{{cite web|title=Naomi Shihab Nye |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/naomi-shihab-nye |website=[[Poetry Foundation]]|access-date=November 5, 2014}}</ref>

Nye's poem ''Famous'' was referenced and quoted in full by Judge [[Andre M. Davis|Andre Davis]] in his concurring opinion on the case ''[[Gender identity under Title IX#G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board|G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board]]''.<ref name="Poetry in the Courtroom">{{cite web|title=Poetry in the courtroom |url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/04/11/poetry-in-the-courtroom-gavin-grimm/|access-date=September 6, 2017|date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>

Her poem ''So much happiness''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poets.org/poem/so-much-happiness|title=So Much Happiness by Naomi Shihab Nye - Poems &#124; Academy of American Poets|first=Academy of American|last=Poets|website=poets.org}}</ref> was included in the 'Happiness' edition of [[Parabola (magazine)|Parabola]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.parabola.org/vol-422-happiness-p176.aspx|title=VOL. 42:2 Happiness|website=Parabola Online Store}}</ref>

===Editing anthologies===
Nye has edited many anthologies of poems, for audiences both young and old. One of the best-known is ''This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from around the World'', which contains translated work by 129 poets from 68 different countries. Her most recent anthology is called ''Is This Forever, Or What?: Poems & Paintings from Texas''.

==Awards and recognition==
Nye has won many awards and fellowships, among them four [[Pushcart Prize]]s, the [[Jane Addams Children's Book Award]], the Paterson Poetry Prize, and many notable book and best book citations from the [[American Library Association]], and a 2,000 Witter Bynner Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2000/00-019.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000605055008/http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2000/00-019.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 5, 2000 |title=Poetry in America Celebration - News Releases (Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=February 25, 2000 |access-date=November 13, 2013 }}</ref> In 1997, Trinity University, her alma mater, honored her with the Distinguished Alumna Award.

In October 2012, she was named laureate of the 2013 [[NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neustadtprize.org/naomi-shihab-nye-wins-2013-nsk-prize/|title=Naomi Shihab Nye Wins 2013 NSK Prize|date=June 4, 2013}}</ref> The NSK Prize is a juried award sponsored by the [[University of Oklahoma]] and ''[[World Literature Today]]'' magazine. In her nominating statement, Ibtisam Barakat, the juror who championed Nye for the award wrote, "Naomi's incandescent humanity and voice can change the world, or someone's world, by taking a position not one word less beautiful than an exquisite poem." Barakat commended her work by saying, "Naomi's poetry masterfully blends music, images, colors, languages, and insights into poems that ache like a shore pacing in ebb and flow, expecting the arrival of meaning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.com/nsk-childrens-prize |title=NSK Children's Prize |publisher=World Literature Today |access-date=November 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2019, the [[Poetry Foundation]] designated Nye their [[Young People's Poet Laureate]] for the 2019–21 term. The Foundation's announcement characterized Nye's writing style as one that "moves seamlessly between ages in a way that is accessible, warm, and sophisticated even for the youngest of readers."<ref name="laureate" />

==Personal life==
Although she calls herself a "wandering poet", Shihab Nye refers to [[San Antonio]] as her home and lives there with her family. She says a visit to her grandmother in the [[West Bank]] village of [[Sinjil]] was a life-changing experience. In 1978, she married Michael Nye, who worked initially as an attorney and latterly on photography and on writing on topics including hunger, teenage pregnancy and mental illness. They have one son.<ref name="auto"/>
