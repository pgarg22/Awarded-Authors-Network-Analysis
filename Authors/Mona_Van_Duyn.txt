==Biography==

===Early years===

Van Duyn was born May 9, 1921 in [[Waterloo, Iowa]].<ref name=":0">"Van Duyn, Mona (1921–2004)." ''[[Dictionary of Women Worldwide|Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages]]'', edited by Anne Commire and Deborah Klezmer, vol. 2, Yorkin Publications, 2007, p. 1916. ''Gale eBooks''. Accessed 6 Sept. 2021.</ref> She grew up in the small town of [[Eldora, Iowa|Eldora]] (pop. 3,200) where she read voraciously in the town library and wrote poems secretly in notebooks from her grade school years to her high school years. Van Duyn earned a B.A. from [[Iowa State Teachers College]] in 1942, and an M.A. from the [[State University of Iowa]] in 1943, the year she married Jarvis Thurston.<ref name=":0" /> She and Thurston studied in the Ph.D. program at Iowa. In 1946 she was hired as an instructor at the [[University of Louisville]] when her husband became an assistant professor there. Together they began ''Perspective: A Quarterly of Literature and the Arts'' in 1947, which she edited for the next twenty years.<ref name=":0" /> They shifted that journal to [[Washington University in St. Louis]] when they moved there in 1950.<ref name=":0" />

===Academic career===

In St. Louis, Van Duyn taught English from 1950 to 1967 at Washington University.<ref name=":0" /> Thurston became chair of the Washington University Department of English, and Van Duyn and Thurston drew to St. Louis and presided over what would become a unique literary circle of creative writers and critics. (It  included poet [[Howard Nemerov]], novelist and critic [[William Gass]], novelist [[Stanley Elkin]], poets [[Donald Finkel]] and John Morris, critic Richard Stang, authors Wayne Fields and Naomi Lebowitz, and others.){{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} [[File:Joan Elkin's Painting, Jarvis Thurston and His Circle.jpg|thumb|Artist Joan Elkin's 1993 painting "Jarvis Thurston and His Circle" captures key members of the Washington University literary community. Ms Van Duyn (seated) and Dr. Thurston occupy the foreground. Novelist Stanley Elkin talks with Richard Stang, far right. Behind Ms. Van Duyn are poet Donald Finkel (in glasses) and painter Arthur Osver.]] Continuing to edit ''Perspective'' until it ceased publication in 1975, they are recognized for their role in fostering literary talent nationwide and for publishing early works by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[W. S. Merwin]], [[Douglas Woolf]], and many others.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} 
Van Duyn was a friend of poet [[James Merrill]] and instrumental in securing his papers for the Washington University Special Collections in the mid 1960s. She was a lecturer in the University College of Washington University until her retirement in 1990. In 1983, a year after she had published her fifth book of poems, she was named Adjunct Professor in the English Department and became the "Visiting Hurst Professor" in 1987, the year she was invited to be a member of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]].<ref name="Famous Iowans: Van Duyn, Mona">{{cite web|url= http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/99999999/FAMOUSIOWANS/603120338/Van-Duyn-Mona|title= Famous Iowans: Van Duyn, Mona|work= DesMoinesRegister.com|publisher= The Des Moines Register|access-date= May 16, 2010|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://archive.today/20120730220456/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/99999999/FAMOUSIOWANS/603120338/Van-Duyn-Mona|archive-date= July 30, 2012}}</ref>

===Career as a poet===

Van Duyn won every major U.S. prize for poetry, including the [[National Book Award]] (1971) for ''To See, To Take'',<ref name=nba1971/> the [[Bollingen Prize]] (1971), the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]] (1989), and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] (1991) for ''[[Near Changes]]''.<ref name=pulitzer/> She was the [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|U.S. Poet Laureate]] between 1992 and 1993.<ref name=":0" /> Despite her accolades, her career fluctuated between praise and obscurity. Her views of [[love]] and [[marriage]] ranged from the scathing to the optimistic.  In "What I Want to Say", she wrote of love:
:''It is the absolute narrowing of possibilities''
:''and everyone, down to the last man''
:''dreads it''

But in "Late Loving", she wrote:
:''Love is finding the familiar dear''

''To See, To Take'' (1970) was a collection of poems that gathered together three previous books and some uncollected work and won the [[National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref name=nba1971/> In 1981 she became a fellow in the [[Academy of American Poets]] and then, in 1985, one of the twelve Chancellors who serve for life.<ref name=":0" /> Collected poems, ''If It Be Not I'' (1992) included four volumes that had appeared since her first collected poems. It was published simultaneously with a new collection of poetry, ''Firefall''.

In 1993 she was inducted into the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|access-date=25 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E7tA66dm?url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|archive-date=2 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1996.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter V|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterV.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>
