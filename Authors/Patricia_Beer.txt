==Biography==
She was born in [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]], [[Devon]] into a family of [[Plymouth Brethren]]. Her mother died when she was fourteen and it affected her entire life and the way she saw death. Patricia Beer was strongly influenced by the Plymouth Brethren Church, a loosely structured, fundamentalist sect. She attended [[Exmouth Grammar School]] before reading English at [[Exeter University]]. Beer moved away from her religious background as a young adult, becoming a teacher and academic. She took her [[Bachelor of Letters|B.Litt]] at the [[University of Oxford]] following which she spent seven years in Italy where she taught [[English Literature]] at the [[University of Padua]], the British Institute and the Ministero Aeronautica in Rome.<ref name=IND/>

She began to write poetry after [[World War II]], while living in [[Italy]]; she is most often classified as a 'New Romantic' poet comparable to [[John Heath-Stubbs]]. On her own account, however, there is a discontinuity in her work. Devon is a major presence.<ref name=ARCHIVE>{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=1533 |title=Patricia Beer - 1924-1999 |work=The Poetry Archive |publisher= |location=Gloucestershire, UK |access-date=2009-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218114706/http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=1533 |archive-date=18 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Beer returned to England in 1953 where she became Senior Lecturer in English at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] at the [[University of London]] (1962-1968). From the later 1960s she wrote full-time. She edited several significant [[anthologies]], broadcast, and contributed to literary reviews.<ref name=IND/>

She was married twice; first in 1960 to the writer [[P. N. Furbank]], and then in 1964 to John Damien Parsons, an architect, settling in [[Upottery]], near [[Honiton]], England.
