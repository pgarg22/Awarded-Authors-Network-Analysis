'''Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Cocteau''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|t|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|k|ɒ|k|ˈ|t|oʊ}}, {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ moʁis øʒɛn klemɑ̃ kɔkto|lang}}; 5 July 1889 – 11 October 1963) was a French poet, playwright, novelist, designer, filmmaker, visual artist and critic.

==Works==
Jean Cocteau insisted on calling himself a [[poet]], classifying the great variety of his works – poems, novels, plays, essays, drawings, films – as "poésie", "poésie de roman", "poésie de thêatre", "poésie critique", "poésie graphique" and "poésie cinématographique".<ref name="FS">Francis Steegmuller "Jean Cocteau: A Brief Biography", ''Jean Cocteau and the French Scene'', Abbeville Press 1984</ref>

He is best known for his novels ''Le Grand Écart'' (1923), ''Le Livre Blanc'' (1928), and ''[[Les Enfants Terribles]]'' (1929); the stage plays ''[[The Human Voice|La Voix Humaine]]'' (1930), ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|La Machine Infernale]]'' (1934), ''[[Les Parents terribles]]'' (1938), ''[[La Machine à écrire]]'' (1941), and ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' (1946); and the films ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930), ''[[Les Parents terribles (film)|Les Parents Terribles]]'' (1948), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1946), ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'' (1949), and ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1960), which alongside ''Blood of a Poet'' and ''Orpheus'' constitute the so-called [[Orphic Trilogy]]. He was described as "one of [the] [[avant-garde]]'s most successful and influential filmmakers" by [[AllMovie]].<ref name="A">{{cite web |title=Biography |url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/jean-cocteau-p85359 |website=AllMovie}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cocteau was born in [[Maisons-Laffitte]], [[Yvelines]], a town near [[Paris]], to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eugénie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family. His father, a lawyer and amateur painter, committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900 to 1904, Cocteau attended the [[Lycée Condorcet]] where he met and began a relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos, who would reappear throughout Cocteau's oeuvre.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Guédras|editor1-first=Annie|title=Jean Cocteau: Erotic Drawings|date=1999|publisher=Evergreen|location=Köln|isbn=3-8228-6532-X|page=11}}</ref> He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, ''Aladdin's Lamp'', at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artistic circles as ''The Frivolous Prince'', the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. [[Edith Wharton]] described him as a man "to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City..."<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/wharton/edith/backward_glance/chapter11.html|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/wharton/edith/backward_glance/index.html|title=A Backward Glance|last1=Wharton|first1=Edith|publisher=eBooks@Adelaide|date=17 December 2014|chapter=Chapter 11|orig-year=1st pub. 1934|access-date=9 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829004848/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/wharton/edith/backward_glance/index.html|archive-date=29 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Early career===

[[File:Erik Satie Parade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Érik Satie]], Parade, thème de Jean Cocteau|150px]]

In his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers [[Marcel Proust]], [[André Gide]], and [[Maurice Barrès]]. In 1912, he collaborated with [[Léon Bakst]] on ''[[Le Dieu bleu]]'' for the [[Ballets Russes]]; the principal dancers being [[Tamara Karsavina]] and [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. During [[World War I]], Cocteau served in the [[Red Cross]] as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], artists [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' in 1917. It was produced by [[Diaghilev]], with sets by Picasso, the [[libretto]] by Apollinaire and the music by [[Erik Satie]]. "If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform," wrote Cocteau, "with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

An important exponent of [[avant-garde art]], Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as [[Les six]]. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named [[Le Boeuf sur le Toit (cabaret)|Le Boeuf sur le Toit]], a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Daniella|title=How the ''Ox'' got its name, and other Parisian legends.|url=http://daniellathompson.com/Texts/Le_Boeuf/boeuf.pt.5.htm|website=The Boeuf Chronicles|publisher=Musica Brasiliensis|access-date=9 April 2016|date=6 May 2002}} (Autoplaying music on site)</ref>

===Friendship with Raymond Radiguet===
[[File:Marie Laurencin, 1921, Portrait de Jean Cocteau.jpg|thumb|[[Marie Laurencin]], ''Portrait de Jean Cocteau'', 1921]]
In 1918 he met the French poet [[Raymond Radiguet]]. They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service. Admiring of Radiguet's great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend's works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of ''[[Le Diable au corps (novel)|Le Diable au corps]]'' (a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man), exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the "[[Nouveau Monde]]" literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=32}} Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature.<ref name="Steegmuller">{{cite book |author=Francis Steegmuller|title=Cocteau, A Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/cocteaubiography00stee|url-access=registration|quote=Monsieur, I have just received your letter and must reply despite my regret at being unable to explain the inexplicable. It is possible that my friendship for your son and my deep admiration for his gifts (which are becoming increasingly apparent) are of an uncommon intensity, and that from the outside it is hard to make out how far my feelings go. His literary future is of primary consideration with me: he is a kind of prodigy. Scandal would spoil all this freshness. You cannot possibly believe for a second that I do not try to avoid that by all the means in my power|year=1970|publisher=Boston, Little, Brown}}</ref>

There is disagreement over Cocteau's reaction to Radiguet's sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to [[opium]] addiction. Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of ''[[Les noces]]'' (''The Wedding'') by the [[Ballets Russes]] at [[Monte Carlo]]. Cocteau himself much later characterised his reaction as one of "stupor and disgust."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His opium addiction at the time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~lenin/jean_cocteau_biogra.html |title=Jean Cocteau Biography – Jean Cocteau Website |publisher=Netcomuk.co.uk |date=11 October 1963 |access-date=14 March 2012}}</ref> Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the [[Monte Carlo Opera]]. Cocteau's opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book, ''[[Les Enfants Terribles]]'', was written in a week during a strenuous [[opium]] weaning. In ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Opium: Journal of drug rehabilitation|fr|3=Opium : Journal d'une désintoxication}}'', he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]]. Under Maritain's influence Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects.

===Further works===
On 15 June 1926 Cocteau's play ''[[Orpheus (play)|Orphée]]'' was staged in Paris. It was quickly followed by an exhibition of drawings and "constructions" called ''Poésie plastique–objets, dessins''. Cocteau wrote the libretto for [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', which had its original performance in the [[Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt]] in Paris on 30 May 1927. In 1929 one of his most celebrated and well known works, the novel ''[[Les Enfants terribles]]'' was published.<ref name="FS" />

In 1930 Cocteau made his first film ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'', publicly shown in 1932. Though now generally accepted as a [[surrealism|surrealist]] film, the surrealists themselves did not accept it as a truly surrealist work. Although this is one of Cocteau's best known works, his 1930s are notable rather for a number of stage plays, above all ''[[La Voix humaine]]'' and ''[[Les Parents terribles]]'', which was a popular success. His 1934 play ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|La Machine infernale]]'' was Cocteau's stage version of the [[Oedipus]] legend and is considered to be his greatest work for the theater.<ref>Neal Oxenhandler "The Theater of Jean Cocteau", ''Jean Cocteau and the French scene'', Abbeville Press 1984</ref> During this period Cocteau also published two volumes of journalism, including ''Mon Premier Voyage: Tour du Monde en 80 jours'', a neo-[[Jules Verne]] around the world travel reportage he made for the newspaper [[Paris-Soir]].<ref name="FS" />

===1940–1944===
[[File:Jean Cocteau I Married a Witch Maryhill Museum.jpg|thumb|''Tribute to René Clair: I Married a Witch'', Jean Cocteau (1945), a set design for the [[Théâtre de la Mode]].]]

Biographer [[James S. Williams]] describes Cocteau's politics as "naturally Right-leaning."{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=123}} During the [[Nazi occupation of France]], he 
was in a ''"round-table"'' of French and German intellectuals who met at the [[Georges V Hotel in Paris]], including Cocteau, the writers [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Paul Morand]] and [[Henry Millon de Montherlant]], the publisher [[Gaston Gallimard]] and the Nazi legal scholar [[Carl Schmitt]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Junger  |first= Ernst |title= A German Officer in Occupied Paris |year=2019  |publisher= Columbia University Press |location= New York |isbn= 9780231127400 |page= xvi}}</ref>

His friend [[Arno Breker]] convinced him that [[Adolf Hitler]] was a pacifist and patron of the arts with France's best interests in mind. In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führer's sexuality. Cocteau effusively praised Breker's sculptures in an article entitled 'Salut à Breker' published in 1942. This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had used his contacts to his failed attempt to save friends such as [[Max Jacob]].{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=182–185}}

In 1940, ''Le Bel Indifférent'', Cocteau's play written for and starring [[Édith Piaf]] (who died the day before Cocteau), was enormously successful.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cocteau|first=Jean|title=Musée SACEM : Edith Piaf et Jean Cocteau|url=https://musee.sacem.fr/index.php/ExhibitionCMS/Chroniques/SimpleExhibitions?id=151|access-date=2020-08-23|website=musee.sacem.fr|language=fr}}</ref>

===Later years===
Cocteau's later years are mostly associated with his films. Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming [[French New Wave]] genre.<ref name="A" />

Following ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930), his best known films include ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1946), ''[[Les Parents terribles (film)|Les Parents terribles]]'' (1948), and ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'' (1949). His final film, ''[[Testament of Orpheus|Le Testament d'Orphée]]'' (''The Testament of Orpheus'') (1960), featured appearances by Picasso and matador [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]], along with [[Yul Brynner]], who also helped finance the film.

In 1945 Cocteau was one of several designers who created sets for the [[Théâtre de la Mode]]. He drew inspiration from filmmaker [[René Clair]] while making ''Tribute to René Clair: I Married a Witch''. The [[maquette]] is described in his "Journal 1942–1945," in his entry for 12 February 1945: {{blockquote|I saw the model of my set. Fashion bores me, but I am amused by the set and fashion placed together. It is a smoldering maid's room. One discovers an aerial view of Paris through the wall and ceiling holes. It creates vertigo. On the iron bed lies a fainted bride. Behind her stand several dismayed ladies. On the right, a very elegant lady washes her hands in a flophouse basin. Through the unhinged door on the left, a lady enters with raised arms. Others are pushed against the walls. The vision provoking this catastrophe is a bride-witch astride a broom, flying through the ceiling, her hair and train streaming.}}

In 1956 Cocteau decorated the ''Chapelle Saint-Pierre'' in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] with mural paintings. The following year he also decorated the marriage hall at the Hôtel de Ville in [[Menton]].<ref>''Jean Cocteau and the French scene'', Abbeville Press 1984, p. 227</ref>

===Private life===
Jean Cocteau never hid his [[homosexuality]]. He was the author of the mildly homoerotic and semi-autobiographical ''Le livre blanc'' (translated as ''The White Paper'' or ''The White Book''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/cocteau.htm|title=Cocteau's White Paper on Homophobia|website=rictornorton.co.uk}}</ref> published anonymously in 1928. He never repudiated its authorship and a later edition of the novel features his foreword and drawings. The novel begins:

{{quote|As far back as I can remember, and even at an age when the mind does not yet influence the senses, I find traces of my love of boys. I have always loved the strong sex that I find legitimate to call the fair sex. My misfortunes came from a society that condemns the rare as a crime and forces us to reform our inclinations.}}

Frequently his work, either literary (''[[Les enfants terribles]]''), graphic (erotic drawings, book illustration, paintings) or cinematographic (''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'', ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''), is pervaded with homosexual undertones, homoerotic imagery/symbolism or [[Camp (style)|camp]]. In 1947 [[w:fr:Paul Morihien|Paul Morihien]] published a clandestine edition of ''[[Querelle de Brest]]'' by [[Jean Genet]], featuring 29 very explicit erotic drawings by Cocteau. In recent years several albums of Cocteau's [[homoerotica]] have been available to the general public.

It is widely believed that Cocteau had affairs with [[Raymond Radiguet]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyrb.com/collections/raymond-radiguet|title=Raymond Radiguet|website=New York Review Books|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> [[w:fr:Jean Desbordes|Jean Desbordes]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kb.nl/fr/collection-koopman/le-livre-blanc|title=Le livre blanc {{!}} Koninklijke Bibliotheek|website=kb.nl|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> [[w:fr:Marcel Khill|Marcel Khill]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cocteau.biu-montpellier.fr/index.php?id=601|title=Cocteau|website=cocteau.biu-montpellier.fr|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> and [[Panama Al Brown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narratively.com/the-secret-story-of-the-groundbreaking-boxing-champ-who-lost-his-title-because-he-was-gay/|title=The Secret Story of the Groundbreaking Boxing Champ Who Lost His Title -- Because He Was Gay|date=2017-06-15|website=Narratively|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>

In the 1930s, Cocteau is rumoured to have had a very brief affair with Princess [[Natalie Paley]], the daughter of a [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Romanov Grand Duke]] and herself a sometime actress, model, and former wife of couturier [[Lucien Lelong]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liaut|first1=Jean-Noël|title=Natalie Paley: Une princesse dechiree|date=1996|publisher=Filipacchi|location=Paris|isbn=2-85018-295-8|language=fr}}</ref>

Cocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with French actors [[Jean Marais]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecrannoir.fr/stars/legendes/marais.htm|title=Légendes d'Écran Noir: Jean Marais|website=ecrannoir.fr}}</ref> and [[w:fr:Édouard Dermit|Édouard Dermit]], whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in ''[[L'Éternel Retour|The Eternal Return]]'' (1943), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1946), ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' (1947), and ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'' (1949).

===Death===
Cocteau died of a heart attack at his [[château]] in [[Milly La Foret|Milly-la-Forêt]], Essonne, France, on 11 October 1963 at the age of 74. His friend, French singer [[Édith Piaf]], died the day before but that was announced on the morning of Cocteau's day of death; it has been said, in a story which is almost certainly apocryphal, that his heart failed upon hearing of Piaf's death. Cocteau's health had already been in decline for several months, and he had previously had a severe heart attack on 22 April 1963. A more plausible suggestion for the reason behind this decline in health has been proposed by author [[Roger Peyrefitte]],<ref>''Propos secrets'', Paris: Albin Michel, 1977</ref> who notes that Cocteau had been devastated by a breach with his longtime friend, socialite and notable patron [[Francine Weisweiller]], as a result of an affair she had been having with a minor writer.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1450644/Francine-Weisweiller.html ''Francine Weisweiller obituary'']</ref> Weisweiller and Cocteau did not reconcile until shortly before Cocteau's death.

According to his wishes Cocteau is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint-Blaise des Simples in Milly-la-Forêt.<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 8971). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref> The epitaph on his gravestone set in the floor of the chapel reads: "I stay with you" ("Je reste avec vous").

==Honours and awards==
In 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the [[Académie Française]] and [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|The Royal Academy of Belgium]].

During his life, Cocteau was commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]], Member of the Mallarmé Academy, German Academy (Berlin), American Academy, [[Mark Twain]] (U.S.A) Academy, Honorary President of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], Honorary President of the France-Hungary Association and President of the Jazz Academy and of the Academy of the Disc.
