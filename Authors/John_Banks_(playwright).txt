'''John Banks'''  (c. 1650&ndash;1706) was an English playwright of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era. His works concentrated on historical dramas, and his plays were twice suppressed because of their implications, or supposed implications, for the contemporaneous political situation.

Virtually nothing is known about Banks's early life; his date of birth has been estimated on the basis of his later biography. He studied law at the New Inn, one of the minor [[Inns of Chancery]] attached to the [[Middle Temple]]. Banks's first play was ''The Rival Kings''  of [[1677 in literature|1677]], written in imitation of [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s ''The Rival Queens'' of the same year. Banks followed this with ''[[The Destruction of Troy]]'', which was staged by the [[Duke's Company]] at their [[Dorset Garden Theatre]] in November [[1678 in literature|1678]] and printed the following year. His ''[[The Unhappy Favourite|The Unhappy Favourite, or the Earl of Essex]]'' ([[1682 in literature|1682]]) was his first major success. ([[John Dryden]] provided a Prologue and Epilogue.) Banks was considered a crude writer who could nonetheless, at his best, create powerful drama. His other [[1682 in literature|1682]] play ''Virtue Betrayed, or Anna Bullen'' proved to be his most popular play, and was acted as late as [[1766 in literature|1766]].

His next play, however, was judged more crude than powerful: ''The Innocent Usurper'', based on the life of [[Lady Jane Grey]], was disliked by both the [[King's Company]] and the Duke's Company. And his subsequent attempt, ''The Island Queens, or the Death of Mary Queen of Scotland'' ([[1684 in literature|1684]]), was banned on political grounds. (Banks published the play in [[1686 in literature|1686]]. It would eventually be staged as ''The Albion Queens'', twenty years after its creation &mdash; and would be a hit with its audience.)

He tried to stage ''The Innocent Usurper'' again in [[1693 in literature|1693]], but on this second attempt the play was banned for political reasons. Yet he did get the play published in [[1694 in literature|1694]]. His last drama was his ''[[Cyrus the Great (play)|Cyrus the Great]]'' (inspired by ''Le Grand Cyrus'' of [[Madeleine de Scudéry]]). The acting companies resisted this work, because of its perceived low quality; but the play proved to be another success once staged, by the King's Company at their [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] theatre.
