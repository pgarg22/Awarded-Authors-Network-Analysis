He was born '''Nicholas Valentin Yermakov''', but began writing as Simon Hawke in 1984 and later changed his legal name to '''Hawke'''.

He was the Colorado Writer of the Year, 1992.<ref>{{cite book | first=Taylor | last=Stephanie | title=Contemporary Authors New Revision Series | chapter=Hawke, Simon 1951â€“ | volume=154 | publisher=Gale | year=2007}} </ref>

==Career==
As Nicholas Yermakov, his early books were published in 1981-1984 including two ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' [[novelization]]s. Since re-launching his career as  Simon Hawke in 1984, he has produced a large volume of lighter fiction. Almost all of his books published after 1984 have been either part of a series and/or [[tie-in novel]]s and novelizations.

His first major work as Simon Hawke was the ''[[Timewars]]'' series, which recounts the adventures of an organization tasked with protecting history from being changed by [[time travel]]lers. In the world of the series, many people and events we consider fictional are historical, and vice versa; the action of each book in the series weaves in and out of the events of a famous work of literature. For example, in the first book in the series time travellers contesting the fate of [[Richard I of England]] become caught up in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.

He has also written a series of humorous [[mystery fiction|murder mysteries]] which features a young [[William Shakespeare]] and a fictional friend, Symington "Tuck" Smythe.

In 2017, he received the Phoenix Award from DeepSouthCon 55.<ref>http://www.southernfan.com/deepsouthcon.htm</ref>
