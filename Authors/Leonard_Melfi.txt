'''Leonard Melfi''' (February 21, 1932 &ndash; October 28, 2001) was an American [[playwright]] and [[actor]] whose work has been widely produced on the American stage.

== Life and career ==
Leonard was the eldest child of Leonard and Louise Melfi, who owned and operated the Circle Tavern in [[Binghamton, New York]]. In a 1966 radio interview with [[WBAI]]'s Janet Coleman, he said, "We always talked, and we always cooked together, and while cooking we drank. My father's father was a bootlegger and my mother's father made wine in the cellar... I was sort of doomed." He joked that he had developed his taste for alcohol by "working in the family business."

Melfi briefly attended [[St. Bonaventure University]], followed by a [[tour of duty]] in Germany. Upon his discharge from the [[U.S. Army]], Melfi moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a playwriting career.

His plays tended to portray [[Outcast (person)|social outcasts]] with dark secrets spontaneously revealed in moments of great anxiety. He was among the most prominent artists making [[experimental theatre]] at the beginnings of the [[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-Broadway movement]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guernsey|first=Otis L.|year=1974|title=Playwrights, Lyricists, and Composers on Theatre|publisher=Mead/Dodd}}

A number of Melfi's later plays were produced at the [[Theater for the New City]].

Melfi struggled with alcohol for many years, and eventually moved into the [[single room occupancy]] Narragansett Hotel at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[93rd Street]]. On October 24, 2001, Melfi's niece tried to visit her uncle and found his door to be locked. She tried again two days later, with no success, and became worried. The following day, [[paramedic]]s arrived at the hotel and transported Melfi to [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], where he died four hours later of [[congestive heart failure]].

Melfi's body was misplaced by hospital staff and was found four months later in a [[potter's field (graveyard)|potter's grave]]. After weeks of working through [[bureaucracy]], his brother John had Leonard's body exhumed and brought to [[Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel|Campbell Funeral Home]]. There, the coffin was opened and John verified the body as his brother's. He had the body transferred to DeMarco Funeral Home in Binghamton, and after a complete funeral service including a mass he was buried in the family plot next to his sister in April 2002.

Memorial services were held for the playwright on May 5, 2002 at La MaMa following an April 17 ''New York Times'' article describing the playwright's final days.<ref>http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4565460-1.html</ref> Playwright [[Edward Albee]] sent the following note, which was read aloud to those present at the memorial: "Years ago, there were many serious and daring individuals in Greenwich Village under 30 as well as young playwrights, myself included. It was a wild and vital time, and no one was more vital than Leonard."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/17/nyregion/for-once-death-imitates-art-a-talented-playwright-s-journey-to-a-pauper-s-grave.html|title=For Once, Death Imitates Art; A Talented Playwright's Journey to a Pauper's Grave|last1=Barry|first1=Dan|date=April 17, 2002|work=The New York Times|last2=Gussow|first2=Mel}}</ref>
