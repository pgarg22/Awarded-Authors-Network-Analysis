==Works==

Adaptation of the English Medieval [[Mystery Plays]], based on the [[York Mystery Plays|York]] and [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] cycles, ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', were first performed in 1985 by the Royal National Theatre.<ref name="Head2006"/> Interviewed by [[Melvyn Bragg]] for [[BBC]] television in 2012, Harrison said: "It was only when I did the Mystery Plays and got [[Northern England|Northern]] actors doing verse, that I felt that I was reclaiming the energy of classical verse in the voices that it was created for."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01czct7 "Melvyn Bragg on Class and Culture: Episode 2], [[BBC2]], broadcast 2 March 2012</ref>

One of his best-known works is the long poem "[[V (poem)|V]]" (1985), written during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike of 1984–85]], and describing a trip to see his parents' grave in [[Holbeck]] Cemetery in [[Beeston, Leeds]], 'now littered with beer cans and vandalised by obscene graffiti'. The title has several possible interpretations: victory, versus, verse, etc. Proposals to screen a filmed version of "V" by [[Channel 4]] in October 1987 drew howls of outrage from the tabloid press, some broadsheet journalists, and MPs, apparently concerned about the effects its "''torrents of obscene language''" and "''streams of four-letter filth''" would have on the nation's youth. Indeed, an [[Early day motion|Early Day Motion]] entitled "Television Obscenity" was proposed on 27 October 1987 by a group of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), who condemned Channel 4 and the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]]. The motion was opposed only by MP [[Norman Buchan]], who suggested that fellow members had either failed to read or failed to understand the poem. The broadcast went ahead and, after widespread press coverage, the uproar subsided. [[Gerald Howarth]] MP said that Harrison was "Probably another [[bolshie]] poet wishing to impose his frustrations on the rest of us". When told of this, Harrison retorted that Howarth was "Probably another idiot MP wishing to impose his intellectual limitations on the rest of us".<ref name="The Independent">{{cite news|title=The Blagger's Guide To: Tony Harrison|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-blaggers-guide-to-tony-harrison-7687291.html|access-date=16 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=29 April 2012}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Richard Eyre]] calls Harrison's 1990 play, ''[[The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus]]'' "among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s". [[Jocelyn Herbert]], famous designer of the British theatrical scene, comments that Harrison is aware of the dramatic visual impact of his ideas: "The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage. Some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like, but Tony always knows exactly what he wants."<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|title=The Guardian Profile: Tony Harrison Man of mysteries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/01/poetry.theatre|access-date=17 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2000}}</ref>

[[Edith Hall]] has written that she is convinced that Harrison's 1998 [[film-poem]] ''[[Prometheus (1998 film)|Prometheus]]'' is "artistic reaction to the fall of the British working class" at the end of the twentieth century,<ref name="Edith Hall"/><ref name="Hardwick2003">{{cite book|author=Lorna Hardwick|title=Reception Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKYSc5RDMncC&pg=PA84|access-date=12 May 2013|date=15 May 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-19-852865-4|pages=84–85}}</ref> and considers it as "the most important adaptation of classical myth for a radical political purpose for years" and Harrison's "most brilliant artwork, with the possible exception of his stage play ''The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus''".<ref name="Edith Hall">{{cite web|title=Tony Harrison's Prometheus: A View from the Left|url=http://www.bu.edu/arion/files/2010/03/Hall-Harrison-Prometheus.pdf|author=Edith Hall|author-link=Edith Hall|quote=...&nbsp;an essential requirement in a film where the most unlikely wheezing ex-miner is slowly made to represent Prometheus himself}}</ref>

Professor [[Roger Griffin]] of the Department of History at [[Oxford Brookes University]], in his paper ''The palingenetic political community: rethinking the legitimation of totalitarian regimes in inter-war Europe'', describes Harrison's film-poem as "magnificent" and suggests that Harrison is trying to tell his audience
"To avoid falling prey to the collective mirage of a new order, to stay wide awake while others succumb to the [[lethe]] of the group mind, to resist the gaze of modern Gorgons".<ref name=Griffin>{{cite journal|title=The palingenetic political community: rethinking the legitimation of totalitarian regimes in inter-war Europe.|journal=[[Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions]]|date=December 2002|volume=3|issue=3|pages=24–43|url=http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/palingcomm.pdf|author=Roger Griffin|doi=10.1080/714005484}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
