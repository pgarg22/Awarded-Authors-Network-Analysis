=={{anchor|Early life and education}}Early life and education==
Girish Karnad was born in [[Matheran]], in present-day [[Maharashtra]], in 1938. His mother Krishnabai (née Mankikar) was a young widow with a son who belonged to a poor family. Since it was necessary for her to earn a living, she began working as a nurse and cook (general housekeeper) for the bedridden wife of a certain Raghunath Karnad, a doctor in the [[Bombay Medical Services]]. He was from the Konkani speaking Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin community.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-12|title=Girish Karnad, the artiste as a brave intellectual|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/girish-karnad-the-artiste-as-a-brave-intellectual/story-b9DKJvnYrGhlfJcZv3spnK.html|access-date=2021-03-21|website=Hindustan Times|language=en}}</ref>

Some five years later, and while the first wife was still alive, Krishnabai and Dr. Raghunath Karnad were married in a private ceremony. The marriage was controversial not because of bigamy (it was legal until 1956 for a Hindu man to have more than one wife) but because of the prevailing social prejudice against widow remarriage. Therefore, the wedding was held privately, and under the dispensation of the [[Arya Samaj]], a reform organization that condones widow remarriage. Girish was the third of the four children born thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/essay/beginnings | title=How a Brahmin woman broke into the twentieth century | access-date=8 August 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808135841/http://www.caravanmagazine.in/essay/beginnings | archive-date=8 August 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Karnad's initial schooling was in Marathi. Later, after his father was transferred to [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]] in the [[Kannada]]-speaking regions of [[Bombay Presidency]], Karnad was exposed to travelling theatre groups and ''natak mandalis'' (theatre troupes), which were experiencing a period of efflorescence during the iconic [[Balgandharva]] era .<ref>[[#Ku|Kumar, p.115]]</ref> As a youngster, he was an ardent admirer of [[Yakshagana]] and the theater in his village.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.museindia.com/showcont.asp?id=10 |title=Conversation with Girish Karnad |work=Bhargavi Rao on [[Muse India]] |publisher=Muse India |access-date=11 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316065029/http://www.museindia.com/showcont.asp?id=10 |archive-date=16 March 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> His family moved to [[Dharwad]] in Karnataka when he was fourteen, where he grew up with his two sisters and a niece.<ref name=mint>{{cite web| title = Conversation: 'I wish I were a magician'| publisher = Livemint| url = http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ZzkS8xw8yBGc5o2lZkuRAM/Conversation--I-wish-I-were-a-magician.html| date = 11 October 2013| access-date = 2013-10-12| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033409/http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ZzkS8xw8yBGc5o2lZkuRAM/Conversation--I-wish-I-were-a-magician.html| archive-date = 12 October 2013| url-status = live}}</ref>

===Literature===
[[File:Girish-Karnad.jpg|thumb|Karnad in 2010]]
Karnad is known as a playwright. His plays, written in [[Kannada]], have been translated into English (mostly translated by himself) and some Indian languages. Kannada is his language of choice.

When Karnad started writing plays, [[Kannada literature]] was highly influenced by the renaissance in [[Western literature]]. Writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of native soil. [[C. Rajagopalachari]]'s version of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' published in 1951, left a deep impact on him<ref name=sachi58>[[#Sa|Sachindananda, p. 58]]</ref> and soon, sometime in the mid-1950s, one day he experienced a rush of dialogues by characters from the Mahabharata in Kannada.

"I could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears ... I was just the scribe," said Karnad in a later interview. ''Yayati'' was published in 1961, when he was 23 years old. It is based on the story of King [[Yayati]], one of the ancestors of the [[Pandavas]], who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor, [[Shukracharya]], who was incensed at Yayati's infidelity.

Yayati, in turn, asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him, and one of them agrees. It ridicules the ironies of life through characters in ''Mahabharata''. The play in Hindi was adapted by [[Satyadev Dubey]] and [[Amrish Puri]] was lead actor for the play. It became an instant success, immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages.<ref name="today">{{cite web |title=PROFILE: GIRISH KARNAD: Renaissance Man |url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/12041999/arts.html |date=12 April 1999 |work=[[India Today]] |access-date=29 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124040310/http://india-today.com/itoday/12041999/arts.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Karnad found a new approach of drawing historical and mythological sources to tackle contemporary themes and [[existentialist]] crisis of modern man through characters locked in psychological and philosophical conflicts. His next was ''[[Tughlaq (play)|Tughlaq]]'' (1964), about a rashly idealist 14th-century [[Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], and allegory on the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]vian era which started with ambitious idealism and ended up in disillusionment.<ref name=sachi58/> This established Karnad, now 26 years old, as a promising playwright in the [[India|country]]. It was staged by the [[National School of Drama]] Repertory under the direction of [[Ebrahim Alkazi]], with the actor [[Manohar Singh]], playing the visionary king who later becomes disillusioned and turns bitter, amidst the historic [[Purana Qila]] in Delhi. It was staged in London by the National School of Drama for the Festival of India in 1982.<ref name=hin/><ref name=today/>

''Hayavadana'' (1971) was based on a theme drawn from ''The Transposed Heads'', a 1940 novella by [[Thomas Mann]], which is originally found in the 11th-century Sanskrit text ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]''. Herein he employed the folk theatre form of [[Yakshagana]]. A German version of the play was directed by [[Vijaya Mehta]] as part of the repertoire of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Deutsches National Theatre, Weimar]].

''Naga-Mandala'' (Play with Cobra, 1988) was based on a folk tale related to him by A. K. Ramanujam, brought him the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award for the Most Creative Work of 1989. It was directed by J. Garland Wright, as part of the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of Guthrie Theatre, Minneapolis. The theatre subsequently commissioned him to write the play, ''Agni Mattu Male'' (The Fire and the Rain). Though before it came ''[[Taledanda]]'' (Death by Beheading, 1990) which used the backdrop, the rise of [[Veerashaivism]], a radical protest and reform movement in 12th century Karnataka to bring out current issues.<ref name=hin/><ref>{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia|author=Don Rubin |publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1998|isbn=978-0-415-05933-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MUiXjMUl34C&q=hindi+theatre&pg=PA219 |page=196|ref=Ru }}</ref>

===Movies===
Karnad made his acting as well as screenwriting debut in a Kannada movie, ''[[Samskara (film)|Samskara]]'' (1970), based on a novel by [[U.R. Ananthamurthy]] and directed by Pattabhirama Reddy. That movie won the first [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|President's Golden Lotus Award]] for [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada cinema]].

In television, he played the role of Swami's father in the TV series ''[[Malgudi Days (TV series)|Malgudi Days]]'' (1986–1987), based on [[R. K. Narayan]]'s books, directed by [[Kannada]] actor and director [[Shankar Nag]]. He also hosted the science magazine [[Turning Point (Doordarshan)|Turning Point]] on Doordarshan, in the early 1990s.

He made his directorial debut with ''[[Vamsha Vriksha]]'' (1971), based on a [[Kannada]] novel by [[S. L. Bhyrappa]]. It won him [[National Film Award for Best Direction]] along with [[B. V. Karanth]], who co-directed the film. Later, Karnad directed several movies in [[Kannada]] and [[Hindi]], including ''[[Godhuli]]'' (1977) and ''[[Utsav]]'' (1984). Karnad has made number of documentaries, like one on the Kannada poet [[D. R. Bendre]] (1972), ''Kanaka-Purandara'' (English, 1988) on two medieval [[Bhakti]] poets of Karnataka, [[Kanaka Dasa]] and [[Purandara Dasa]], and ''The Lamp in the Niche'' (English, 1989) on Sufism and the [[Bhakti movement]]. Many of his films and documentaries have won several national and international awards.

Some of his famous Kannada movies include ''[[Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane]]'', ''[[Ondanondu Kaladalli]]'', ''[[Cheluvi]]'' and ''[[Kaadu (1973 Kannada film)|Kaadu]]'' and most recent film ''Kanooru Heggaditi'' (1999), based on a novel by Kannada writer [[Kuvempu]].

His Hindi movies include ''[[Nishaant]]'' (1975), ''[[Manthan]]'' (1976), ''[[Swami (1977 film)|Swami]]'' (1977) and ''[[Pukar (2000 film)|Pukar]]'' (2000). He has acted in a number of [[Nagesh Kukunoor]] films, starting with ''[[Iqbal (film)|Iqbal]]'' (2005), where Karnad's role of the ruthless cricket coach got him critical acclaim. This was followed by ''[[Dor (film)|Dor]]'' (2006), ''[[8 x 10 Tasveer]]'' (2009) and ''[[Aashayein]]'' (2010). He played a key role in movies "[[Ek Tha Tiger]]" (2012) and its sequel "[[Tiger Zinda Hai]]" (2017) produced by Yash Raj Films.

Karnad has acted in the Kannada gangster movie ''[[Aa Dinagalu]]''.

==Controversies==

At the Tata Literary Festival held in [[Mumbai]] in 2012, Karnad was invited to speak about "his life in theater" in an hour-long session. Instead of talking about the subject, he took the opportunity to lash out at [[V. S. Naipaul]] for his "antipathy towards Indian Muslims". V. S. Naipaul had earlier been conferred the Lifetime achievement award by the festival's organisers. Karnad also criticized the organizers for having honored Naipaul.

The audience, which had gathered to hear Karnad speak, had mixed reactions to the speech. Some, like organizer [[Anil Dharker]], tried ineffectually to steer the speech toward less controversial waters. Others were amused by the episode, and some commented on the research and logic that had gone into the speech (unfortunately overshadowed by its 'scandalous' nature).<ref name=ie>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/girish-karnad-slams-v-s-naipaul-for-his-antiislam-views-questions-his-mumbai-fest-award/1026127/0 Girish Karnad slams V S Naipaul for his anti-Islam views, questions his Mumbai fest award] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105192003/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/girish-karnad-slams-v-s-naipaul-for-his-antiislam-views-questions-his-mumbai-fest-award/1026127/0 |date=5 November 2012 }}, ''[[Indian Express]]'', 3 November 2012.</ref>

Just a few weeks after this, Karnad again created controversy by claiming that [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who wrote India's national anthem, was a great poet but a second-rate playwright.<ref name=dc>[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/rabindranath-tagore%E2%80%99s-plays-unbearable-girish-karnad-074] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110055443/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/rabindranath-tagore%E2%80%99s-plays-unbearable-girish-karnad-074 |date=10 November 2012 }}''[[Deccan Chronicle]]''.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-09/india/35015880_1_girish-karnad-rabindranath-tagore-bengali-theatre |title=Rabindranath Tagore a 'second-rate playwright', Girish Karnad says |access-date=9 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127031806/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-09/india/35015880_1_girish-karnad-rabindranath-tagore-bengali-theatre |archive-date=27 January 2013 |work=[[The Times of India]] |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In November 2015, during celebrations marking the anniversary of 18th-century Muslim ruler [[Tipu Sultan]]'s birth, Karnad stated that [[Kempegowda International Airport|Bangalore International Airport]] should have been named after Tipu Sultan instead of [[Kempe Gowda I|Kempe Gowda]].
