'''Walter John de la Mare''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OM|CH}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə|ˌ|m|ɛər}};<ref>Alec Guinness, ''Blessings in Disguise'', p. 93.</ref> 25 April 1873 – 22 June 1956) was an English poet, short story writer, and novelist. He is probably best remembered for his [[children's literature|works for children]], for his poem "The Listeners",<ref>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Reid-Walsh |first=Jacqueline |year=1988 |title=The Burning-Glass: A Developmental Study of Walter de la Mare's Poetry  |publisher=McGill University |pages=51–56 |url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/thesisfile75903.pdf |place=Montreal }} Includes the poem itself and analysis.</ref> and for a highly acclaimed selection of subtle psychological horror stories, amongst them "Seaton's Aunt" and "All Hallows".

In  1921, his novel ''[[Memoirs of a Midget]]'' won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction,<ref>[http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/events/tait-black/winners/fiction "Fiction winners"]. James Tait Black Prizes: Previous Winners. The University of Edinburgh. Retrieved 11 November 2012.</ref> and his post-war ''[[Collected Stories for Children]]'' won the 1947 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for British children's books.<ref name=medal1947/>

==Life==

De la Mare was born in Kent at 83 Maryon Road, [[Charlton, Greenwich|Charlton]]<ref>Theresa Whistler, "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=32771&back= Mare, Walter John de la (1873–1956)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct. 2006. Retrieved 2 April 2013.</ref> (now part of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]]), partly descended from a family of French [[Huguenot]]s, and was educated at [[St Paul's Cathedral School]]. He was born to James Edward de la Mare, a principal at the [[Bank of England]], and Lucy Sophia Browning (James's second wife), daughter of Scottish [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]] and author Dr Colin Arrott Browning. The suggestion that Lucy was related to poet [[Robert Browning]] has been found to be incorrect. He had two brothers, Francis Arthur Edward and James Herbert, and four sisters Florence Mary, Constance Eliza, Ethel (who died in infancy), and Ada Mary. De la Mare preferred to be known as 'Jack' by his family and friends as he disliked the name Walter.

He worked from 1890 in the statistics department of the London office of [[Standard Oil]] for eighteen years to support his family, but nevertheless found time to write. In 1908, through the efforts of Sir [[Henry Newbolt]] he received a [[Civil List]] pension which enabled him to concentrate on writing.

In 1892, de la Mare joined the Esperanza Amateur Dramatics Club, where he met and fell in love with Elfrida Ingpen, the leading lady, who was ten years older than he. They were married on 4 August 1899, and they went on to have four children: Richard Herbert Ingpen, Colin, Florence and Lucy Elfrida de la Mare. The new family lived in [[Beckenham]] and [[Anerley]] from 1899 till 1924.<ref>Beckenham heritage, "[http://www.beckenhamheritagegroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Walter-de-la-Mare.pdf= Beckenham period]"</ref> It was in Beckenham at Mackenzie Road that the children were born; his first book of poems, ''Songs of Childhood'', published (under the name Walter Ramal); and ''Henry Brocken'' written. Their house at Anerley in south London was the scene of many parties, notable for imaginative games of [[charades]].<ref>Peggy Denton, "[http://www.norwoodsociety.co.uk/book-reviews/179-walter-de-la-mare-poet-of-anerley-and-south-east-london.html Walter de la Mare – Poet of Anerley and South East London]", The Norwood Society.</ref>

In 1940, his wife Elfrida was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and spent the rest of her life as an invalid, eventually dying in 1943. From 1940 until his death, de la Mare lived in [[South End House, Montpelier Row]], [[Twickenham]], the same street on which [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], had lived a century earlier. For the ''Collected Stories for Children'' (Faber and Faber, 1947), he won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].<ref name=medal1947/> It was the first collection to win the award.

De la Mare suffered from a [[coronary thrombosis]] in 1947 and died of another in 1956. He spent his final year mostly bed-ridden, being cared for by a nurse whom he loved but never had a physical relationship with.<ref name="campbell">James Campbell, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/10/booksforchildrenandteenagers.featuresreviews A kind of magic], ''The Guardian'', 10 June 2006.</ref> His ashes are buried in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], where he had once been a choirboy.

==The imagination==
De la Mare described two distinct "types" of imagination – although "aspects" might be a better term: the childlike and the boylike. It was at the border between the two that [[Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], and the rest of the great poets lay.

De la Mare claimed that all children fall into the category of having a childlike imagination at first, which is usually replaced at some point in their lives. He explained in the lecture "[[Rupert Brooke]] and the Intellectual Imagination"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = de la Mare | first1 = Walter | title = Rupert Brooke and the Intellectual Imagination | publisher = Sidgwick & Jackson | year = 1919 | location = London | url = https://archive.org/details/rupertbrookethei00delauoft | access-date = 29 January 2014 }}</ref>{{efn|name=intellectual}} that children "are not bound in by their groping senses. Facts to them are the liveliest of chameleons. ... They are contemplatives, solitaries, [[fakir]]s, who sink again and again out of the noise and fever of existence and into a waking vision."  His biographer Doris Ross McCrosson summarises this passage, "Children are, in short, visionaries." This visionary view of life can be seen as either vital creativity and ingenuity, or fatal disconnection from reality (or, in a limited sense, both).

The increasing intrusions of the external world upon the mind, however, frighten the childlike imagination, which "retires like a shocked snail into its shell". From then onward the boyish imagination flourishes, the "intellectual, analytical type".

By adulthood (de la Mare proposed), the childlike imagination has either retreated for ever or grown bold enough to face the real world. Thus emerge the two extremes of the [[spectrum]] of adult minds: the mind moulded by the boylike is "[[logical]]" and "[[deductive]]". That shaped by the childlike becomes "[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]". For de la Mare, "The one knows that beauty is truth, the other reveals that truth is beauty." Yet another way he puts it is that the visionary's source of poetry is within, while the intellectual's sources are without – external – in "action, knowledge of things, and experience" (McCrosson's terms). De la Mare hastens to add that this does not make the intellectual's poetry any less good, but it is clear where his own preference lies.{{efn |name=intellectual}}

==''Come Hither''==
''Come Hither'' was an anthology, edited by de la Mare, mostly of poetry with some prose. It has a [[frame story]], and can be read on several levels. It was first published in 1923, and was a success; further editions followed. Alongside children's literature it includes a selection of the leading [[Georgian poets]] (from de la Mare's perspective).

==Supernaturalism==
De la Mare was a notable writer of [[ghost story|ghost stories]]. His collections ''[[Eight Tales]]'', ''The Riddle and Other Stories'', ''The Connoisseur and Other Stories'', ''On the Edge'' and ''The Wind Blows Over'' contain several ghost stories each.

De la Mare's supernatural horror writings were a favourite of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who in his classic study ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'' remarked that "he is able to put into his occasional fear-studies a keen potency which only a rare master can achieve",<ref>[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/shil.aspx essays at hplovecraft.com]</ref> especially praising his short stories "Seaton's Aunt", "The Tree", "Out of the Deep", "Mr Kempe", "A Recluse" and "All Hallows", along with his novel ''The Return''. [[Gary William Crawford]] has described de la Mare's supernatural fiction for adults as being "among the finest to appear in the first half of this century", whilst noting the disparity between the high quality and low quantity of de la Mare's mature horror stories.<ref name="gwc">Gary William Crawford, "On the Edge: the Ghost Stories of Walter de la Mare" in [[Darrell Schweitzer]], ed., ''Discovering Classic Horror Fiction I'', Wildside Press, 1992, pp. 53–56. {{ISBN|1-58715-002-6}}.</ref> Other notable de la Mare ghost/horror stories are "A:B:O", "Crewe", "The Green Room" and "Winter".

Several later writers of supernatural fiction, including [[Robert Aickman]], [[Ramsey Campbell]],<ref name="gwc" /> [[David A. McIntee]] and [[Reggie Oliver]], have cited de la Mare's ghost stories as highly inspirational. The horror scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] has said that de la Mare's supernatural fiction "should always have an audience that will shudder apprehensively at its horror and be moved to somber reflection by its pensive philosophy".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nE6cFX-iE0sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Return'', Walter de la Mare, at books.google.co.uk]</ref>

For children, de la Mare wrote the fairy tale ''The Three Mulla Mulgars'' (1910, AKA ''The Three Royal Monkeys''), praised by the literary historian Julia Briggs as a "neglected masterpiece"<ref>Julia Briggs, "Transitions", in [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]], ed., ''Children's literature: an illustrated history'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 181. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}.</ref> and by the critic [[Brian Stableford]] as a "classic animal fantasy".<ref>"De la Mare, Walter" in Brian Stableford,
''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature''. Scarecrow Press, 2005, pp. 104–05.</ref> [[Richard Adams]] said it was his favourite novel.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n3quw/i_am_richard_adams_author_of_watership_down/ccf3r28 Reddit AMA, 25 September 2013.]</ref>

Writer [[Joan Aiken]] cited some of his short stories, such as "The Almond Tree" and "Sambo and the Snow Mountains", for their sometimes unexplained quality, which she also employed in her own work.<ref>{{cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |url=https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg |url-access=registration |author=Joan Aiken |editor= Geoff Fox |editor2= Graham Hammond |editor3= Terry Jones |editor4= Frederic Smith |editor5= Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg/page/24 24] }}</ref>{{clarify |date=November 2012 |how does this fit here?}}

De la Mare's play ''Crossings'' has an important role in [[Robertson Davies]]' novel ''[[The Manticore]]''.

==Notes==
{{notelist |25em |notes=

{{efn |name=intellectual |1=
In the lecture "Rupert Brooke and the Intellectual Imagination", de la Mare used the term "imagination" for both the intellectual and the visionary. To simplify and clarify his language, de la Mare generally used the more conventional "[[reason]]" and "imagination" when discussing the same idea elsewhere.}}
