'''Michael Hartnett''' ({{lang-ga|Mícheál Ó hAirtnéide}}) (18 September 1941 – 13 October 1999) was an [[Irish poetry|Irish poet]] who wrote in both English and Irish. He was one of the most significant voices in late 20th-century Irish writing and has been called "[[Munster]]'s de facto poet laureate".<ref name="Nolan">{{cite news | last = Nolan | first = Val | title = The Shoulders for a Raggy Coat | publisher = Poetry Ireland Newsletter|date=July 2009 }}</ref>

==Early life and background==
Michael Harnett was born in [[Croom Hospital]], [[County Limerick]].<ref>Hartnett liked to cite his birth in Croom hospital, as Croom was an area connected with the ancient Gaelic poets</ref> Although his parents' name was Harnett, he was registered in error as Hartnett on his birth certificate. In later life he declined to change this as his legal name was closer to the Irish Ó hAirtnéide. He grew up in the Maiden Street area of [[Newcastle West]], Co. Limerick, spending much of his time with his grandmother Bridget Halpin, who resided in the townland of Camas, in the countryside nearby. Hartnett claimed that his grandmother, was one of the last native speakers to live in Co. Limerick, though she was originally from North [[County Kerry|Kerry]]. He claims that, although she spoke to him mainly in English, he would listen to her conversing with her friends in Irish, and as such, he was quite unaware of the imbalances between English and Irish, since he experienced the free interchange of both languages. When he began school, he claims that he was made aware of the tensions between both languages, and was surprised to discover that Irish was considered an endangered language, taught as a contrived, rule-laden code, with little of the literary attraction which it held for him. He was educated in the local national and secondary schools in Newcastle West. Hartnett emigrated to England the day after he finished his secondary education and went to work as a tea boy on a building site in London.

==Early writings==
Hartnett had started writing by this time and his work came to  of the poet [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]], who was professor of English at [[University College Dublin]].  Jordan invited Hartnett to attend the university for a year. While back in Dublin, he co-edited the literary magazine ''[[Arena]]'' with [[James Liddy]]. He also worked as curator of [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] tower at [[Sandycove]] for a time. He returned briefly to London, where he met Rosemary Grantley on 16 May 1965, and they were married on 4 April 1966. His first book, ''Anatomy of a Cliché'', was published by [[Poetry Ireland]] in 1968 to critical acclaim and he returned to live permanently in Dublin that same year.

He worked as a night telephonist at the telephone exchange on Exchequer Street. He now entered a productive relationship with [[New Writers Press]], run by [[Michael Smith (poet)|Michael Smith]] and [[Trevor Joyce]]. They published his next three books. The first of these was a translation from the Irish,  ''The Old Hag of Beare'' (1969), followed by ''Selected Poems'' (1970) and  ''Tao'' (1972). This last book was a version of the Chinese ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. His ''Gypsy Ballads'' (1973), a translation of the ''Romancero Gitano'' of [[Federico García Lorca]]  was published by the [[Goldsmith Press]].

==A Farewell to English==
In 1974 Hartnett decided to leave Dublin to return to his rural roots, as well as deepen his relationship with the Irish language. He went to live in [[Templeglantine]], five miles from Newcastle West, and worked for a time as a lecturer in creative writing at [[Thomond College of Education, Limerick]].

In his 1975 book ''A Farewell to English'' he declared his intention to write only in Irish in the future, describing English as 'the perfect language to sell pigs in'. A number of volumes in Irish followed: ''Adharca Broic'' (1978), ''An Phurgóid'' (1983) and ''Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn'' (1984).
A biography on this period of Michael Hartnett's life entitled 'A Rebel Act Michael Hartnett's Farewell To English' by Pat Walsh was published in 2012 by Mercier Press.

==Later life and works==
In 1984 he returned to Dublin to live in the suburb of [[Inchicore]]. The following year marked his return to English with the publication of ''Inchicore Haiku'', a book that deals with the turbulent events in his personal life over the previous few years. This was followed by a number of books in English including ''A Necklace of Wrens'' (1987), ''Poems to Younger Women'' (1989) and ''The Killing of Dreams'' (1992).

He also continued working in Irish, and produced a sequence of important volumes of translation of classic works into English. These included ''Ó Bruadair, Selected Poems of [[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]]'' (1985) and ''Ó Rathaille The Poems of [[Aogán Ó Rathaille|Aodhaghán Ó Rathaille]]'' (1999). His ''Collected Poems'' appeared in two volumes in 1984 and 1987 and ''New and Selected Poems'' in 1995. Hartnett died from Alcoholic Liver Syndrome. A new ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 2001.
