'''John Francis Alexander Heath-Stubbs''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (9 July 1918 – 26 December 2006) was an English poet and translator. He is known for verse influenced by classical myths, and for a long Arthurian poem, ''Artorius'' (1972).

==Biography and works==
Heath-Stubbs was born at [[Streatham]], London. The family later lived in [[Hampstead]]. His parents were Francis Heath-Stubbs, a non-practising, independently wealthy solicitor,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb133-jhs |title=Papers of John Heath Stubbs - Archives Hub}}</ref><ref>''Encyclopaedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present'', vol. 2, ed. George Stade and Karen Karbiener, 2010, p. 233.]</ref> and his wife Edith Louise Sara, a concert pianist under her maiden name, Edie Marr. His boyhood was largely spent near the [[New Forest]].<ref name="ODNB">A. Curtis (2011): "Stubbs, John Francis Alexander Heath (1918–2006), poet", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP).

The Stubbs family were gentry from Staffordshire; Heath-Stubbs's great-great-grandfather Joseph, a younger son, married Mary, the only child of a judge named Heath, this eventually becoming part of the family name.<ref>Sir Bernard Burke, ''A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland, fourth edition'', Part II, Harrison (Pall Mall), 1863, p. 1453.</ref><ref>Sampson Erdeswicke et al, ''A Survey of Staffordshire Containing the Antiquities of that County'', J. B. Nichols & Son, 1844, p. 298.</ref> Heath-Stubbs stated in his autobiography ''Hindsights'' (1993), "In my grandfather's day, the last of the Heaths made us Stubbses her heirs, so long as we changed our name to Heath-Stubbs." Furthermore, "according to family tradition", they were related to the pamphleteer [[John Stubbs]], who was sentenced to the loss of his right hand by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] for his opposition to negotiations for her marriage to [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], and yet remained a staunch royalist.<ref>''World Authors 1900–1950'', vol. 2, ed. Martin Seymour-Smith, Andrew C. Kimmens and H. W. Wilson, 1996, p. 1170.</ref> "Family pride, combining with a poised self-irony" marked Heath-Stubbs's poem ''Epitaph'', beginning, "Mr Heath-Stubbs as you must understand/Came of a gentleman's family out of Staffordshire/Of as good blood as any in England/But he was wall-eyed and his legs too spare."<ref>''Books and Bookmen'', vol. 19, no. 3, issue 219, ed. Gareth Marshallsea, Hansom Books, December 1973, p. 52.</ref><ref>''The Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse'', ed. Kenneth Allott, Penguin Books, 1980, p. 308.</ref>

Heath-Stubbs was educated at [[Bembridge School]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] and at the age of 21 entered [[Queen's College, Oxford]], where he read English, finding the lectures of [[Nevill Coghill]] and [[C. S. Lewis]] particularly rewarding. He became a poetry adviser to the firm of [[Routledge]], co-editing ''Eight Oxford Poets'' in 1941, with [[Sidney Keyes]] and Michael Meyer,<ref name="ODNB"/> and helping to edit ''Oxford Poetry'' in 1942–1943.

By that time Heath-Stubbs had recognized his homosexuality, though his love for the poet and artist Philip Rawson was returned only in the form of strong friendship. Heath-Stubbs in the early 1940s reverted to regular [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] worship.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Heath-Stubbs held the Gregory Fellowship of Poetry at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] in 1952–1955, followed by professorships in [[Alexandria, Egypt]] in 1955–1958 and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1960–1961, and teaching posts at the College of St Mark and St John in Chelsea in 1962–1972 and at [[Merton College, Oxford]] for twenty years from 1972. He lived for a time in the 1950s at [[Zennor]] in [[Cornwall]].

Heath-Stubbs's translations include work by [[Sappho]], [[Horace]], [[Catullus]], [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. He was a central figure in British poetry in the early 1950s, editing, for example, the poetry anthology ''Images of Tomorrow'' (1953) and with [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]] the ''[[Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse]]''. He was elected to the [[Royal Society of Literature|RSL]] in 1954, awarded the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] in 1973, and appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1989.<ref name="Guardian">{{Cite news |last=Meyer |first=Michael |date=29 December 2006 |title=John Heath-Stubbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1979644,00.html |work=Obituary from The Guardian |location=London, England |access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref>

Although diagnosed with glaucoma at the age of 18, a condition he inherited from his father,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/book-review-a-sight-more-interesting-hindsights-an-autobiography-john-heathstubbs-hodder-25-pounds-and-sweetapple-earth-john-heathstubbs-carcanet-7-95-pounds-1487146.html |title=BOOK REVIEW / A sight more interesting: 'Hindsights: An Autobiography' |website=[[Independent.co.uk]] |date=23 October 2011}}</ref> he was able to read with his left eye until 1961, but was completely blind from 1978.<ref name="ODNB"/> Nonetheless, he continued to write almost to the end. A documentary film about him, entitled ''Ibycus: A Poem by John Heath-Stubbs'', was made by the [[Chile]]an director Carlos Klein in 1997.

John Heath-Stubbs died in London on 26 December 2006, aged 88.<ref name="Guardian"/>

==Writing style==
As a Romantic poet, Heath-Stubbs's diction was strong, yet subtle. Running through his work was a nostalgia for "classicism". He was consciously literary and his work elaborately wrought rather than spontaneous, which meant his was not the kind of poetry likely to have mass appeal. However, his devotion to the craft of poetry makes his work impressive. As [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] put it, "Few writers of his time had a deeper knowledge of the English language, or cared for it more devotedly."<ref>[[Edward Lucie-Smith]] in ''[[British Poetry since 1945]]''.</ref>
