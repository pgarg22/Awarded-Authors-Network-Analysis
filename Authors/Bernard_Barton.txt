Barton was apprenticed at the age of 14 to a shopkeeper in [[Halstead]], [[Essex]], whose daughter, Lucy Jesup (1781–1808), he married in 1807. His wife died at the end of their first year of marriage, while giving birth to their daughter Lucy. After a year as a tutor in [[Liverpool]], Barton spent the rest of his life at [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], for the most part as a clerk in Messrs Alexander's Bank.

"See we not beyond the portal?" and "Those who live in love shall know".
