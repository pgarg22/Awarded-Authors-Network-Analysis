[[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]] said of ''A Green Light,'' "There are poems in A Green Light that can break your heart with their unexpected twists and turns. You think you know where you are and then you don't and it is inexplicably sad. You experience some kind of emotion that you can't even name, but it's deep and real. That's the power of Matthew Rohrer's new poems."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
