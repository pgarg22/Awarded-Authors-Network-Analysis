'''Paul O. Williams''' (January 17, 1935 – June 2, 2009) was an American [[science fiction]] writer and [[haiku]] poet. Williams was professor emeritus of English at [[Principia College]] in [[Elsah, Illinois]].

His most notable science fiction works are a series of novels, the Pelbar Cycle, set in [[North America]] about a thousand years after a "time of fire", in which the world was nearly totally depopulated. The novels track a gradual reconnection of the human cultures which developed. Much of the action takes place in the communities of the Pelbar, along the [[Upper Mississippi River]] — in the general vicinity of Elsah. Several cultures, including the matriarchal Pelbar, join together in the Heart River Federation.  Others, especially the tyrannical Tantal and slave-raiding Tusco, fall apart after suffering defeats.  The predominant characters are change agents: Tor, Jestak, Stel and his wife Ahroe Westrun.  All are Pelbar except for Tor who is Shumai.  Williams won the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer|John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in Science Fiction]] in 1983.<ref name="nyt830906"/>

He is also known as a writer of [[haiku]], [[senryū]], and [[Tanka in English|tanka]], and wrote a number of essays on the haiku form in English. In a 1975 essay, he coined the term "Tontoism" to refer to the practice of writing haiku with missing [[Article (grammar)|articles]] ("the", "a", or "an"), which he claimed made the haiku sound like the stunted English of the Indian sidekick, [[Tonto (Lone Ranger character)|Tonto]], in the ''[[Lone Ranger]]'' radio and television series. In 2001, his best essays were collected in ''The Nick of Time: Essays on Haiku Aesthetics'', edited by Lee Gurga and Michael Dylan Welch. Williams was the president of the [[Haiku Society of America]] (1999) and vice president of the Tanka Society of America (2000). In 1989 he won the Museum of Haiku Literature Award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa-haiku.org/museumhaikuliteratureawards/museumhaikuliterature-award.htm#1989|title=Museum of Haiku Literature Award}}</ref> from the Haiku Society of America with this poem written for [[Nick Virgilio]] shortly after Nick's death:
