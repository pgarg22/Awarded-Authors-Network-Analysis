'''Hannah Brand''' (1754–1821) was an English actress, poet and playwright. After her brief theatrical career, she became a governess.

==Life and career==

Hannah Brand was born in [[Norwich]], where she ran a "young Ladies Boarding School, No. 18, St. Giles's Broad-street" with her sister, Mary, until she turned to the stage.<ref name="Chandler">[http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1998/v/n12/005819ar.html Chandler]</ref>
At the Miss Brands' Academy for Young Ladies, day and boarding students were taught English Language, needlework, writing, arithmetic, drawing, music, dancing and French.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Miss Brands| newspaper=Bury and Norwich Post| date=18 October 1786|page=3}}</ref>
<ref>[http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1998/v/n12/005819ar.html Chandler]</ref> Her historical tragedy ''Huniades, or, The siege of Belgrave,'' was first produced in John Brunton's Theatre-Royal, Norwich in April 1791 and performed on at least three nights and was, according to the ''[[Norwich Mercury]]'', "well received" by "a genteel audience."<ref>{{cite news| title=Norwich| newspaper=Ipswich Journal| date=16 April 1791|page=2}}</ref> <ref name="Chandler"/> 

Brand was due to appear at the Haymarket on 14 January but did not on account of a sudden indisposition.<ref>{{cite news| title=Norwich|newspaper=Bury and Norwich Post| date=18 January 1792|page=3}}</ref> A subsequent performance by the Drury-Lane company at the Haymarket on 19 January 1792, however, in which she herself appeared (despite having to combat a cold)  as the heroine, was not successful. The play was performed again the next evening.<ref>{{cite news| title=Haymarket Theatre| newspaper=Norfolk Chronicle| date=21 January 1792|page=2}}</ref> She shortened the play, retitled it ''Agmunda'' after the character she herself played, and remounted it the following month; it enjoyed a small success. After this measured reception she left London to pursue a middling acting career in the provinces. It was reported {quote 'On 29 March 1792 in ''The Battle of Hexham'' the part of Queen Margaret was attempted by local playwright Hannah Brand at Norwich'.}<ref>{{cite news| title=Theatre-Royal, Norwich| newspaper=Bury and Norwich Post| date=28 March 1792|page=3}}</ref> 
On 28 May for her benefit night in Norwich, she was Euphrasia to Brunton's Evander in ''[[The Grecian Daughter]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Theatre-Royal, Norwich| newspaper=Bury and Norwich Post| date=16 May 1792|page=3}}</ref>
On 31 July she appeared as Alicia in ''Jane Shore'' in Norwich.<ref>{{cite news| title=Theatre-Royal, Norwich| newspaper=Bury and Norwich Post| date=25 July 1792|page=3}}</ref>
She performed in Agimunda in Yorkshire on 21 May 1794. <ref>{{cite news| title=Miss Brand| newspaper=Wakefield and West Riding Herald| date=15 August 1885|page=6}}</ref>

This volume of ''Plays, and Poems'' (Norwich: Beatniffe and Payne)  was not published until 1798, she included ''Huniades'' the  two other plays, adaptations of works by [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Philippe Néricault Destouches|Destouches]], respectively: ''The conflict, or, Love, honour, and pride a heroic comedy'' and ''Adelinda, a comedy''. Neither would seem to have been performed. She subsequently gave up the stage and became a governess to a family in Woodbridge, though after her arrival there was apparently "much unpleasantness between husband and wife."<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3250 Knight]</ref> 


ODE TO YOUTH. From Poems by Miss Hannah Brand.
Sweet Morn of Life ! all hail, ye hours ease!
When blooms the cheek with roseate, varying dyes;
When modest grace exerts each power to please,
And Streaming lustre radiates in the eyes.
Thy past hours innocent, thy present gay,
Thy future, halcyon Hope depicts without allay.
Day spring of life! oh, stay thy fleeting hours!
Thou fairy reign of ev'ry pleasant thought!
Fancy, to cheer thy path, strews all her flowers, 
And in her loom thy plan of years is wrought. 
By thee for goodness each heart caress'd. 
The world, untried, judg'd by that within thy breast. 
Sweet state of Youth ! O harmony of foul! 
Now chearful dawns the day, noon brightly beams, 
And evening comes serene, nor cares controul, 
And night approaches with soft infant dreams Circling, 
the morn beholds th' accustom'd round, 
Life's smiling charities awake and joys abound.
published in The Scots Magazine - Sunday 01 September 1799.
