'''Tim Firth''' (born 13 October 1964) is an English [[dramatist]], [[screenwriter]] and [[songwriter]].

==Life and career==
Firth was born in [[Frodsham]], [[England]]. He spent much of his time at school writing songs and it was only a few weeks before going to Cambridge to read English that he attended an [[Arvon Foundation]] course in West Yorkshire. This was run by [[Willy Russell]] and whilst on it, Firth had to write dialogue. He wrote about the only thing he knew - two sixteen-year-olds trying to write a song. Another course participant optioned it for his production company and Firth decided to become a writer. While at Cambridge he joined the [[Footlights]] where his contemporaries included [[David Baddiel]] who later invited him to contribute music to ''[[The Mary Whitehouse Experience]]'' on BBC radio. His first plays at this time were all directed by [[Sam Mendes]].

On leaving Cambridge, he wrote and composed music for the award winning [[Radio Four]] series ''[[And Now In Colour]]'' but was soon invited to meet [[Alan Ayckbourn]] in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and commissioned to write a play for the studio at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]]. His one-act play ''A Man Of Letters'' was a success and led to the commissioning of a full-length play from Ayckbourn, ''Neville's Island'', which later transferred to the West End, has been seen in translation all round the world and has been in almost continuous production since its premiere. It was revived in the West End in 2013 at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]].

Along with his father, Gordon Firth, he created the TV series ''[[Roger and the Rottentrolls|Roger and the Rotten Trolls]]'', running for four series' and winning a [[BAFTA]]. The spin off series ''[[Ripley and Scuff]]'' also won a BAFTA, and more recently the [[Radio Times]] voted the original series one of the 50 Greatest Children's TV Shows of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-01-13/the-50-greatest-childrens-tv-shows-of-all-time/|title=The 50 greatest children's TV Shows of all time}}</ref>

During two successive Christmas runs, the stage version of his TV film ''[[The Flint Street Nativity]]'' at the [[Liverpool Playhouse]] became the most successful Christmas production in the theatre's history.

His play ''[[Calendar Girls (play)|Calendar Girls]]'', adapted by Firth from [[Calendar Girls|his own film]], found favour with audiences across the UK during its 2008/09 tour, and in the process broke the all time British box office record for a play and also continued to sell out during its West End residency. In 2010, the hit comedy embarked on a UK country wide tour and has since been produced worldwide.

2013 marked the premiere of Firth's first solo musical, ''This Is My Family'' for which he wrote book, lyrics and music. Directed by [[Daniel Evans (actor)|Daniel Evans]], it premiered at the [[Crucible Theatre]] on 19 June 2013,<ref>Brennan, Claire.

''[[The Girls (musical)|The Girls]]'', directed by Tim Firth, and co-written with Gary Barlow opened at the [[Phoenix Theatre, London]] in 2017, winning a [[WhatsOnStage Awards|WhatsOnStage Award]] and being nominated for three [[Olivier Awards]]. As ''Calendar Girls: The Musical'', it embarked on a national tour in 2018. 

In September 2017, Firth’s new musical ''[[The Band (musical)|The Band]]'', featuring the music of [[Take That]], was premiered at the [[Manchester Opera House]], prior to a national tour. It had a West End season at the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] in 2018.

In 2004, Firth released a solo album, ''Harmless Flirting'', completing a tour of words and music with fellow playwright Willy Russell that won positive reviews at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].

For television, his TV credits include ''Money For Nothing'' (which won a Writer’s Guild Award), ''[[Roger and the Rottentrolls]]'' (winner of a [[BAFTA]] Award), ''[[Cruise of the Gods]]'', ''The Flint Street Nativity'', ''[[All Quiet on the Preston Front]]'' (winning a Writer’s Guild Award, British Comedy Award, [[Royal Television Society]] Award and BAFTA nomination). Tim also produced a season of single comedy plays entitled ''Trapped'', and wrote the Sky Arts single drama ''Timeless''.
