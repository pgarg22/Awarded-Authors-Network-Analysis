==Education and career==

Ackerman received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English from [[Pennsylvania State University]] and a [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]] and [[Ph.D.]] from [[Cornell University]]. Among the members of her [[dissertation]] committee was [[Carl Sagan]], an [[astronomer]] and the creator of the ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' television series.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview: Diane Ackerman |last=Richards |first=Linda L. |authorlink=Linda L. Richards |work=[[January Magazine]] |date=August 1999 |accessdate=2013-08-31 |url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/ackerman.html |quote=I didn't want to be a scientist. I just felt that the universe wasn't knowable from only one perspective. I wanted to be able to go exploring: follow my curiosity in both worlds. So I had a poet on my doctoral committee. And I had a scientist -- Carl Sagan. And I had someone in comparative literature. Essentially, they all ran interference for me so that I could -- ultimately -- write a dissertation that was about the metaphysical mind: science and art and be teaching and be in school while I was writing books.}}</ref> She has taught at a number of universities, including [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Diane|title=The Poetry Foundation|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/diane-ackerman|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quote  = <poem>The Great Affair
The great affair, the love affair with life,
is to live as variously as possible,
to groom one's curiosity like a high-spirited thoroughbred,
climb aboard, and gallop over the thick, sun-struck hills every day..
 
It began in mystery, and it will end in mystery,
but what a savage and beautiful country lies in between.
