In 1987, her play ''Breathless'' was a prize winner at the 1987 Second Wave Young Women's Writing Festival.

Her plays often feature historical figures. ''[[Playhouse Creatures]]'' and ''A Laughing Matter'' are set in the London theatrical milieu of the 17th and 18th centuries respectively.

As a librettist, De Angelis contributed to the opera ''The Silent Twins'' (2007), composed by [[Errollyn Wallen]], which is based on the case of [[June and Jennifer Gibbons]].<ref>April de Angelis [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/28/fiction.classicalmusicandopera "'Have I the strength to kill her?'"], ''The Guardian'', 28 June 2007</ref>
