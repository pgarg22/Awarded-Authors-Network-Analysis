'''John Gower''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|aʊ|.|ər}}; c. 1330 – October 1408) was an English poet, a contemporary of [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]], and a personal friend of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sobecki|first=Sebastian|date=2017|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/692620|journal=Speculum|language=en|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630–660|doi=10.1086/692620|issn=0038-7134|hdl=11370/ea54db6f-e701-4bc9-8dca-ad742056934f|hdl-access=free}}</ref>  He is remembered primarily for three major works, the ''[[Mirour de l'Omme]]'', ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', and ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', three long poems written in French, Latin, and English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes.<ref name=DNBG/>

In the prologue of the first [[recension]] of the ''Confessio Amantis'', he tells how the king, chancing to meet him on the Thames (probably circa 1385), invited him aboard the royal barge, and that their conversation then resulted in a commission for the work that would become the ''Confessio Amantis''.<ref>{{ cite web

At some point during the middle 1370s, he took up residence in rooms provided by the Priory of St Mary Overie (now [[Southwark Cathedral]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sobecki|first=Sebastian|date=2017|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/692620|journal=Speculum|language=en|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630–660|doi=10.1086/692620|issn=0038-7134|hdl=11370/ea54db6f-e701-4bc9-8dca-ad742056934f|hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp|59}}  In 1398, while living here, he married,<ref name=MacLatin />{{rp|xvii}}<ref>''Register of William of Wykman'' ii. f.299b.  not verified</ref> probably for the second time: his wife, Agnes Groundolf, who survived him.

After his death in 1408, Gower was interred in an ostentatious tomb in the Priory church (now [[Southwark Cathedral]]), where it remains today.

Macaulay provides much information and speculation about Gower. Some of his conclusions are inferences drawn from the trilingual writings of Gower. Where possible he draws upon legal records and other biographers.<ref name=MacLatin />

==Works==

Gower's verse is by turns religious, political, historical, and moral—though he has been narrowly defined as "moral Gower" ever since Chaucer graced him with the epithet.<ref name=Troilus>{{ cite book

}}</ref>{{rp|line 1856}}  His primary mode is [[allegory]], although he shies away from sustained abstractions in favour of the plain style of the raconteur.

His earliest works were probably [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]s in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]], some of which may have later been included in his work the ''Cinkante Ballades''. The first work which has survived is in the same language, however: it is the ''Speculum Meditantis'', also known by the French title ''Mirour de l'Omme'', a poem of just under 30,000 lines, containing a dense exposition of religion and morality. According to Yeager "Gower's first intent to write a poem for the instructional betterment of king and court, at a moment when he had reason to believe advice about social reform might influence changes predictably to take place in an expanded jurisdiction, when the French and English peoples were consolidated under a single crown."<ref>{{ cite journal

Gower's second major work, the ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', was written in Latin. 
The first book has an allegorical account of the [[Peasants' Revolt]]  which begins as an allegory, becomes quite specific and ends with an allusion to [[William Walworth]]’s suppression of the rebels.<ref name=MacLatin/>{{rp|xxxiv-xl}}   Gower takes the side of the aristocracy but the actions of Richard II are described by "the captain in vain endeavoured to direct the ship’s course".<ref name=MacLatin/>{{rp|xxxix}}Subsequent books decry the sins of various classes of the social order: priests, friars, knights, peasants, merchants, lawyers. The last two books give advice to King Richard II and express the poet's love for England.<ref name=MacLatin />{{rp|xxx-lvii}} As Gower admits,<ref>Vox Clamatis Prologos Libri Secunti</ref> much of ''Vox Clamantis'' was borrowed from other authors.

His third work is the ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', a 30,000-line poem in octosyllabic [[Middle English|English]] couplets, which makes use of the structure of a Christian [[Confession (religion)|confession]] (presented allegorically as a confession of sins against Love) as a [[frame story|narrative frame]] within which a multitude of individual tales are told.{{rp|I.203–288}}  Like his previous works, the theme is very much morality, even where the stories themselves have a tendency to describe rather immoral behaviour.  One scholar asserts that ''Confessio Amantis'' "almost exclusively" made Gower's "poetic reputation."<ref>Grey, Douglas. "John Gower." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford UP, 2004.</ref>

Fisher views the three major works as "one continuous work" with ''In Praise of Peace'' as a capstone. There is "movement from the courtly tone of the ''Cinkante Balades'' to the moral and philosophical tone of the ''Traitie''." Leland <ref name=Leland>{{ cite book
 | title=Commentarii de Scriptoribus Brittannicis
 | author=John Leland  | year=1540 |language=la
}}</ref> (ca 1540) <ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp| Fisher translation 136}} states "that the three works were intended to present a systematic discourse upon the nature of man and society." <blockquote>They provide as organized and unified a view as we have of the social ideals on England upon the eve of the Renaissance. This view may be subsumed under the three broad headings: individual VIRTUE, legal JUSTICE, and the administrative responsibility of the KING. The works progress from the description of the origins of sin and the nature of the vices and virtues at the beginning of the ''Mirour de l'omme'', through consideration of social law and order in the discussion of the three estates in the ''Mirour'' and ''Vox Clamatis'', to a final synthesis of royal responsibiity of [[Empedoclean]] love in the ''Confessio Amantis''.<ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp| 136}}</blockquote>

In later years Gower published a number of minor works in all three languages: 
* the ''Cinkante Ballades'', a series of French ballades on romantic subjects. Yeager (2011) argues that these sonnets were composed throughout Gower's lifetime.<ref>{{Cite book

==Prediction of the Peasants' Revolt==
When Wickert was attempting to date ''Vox Clamantis'' Books Two to Seven, she found two passages which predict the revolt. One is ''Mirour''{{rp|at=lines 26485-26496}} which uses the metaphor of the stinging nettle to predict the impending catastrophe. The second is the final couplet of ''Vox Clamantis'' Book Five Chapter 10.{{rp|at=line V.563-564}} This predicts trouble in a short time.<ref name=Wickert/>{{rp|18–19}} Gower's warnings and call for reform were ignored both before and after the events of 1381.<ref name=Wickert/>{{rp|51–52}}

==Chaucer influence==
Chaucer used octosyllabic lines in ''[[The House of Fame]]'' but eschewed [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic]] rhythm. He "left it to Gower to invent the iambic [[tetrameter]], and to later centuries of poets to solve the problems of its potential monotony; he himself merely polished the traditional Middle English short line."<ref name=Duffel>{{ cite book

Fisher <ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp|207}} concludes that they were living near each other in the period 1376 to 1386. They influenced each other in several ways:
# They imported Italian models and learned "to count beats in such a way as to produce a regular number of syllables."<ref name=Duffel/>{{rp| 92}} This led via ''Mirour'' to the iambic tetrameter of ''Confessio'' and Chaucer's pentameter.
# After 1376 both poets turned from love poetry to more serious topics. For Gower this was the "moralistic social complaint in the ''Mirour d l'omme'' and ''Vox Clamatis'', while Chaucer wrestled more painfully in the ''[[House of Fame]]'' and ''[[Parliament of Fowls]]'' with the relation between the style and substance of courtly poetry and social satire."<ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp|208}}
# Gower "took the risk of composing in English only after Chaucer had achieved success and fame with ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''."<ref name=Duffel/>{{rp| 92}}
#  The most of the individuals in the [[General Prologue]] are members of classes  criticized in ''Mirour'' and ''Vox Clamantis''. Chaucer has omitted the higher ranks of the secular and clerical hierarchies.  The language and the introduction of satire are the invention of Chaucer.<ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp| 251ff}}
# Gower is criticized in the Introduction to [[The Man of Law's Tale]]. Some commentators have interpreted these remarks to indicate a breach between the two poets. Fisher interprets them and along with the details of the Tale as a friendly competition between two poets.<ref name=FisherMP/>{{rp|292}}
