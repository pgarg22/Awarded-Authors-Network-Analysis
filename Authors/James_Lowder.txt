==Career==
===Novels and short fiction===
His earliest novels were part of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' and ''[[Ravenloft]]'' [[shared universe]] book lines, but beginning in the late 1990s he turned his attention more often to creator-owned projects.<ref>{{cite web | title=James Lowder interview | last=McElroy | first=Matt | publisher=Flames Rising | date=2006-10-02 | url=http://www.flamesrising.com/james-lowder-interview-author-editor/ | access-date=2010-04-13}}</ref>  His novels include ''[[Prince of Lies (novel)|Prince of Lies]]'', ''The Ring of Winter'', and ''[[Spectre of the Black Rose]]'' (the latter with Voronica Whitney-Robinson), and his short fiction has appeared in such anthologies such as ''[[Shadows Over Baker Street]]'', ''Truth Until Paradox'', and ''Historical Hauntings''.<ref name="wizardsbio">{{cite web|url=http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=JamesLowder|title=James Lowder|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224011350/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/Bios/default.aspx?doc=JamesLowder|archive-date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> Some of his short stories have been cited in the honorable mention list of the annual ''[[Year's Best Fantasy and Horror]]''. He was an [[Origins Award]] finalist in the ''Best Short Fiction'' category for his 2003 novella, "The Night Chicago Died", a story that featured the debut of his mystery man character, The Corpse. His novels have been translated into more than a dozen languages.

===Prose editing===
As an editor, Lowder directed several best-selling book lines for [[TSR, Inc.]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Ravenloft]], and [[Dark Sun]].<ref name="chaosiumbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.chaosium.com/james-lowder/|title=James Lowder| access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> In 1999, Peter Corless brought Lowder in to oversee the ''[[Pendragon (fiction series)|Pendragon]]'' fiction line for [[Green Knight Publishing]]; Lowder continued to reprint older Athurian works and also produced the original short story collections ''The Doom of Camelot'' (2000) and ''Legends of the Pendragon'' (2002) and the original novel ''Exiled from Camelot'' (2001).<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|357}} He served as executive editor for Green Knight Publishing's line of [[Arthurian]] fiction<ref>{{cite web | title=A Brief History of Game #5: Green Knight Publishing | last=Appelcline | first=Shannon | publisher=RPGnet | date=2006-10-03 | url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory5.phtml | access-date=2010-04-18}}</ref> — the [[Pendragon (fiction series)|''Pendragon'' fiction series]] — and as a consulting editor for CDS Books on their ''[[City of Heroes]]'' novels. Lowder has edited more than a dozen anthologies, with subjects ranging from [[King Arthur]] to [[superhero]]es to [[zombies]]. He has won several Origins Awards and an [[ENnies|ENnie Award]], and been shortlisted for an [[International Horror Guild Award]] for these projects. Though some of these anthologies have been published in connection with [[role-playing game]] product lines, they often contain only creator-copyrighted stories. This makes them unusual, as game publishers frequently insist on [[work for hire]] contracts for such projects.<ref>{{cite web | title=Writing for Role-Playing Games | last= Tupper | first=Peter | publisher=writersweekly.com | date=2004-02-04 | url=http://www.writersweekly.com/this_weeks_article/001197_02042004.html | access-date=2007-06-20}}</ref>

Knowing his craft inside and out, he brings his advocacy and integrity to the table at every turn. Having him relaunch our fiction line is a ‘the stars are right’ moment.” Lowder had previously served as a consultant for Chaosium, helping the company and freelancers resolve payment and contract problems with past fiction projects.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chaosium appoints James Lowder as new Executive Editor of Fiction | last=O'Brien | first=Michael | publisher=Chaosium | date=2017-05-05 | url=http://www.chaosium.com/blog/chaosium-appoints-james-lowder-as-new-executive-editor-of-fiction/ | access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>
