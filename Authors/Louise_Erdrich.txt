== Personal life ==
Erdrich was born on June 7, 1954, in [[Little Falls, Minnesota]]. She was the oldest of seven children born to Ralph Erdrich, a German-American, and Rita (née Gourneau), a Chippewa woman (of half Ojibwe and half French blood). Both parents taught at a boarding school in [[Wahpeton, North Dakota]], set up by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. Erdrich's maternal grandfather, Patrick Gourneau, served as tribal chairman for the federally recognized tribe of [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians]] for many years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/louise-erdrich/10/ |title=Louise Erdrich|work=[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]|publisher= PBS|author=Gates, Jr., Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis]] (Host)|year=2010}}</ref> Though not raised in a reservation, she often visited relatives there.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Conversations with Louise Edrich and Michael Dorris|last=Chavkin|first=Allan and Nancy Feyl|publisher=University of Mississippi|year=1994|isbn=0-87805-652-1|location=Jackson, Mississippi|pages=155}}</ref> She was raised "with all the accepted truths" of Catholicism.<ref name=":0" />

While Erdrich was a child, her father paid her a nickel for every story she wrote. Her sister Heidi became a poet and also lives in Minnesota; she publishes under the name [[Heid E. Erdrich]].<ref>{{cite web|website=HeidErdrich.com|url=http://heiderdrich.com/ |title=Heid E. Erdrich}}</ref> Another sister, Lise Erdrich, has written children's books and collections of fiction and essays.

Erdrich attended [[Dartmouth College]] from 1972 to 1976.<ref name="Louise Erdrich 2010">{{cite web|publisher=Poetry Foundation|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/louise-erdrich|title=Louise Erdrich|date=August 24, 2021}}</ref> She was a part of the first class of women admitted to the college and earned an A.B. in English. During her first year, Erdrich met [[Michael Dorris]], an [[anthropologist]], writer, and then-director of the new Native American Studies program. While attending Dorris' class, she began to look into her own ancestry, which inspired her to draw from it for her literary work, such as poems, short stories, and novels.  During that time, she worked as a lifeguard, waitress, researcher for films,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Conversations with Louise Erdrich and Michael Dorris|last=Chavkin|first=Allan and Nancy Fyel|publisher=University of Mississippi|year=1994|isbn=0-878056521|location=Jackson, Mississippi|pages=94}}</ref> and as an editor for the Boston Indian Council newspaper ''The Circle.''<ref name=":0" />

In 1978, Erdrich enrolled in a Master of Arts program at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. She earned the Master of Arts in the Writing Seminars in 1979.<ref name="Louise Erdrich 2010"/> Erdrich later published some of the poems and stories she wrote while in the M.A. program. She returned to Dartmouth as a writer-in-residence.<ref name="Louise Erdrich 2010"/>

After graduating from Dartmouth, Erdrich remained in contact with Michael Dorris. He attended one of her poetry readings, became impressed with her work, and developed an interest in working with her.<ref name=":0" /> Although Erdrich and Dorris were on two different sides of the world, Erdrich in Boston and Dorris in New Zealand for field research, the two began to collaborate on short stories.

The pair's literary partnership led them to a romantic relationship. They married in 1981, and raised three children whom Dorris had adopted as a single parent<ref name=":0" /> and three biological children together (Persia, Pallas, Madeline, Reynold Abel, Sava<ref name=":0" /> and Aza Marion<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Erdrich, Louise {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/culture-magazines/erdrich-louise|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>). Reynold Abel suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and in 1991, at age 23, he was killed when he was hit by a car.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Master Butchers Singing Club (Erdrich) - LitLovers|url=https://www.litlovers.com/reading-guides/630-master-butchers-singing-club-erdrich?showall=1|website=www.litlovers.com|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> In 1995 their son Jeffrey Sava accused Dorris of committing child abuse;<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Broken Life|url=https://www.salon.com/1997/04/21/dorris/|last=Rawson|first=Josie|date=April 21, 1997|website=Salon|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in 1997, after Dorris's death, their adopted daughter Madeline claimed that Dorris sexually abused her and Erdrich had neglected to stop the abuse.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Adopted daughter sues Michael Dorris estate, alleging sex abuse|url=https://apnews.com/1bdfc288e6b418c256058c46a9702ab4|website=AP NEWS|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>

Dorris and Erdrich separated in 1995, and Dorris died by suicide in 1997. In his will, he only named his biological children with Erdrich.<ref name=":3" />

In 2001, at age 47, Erdrich gave birth to a daughter, Azure, fathered by a Native American man Erdrich declines to identify publicly.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Woman With a Habit|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,104598,00.html|last1=Gray|first1=Paul|date=April 1, 2001|journal=Time|access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref> She discusses her pregnancy with Azure, and Azure's father, in her 2003 non-fiction book, ''Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country''.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title='Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country' by Louise Erdrich|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/books/reviews/20030713erdrich0713fnp5.asp|website=old.post-gazette.com|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She uses the name "Tobasonakwut" to refer to him.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|last=Erdrich|first=Louise|title=Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2014|isbn=978-0-06-230996-9|location=|pages=52, 57}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knoeller|first=Christian|date=2012|title=Landscape and Language in Erdrich's "Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country"|journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment|volume=19|issue=4|pages=645–660|doi=10.1093/isle/iss111|issn=1076-0962|jstor=44087160}}</ref> He is described as a traditional healer and teacher, who is eighteen years Erdrich's senior and a married man.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":4" /> In a number of publications, Tobasonakwut Kinew, who died in 2012, is referred to as Erdrich's partner and the father of Azure.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Raibaud|first1=Martine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_qmBgAAQBAJ&q=louise+erdrich+tobasonakwut&pg=PA56|title=Cultures in Movement|last2=Symington|first2=Micéala|last3=Untea|first3=Ionut|date=February 5, 2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-7502-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Learning|first=Gale, Cengage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SucjDAAAQBAJ&q=tobasonakwut+kinew+louise+erdrich+daughter&pg=PT5|title=A study guide for Louise Erdrich's "The Bingo Palace"|date=March 13, 2015|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4103-2049-0|language=en}}</ref>

When asked in an interview if writing is a lonely life for her, Erdrich replied, "Strangely, I think it is. I am surrounded by an abundance of family and friends and yet I am alone with the writing. And that is perfect." Erdrich lives in [[Minneapolis]].<ref name="Interview">{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6055/the-art-of-fiction-no-208-louise-erdrich|title=Louise Erdrich, The Art of Fiction |number= 208|journal=[[The Paris Review]]|author=Halliday, Lisa|date=Winter 2010|volume=Winter 2010 }}</ref>

==Work==
In 1975, Erdrich won the American Academy of Poets Prize.<ref name=":2" />

In 1979 she wrote "The World's Greatest Fisherman", a short story about June Kashpaw, a divorced Ojibwe woman whose death by [[hypothermia]] brought her relatives home to a fictional North Dakota reservation for her funeral. She wrote this while "barricaded in the kitchen."<ref name=":0" /> At her husband's urging, she submitted it to the Nelson Algren Short Fiction prize in 1982, which it won,<ref name=":0" /> and eventually it became the first chapter of her debut novel, ''[[Love Medicine]]'', published by [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] in 1984.<ref name="Interview" />

"When I found out about the prize I was living on a farm in New Hampshire near the college I'd attended," Erdrich told an interviewer. "I was nearly broke and driving a car with bald tires. My mother knitted my sweaters, and all else I bought at thrift stores ... The recognition dazzled me. Later, I became friends with [[Studs Terkel]] and Kay Boyle, the judges, toward whom I carry a lifelong gratitude. This prize made an immense difference in my life."<ref>{{Cite web|title=A look back at winners of the Nelson Algren Short Story Award|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-books-past-algren-winners-0728-20190721-hspatf3w4ze73nmku6piiueruu-story.html|last=Crowder|first=Courtney|date=July 21, 2019|website=Chicago Tribune|url-status=live|access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref>

''Love Medicine'' won the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award.<ref name="Author: Louise Erdrich">{{cite web|title=Louise Erdrich: About the Author: HarperCollins Publishers|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/about.aspx?authorid=2905|date=March 24, 2010|publisher=Harpercollins.com|access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref> It has also been featured on the National Advanced Placement Test for Literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP Literature: Titles from Free Response Questions since 1971|url=http://mseffie.com/AP/APtitles.html|date=May 13, 2013|publisher=Mseffie.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130032924/http://mseffie.com/AP/APtitles.html|archive-date=November 30, 2014|access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>

In the early years of their marriage, Erdrich and Michael Dorris often collaborated on their work, saying they plotted the books together, "talk about them before any writing is done, and then we share almost every day, whatever it is we've written" but "the person whose name is on the books is the one who's done most of the primary writing.<ref name=":1" />" They got started with "domestic, romantic stuff" published under the shared pen name of "Milou North" (Michael + Louise + where they live).<ref name=":0" />

In 1982, Erdrich's story, "The World's Greatest Fisherman,"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Erdrich|first=Louise|date=|title="The World's Greatest Fisherman"|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Worlds-Greatest-Fisherman|url-status=live|access-date=October 4, 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> won $5,000 in the Nelson Algren fiction competition.<ref name="Louise Erdrich 2010" /> She expanded the story into the novel ''Love Medicine'' (1984), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. It is the only debut novel ever to receive that honor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Streitfeld|first=David|date=July 13, 1997|title="Sad Story"|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/07/13/sad-story/b1344c1d-3f2a-455f-8537-cb4637888ffc/|journal=Washington Post|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Erdrich later turned ''Love Medicine'' into a tetralogy that includes ''The Beet Queen'' (1986), ''Tracks'' (1988), and ''The Bingo Palace'' (1994).

During the publication of ''Love Medicine'', Erdrich produced her first collection of poems, ''Jacklight'' (1984), which highlights the struggles between Native and non-Native cultures, as well as celebrating family, ties of kinship, autobiographical meditations, monologues, and love poetry. She incorporates elements of Ojibwe myths and legends.<ref name="Louise Erdrich 2010"/> Erdrich continues to write poems, which have been included in her collections.

Erdrich is best known as a novelist, and has published a dozen award-winning and best-selling novels.<ref name="Louise Erdrich 2010" /> She followed ''Love Medicine'' with ''The Beet Queen'' (1986), which continued her technique of using [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/books/books-of-the-times-293786.html|title=Books of the Times|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=August 20, 1986|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 6, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and expanded the fictional reservation universe of ''Love Medicine'' to include the nearby town of Argus, North Dakota.The action of the novel takes place mostly before [[World War II]]. [[Leslie Marmon Silko]] accused Erdrich's ''The Beet Queen'' of being more concerned with [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] technique than with the political struggles of Native peoples.<ref>[[Susan Castillo (academic)|Susan Castillo]] "Postmodernism, Native American Literature, and the Real: The Silko-Erdrich Controversy" in ''Notes from the Periphery: Marginality in North American Literature and Culture'' New York: Peter Lang, 1995. 179–190.</ref>

''[[Tracks (novel)|Tracks]]'' (1988) goes back to the early 20th century at the formation of the reservation. It introduces the [[trickster]] figure of Nanapush, who owes a clear debt to Ojibwe figure [[Nanabozho]].<ref>There are many studies of the trickster figure in Erdrich's novels. A recent study that makes the connection between Nanabozho and Nanpush is "The Trickster and World Maintenance: An Anishinaabe Reading of Louise Erdrich's Tracks" by Lawrence W. Gross [http://onCampus.richmond.edu/faculty/ASAIL/SAIL2/173.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423103851/http://oncampus.richmond.edu/faculty/ASAIL/SAIL2/173.html |date=April 23, 2008 }}</ref> ''Tracks'' shows early clashes between traditional ways and the Roman Catholic Church. ''[[The Bingo Palace (Novel)|The Bingo Palace]]'' (1994), set in the 1980s, describes the effects of a casino and a factory on the reservation community. ''Tales of Burning Love'' (1997) finishes the story of Sister Leopolda, a recurring character from all the previous books, and introduces a new set of European-American people into the reservation universe.
	 
''The Antelope Wife'' (1998), Erdrich's first novel after her divorce from Dorris, was the first of her novels to be set outside the continuity of the previous books.<ref>Lorena Laura Stookey, ''Louise Erdrich: A Critical Companion'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 {{ISBN|0-313-30612-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30612-9}}</ref>

She subsequently returned to the reservation and nearby towns. She has published five novels since 1998 dealing with events in that fictional area. Among these are ''[[Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse|The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Master Butchers Singing Club]]'' (2003). Both novels have geographic and character connections with ''The Beet Queen''.  In 2009, Erdrich was a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]] finalist for ''[[The Plague of Doves (novel)|The Plague of Doves]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/louise-erdrich|title=Finalist: ''The Plague of Doves'', by Louise Erdrich (HarperCollins)|website=www.pulitzer.org|language=en|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> and a National Book Award finalist for ''[[The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/books/the-last-report-on-the-miracle-at-little-no-horse/|title=The Last Report on the Miracle at Little No Horse|website=National Book Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> It focuses on the historical lynching of four Native people wrongly accused of murdering a Caucasian family, and the effect of this injustice on the current generations.

She also writes for younger audiences; she has a children's picture book ''[[Grandmother's Pigeon]],'' and her children's book ''[[The Birchbark House]]'', was a National Book Award finalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/books/the-birchbark-house/|title=The Birchbark House|website=National Book Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>  She continued the series with ''[[The Game of Silence]]'', winner of the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scottodell.com/the-scott-odell-award|title=Scott O'Dell|last=O'Dell|first=Scott|website=www.scottodell.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> and ''The Porcupine Year''.

===Nonfiction and teaching===
In addition to fiction and poetry, Erdrich has published nonfiction. ''The Blue Jay's Dance'' (1995) is about her pregnancy and the birth of her first child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/10/the-blue-jays-dance/|title=The Blue Jay's Dance|last=Menkedick|first=Sarah|date=May 10, 2017|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> ''Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country'' traces her travels in northern Minnesota and Ontario's lakes following the birth of her last daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/about.htm|title=About Louise Erdrich|author= Department of English|publisher= University of Illinois|date=2001|access-date=May 22, 2016}}</ref>

===Influence and style===
Her heritage from both parents is influential in her life and prominent in her work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/louise-erdrich|title=Louise Erdrich|date=May 12, 2018|publisher=Poetry Foundation|access-date=May 13, 2018}}</ref> Although many of Erdrich's works explore her Native American heritage, her novel ''The Master Butchers Singing Club'' (2003) featured the European, specifically German, side of her ancestry. The novel includes stories of a [[World War I]] veteran of the German Army and is set in a small North Dakota town.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/09/books/her-own-private-north-dakota.html|title=Her Own Private North Dakota|last=Allen|first=Brooke|date=February 9, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 6, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award. 
	 	
Erdrich's interwoven series of novels have drawn comparisons with [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha]] novels.  Like Faulkner's, Erdrich's successive novels created multiple narratives in the same fictional area and combined the tapestry of local history with current themes and modern consciousness.<ref>See, e.g., Powell's Books (book review), ''The Christian Science Monitor'', August 2, 2004</ref>

==Birchbark Books==
Her bookstore hosts literary readings and other events. Erdrich's new works are read here, and events celebrate the works and careers of other writers as well, particularly local Native writers. Erdrich and her staff consider Birchbark Books to be a "teaching bookstore".<ref name="birchbarkbooks1">{{cite web|url=http://birchbarkbooks.com/OurStory |title=Our Story &#124; Birchbark Books & Native Arts &#124; Minneapolis, MN |publisher=Birchbarkbooks.com |access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref> In addition to books, the store sells Native art and traditional medicines, and Native American jewelry.
