{{nihongo|'''Seichō Matsumoto'''|松本 清張|Matsumoto Seichō|extra=December 21, 1909&nbsp;– August 4, 1992}} (born Kiyoharu Matsumoto) was a Japanese writer, credited with popularizing [[detective fiction]] in Japan.

Matsumoto's works broke new ground by incorporating elements of human psychology and ordinary life. His works often reflect a wider social context and postwar [[nihilism]] that expanded the scope and further darkened the atmosphere of the genre. His exposé of corruption among police officials and criminals was a new addition to the field. The subject of investigation was not just the crime but also the society affected.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Although Matsumoto was a self-educated prolific author, his first book was not printed until he was in his forties. In the following 40 years, he published more than 450 works. Matsumoto's work included historical novels and non-fiction, but it was his mystery and detective fiction that solidified his reputation as a writer internationally. 

Credited with popularizing the genre among readers in his country, Matsumoto became Japan's best-selling and highest earning author in the 1960s. His most acclaimed detective novels, including ''[[Ten to sen]]'' (1958; Points and Lines, 1970); ''Suna no utsuwa'' (1961; Inspector Imanishi Investigates, 1989) and ''Kiri no hata'' (1961; Pro Bono, 2012), have been translated into a number of languages, including English. He received the [[Akutagawa Prize]] in 1952, the [[Kikuchi Kan Prize]] in 1970, and the [[Mystery Writers of Japan Award]] in 1957. He served as president of the [[Mystery Writers of Japan]] from 1963 to 1971.

Matsumoto also collaborated with film director [[Yoshitarō Nomura]] on adaptations of eight of his novels to film, including ''[[Castle of Sand]]''.

==Early life==
[[File:140721 Matsumoto Seicho Memorial Museum Kitakyushu Japan01bs3.jpg|thumb|[[Matsumoto Seicho Memorial Museum]] ([[Kokura]])]]

Matsumoto was born in the city of [[Kokura]], now [[Kokura Kita-ku, Kitakyushu|Kokura Kita ward]], [[Kitakyushu, Fukuoka]] prefecture, [[Kyushu]], in 1909. His real name was Kiyoharu Matsumoto before he adopted the pen name Seichō Matsumoto; "Seichō" is the [[On'yomi|Sino-Japanese reading]] of the [[kanji|characters]] of his given name. He was an only child. After graduating from elementary school, Seichō was hired at a utility company. As an adult he designed layouts for the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' in Kyushu. His work in the advertising department was interrupted by serving in [[World War II]] as a medical corpsman. He spent much of the war in [[Korea]] before resuming work at the Asahi Shimbun after the war. He transferred to the Tokyo office in 1950.

Although Matsumoto attended neither secondary school nor university, he was well-educated. As a rebellious teenager, he read banned [[revolutionary]] texts as part of a political protest, which enraged Seichō's father, causing him to destroy his son's collection of literature. Matsumoto sought award-winning works of fiction and studied them. His official foray into literature occurred in 1950 when the magazine Shukan Asahi hosted a fiction contest. He submitted his short story "Saigō satsu" (Saigō's Currency) and placed third in the competition. Within six years he had retired from his post at the newspaper to pursue a full-time career as a writer.

==Writing career==

Matsumoto wrote short fiction while simultaneously producing multiple novels, at one point as many as five concurrently, in the form of magazine serials. Many of his crime stories debuted in periodicals, among them "Harikomi" (The Chase), in which a woman reunites with her fugitive lover while police close in on them.

For his literary accomplishments, Matsumoto received the Mystery Writers of Japan Prize, Kikuchi Kan Prize, and the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for Literature. In 1952 he was awarded the [[Akutagawa Prize]] for "Aru 'Kokura-nikki' den" (The Legend of the Kokura-Diary).

As a lifelong activist, Matsumoto voiced both anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiments in some of his writings. For example at the height of the [[Anpo protests|1960 Anpo protests]], Matsumoto tapped into the anti-American mood with his notorious work of "non-fiction" ''Black Fog over Japan'' (日本の黒い霧, Nihon no kuroi kiri), in which an enterprising detective uncovers a vast conspiracy by American secret agents that ties together many famous incidents and unsolved crimes of the postwar period.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kapur|first=Nick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re5hDwAAQBAJ|title=Japan at the Crossroads: Conflict and Compromise after Anpo|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|ISBN=978-0674984424|pages=210}}</ref> Likewse, many of Matsumoto's works of fiction and nonfiction revealed various aspects of home-grown corruption in the Japanese system. In 1968 he traveled to communist [[Cuba]] as a delegate of the World Cultural Congress and ventured to [[North Vietnam]] to meet with its president later that same year.

Matsumoto was also interested in archeology and [[Ancient history]]. He made his ideas public in his fiction and in many essays. His interest extended to Northeast Asia, the [[Western Regions]], and the [[Celts]].

==International recognition==

In 1977, Matsumoto met [[Ellery Queen]] when they visited Japan. In 1987, he was invited by French mystery writers to talk about his sense of mystery at [[Grenoble]]. 

Matsumoto died from cancer at the age of 82.
