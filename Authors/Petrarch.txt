'''Francesco Petrarca''' ({{IPA-it|franˈtʃesko peˈtrarka|lang}}; 20 July 1304 – 18/19 July 1374), commonly [[anglicized]] as '''Petrarch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|r|ɑr|k|,_|ˈ|p|ɛ|t|-}}), was a scholar and poet of early [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]], and one of the earliest [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-petrarca_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Petrarca, Francesco|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana |first1=Francisco|last1=Rico|first2=Luca|last2=Marcozzi|volume=82|year=2015|language=it}}</ref>

Petrarch's rediscovery of [[Cicero]]'s letters is often credited with initiating the 14th-century Italian [[Renaissance]] and the founding of [[Renaissance humanism]].<ref>This designation appears, for instance, in a recent [http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=15299 review] of Carol Quillen's ''Rereading the Renaissance.''</ref> In the 16th century, [[Pietro Bembo]] created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Dante Alighieri]].<ref>In the [http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Prose_della_volgar_lingua/Libro_primo/XIX Prose della volgar lingua], Bembo proposes Petrarch and Boccaccio as models of Italian style, while expressing reservations about emulating Dante's usage.</ref> Petrarch would be later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the [[Accademia della Crusca]].

Petrarch's sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for [[lyrical poetry]]. He is also known for being the first to develop the concept of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]],"<ref name="DarkAges">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707236 Renaissance or Prenaissance], ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1.

==Biography==

===Youth and early career===
Petrarch was born in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] city of [[Arezzo]] on 20 July 1304. He was the son of [[Ser Petracco]] and his wife Eletta Canigiani. His given name was ''Francesco Petracco,'' which was [[Latinized name|Latinized]] to ''Petrarca.'' Petrarch's younger brother was born in [[Incisa in Val d'Arno]] in 1307. [[Dante Alighieri]] was a friend of his father.<ref name="Bishop">[[J.H. Plumb]], ''The Italian Renaissance'', 1961; Chapter XI by Morris Bishop "Petrarch", pp. 161–175; New York, [[American Heritage Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-618-12738-0}}</ref>

Petrarch spent his early childhood in the village of [[Incisa in Val d'Arno|Incisa]], near [[Florence]]. He spent much of his early life at [[Avignon]] and nearby [[Carpentras]], where his family moved to follow [[Pope Clement V]], who moved there in 1309 to begin the [[Avignon Papacy]]. Petrarch studied law at the [[University of Montpellier]] (1316–20) and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] (1320–23) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate called Guido Sette. Because his father was in the legal profession (a [[Civil law notary|notary]]), he insisted that Petrarch and his brother also study law. Petrarch, however, was primarily interested in writing and [[Latin literature]] and considered these seven years wasted. Additionally, he proclaimed that through legal manipulation his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system. He protested, "I couldn't face making a merchandise of my mind," as he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice.<ref name="Bishop" />

Petrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted [[Boccaccio]] among his notable friends to whom he wrote often. After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to Avignon in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices. This work gave him much time to devote to his writing. With his first large-scale work, ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in [[Latin]] about the great [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Scipio Africanus]], Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity. On 8 April 1341, he became the second<ref>after "Albertino Mussato" who was the first to be so crowned according to Robert Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford, 1973)</ref> [[poet laureate]] since [[classical antiquity]] and was crowned by Roman ''Senatori'' [[Giordano Orsini (Senatore 1341)|Giordano Orsini]] and Orso dell'Anguillara on the holy grounds of [[Rome's Capitol]].<ref>Plumb, p. 164</ref><ref name=pie32>Pietrangeli (1981), p. 32</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirkham|first1=Victoria|title=Petrarch: A Critical Guide to the Complete Works|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGDdF667hosC&q=giordano+orsini+1341&pg=PA9|isbn=978-0226437439}}</ref>

He traveled widely in Europe, served as an ambassador, and (because he traveled for pleasure,<ref>[[Morris Bishop|Bishop, Morris]] ''Petrarch and his World'', p. 92, Indiana University Press 1963, {{ISBN|0-8046-1730-9}}</ref> as with his [[ascent of Mont Ventoux]]) has been called "the first [[Tourist#History|tourist]]".<ref>NSA Family Encyclopedia, ''Petrarch, Francesco'', Vol. 11, p. 240, Standard Education Corp. 1992</ref>
During his travels, he collected crumbling Latin [[manuscripts]] and was a prime mover in the recovery of knowledge from writers of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. He encouraged and advised [[Leontius Pilatus]]'s translation of [[Homer]] from a manuscript purchased by Boccaccio, although he was severely critical of the result. Petrarch had acquired a copy, which he did not entrust to Leontius,<ref>Vittore Branca, ''Boccaccio; The Man and His Works'', tr. Richard Monges, pp. 113–118</ref> but he knew no [[Greek language|Greek]]; Petrarch said, "Homer was dumb to him, while he was deaf to Homer".<ref>[http://www.tuttotempolibero.altervista.org//poesia/trecento/francescopetrarca/epistolefamiliares.html ''Ep. Fam.'' 18.2 §9]</ref> In 1345 he personally discovered a collection of [[Cicero]]'s letters not previously known to have existed, the collection ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum]]'', in the [[Chapter Library of Verona|Chapter Library]] (''Biblioteca Capitolare'') of [[Verona Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecacapitolare.it/en/history/|title=History – Biblioteca Capitolare Verona}}</ref>

Disdaining what he believed to be the ignorance of [[Middle Ages|the era]] in which he lived, Petrarch is credited with creating the concept of a historical "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]".<ref name="DarkAges"/>

===Mount Ventoux===
{{Main|Ascent of Mont Ventoux}}
[[File:140608 Mont-Ventoux-04.jpg|thumb|left|Summit of [[Mont Ventoux]]]]
Petrarch recounts that on 26 April 1336, with his brother and two servants, he climbed to the top of [[Mont Ventoux]] ({{convert|1912|m|ft|sp=us}}, a feat which he undertook for recreation rather than necessity.<ref>[[Marjorie Hope Nicolson|Nicolson, Marjorie Hope]]; ''Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite'' (1997), p. 49; {{ISBN|0-295-97577-6}}</ref> The exploit is described in a celebrated letter addressed to his friend and confessor, the monk [[Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro]], composed some time after the fact. In it, Petrarch claimed to have been inspired by [[Philip V of Macedon]]'s ascent of [[Beklemeto Pass|Mount Haemo]] and that an aged peasant had told him that nobody had ascended Ventoux before or after himself, 50 years before, and warned him against attempting to do so. The nineteenth-century Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] noted that [[Jean Buridan]] had climbed the same mountain a few years before, and ascents accomplished during the [[Middle Ages]] have been recorded, including that of [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne]].<ref>Burckhardt, Jacob. ''[https://archive.org/details/civilisationren02middgoog The Civilisation of the Period of the Renaissance in Italy]'' (1860).  Translated by S.G.C. Middlemore.  [[Swan Sonnenschein]] (1904), pp. 301–302.</ref><ref>[[Lynn Thorndike]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707236 Renaissance or Prenaissance], ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74. [[JSTOR]] link to a collection of several letters in the same issue.</ref>

Scholars<ref>Such as [[J.H. Plumb]], in his book ''The Italian Renaissance'',</ref> note that Petrarch's letter<ref name=AMV>[http://petrarch.petersadlon.com/read_letters.html?s=pet17.html Familiares 4.1] translated by Morris Bishop, quoted in Plumb.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 462985|title = Petrarch at the Peak of Fame|journal = PMLA|volume = 108|issue = 5|pages = 1050–1063|last1 = Asher|first1 = Lyell|year = 1993|doi = 10.2307/462985}}</ref> to Dionigi displays a strikingly "modern" attitude of aesthetic gratification in the grandeur of the scenery and is still often cited in books and journals devoted to the sport of [[mountaineering]]. In Petrarch, this attitude is coupled with an aspiration for a virtuous Christian life, and on reaching the summit, he took from his pocket a volume by his beloved mentor, Saint Augustine, that he always carried with him.<ref>McLaughlin, Edward Tompkins; ''Studies in Medieval Life and Literature'', p. 6, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894</ref>

<blockquote>For pleasure alone he climbed Mont Ventoux, which rises to more than six thousand feet, beyond Vaucluse. It was no great feat, of course; but he was the first recorded [[Mountaineering|Alpinist]] of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top. (Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing.) Petrarch was dazed and stirred by the view of the Alps, the mountains around [[Lyon]]s, the [[Rhone]], the Bay of [[Marseilles]]. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' from his pocket and reflected that his climb was merely an [[allegory]] of aspiration toward a better life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plumb |first=J.H. |date=1961 |title=The Horizon Book of the Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FKVBjaLtJsC&q=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22 |location=New York |publisher=American Heritage |page=26 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

As [[Bibliomancy|the book fell open]], Petrarch's eyes were immediately drawn to the following words:

{{quote|And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars, but themselves they consider not.<ref name=AMV/>}}
Petrarch's response was to turn from the outer world of nature to the inner world of "soul":

{{quote|I closed the book, angry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might long ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful but the soul, which, when great itself, finds nothing great outside itself. Then, in truth, I was satisfied that I had seen enough of the mountain; I turned my inward eye upon myself, and from that time not a syllable fell from my lips until we reached the bottom again. ... [W]e look about us for what is to be found only within. ... How many times, think you, did I turn back that day, to glance at the summit of the mountain which seemed scarcely a cubit high compared with the range of human contemplation<ref name=AMV/>}}

[[James Hillman]] argues that this rediscovery of the inner world is the real significance of the Ventoux event.<ref name=RP>{{cite book|first=James|last=Hillman|author-link=James Hillman|year=1977|title=Revisioning Psychology|isbn=978-0-06-090563-7|publisher=Harper & Row|pages=[https://archive.org/details/revisioningpsych00hill/page/197 197]|title-link=Revisioning Psychology}}</ref> The Renaissance begins not with the ascent of Mont Ventoux but with the subsequent descent—the "return [...] to the valley of soul", as Hillman puts it. 

Arguing against such a singular and hyperbolic periodization, Paul James suggests a different reading:

{{quote| In the alternative argument that I want to make, these emotional responses, marked by the changing senses of space and time in Petrarch's writing, suggest a person caught in unsettled tension between two different but contemporaneous ontological formations: the traditional and the modern.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=Spring 2014 |last=James |first=Paul |author-link=Paul James (academic) |title=Emotional Ambivalence across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds |journal=Exemplaria |volume=26 |issue=1 |page=82 |doi=10.1179/1041257313Z.00000000044 |s2cid=191454887 |url= https://www.academia.edu/9017816 |access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>}}

===Later years===
Petrarch spent the later part of his life journeying through northern Italy as an international scholar and poet-diplomat. His career in [[Catholicism|the Church]] did not allow him to marry, but he is believed to have fathered two children by a woman or women unknown to posterity. A son, Giovanni, was born in 1337, and a daughter, Francesca, was born in 1343. He later legitimized both.<ref>Plumb, p.  165</ref>

[[File:Arquà Petrarca Punto di vista di un'aquila.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Petrarch's [[Arquà Petrarca|Arquà]] house near [[Padua]] where he retired to spend his last years]]
Giovanni died of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] in 1361. In the same year Petrarch was named [[canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Monselice]] near [[Padua]]. Francesca married [[Francescuolo da Brossano]] (who was later named executor of Petrarch's [[Will and testament|will]]) that same year. In 1362, shortly after the birth of a daughter, Eletta (the same name as Petrarch's mother), they joined Petrarch in [[Venice]] to flee the plague then ravaging parts of Europe. A second grandchild, Francesco, was born in 1366, but died before his second birthday. Francesca and her family lived with Petrarch in Venice for five years from 1362 to 1367 at [[Palazzo Molina]]; although Petrarch continued to travel in those years. Between 1361 and 1369 the younger Boccaccio paid the older Petrarch two visits. The first was in Venice, the second was in Padua.

About 1368 Petrarch and Francesca (with her family) moved to the small town of [[Arquà Petrarca|Arquà]] in the [[Euganean Hills]] near Padua, where he passed his remaining years in religious contemplation. He died in his house in Arquà early on 20 July 1374—his 70th birthday. The house hosts now a permanent exhibition of Petrarchian works and curiosities; inside is the famous tomb of Petrarch's beloved cat, who was embalmed, among other objects. On the marble slab, there is a Latin inscription written by Antonio Quarenghi:<br />
{{quote|text=<poem>Etruscus gemino vates ardebat amore:
Maximus ignis ego; Laura secundus erat.
Quid rides? divinæ illam si gratia formæ,
Me dignam eximio fecit amante fides.
Si numeros geniumque sacris dedit illa libellis
Causa ego ne sævis muribus esca forent.
Arcebam sacro vivens a limine mures,
Ne domini exitio scripta diserta forent;
Incutio trepidis eadem defuncta pavorem,
Et viget exanimi in corpore prisca fides.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40773/40773-0.txt The last lay of Petrarch's cat], Notes and Queries, Vol. V, Number 121, February 21, 1852, Author: Various, Editor: George Bell

This translates into English as:
The Etruscan bard burned with two loves
I was the greatest fire; Laura was second.
Why are you laughing? If it’s a matter of beauty and faith, 
I should have made a superb lover. 
The Muse of Poetry gave no reason why 
I should not eat wild mice. 
I guarded the sacred threshold from mice 
to prevent anxiety that might have meant the fearful
destruction of eloquent his inspired writings. 
I died, full of life, my lifeless body faithful to the end.</ref></poem>}}

Petrarch's will (dated 4 April 1370) leaves 50 [[Italian coin florin|florins]] to Boccaccio "to buy a warm winter dressing gown"; various legacies (a horse, a silver cup, a lute, a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]) to his brother and his friends; his house in Vaucluse to its caretaker; for his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and for the poor; and the bulk of his estate to his son-in-law, Francescuolo da Brossano, who is to give half of it to "the person to whom, as he knows, I wish it to go"; presumably his daughter, Francesca, Brossano's wife.  The will mentions neither the property in Arquà nor his library; [[Petrarch's library]] of notable manuscripts was already promised to Venice, in exchange for the Palazzo Molina.  This arrangement was probably cancelled when he moved to Padua, the enemy of Venice, in 1368.  The library was seized by the lords of Padua, and his books and manuscripts are now widely scattered over Europe.<ref>Bishop, pp. 360, 366. Francesca and the quotes from there;{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} Bishop adds that the dressing-gown was a piece of tact: "fifty florins would have bought twenty dressing-gowns".</ref> Nevertheless, the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] traditionally claimed this bequest as its founding, although it was in fact founded by [[Cardinal Bessarion]] in 1468.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Libraries |display=Libraries § Italy |volume=16 |page=573 |first1=Henry Richard |last1=Tedder |first2=James Duff |last2=Brown}}</ref>

Petrarch is best known for his Italian poetry, notably the ''[[Il Canzoniere|Rerum vulgarium fragmenta]]'' ("Fragments of Vernacular Matters"), a collection of 366 lyric poems in various genres also known as 'canzoniere' ('songbook'), and ''I trionfi'' ("The [[Triumphs]]"), a six-part narrative poem of Dantean inspiration. However, Petrarch was an enthusiastic Latin scholar and did most of his writing in this language. His Latin writings include scholarly works, introspective essays, letters, and more poetry. Among them are ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum]]'' ("My Secret Book"), an intensely personal, imaginary dialogue with a figure inspired by [[Augustine of Hippo]]; ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)|De Viris Illustribus]]'' ("On Famous Men"), a series of moral biographies; ''Rerum Memorandarum Libri'', an incomplete treatise on the [[cardinal virtues]]; ''De Otio Religiosorum'' ("On Religious Leisure")<ref>[http://www.italicapress.com/index186.html Francesco Petrarch, ''On Religious Leisure (De otio religioso),''] edited & translated by Susan S.

[[File:Thorvaldsen Cicero.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Petrarch revived the work and letters of the ancient [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]Petrarch also published many volumes of his letters, including a few written to his long-dead friends from history such as [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]]. Cicero, Virgil, and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were his literary models. Most of his Latin writings are difficult to find today, but several of his works are available in English translations. Several of his Latin works are scheduled to appear in the Harvard University Press series ''I Tatti''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/itatti/forthcoming.html |title=I Tatti Renaissance Library/Forthcoming and Published Volumes |publisher=Hup.harvard.edu |access-date=July 31, 2009}}</ref> It is difficult to assign any precise dates to his writings because he tended to revise them throughout his life.

Petrarch collected his letters into two major sets of books called ''[[Rerum familiarum liber]]'' ("[http://www.italicapress.com/index260.html Letters on Familiar Matters]") and ''[[Seniles]]'' ("[http://www.italicapress.com/index262.html Letters of Old Age]"), both of which are available in English translation.<ref>''[http://www.italicapress.com/index260.html Letters on Familiar Matters] (Rerum familiarium libri),''  translated by Aldo S.

Bernardo, 2 vols.</ref> The plan for his letters was suggested to him by knowledge of [[Cicero]]'s letters. These were published "without names" to protect the recipients, all of whom had close relationships to Petrarch. The recipients of these letters included [[Philippe de Cabassoles]], [[bishop of Cavaillon]]; [[Ildebrandino Conti]], [[bishop of Padua]]; [[Cola di Rienzo]], [[tribune]] of Rome; [[Francesco Nelli]], priest of the Prior of the Church of the Holy Apostles in [[Florence]]; and [[Niccolò di Capoccia]], a cardinal and priest of [[San Vitale (Rome)|Saint Vitalis]].

While Petrarch's poetry was set to music frequently after his death, especially by Italian [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] composers of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] in the 16th century, only one musical setting composed during Petrarch's lifetime survives. This is ''Non al suo amante'' by [[Jacopo da Bologna]], written around 1350.

===Laura and poetry===
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}
On 6 April 1327,<ref>6 April 1327 is often thought to be [[Good Friday]] based on poems 3 and 211 of Petrarch's ''[[Rerum vulgarium fragmenta]]'', but in fact that date fell on Monday in 1327. The apparent explanation is that Petrarch was not referring to the variable date of Good Friday but to the date fixed by the death of Christ in absolute time, which at the time was thought to be April 6 (Mark Musa, ''Petrarch's Canzoniere'', Indiana University Press, 1996, p. 522).</ref> after Petrarch gave up his vocation as a priest, the sight of a woman called "Laura" in the church of Sainte-Claire d'[[Avignon]] awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the ''Rerum vulgarium fragmenta'' ("Fragments of Vernacular Matters"). 
Laura may have been [[Laura de Noves]], the wife of Count [[Hugues de Sade]] (an ancestor of the [[Marquis de Sade]]). There is little definite information in Petrarch's work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing. Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact. According to his "Secretum", she refused him because she was already married. He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive, and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women.  Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his [[grief]] was as difficult to live with as was his former despair.  Later in his "Letter to Posterity", Petrarch wrote: "In my younger days I struggled constantly with an overwhelming but pure love affair—my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did".

[[File:Francesco Petrarca01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laura de Noves]]]]
While it is possible she was an idealized or pseudonymous character—particularly since the name "Laura" has a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] connection to the poetic "laurels" Petrarch coveted—Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of ''l'aura'' is also remarkable: for example, the line "Erano i capei d'oro a ''l'aura'' sparsi" may both mean "her hair was all over Laura's body", and "the wind ("l'aura") blew through her hair". There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalised descriptions of love and lovers from [[troubadour]] songs and other literature of [[courtly love]]. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the [[Christian mysticism|mystic Christian]], making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 "Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio": "I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Italian/PetrarchCanzoniere123-183.htm#_Toc10863123|title=Petrarch (1304–1374). The Complete Canzoniere: 123–183|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}</ref>

Laura is unreachable and evanescent – descriptions of her are evocative yet fragmentary. [[Francesco de Sanctis]] praises the powerful music of his verse in his ''Storia della letteratura italiana''. Gianfranco Contini, in a famous essay ("Preliminari sulla lingua del Petrarca". Petrarca, Canzoniere. Turin, Einaudi, 1964), has described Petrarch's language in terms of "unilinguismo" (contrasted with Dantean "plurilinguismo").

<poem>Aura che quelle chiome bionde et crespe

et poi ’l raccogli, e ’n bei nodi il rincrespe,

tu stai nelli occhi ond’amorose vespe
mi pungon sí, che ’nfin qua il sento et ploro,
et vacillando cerco il mio tesoro,
come animal che spesso adombre e ’ncespe:

<poem>Breeze, blowing that blonde curling hair,
stirring it, and being softly stirred in turn,
scattering that sweet gold about, then
gathering it, in a lovely knot of curls again,

you linger around bright eyes whose loving sting
pierces me so, till I feel it and weep,
and I wander searching for my treasure,
like a creature that often shies and kicks:

now I seem to find her, now I realise
she’s far away, now I’m comforted, now despair,
now longing for her, now truly seeing her.

Happy air, remain here with your
living rays: and you, clear running stream,
why can’t I exchange my path for yours?</poem>

==Dante==
[[File:Dante Luca.jpg|thumb|left|Dante Alighieri, detail from a [[Luca Signorelli]] [[fresco]] in the chapel of [[Orvieto Cathedral#Chapel of the Madonna di San Brizio|San Brizio]], Duomo, Orvieto.]]
Petrarch is very different from [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. In spite of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] subject, the ''Commedia'' is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century [[Florence]]: Dante's rise to power (1300) and exile (1302); his political passions call for a "violent" use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical. Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the ''Commedia'', remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante. Dante's language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early [[Dolce Stil Novo|stilnovistic]] ''Rime'' and ''Vita nuova'' to the ''Convivio'' and ''Divina Commedia'', where [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy—the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112102335/http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2013 }}</ref>

In contrast, Petrarch's thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life—he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' rather than moving to new subjects or poetry. Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus [[mysticism]], profane versus [[Christian literature]]), not against anything outside of himself. The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the [[Medieval commune|commune]]; Petrarch's moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time. The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the ''signoria'' was taking its place. Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress—but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire ([[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], the last hope of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|white Guelphs]], died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petrarch.uoregon.edu/|title=The Oregon Petrarch Open Book – "Petrarch is again in sight"|website=petrarch.uoregon.edu}}</ref>

Petrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from [[Giacomo da Lentini]] and which Dante widely used in his ''[[Vita nuova]]'' to popularise the new courtly love of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]''. The tercet benefits from Dante's [[terza rima]] (compare the ''Divina Commedia''), the [[quatrain]]s prefer the ABBA–ABBA to the ABAB–ABAB scheme of the [[Sicilian School|Sicilians]]. The imperfect rhymes of ''u'' with closed ''o'' and ''i'' with closed ''e'' (inherited from Guittone's mistaken rendering of [[Sicilian School|Sicilian verse]]) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed ''o'' is kept. Finally, Petrarch's [[enjambment]] creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following. The vast majority (317) of Petrarch's 366 poems collected in the ''Canzoniere'' (dedicated to Laura) were ''sonnets'', and the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] still bears his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/poetry/home_movements.html|title=Movements : Poetry through the Ages|website=www.webexhibits.org}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
[[File:Francesco Petrarca2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Petrarch on the Uffizi Palace, in Florence]]Petrarch is traditionally called the father of Humanism and considered by many to be the "father of the [[Renaissance]]."<ref>See for example [[Rudolf Pfeiffer]], ''History of Classical Scholarship 1300–1850'', Oxford University Press, 1976, p. 1; Gilbert Highet, ''The Classical Tradition,'' Oxford University Press, 1949, p. 81–88.</ref> In his work ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum meum]]'' he points out that secular achievements did not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with God. Petrarch argued instead that God had given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to their fullest.<ref>[[Famous First Facts]] International, H.W. Wilson Company, New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-8242-0958-3}}, p. 303, item 4567.</ref> He inspired humanist philosophy which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance. He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literature—that is, the study of human thought and action. Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity's potential and having [[religious faith]].

A highly introspective man, he shaped the nascent humanist movement a great deal because many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were seized upon by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years. For example, Petrarch struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life, and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study. In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' that [[Pope Celestine V]]'s refusal of the papacy in 1294 was as a virtuous example of solitary life.<ref>{{Cite book | last= Petrarca | first = Francesco | title = De vita Solitaria | location = Bologna | publisher = Gaetano Romagnoli | year = 1879 | url = https://archive.org/details/lavitasolitaria01petr | language = it}}</ref> Later the politician and thinker [[Leonardo Bruni]] (1370–1444) argued for the active life, or "[[civic humanism]]". As a result, a number of political, military, and religious leaders during the Renaissance were inculcated with the notion that their pursuit of personal fulfillment should be grounded in [[Classical era|classical]] example and philosophical contemplation.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://edizionighibli.com/francesco-petrarca/ | language = it | title=Edizioni Ghibli, Il Rinascimento e Petrarca| date = August 18, 2016 |publisher=edizionighibli.com| access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Petrarca Tomb (Arqua).JPG|thumb|right|Petrarch's tomb at [[Arquà Petrarca]]]]
Petrarch's influence is evident in the works of [[Serafino dell' Aquila|Serafino Ciminelli]] from [[L'Aquila|Aquila]] (1466–1500) and in the works of [[Marin Držić]] (1508–1567) from [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance: Class-Furió Ceriol, Vol. 2, p. 106, Paul F. Grendler, Renaissance Society of America, Scribner's published in association with the Renaissance Society of America, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-684-80509-2}}</ref>

The [[Romantic era|Romantic]] composer [[Franz Liszt]] set three of Petrarch's Sonnets (47, 104, and 123) to music for voice, ''Tre sonetti del Petrarca'', which he later would transcribe for solo piano for inclusion in the suite ''[[Années de Pèlerinage]]''. Liszt also set a poem by [[Victor Hugo]], " O quand je dors" in which Petrarch and Laura are invoked as the epitome of erotic love.

While in Avignon in 1991, [[Modernist]] composer [[Elliott Carter]] completed his solo flute piece ''Scrivo in Vento'' which is in part inspired by and structured by Petrarch's Sonnet 212, ''Beato in sogno''. It was premiered on Petrarch's 687th birthday.<ref>[http://www.patriciaspencerflute.com/images/CarterInterviewFQ.pdf Spencer, Patricia (2008) "Regarding ''Scrivo in Vento'': A Conversation with Elliott Carter"] ''Flutest Quarterly'' summer.</ref>

In November 2003, it was announced that [[pathology|pathological]] [[anatomy|anatomists]] would be exhuming Petrarch's body from his casket in [[Arquà Petrarca]], to verify 19th-century reports that he had stood 1.83 meters (about six feet), which would have been tall for his period. The team from the [[University of Padua]] also hoped to reconstruct his cranium to generate a computerized image of his features to coincide with his 700th birthday. The tomb had been opened previously in 1873 by Professor Giovanni Canestrini, also of Padua University. When the tomb was opened, the skull was discovered in fragments and a [[DNA]] test revealed that the skull was not Petrarch's,<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Caramelli D, Lalueza-Fox C, Capelli C, etal |title=Genetic analysis of the skeletal remains attributed to Francesco Petrarch |journal=Forensic Sci. Int. |volume=173 |issue=1 |pages=36–40 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17320326 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.01.020 }}</ref> prompting calls for the return of Petrarch's skull.

The researchers are fairly certain that the body in the tomb is Petrarch's due to the fact that the [[skeleton]] bears evidence of injuries mentioned by Petrarch in his writings, including a kick from a donkey when he was 42.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upf.edu/bioevo/2007BioEvo/BE2007-Caramelli-FSI.pdf |title=UPF.edu |access-date=March 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306013340/http://www.upf.edu/bioevo/2007BioEvo/BE2007-Caramelli-FSI.pdf |archive-date=March 6, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>
