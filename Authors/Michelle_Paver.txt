Her family settled in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], England when she was three. She was educated at The Study and [[Wimbledon High School]]. After reading [[biochemistry]] at [[Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford]], where she attained a first-class degree, she became a partner in a City of London law firm.
