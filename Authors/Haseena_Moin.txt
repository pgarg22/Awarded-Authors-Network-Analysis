'''Haseena Moin''' (20 November 1941 – 26 March 2021) was Pakistani dramatist, playwright and [[scriptwriter]]. She wrote several plays for stage, [[radio programming|radio]] and [[television programming|television]], some of which have even gained international repute. She was the recipient of the [[Pride of Performance]] award for her services to the [[performing arts]] in Pakistan. She wrote Pakistan's first original script ''Kiran Kahani'' aired in the early-1970s. Before this [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]] relied on novel-based scripts for dramas. She was considered to be the best playwright and dramatist Pakistan has ever witnessed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistani Writer Haseena Moin|url=http://www.meriduniya11.com/entertainment/haseena-moin.html|publisher=meriduniya11.com|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Haseena Moin Biography|url=http://www.urduyouthforum.org/biography/Haseena_Moin____biography.php|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416023828/http://www.urduyouthforum.org/biography/Haseena_Moin____biography.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 April 2013|publisher=urduyouthforum.org|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Haseena Moin|url=http://www.woman.com.pk/haseena-moin.html|publisher=woman.com.pk|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref>

Some of the most popular dramas she wrote that gained international repute include ''[[Ankahi]]'', ''[[Tanhaiyaan]]'', ''Kiran Kahani'', ''[[Dhoop Kinaray]]'', ''Aahat'', ''Uncle Urfi'', ''[[Shehzori]]'', ''Kohar'', ''Des Pardes'', ''Pal Do Pal'', ''Aansoo'', ''Kasak'', ''[[Parchaiyan (1976)]]'' and ''Parosi''. Other notable works include ''Mere Dard ko Jo Zuban Milay'', ''Kaisa Yeh Junoon'', ''Dhundle Raaste'', ''Shayad ke Bahar Aaye'', ''Mohim Joo'', ''Tum Se Mil Kar'', ''[[Bandish]]'' and ''Zer Zabar Paish''.
It appears strange that with such a success following even greater success on the TV screen, Moin didn't branch out into other literary forms like novels or short stories which are such a popular genre among Urdu fiction writers.<ref>{{cite web|title=281/Haseena-Moin|url=http://vidpk.com/p/281/Haseena-Moin/|publisher=vidpk.com|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117232625/http://vidpk.com/p/281/Haseena-Moin/|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Early life==
Haseena was born in [[Kanpur]], the most populous city in the northern Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], on November 20, 1941. Moin received her early education in her ancestral region and, after the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, migrated with her family to Pakistan. She lived for a number of years in [[Rawalpindi]], then moved to [[Lahore]] and, in the 1950s, settled in [[Karachi]], where she graduated from the Government College for Women in 1960 and earned [[Master of Arts]] in History from [[Karachi University]] in 1963. Her yearning for writing was visible right from the time she was in final years of her schooling, as from 7th standard, beside other school activities she got selected to write weekly column by the title of BHAI JAN for a local journal.<ref>{{cite web|title=HASEENA MOIN BIO|url=http://www.in.com/haseena-moin/biography-114923.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184027/http://www.in.com/haseena-moin/biography-114923.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2014|publisher=in.com|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Talented Drama Writer from Pakistan-Haseena Moin|url=http://pakistan360degrees.com/tag/haseena-moin/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162512/http://pakistan360degrees.com/tag/haseena-moin/|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2014|publisher=pakistan360degrees.com|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref>

Her fame started laying its foundation when she regularly wrote some memorable plays for Radio Pakistan Karachi's all-time popular "Studio Number 9. Professionally, she took up the educational pursuits and started teaching. She rose to the level of Principal. It was in 1969 that Iftikhar Arif, Head of the Script Dept. at [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]]-Karachi Centre, called Haseena and offered her the chance to write a play for the then-forthcoming EID. Initially Haseena was nervous, but took courage to pen down a play. The cast was also decided by her with Kunwar Aftab Ahmed as the director. Hence came ''Eid Ka Jorra'' with Neelofer Aleem and Talat Hussain in lead, supported by Khalid Nizami and Ishrat Hashmi.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haseena Moin: Writer of Modern Drama|url=http://www.thinktwicepakistan.com/haseena-moin-writer-of-modern-drama-2/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103042500/http://www.thinktwicepakistan.com/haseena-moin-writer-of-modern-drama-2/|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 January 2013|publisher=thinktwicepakistan.com|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Haseena Moin Pakistani dramatist, playwright and scriptwriter|url=http://www.profilepk.com/Haseena-Moin_280.html|publisher=profilepk.com|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref>

She was the writer of the first coloured drama of Pakistan, aired on PTV called ''Parchaiyan'', which had a huge star cast and was directed by [[Mohsin Ali (director)|Mohsin Ali]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parchaiyan (2 DVDs)|url=http://desistore-com.stores.yahoo.net/parchaiyandvd.html|publisher=desistore-com.stores.yahoo.net|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214145910/http://desistore-com.stores.yahoo.net/parchaiyandvd.html|archive-date=14 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

She also wrote Pakistan's first original script 'Kiran Kahani' aired in the early-1970s. Before this PTV used to rely on novel based scripts. Most of the people at that time were not confident with the experiment but it was Mohsin Ali who encouraged her to write and finally when the play was on air, it was a huge success and is remembered to date. It starred Roohi Bano in the lead with Manzoor Qureshi, Begum Khursheed Mirza, [[Qazi Wajid]] and many more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haseena Moin: Writer of Modern Drama|url=http://www.thinktwicepakistan.com/haseena-moin-writer-of-modern-drama/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110230436/http://www.thinktwicepakistan.com/haseena-moin-writer-of-modern-drama/|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2012|publisher=thinktwicepakistan.com|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kiran Kahani|url=http://www.ptvdramas.com/classic-serials/kiran-kahani/|publisher=ptvdramas.com|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702162600/http://www.ptvdramas.com/classic-serials/kiran-kahani/|archive-date=2 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Bollywood===
Moin was the first Pakistani writer to write for a [[Bollywood]] film. [[Raj Kapoor]] wanted her to write the dialogues for his dream project ''[[Henna (film)|Henna]]'', which was released in 1991. He also wanted to cast [[Shehnaz Sheikh]] in the title role of the film but after she refused, Haseena Moin recommended [[Zeba Bakhtiar]] as the leading lady, thus Zeba was cast in the title role of ''Henna''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shehnaz Sheikh Was The First Choice For Henna|url=http://showbizspice.com/shehnaz-sheikh-was-the-first-choice-for-heena/|access-date=10 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929172010/http://showbizspice.com/shehnaz-sheikh-was-the-first-choice-for-heena/|archive-date=29 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shehnaz Sheikh: Raj Kapoors first choice!|url=http://luxstyle.pk/celebrity-news/?shehnaz-sheikh-raj-kapoors-first-choice|access-date=10 February 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416081422/http://luxstyle.pk/celebrity-news/?shehnaz-sheikh-raj-kapoors-first-choice|archive-date=16 April 2013}}</ref> The film was a box office success and was also chosen as India's entry for the ''Best Foreign Language Film'' at the [[Oscars]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Henna|url=http://m.prestage.cineplex.com/Movies/Archives/BL4738467/Henna.aspx?tab=awards|access-date=10 February 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130407224721/http://m.prestage.cineplex.com/Movies/Archives/BL4738467/Henna.aspx?tab=awards|archive-date=7 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Saraansh to Barfi: Indian Movies at the Oscar so far|url=http://www.buzzintown.com/bollywood-news--saraansh-barfi-indian-movies-the-oscar-so-far/show--full/id--5976.html|access-date=10 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705032953/http://www.buzzintown.com/bollywood-news--saraansh-barfi-indian-movies-the-oscar-so-far/show--full/id--5976.html|archive-date=5 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Initially she was hesitant to write for a Bollywood film. During the pre production stages Raj Kapoor died, and the project was taken over by his son [[Randhir Kapoor]]. But when the film was about to release the [[Babri Mosque]] incident broke out and Moin wrote a letter to Randhir Kapoor in which she requested that her name should not be used to promote the film neither her name should be mentioned in the credits as it may hurt her fans in Pakistan, thus her name was not mentioned in the credits nor the film was promoted using her name but she was acknowledged at the end of the film. Although this incident brought a lot of loss to her, she stated in an interview that "she can do any thing for her country and sacrificing a film was very little thing for her she could also give her life for her country".<ref>{{cite news|title=It's No Ordinary Film in Pakistan Resistance Faced By Movie on Hindu-muslim Romance|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-06/news/9103070216_1_india-and-pakistan-indian-pakistani-henna|access-date=11 February 2013 | work=Chicago Tribune|date=6 September 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Karachi Journal; A Hindu Romeo, a Muslim Juliet and Woe Aplenty|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/05/world/karachi-journal-a-hindu-romeo-a-muslim-juliet-and-woe-aplenty.html|access-date=11 February 2013 | work=The New York Times|first=Philip|last=Shenon|date=5 September 1991}}</ref>

Moin wrote the first 7 episodes and then had to go abroad, so she allowed Mohammad Ahmed to write the rest of the episodes, with a plan to write the final episode when she returned. But by the time she returned, the entire serial was written and many changes were made to the episodes she had previously completed. She was disappointed and asked the producers to remove her name from the serial, but due to copyright issues her name could not be removed. Moin has said she had nothing to do with ''Naye Silsilay'' and was very disappointed by the outcome.<ref>{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: I am Not Happy with Tanhaiyan Sequal: Haseena Moin
