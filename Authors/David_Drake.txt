His studies at [[Duke University School of Law]] were interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]], where he served as an enlisted interrogator with the [[11th Armored Cavalry]] (The [[Black Horse Regiment]]) in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Cambodian Civil War|Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web

With [[Karl Edward Wagner]] and Jim Groce, he was one of the initiators of [[Carcosa]], a small press company. He now lives in [[Pittsboro, North Carolina]].

On 17 November 2021 he announced he is retiring from writing novels, due to unspecified health problems.<ref name="newsletter 123">{{Cite web|url=https://david-drake.com/2021/newsletter-123-the-last-one/|title=Newsletter #123 – the last one|date=2021-11-17|access-date=2021-11-26|website=David Drake — Science Fiction & Fantasy Writer|last=Drake|first=Dave}}</ref>

==Works==
His best-known solo work is the [[Hammer's Slammers]] series of military science fiction. His newer [[RCN Series|Republic of Cinnabar Navy]]  series are [[space opera]]s inspired by the [[Aubrey–Maturin series|Aubrey–Maturin novels]]. During 1997, Drake began his largest fantasy series, ''[[Lord of the Isles (David Drake)|Lord of the Isles]]'', using elements of [[Sumer]]ian religion and medieval technology. During 2007, Drake finished the series with its ninth volume.

Drake has co-authored novels with authors such as [[Karl Edward Wagner]], [[S.M. Stirling]], and [[Eric Flint]]. Typically Drake provides plot outlines (5,000&ndash;15,000 words) and the co-author does "the real work of developing the outline into a novel".<ref name=outlines>[http://david-drake.com/2010/plot-outlines/ Novel Plot Outlines], David Drake, May 26, 2010</ref> He does not "consider [his] involvement to be that of a real co-author."<ref name=outlines/> Drake also contributed to the ''[[Heroes in Hell]]'' series.

Drake's plots often use history, literature, and mythology.  Starting with ''Northworld'' in 1990,<ref>[http://david-drake.com/2000/northworld/ Northworld, Vengeance, and Justice], David Drake, May 15, 2000</ref> he has generally explained the background of each book in an afterword or preface.  Additionally, Drake's plots frequently involve a contest of political systems.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[John Clute]] stated in the entry on Drake in the 1993 edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', "Today there seems very little to stop [Drake] from writing exactly what he wishes to write."

Some of Drake's works are available for free download in the [[Baen Free Library]].
