'''Washington Allston''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|ARA}} (November 5, 1779 &ndash; July 9, 1843) was an American painter and [[poet]], born in [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Waccamaw Parish]], [[South Carolina]]. Allston pioneered America's Romantic movement of landscape painting. He was well known during his lifetime for his experiments with dramatic subject matter and his bold use of light and atmospheric color. While his early artworks concentrate on grandiose and spectacular aspects of nature, his later pieces represent a more subjective and visionary approach.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw|url-access=limited|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw/page/13 13]}}</ref>

Allston was born on a rice plantation on the [[Waccamaw River]] near [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]. His mother Rachel Moore had married Captain William Allston in 1775, though her husband died in 1781, shortly after the [[Battle of Cowpens]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Hubbell, Jay B. |title=The South in American Literature: 1607–1900|publisher=Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press| year=1954 |page=[https://archive.org/details/southinamericanl0000unse/page/274 274] |url=https://archive.org/details/southinamericanl0000unse/page/274}}</ref> Moore remarried to Dr. Henry C.

From 1803 to 1808, he visited the great museums of [[Paris]] and then, for several years, those of [[Italy]], where he met [[Washington Irving]] in Rome<ref>{{cite book |author=Burstein, Andrew |title=The Original Knickerbocker: The Life of Washington Irving|publisher=Basic Books| year=2007 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originalknickerb00burs/page/43 43] |url=https://archive.org/details/originalknickerb00burs/page/43 |isbn=978-0-465-00853-7}}</ref> and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], his lifelong friend. In 1809, Allston married Ann Channing, sister of [[William Ellery Channing]].<ref name="Hubbell275"/> [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] was one of Allston's art pupils and accompanied Allston to Europe in 1811. After traveling throughout western Europe, Allston finally settled in London, where he won fame and prizes for his pictures.

Allston was also a published writer. In London in 1813, he published ''The Sylphs of the Seasons, with Other Poems'', republished in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], later that year.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hubbell, Jay B. |title=The South in American Literature: 1607–1900|publisher=Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press| year=1954 |page=[https://archive.org/details/southinamericanl0000unse/page/277 277] |url=https://archive.org/details/southinamericanl0000unse/page/277}}</ref> His wife died in February 1815, leaving him saddened, lonely, and homesick for America.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hubbell, Jay B. |title=The South in American Literature: 1607–1900|publisher=Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press| year=1954 |page=[https://archive.org/details/southinamericanl0000unse/page/278 278] |url=https://archive.org/details/southinamericanl0000unse/page/278}}</ref>

In 1818, he returned to the United States and lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for twenty-five years. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1826.<ref name="AAAS">{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref> He was the uncle of the artists [[George Whiting Flagg]] and [[Jared Bradley Flagg]], both of whom studied painting under him.

The first American exhibition of Allston's work was in 1827 when twelve of his paintings were shown at the [[Boston Athenæum]].<ref>Swan, Mabel Munson. ''The Athenæum Gallery 1827–1873: The Boston Athenæum as an Early Patron of Art'' (Boston: The Boston Athenæum, 1940)</ref>

In 1830 Allston married Martha Remington Dana (daughter of Chief Justice [[Francis Dana]]), the sister of the novelist [[Richard Henry Dana Sr.]]; Dana was a cousin of Allston's first wife.<ref>{{cite book |author=Flagg, Jared Bradley |title=The Life and Letters of Washington Allston|publisher=New York: Charles Scribner| year=1892 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifelwas00flag}}</ref>

In 1841, he published ''Monaldi,'' a romance illustrating Italian life, and in 1850, a volume of his ''Lectures on Art, and Poems''.<ref>Ware's ''Lectures on the Works and Genius of Washington Allston'' (Boston, 1852) and ''Artist Biographies, Allston'' (1879).</ref>

Allston died on July 9, 1843, at age 63. Allston is buried in [[Harvard Square]], in "the Old Burying Ground" between the [[The First Parish in Cambridge|First Parish Church]] and [[Christ Church (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Christ Church]].

==Recognition==

Allston was sometimes called the "American [[Titian]]" because his style resembled the great [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] artists in their display of dramatic color contrasts. His work greatly influenced the development of U.S. landscape painting. Also, the themes of many of his paintings were drawn from literature, especially Biblical stories.<ref name="Poets of Cambridge, USA">{{cite web | author=Vetter, H.F | title=Poets of Cambridge, USA | work=Harvard Square Library (2006) | url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/poets/allston.php | access-date=2007-06-12}}</ref>

His artistic genius was much admired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was strongly influenced by his paintings and poems, but so were both [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia Peabody]], wife of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].<ref name="Poets of Cambridge, USA"/> The influential critic and editor [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] dedicated his famous anthology ''[[The Poets and Poetry of America]]'' to Allston in 1842.<ref>*{{cite book | title=The First Century of American Literature: 1770–1870 | last=Pattee | first=Fred Lewis | publisher=Cooper Square Publishers | location=New York | year=1966 | pages=279}}</ref> Poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], 17 years after Allston's death, wrote that: "One man may sweeten a whole time. I never pass through Cambridge Port without thinking of Allston. His memory is the [[quince]] in the drawer and perfumes the atmosphere."<ref name="Hubbell275"/>

Boston painter [[William Morris Hunt]] was an admirer of Allston's work, and in 1866 founded the Allston Club in Boston, and in his arts classes passed on to his students his knowledge of Allston's techniques.<ref>Wright, Nathalia. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym3Gs2jBocgC&pg=PA637&dq=%22william+morris+hunt%22+%22boston+athenaeum%22&lr=&ei=NWZ0SZOjO5LOlQTGoMGDDg ''The Correspondence of Washington Allston''], Published by University Press of Kentucky, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8131-1708-9}}</ref>

Washington Allston was the first to use (apparently) the term '''Objective Correlative''' in 1840 which subsequently revived and made famous by T.S Eliot in essay on ''Hamlet'' (1919). The term denotes a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked.

The west [[Boston, Massachusetts]] neighborhood of [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] is named after him, as is Allston Way, in the "Poets Corner" neighborhood of Berkeley, California.
