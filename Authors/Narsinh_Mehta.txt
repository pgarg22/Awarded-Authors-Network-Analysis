'''Narsinh Mehta''', also known as '''Narsi Mehta''' or '''Narsi Bhagat'''<!---(1414–1481)--->, was a 15th-century poet-[[Saint#Hinduism|saint]] of [[Gujarat]], [[India]], notable as a [[Bhakti|bhakta]], an exponent of [[Vaishnava]] poetry. He is especially revered in [[Gujarati literature]], where he is acclaimed as its ''Adi Kavi'' ([[Sanskrit]] for "first among poets"). His bhajan ''[[Vaishnav Jan To]]'' was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s favourite and has become synonymous with him.<ref name="nm">{{cite book |last1=Ramanuj |first1=Jagruti |last2=Ramanuj |first2=Vi |year=2012 |title=Atmagnyani Bhaktakavi Narsinh Mehta (Biography of Narsinh Mehta)  |location=Ahmedabad |publisher=Navsarjan Publication |isbn=978-93-81443-58-3}}</ref>

==Biography per traditional sources==
[[File:Narsinh Mehta.jpg|thumb|Bust of Narsinh Mehta in [[Vadodara]]]]
Narsinh Mehta was born in a [[Nagar Brahmin]] family at [[Talaja, Bhavnagar|Talaja]] and later moved to [[Junagadh]] in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] peninsula of modern-day Gujarat. His father held an administrative post in a royal court. He lost his parents when he was five years old. He could not speak until the age of eight. He was raised by his grandmother Jaygauri.<ref name="iss">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvJa5nTi3VsC&q=vallabhacharya&pg=PA189 | title=Indian Saints & Sages | publisher=Pustak Mahal | author=Prasoon, Shrikant | year=2009 | page=169 | isbn=9788122310627}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

He married Manekbai probably in the year 1429. Mehta and his wife stayed at his brother Bansidhar's house in Junagadh. However, Bansidhar's wife (Sister-in-law or ''bhabhi'') did not welcome Narsinh very well. She was an ill-tempered woman, always taunting and insulting Narsinh Mehta for his devotion (Bhakti). One day, when Narasinh Mehta had enough of these taunts and insults, he left the house and went to a nearby forest in search of some peace, where he fasted and meditated for seven days by a secluded [[Shiva lingam]] until [[Shiva]] appeared before him in person. On the poet's request, the Lord took him to [[Vrindavan]] and showed him the eternal ''[[Rasa lila|raas leela]]'' of [[Krishna]] and the [[Gopis]]. A legend has it that the poet, transfixed by the spectacle, burnt his hand with the torch he was holding, but he was so engrossed in the ecstatic vision that he was oblivious to the pain. Mehta, as the popular account goes, at Krishna's command, decided to sing His praises and the nectarous experience of the ''rasa'' in this mortal world. He resolved to compose around 22,000 [[kirtan]]s or compositions.<ref name="nm"/>

After this divine experience, the transformed Mehta returned to his village, touched his sister-in-law's feet as reverence, and thanked her for insulting him for had she not made him upset, the above episode would not have occurred.

In [[Junagadh]], Mehta lived in poverty with his wife and two children, a son named Shamaldas, and a daughter for whom he had special affection, Kunwarbai. He revelled in devotion to his heart's content along with sadhus, saints, and all those people who were Lord Hari's subjects&nbsp;– Harijans&nbsp;– irrespective of their caste, class or sex. It also seems that he must have fallen into a somewhat ill repute amongst the Nagars following incidents like accepting invitation to sing glories of Lord Krishna in association of devotees belonging to lower social strata. The [[Nagar Brahmins|Nagars]] of Junagadh despised him and spared no opportunity to scorn and insult him {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. By this time, Mehta had already sung about the [[rasa lila|rasaleela]] of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]]. The compositions are collected under the category of [[Sringara|Shringar]] compositions. They are full of intense lyricism, based upon pastimes of conjugal love between the Supreme Lord and His most intimate devotees - the Gopis and are not without allegorical dimensions.<ref name="nm"/>

Soon after his daughter, Kunwarbai's marriage (around 1447) to Shrirang Mehta of [[Una, Gujarat|Una]]'s son, Kunwarbai conceived and it had been a custom for the girl's parents to give gifts and presents to all the in-laws during the seventh month of pregnancy. This custom, known as Mameru, was simply out of the reach of materialistically poor Narsinh who had hardly anything except intransient faith in his Lord. How Krishna helped his beloved devotee is a legend depicted in 'Mameru Na Pada'. This episode is preserved vividly in the memory of [[Gujarati people]] by compositions by later poets and films. Other famous legends include: '[[Hundi]] (Bond)' episode and 'Har Mala (Garland)' episode.  The episode in which none other than Shamalsha Seth cleared a bond written by poverty-stricken beloved, is famous not only in Gujarat but in other parts of India as well. The Har Mala episode deals with the challenge given to Mehta by [[Mandalika III|Ra Mandalika]] (1451–1472), a [[Chudasama]] king, to prove his innocence in the charges of immoral behaviour by making the Lord Himself garland Narsinh. Mehta depicts this episode. How Sri Krishna, in the guise of a wealthy merchant, helped Mehta in getting his son married is sung by the poet in ''Putra Vivah Na Pada''. He went to [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]] where, at the age of 79, he is believed to have died. The crematorium at Mangrol is called 'Narsinh Nu Samshan' where one of the sons of Gujarat and more importantly a great Vaishnav was cremated. He will forever be remembered for his poetic works and devotion to Lord Krishna. He is known as the first poet of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] Adi Kavi.<ref name="nm"/>

== Study of biography ==
Darshana Dholakiya had studied the development of biography of Narsinh Mehta. She has divided the development in three stages; biography from his poetry which is autobiographical in nature, biography emerging from poetry of poets born between Krishnadas and [[Premanand Bhatt|Premanand]], biography written by poets after Premanand. She considers second stage very important because an image of Narsinh Mehta's personality was established during this period.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Narsinh Mehta|last=Dholakiya|first=Darshana|publisher=Sardar Patel University|year=1994|location=Vallabh Vidyanagar|pages=8–20|language=gu|oclc=32204298}}</ref>
<!---
=== Biography===
Narsinh Mehta was native of [[Junagadh]]. He was Vadnagara Nagar by caste. He is also mentioned as Vadnagara [[Nagar Brahmin]]. He was householder Brahmin. His family was a [[Shaivism|follower of Shiva]] and he had adopted [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] tradition later after grace of Shiva.He had lost his parents when he was young and he was raised by his brother and sister-in-law. He had not gained knowledge as per his caste and had to left home due to his sister-in-law. It does not seem that he had adopted any profession after being involved in [[Bhakti]] (devotion). No other family members are mentioned and he may have lost contact with his brother and sister-in-law.<ref name=":0" />

Manekbai was Narsinh Mehta's wife. When Narsinh left home, he went to forest where he worshiped a [[Shivalinga]]. [[Shiva]] emerged and saw him the [[Rasa lila|rasaleela of Braj]] as he was granted boon to see the favorite thing of Shiva. Thus he was introduced to Vaishnava tradition. He returned home and decided to spent his life in devotion.<ref name=":0" />

He had a son, Shamal and a daughter, Kunvarbai. He had his children married. Shamal had married a daughter of Madan Mehta, a divan of [[Vadnagar]]. Shamal died soon after and his wife continued to stay at Narsinh's house and spent rest of her life in devotion too. After his son, Manekbai died too.<ref name=":0" />

Kunvarbai married and Narsinh Mehta was invited by his co-father-in-law when she conceived. It had been a custom, known as ''Mameru'', for the girl's parents to give gifts and presents to all the in-laws during the seventh month of pregnancy. Narsinh being poor, he went only with a Shankh, plate and few leaves of Tulsi. But the episode ends with the miraculous help of god [[Krishna]].<ref name=":0" />

Once few pilgrims, going to [[Dwarka]], were directed to Narsinh by some Nagars to write bond. Narsinh wrote bond to them in name of Shamalsha Sheth in Dwarka. When pilgrims reached Dwarka, nobody accepted their bond and they were told that no person named Shamalsha lives in Dwarka. The confused pilgrims roamed in Dwarka and finally Krishna fulfilled their bond in disguise of Shamlasha Sheth.<ref name=":0" />

Few people told Mandalika, the Chudasama king of Junagadh, to test his faith. He was seated and locked in the assembly hall and was told to bring the garland in the neck of god in the temple to his neck. Narsinh prays whole night and the garland appears in his neck the next morning.<ref name=":0" />

This four events from his life are found in his compositions of older traditions. All these events are more about his faith in god instead of miracles.<ref name=":0" />

Other events of later tradition include: the god appearing as a lady to quench thirst of Narsinh as well as fulfilling his hunger when he was meditating. Another event include a [[Śrāddha]] (tradition of venerating ancestors by feeding people) of his father. When he was denied leaving home to worship god, he was seen by others in his home even though he was out for worship. Another event mentions that the community meal being bad, when Narsinh was not invited.<ref name=":0" />
--->

===Time===
No year is mentioned in his compositions. So there is difference of opinions among scholars about his time.<ref name=":0" />

The mention of Junagadh king Mandalika is considered to establish his date. No independent poem of the event of garland is found in the biographical poems of the poets of second period like Krishnadas, Vishnudas, Govind, Vishwanath Jani or Premanand but the event of garland is mentioned in some poems.<ref name=":0" />

A poem on the event of garland is independently found in the autobiographical poems said to be composed by Narsinh. The oldest manuscript dated [[Samvat]] 1675 has seven poems (''pada'') which also mentions Mandalika. So it can be said that the contemporaneity of Mandalika and Narsinh was established by Samvat 1675. One poem on the event of garland even mentions Samvat 1512 as the date of event but the authenticity is not established. So it is known that the contemporaneity of Mandalika and Narsinh is popular in old as well as new traditions. One question emerge from that why did Mandalika tested him even though he was mentioned as a religious Vaishnava in other sources. This Mandalika must have been [[Mandalika III]] ({{reign|1451|1472 CE}} or Samvat 1506–1527) and was defeated by [[Mahmud Begada]]. His defeat is connected to the test of Narsinh. Other reasons for his defeat mentioned are the curse of [[Charan]] lady Nagbai.<ref name=":0" />

===Clan and pedigree===
In older traditions, there is no mention of his clan. Names of his parents or brother is not mentioned either.<ref name=":0" />

''Narsain Mehtanu Akhyan'' (written after Samvat 1705) mentions one Parvat Mehta but he was not related to Narsinh Mehta and he is just mentioned as a devotee.<ref name=":0" />

Vallabhdas' ''Shamaldasno Vivah'' gives information about his clan and ancestry. Purushottam is mentioned as his grandfather. His ''[[gotra]]'' is Kashyap. His Veda division and his family deities (''Kuladevta'' and ''Kuladevi'') is also mentioned. The following family tree is mentioned in it:<ref name=":0" />
*Purushottam
**Parvatdas
***Narbat
***Haridas
***Ram
**Krishnadas
***Narsinh
***Jivan
***Narbheram

''Draupadi Pattavidhan'' composed by Rangildas, son of Trikamdas, mentions that Trikamdas was mentioned in Narsinh's clan. But it can be taken as the common Nagar clan.<ref name=":0" />

Several pedigrees are recorded later but they differ from each other. One pedigree even mentions Narsinh as an uncle of Parvatdas though Parvatdas is commonly mentioned as an uncle of Narsinh. So authenticity of these pedigrees are questionable. Vallabhdas' ''Shamaldas no Vivah'' has years of Narsinh arranged so it seems that he had tried to establish his biography.<ref name=":0" />

So Dholakiya opines that the authentic pedigree of Narsinh Mehta has not survived.<ref name=":0" />

===Place of worshiped Shivalinga===
The exact location of the non-reverend Shivalinga worshiped by Narsinh is not mentioned in old as well as new traditions.<ref name=":0" />

''Shamaldas No Vivah'', purportedly composed by Narsinh himself, mentions the place as Gopinath. Later work ''Narsain Mehtanu Akhyan'' mentions it as Gopeshwar. Some scholars mentions [[Gopnath]] near [[Talaja, Bhavnagar|Talaja]] as the place but it is dubious because Narsinh had worshiped it in forest while the Gopnath is on the seashore. It must have been near Junagadh because mention of forest.<ref name=":0" />

===Family tradition===
As he worshiped Shiva after leaving home, it can be said that his family tradition was [[Shaivism]]. He became [[Vaishnava]] due to Shiva. It is mentioned that other Nagars opposed him due to his Vaishnava tradition. Vishwanath Jani's ''Mosalacharitra'' mentions that a Nagar opposed him saying that he is not ''vipra'' (Brahmin) because he is Vaishnava. So Dholakiya opines that the event of Shiva may have originated to make his Vaishnava devotion acceptable.<ref name=":0" />

[[Harivallabh Bhayani]] opines that the Vaishnava devotion was prevalent in Narshin's time and it is not unusual that he was devotee of Vaishnava. He also mentions the ''Vaishnava'' surname among Nagars.<ref name=":0" />

===Education and profession===
No education or profession other than religious devotion is mentioned in his poetry. It is said that he became poet due to grace of god but Bhayani opines that, if we consider ''Chaturi'' as his full or partial composition, its language, style and emotion establishes Narsinh's knowledge of literary traditions and creativity. Narsinh must have known ''[[Geet Govind]]'', [[Vedant]] etc. It works seem influenced by Marathi poets like [[Namdev]]. So he must have studied according to his Nagar family tradition.<ref name=":0" />

===Society and Narsinh===
Narsinh was opposed in his Nagar society but the opposition was not strong as much seen in other saint-poets like [[Meera]] and [[Kabir]] of that era.
The reasons behind opposition seem his acceptance of Vaishnava tradition even though his family tradition was Shaiva, his attitude towards society and poor and his friendly devotion to god in view of orthodox society. His life events matches events of several popular saint-poets like [[Surdas]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Meera]], [[Kabir]], [[Namdev]] and Sundarar. While several saint-poets are not involved in household, Narsinh was involved in household even after his commitment to devotion. He lived with his family and he did not have any followers.<ref name=":0" />

==Works==
{{wikisource|gu:નરસિંહ મહેતા|Narsinh Mehta}}
Mehta is a pioneer poet of [[Gujarati literature]]. He is known for his literary forms called "pada (verse)", "[[Akhyana]]" and "[[Prabhatiya]]" (morning devotional songs).
One of the most important features of Mehta's works is that they are not available in the language in which Narsinh had composed them. They have been largely preserved orally. The oldest available manuscript of his work is dated around 1612, and was found by the noted scholar [[Keshavram Kashiram Shastri]] from [[Gujarat Vidhya Sabha]]. Because of the immense popularity of his works, their language has undergone modifications with changing times. Mehta wrote many bhajans and Aartis for lord Krishna, and they are published in many books. The biography of Mehta is also available at [[Geeta Press]].

For the sake of convenience, the works of Mehta are divided into three categories:
# Autobiographical compositions: ''Putra Vivah/Shamaldas no Vivah'', ''Mameru/Kunvarbai nu Mameru'', ''Hundi'', ''Har Mala'', ''Jhari Na Pada'', and compositions depicting acceptance of [[Harijan]]s. These works deal with the incidents from the poet's life and reveal how he encountered the divine in various guises. They consist of 'miracles' showing how god helped his devotee Narsinh in the time of crises.<ref name=":0" />
# Miscellaneous Narratives: ''Chaturis'', ''Sudama Charit'', ''Dana Leela'', and episodes based on Srimad Bhagwatam. These are the earliest examples of akhyana or narrative type of compositions found in Gujarati. These include:
## ''Chaturis'', 52 compositions resembling Jaydeva's masterpiece Geeta Govinda dealing with various erotic exploits of Radha and Krishna.
## ''Dana Leela'' poems dealing with the episodes of Krishna collecting his dues (dana is toll, tax or dues) from [[Gopi]]s who were going to sell buttermilk etc. to Mathura.
## ''Sudama Charit'' is a narrative describing the well-known story of Krishna and [[Sudama]].
## ''Govinda Gamana'' or the "Departure of Govind" relates the episode of [[Akrura]] taking away Krishna from Gokul.
## ''Surata Sangrama'', The Battle of Love, depicts in terms of a battle the amorous play between Radha and her girl friends on the one side and Krishna and his friends on the other.
## Miscellaneous episodes from Bhagwatam like the birth of Krishna, his childhood pranks and adventures.
# ''Songs of Sringar''. These are hundreds of padas dealing with the erotic adventures and the amorous exploits of Radha and Krishna like Ras Leela. Various clusters of padas like Rasasahasrapadi and Sringar Mala fall under this head. Their dominant note is erotic (Sringar). They deal with stock erotic situations like the ossified Nayaka-Nayika Bheda of classical Sanskrit [[Kavya]] poetics.<ref name="nm"/>

==In popular culture==
The first [[Gujarati cinema|Gujarati talkie film]], ''[[Narsinh Mehta (1932 film)|Narsinh Mehta]]'' (1932) directed by Nanubhai Vakil was based on Narsinh Mehta's life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/comment-gujarati-cinema-a-battle-for-relevance-1777960|title=Gujarati cinema: A battle for relevance|date=16 December 2012}}</ref> It was devoid of any miracles due to Gandhian influence. The bilingual film ''Narsi Mehta'' in Hindi and ''[[Narsi Bhagat]]'' in Gujarati (1940) directed by Vijay Bhatt included miracles and had paralleled Mehta with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. ''Narsi Bhagat'', an Indian Hindi-language biographical film by [[Devendra Goel]] released in 1957. The soundtrack from the film, with music by [[Ravi Shankar Sharma]] and lyrics by [[Gopal Singh Nepali]], became popular especially the song "Darshan Do Ghanshyam" (which was [[Controversial issues surrounding Slumdog Millionaire#Gopal Singh Nepali|misattributed to the poet Surdas]] in the 2008 film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]])''.<ref>{{cite web|date=18 August 2009|title=Slumdog makers in a spot over quiz answer – Mumbai – DNA|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_slumdog-makers-in-a-spot-over-quiz-answer_1283171|work=Daily News and Analysis|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> This was followed by ''Bhagat Narsinh Mehta'', an Indian Gujarati-language film directed by Vijay B.
