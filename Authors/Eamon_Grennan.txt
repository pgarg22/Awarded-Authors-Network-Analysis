'''Eamon Grennan''' (born 1941) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[poet]] born in [[Dublin]]. He has lived in the [[United States]], except for brief periods, since 1964. He was the Dexter M. Ferry Jr. Professor of English at [[Vassar College]] until his retirement in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/eamon-grennan|title=Biography|access-date=July 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Biography==
Though his [[Irish literature|Irish roots]] are clear in his poetry, Grennan has an international sense of literary tradition. He has cited as influences American poets including [[Robert Frost]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]] (herself an international poet with ties to the U.S., [[Canadian literature|Canada]], and [[Literature of Brazil|Brazil]]). In addition to writing poetry, he has translated [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and—with his wife, Vassar [[Ancient Greek literature|classicist]] Rachel Kitzinger—[[Sophocles]]'s [[Oedipus at Colonus]].

[[Grennan]] studied at [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|University College, Dublin]], where he met poets [[Derek Mahon]] and [[Eavan Boland]], and at [[Harvard University]], and began teaching at Vassar in 1974. He returned to Ireland fairly briefly, first in 1977 and later in 1981, and began writing poetry there. His first book, ''Wildly for Days'', was published in 1983. [[Modern literature in Irish|Gaelic poetry]] became an important influence, particularly, he has said, on the sound of his poems. At the same time, he is interested in the sentence as a poetic unit as well as a prose unit. In an interview with Timothy Cahill, Grennan said:
: I have, it's a toothache quality, a kind of pain -- the ambition to make a sentence that is full, that has not gone limp, hasn't stopped while it still has some elasticity in it.
Grennan's career has been long, productive and distinguished, and he has earned from fellow poets a reputation for lyrical skill and psychological intensity. Former U.S. [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate]] [[Billy Collins]] said of Grennan:
: Few poets are as generous as Eamon Grennan in the sheer volume of delight his poems convey, and fewer still are as attentive to the marvels of the earth. To read him is to be led on a walk through the natural world of clover and cricket and, most of all, light, and to face with an open heart the complexity of being human.

He received the [[PEN Award for Poetry in Translation]] in 1998. Grennan was nominated for the 2008 [[Poetry Now Award]] for his collection, ''Out of Breath''.
