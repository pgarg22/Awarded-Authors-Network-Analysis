'''Thomas Tusser''' (c. 1524{{snd}}3 May 1580) was an English poet and farmer, best known for his instructional poem ''Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry'', an expanded version of his original title, ''A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie'', first published in 1557. For Tusser the garden was the domain of the housewife, and the 1562 text expands on this theme. Scholars also consider it a text of interest for its defense of [[enclosure]]s. It was among the best selling poetry books of the [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan]] age.<ref>Samson, Alexander. ''Locus Amoenus: Gardens and Horticulture in the Renaissance'', 2012 :3</ref>

==Early life==
Tusser was born in [[Rivenhall]], Essex, about 1524, the son of William and Isabella Tusser.  At a very early age he became a [[chorister]] in the St Nicholas collegiate chapel at [[Wallingford Castle]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]]. He appears to have been pressed for service in the [[King's Chapel]], the choristers of which were usually afterwards placed by the king in one of the royal foundations at [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]]. But Tusser entered the choir of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], and from there went to [[Eton College]]. He has left a quaint account of his privations at Wallingford, and of the severities of [[Nicholas Udall]] at Eton.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was elected to [[King's College, Cambridge]] in 1543, a date which sets the earliest limit of his birth-year, as he would have been ineligible at nineteen. From King's College he moved to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=TSR543T|name=Tusser, Thomas}}</ref> On leaving Cambridge, he went to court in the service of [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget]] of Beaudesart, as a musician. After ten years of life at court, he married and settled as a farmer at Cattawade, [[Suffolk]], near the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Literary career==
There he wrote ''A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie'', a long poem in rhyming couplets recording the country year. This work was first printed in London in 1557 by the publisher [[Richard Tottel]], and was frequently reprinted. Tottel published an enlarged edition ''Five Hundreth Pointes of Good Husbandrie'' in 1573.  Tusser includes a homely mix of instructions and observations about farming and country customs which offer insight into life in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] England, and his work records many terms and [[proverb]]s in print for the first time.  In this work, he also famously presents ten characteristics the perfect cheese must have:
<blockquote>
Not like [[Gehazi]], i.e., dead white, like a leper<br />
Not like [[Lot's wife]], all salt<br />
Not like [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]], full of eyes<br />
Not like Tom Piper, "hoven and puffed"<br />
Not like [[Crispin]], leathery<br />
Not like [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus]], poor<br />
Not like [[Esau]], hairy<br />
Not like [[Mary Magdalene]], full of whey or maudlin<br />
Not like the [[Gentile]]s, full of maggots<br />
Not like a [[Bishop]], made of burnt milk<ref>Thomas Tusser, ''Five Hundred Good Points of Husbandry'' (1573) as quoted in Ben Schott, ''Schott's Mischellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), November 7.</ref><br />
</blockquote>

He never remained long in one place. For his wife's health he removed to [[Ipswich]]. 
After her death he married again, and farmed for some time at [[West Dereham]]. He then became a singing man in [[Norwich Cathedral]], where he found a good patron in the dean, [[John Salisbury (bishop)|John Salisbury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Samples===
''Five Hundred Points'' contains these rhyming couplets:
<blockquote>
''Swéete April showers,''<br />
''Doo spring Maie flowers.''<ref>Tusser, Thomas (1573, 1577, 1580). Payne, W.; Herrtage, Sidney J., eds. ''Five Hundred Pointes of Good Husbandrie'' (1878 ed.).

as well as

<blockquote>
''At Christmas play and make good cheere,''<br />
''for Christmas comes but once a yeere.''<ref>Tusser, Thomas (1573, 1577, 1580). Payne, W.; Herrtage, Sidney J., eds. ''Five Hundred Pointes of Good Husbandrie'' (1878 ed.). London: Trǔbner & Co. for the English Dialect Society</ref>

and

<blockquote>
''A foole and his monie be soone at debate,''<br />
''which after with sorrow repents him too late.''<ref>Tusser, Thomas (1573, 1577, 1580). Payne, W.; Herrtage, Sidney J., eds. ''Five Hundred Pointes of Good Husbandrie'' (1878 ed.).

The latter is an early version of the [[proverb]] ''A fool and his money are soon parted.''<ref>{{cite journal | last = Terry | first = F. C.

==Later life==
After another experiment in farming at [[Fairstead, Essex|Fairstead]], Essex, he moved once again to London, whence he was driven by the plague of 1572–1573 to find refuge at Trinity Hall, being matriculated as a servant of the college in 1573. At the time of his death he was in possession of a small estate at [[Chesterton, Cambridge|Chesterton]], Cambridgeshire, and his will proves that he was not, as has sometimes been stated, in poverty of any kind, but had in some measure the thrift he preached. [[Thomas Fuller]] says he "traded at large in oxen, sheep, dairies, grain of all kinds, to no profit"; that he "spread his bread with all sorts of butter, yet none would stick thereon."{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Death==
Tusser died on 3 May 1580 at the age of about 55. An erroneous inscription at [[Manningtree]], Essex, asserts that he was 65 years old.

According to [[John Stow]]'s ''[[Survey of London]]'', Cheape Ward, Thomas Tusser was buried in the now lost church of [[St Mildred, Poultry|St Mildred in the Poultry]].<ref>Thoms 1876, 98–99: the fact is also noted from Stow in [[William Hone]]'s ''Every-Day Book'' (London 1830), p. 285 (20 February).</ref> The inscription on his tomb there was as follows:
<blockquote>
"Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie,<br />
That sometime made the pointes of Husbandrie;<br />
By him then learne thou maiest; here learne we must,<br />
When all is done, we sleepe, and turne to dust:<br />
And yet, through Christ, to Heaven we hope to goe;<br />
Who reades his bookes, shall find his faith was so."
</blockquote>
Stow's editor<ref>Thoms 1876, p. 99, n.</ref> adds the following epigram on Tusser from a volume called ''The More the Merrier'' (1608), by 'H. P.':
<blockquote>
''Ad Tusserum''<br />
"Tusser, they tell me, when thou wert alive,<br />
Thou, teaching thrift, thyselfe couldst never thrive.<br />
So, like the whetstone, many men are wont<br />
To sharpen others, when themselves are blunt."
</blockquote>
