==Works==
*[https://archive.org/details/thucydidesmythis00cornuoft ''Thucydides Mythistoricus''] (1907) put the argument that [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' was informed by Thucydides's [[tragic]] view.
*''[[iarchive:in.ernet.dli.2015.179784/page/n3|From Religion to Philosophy: A Study in the Origins of Western Speculation]]'' (1912) sought the deep religious and social concepts that informed the early Greek philosophers. He returned to this in ''Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought'' (posthumous, 1952).
*''[[Microcosmographia Academica]]'' (1908) was an insider's satire on academic politics. It was the source of catch phrases such as the "doctrine of unripeness of time", the "principle of the wedge" and the "principle of the dangerous precedent".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Wilby |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Wilby |date=4 May 2009 |title=Pass the Sickbag, Alice |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2009/05/women-evidence-tax-fast |magazine=New Statesman |volume=138 |issue=4947 |location=London |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=10 September 2001|title=Slavery Was Theft: We Should Pay |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/154073 |magazine=New Statesman |location=London |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref>

*According to the preface to ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic of Plato]]'', translated with an introduction and notes (OUP, 1941), it "aims at conveying... as much as possible of the thought of the ''Republic'' in the most convenient and least misleading form."
