'''Bāṇabhaṭṭa''' ({{lang-sa|बाणभट्ट}}) was a 7th-century [[Sanskrit]] prose writer and poet of [[India]]. He was the ''Asthana Kavi'' in the court of King [[Harsha Vardhana]], who reigned c. 606–647 CE in north India first from Sthanvishvara ([[Thanesar]]), and later [[Kannauj]]. Bāna's principal works include a biography of Harsha, the ''[[Harshacharita]]'' (Deeds of Harsha),<ref>{{cite web | title = Sthanvishvara (historical region, India) |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/566090/Sthanvishvara | access-date = 2014-08-09 }}</ref> and one of the world's earliest novels, ''[[Kadambari]]''. Bāṇa died before finishing the novel and it was completed by his son Bhūṣaṇabhaṭṭa. Both these works are noted texts of Sanskrit literature.<ref name="Datta1988">{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: devraj to jyoti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1339|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|pages=1339–}}</ref> The other works attributed to him are the ''Caṇḍikāśataka'' and a drama, the ''Pārvatīpariṇaya''. Banabhatta gets an applause as "banochhistam jagatsarvam" meaning Bana has described everything in this world and nothing is left.

==Life==
A detailed account regarding his ancestry and early life can be reconstructed from the introductory verses attached to the ''कादम्बरी'' and the first two ''ucchāvasas'' of the ''Harṣacarita'', while the circumstances behind the composition of the ''Harṣacarita'' are described in the third ''ucchāvasa'' of the text. ''Harsacarita'' is considered as the first Indian work which may be regarded as a historical biography. It gives a vivid picture of life in the countryside.<ref>Sreedharan, E, "A Manual of Historical Research Methodology."

Bāna was born to Chitrabhānu and Rājadevi in the village of Pritikuta on the banks of the Hiraṇyavāhu in a [[Bhojaka]] family of [[Vātsyāyana]] [[gotra]] in the current district of [[AURANGABAD,BARUN,SONE RIVER]] in modern-day [[Bihar]]. After the death of his father, Bāṇa led a wandering life for a period but later came back to his native village. Here, on a summer day, on receiving a letter from Krishna, a cousin of King Harsha, he met the king while he was camping near the town of Manitara. After receiving Bāna with mock signs of anger, the king showed him much favor.
