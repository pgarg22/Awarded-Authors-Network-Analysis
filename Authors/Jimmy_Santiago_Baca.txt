'''Jimmy Santiago Baca''' (born January 2, 1952) is an American poet, memoirist, and screenwriter from [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://comptonherald.org/jimmy-santiago-baca-college-speaker/|title= Jimmy Santiago Baca, Compton College guest speaker|date= October 15, 2018|work= Compton Herald}}</ref><ref>Some editions of Baca's work (e.g. ''Winter Poems Along the Rio Grande'' (2004) include references to Apache descent in biographical information, and collections such as ''Mart√≠n & Meditations on the South Valley'' (1987) include poems in a "detribalized" Apache persona which Denise Levertov describes in her introduction to that work as "semi-autobiographical." However, Baca is not a citizen of the Apache nation and does not claim this identity in more recent autobiographical materials such as on his website.</ref>

== Early life and education ==

Baca was born in [[Santa Fe County, New Mexico]], in 1952. Abandoned by his parents at the age of seven, he lived with one of his grandmothers for several years before being placed in an orphanage. At the age of 14 he ran away and wound up living on the streets. When he was 21, he was convicted on charges of drug dealing and incarcerated. He served six and a half years in prison, three of them in isolation, and having expressed a desire to go to school (the guards considered this dangerous), he was put in the same area of the prison with the inmates on [[death row]] for a period of time before he was released.<ref name="progessive2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/radio/baca09.html|title=The Progressive Radio Show|access-date=2009-02-19}}</ref>

During this time, Baca taught himself to read and write, and he began to compose poetry. He sold these poems to fellow inmates in exchange for cigarettes. A fellow inmate convinced him to submit some of his poems to the magazine ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', then edited by [[Denise Levertov]]. Levertov printed Baca's poems and began corresponding with him, eventually finding a publisher for his first book.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-09-08|title=Jimmy Santiago Baca|url=https://www.ndbooks.com/author/jimmy-baca/|access-date=2020-12-24|website=www.ndbooks.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
''Immigrants in Our Own Land'', Baca's first major collection, was published by the [[Louisiana State University Press]] in 1979.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Immigrants in our own land : poems|last=Baca, Jimmy Santiago, 1952-|date=1979|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807105724|location=Baton Rouge}}</ref> This early collection included "[[I Am Offering This Poem]],"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Immigrants in our own land : poems|last=Baca, Jimmy Santiago, 1952-|date=1979|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807105724|location=Baton Rouge|pages=52|oclc=4775791}}</ref> a poem later reprinted in 1990's ''Immigrants in Our Own Land and Selected Early Poems''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/immigrantsinouro00baca|title=Immigrants in our own land & selected early poems|last=Baca, Jimmy Santiago, 1952-|date=1990|publisher=New Directions|isbn=0811211452|location=New York|oclc=21670326|url-access=registration}}</ref> and anthologized in ''The Seagull Book of Poems''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The seagull book of poems|others=Kelly, Joseph, 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780393631623|edition=Fourth|location=New York|oclc=1006521218}}</ref>''.'' In 1987, his semi-autobiographical minor epic in verse, ''[[Martin & Meditations on the South Valley]]'', received the [[American Book Award]] for poetry, bringing Baca international acclaim and, in 1989, the [[Hispanic Heritage Foundation|Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hispanic Heritage Awards for Literature|url=http://www.hispanicheritage.org/hispanic_search.php?name=&opt2=10&opt3=0&x=6&y=10|publisher=Hispanic Heritage Foundation|access-date=January 11, 2011}}</ref>
