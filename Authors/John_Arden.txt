'''John Arden''' (26 October 1930 – 28 March 2012) was an English  playwright who at his death was lauded as "one of the most significant British playwrights of the late 1950s and early 60s".<ref name=Coveney/>

==Career==
Born in [[Barnsley]], son of the manager of a glass factory, he was educated at [[Sedbergh School]] in Cumbria, [[King's College, Cambridge]] and the [[Edinburgh College of Art]], where he studied architecture.<ref name="John Arden">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/theatre-obituaries/9177000/John-Arden.html|title=John Arden|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2012-03-30|access-date=2019-01-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> He first gained critical attention for the [[radio play]] ''The Life of Man'' in 1956 shortly after finishing his studies.

Arden was initially associated with the English Stage Company at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London. His 1959 play, ''[[Serjeant Musgrave's Dance]]'', in which four army deserters arrive in a northern mining town to exact retribution for an act of colonial violence, is considered to be his best{{by whom|date=October 2019}}. His work was influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Epic Theatre]] as in ''Left-Handed Liberty'' (1965, on the anniversary of [[Magna Carta]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05wynm1|title=BBC Radio 3 - Sunday Feature, Left-Handed Liberty}}</ref> Other plays include ''Live Like Pigs'', ''The Workhouse Donkey'', and ''Armstrong's Last Goodnight'', the last of which was performed at the 1963 Chichester Festival by the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] after it was rejected by the Royal Court.<ref name=Coveney>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Coveney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/30/john-arden?CMP=twt_fd|title=Obituary: John Arden|work=The Guardian|date=30 March 2012|access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref>

His 1978 radio play ''[[Pearl (Radio Play)|Pearl]]'' was considered in a ''Guardian'' survey<ref>[http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/jarden.html John Arden's Radio Plays]; retrieved 9 October 2009</ref> to be one of the best plays in that medium. He also wrote several novels, including ''Silence Among the Weapons'', which was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1982,<ref>[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/authors/116 "John Arden"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103846/http://themanbookerprize.com/prize/authors/116 |date=21 May 2011 }}, Man Booker Prize website</ref> and ''Books of Bale'', about the [[Protestant]] apologist [[John Bale]]. He was a member of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].<ref name="John Arden"/>

With his wife and co-writer [[Margaretta D'Arcy]] he picketed the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] premiere of his [[Arthurian]] play ''The Island of the Mighty'', because they thought the production was pro-imperialist, and they wrote several plays together which were highly critical of British presence in Ireland, where he and D'Arcy lived from 1971 onward.<ref name=Coveney/>

In 1961, he was a founder member of the anti-nuclear [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], and he also chaired the pacifist weekly ''[[Peace News]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/jan/03/theatre.stage|title=Profile: John Arden|last=Wroe|first=Nicholas|date=2004-01-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In Ireland, he was for a while a member of [[Official Sinn Féin]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Obituaries in the performing arts, 2012|last=III.|first=Lentz, Harris M.|date=2013|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc|isbn=9781476603858|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=841416459}}</ref> He was an advocate of civil liberties, and opposed anti-terror legislation, as demonstrated in his 2007 radio play ''The Scam''.<ref name=":0" />
