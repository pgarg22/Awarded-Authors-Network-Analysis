'''Louis Aragon''' ({{IPA-fr|lwi aʁaɡɔ̃|lang}}, {{Pronunciation|Fr-Louis Aragon.ogg}}, 3 October 1897 – 24 December 1982) was a French poet who was one of the leading voices of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] movement in France. He co-founded with [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]] the surrealist review ''[[Littérature (magazine)|Littérature]]''.<ref name="Travers2001">{{cite book|author=Martin Travers|title=European Literature from Romanticism to Postmodernism: A Reader in Aesthetic Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlcnxCx1ZM4C&pg=PA176|year=2001|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-4748-7|pages=176–}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Louis Aragon {{!}} French author|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Aragon|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Louis Aragon|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095421109|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Oxford Reference|language=en}}</ref> He was also a novelist and editor, a long-time member of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] and a member of the [[Académie Goncourt]].

== Early life (1897–1939) ==
{{French literature sidebar}}
Louis Aragon was born in Paris. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, believing them to be his sister and foster mother, respectively. His biological father, [[:fr:Louis Andrieux|Louis Andrieux]], a former senator for [[Forcalquier]], was married and thirty years older than Aragon's mother, whom he seduced when she was seventeen. Aragon's mother passed Andrieux off to her son as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2020-10-19|title=Louis Aragon|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/louis-aragon|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Louis Aragon {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/french-literature-biographies/louis-aragon|access-date=2020-10-19|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> Aragon was only told the truth at the age of 19, as he was leaving to serve in the [[First World War]], from which neither he nor his parents believed he would return. Andrieux's refusal or inability to recognize his son would influence Aragon's poetry later on.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Having been involved in [[Dada]]ism from 1919 to 1924, he became a founding member of [[Surrealism]] in 1924,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lblcBR7uDoYC&q=louis%20aragon%20dadaism%201919%201924&pg=PA71|title=The Facts on File Companion to World Poetry: 1900 to the Present|last=Arana|first=R. Victoria|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108377|pages=71|language=en}}</ref> with [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]] under the pen-name "Aragon". {{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In the 1920s, Aragon became a [[fellow traveller]] of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) along with several other surrealists, and joined the Party in January 1927.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/leonard-lauder-research-center/research/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/aragon|access-date=2021-10-14|website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>

In 1933, he began to write for the party's newspaper, ''[[L'Humanité]]'', in the "news in brief" section. He would remain a member for the rest of his life, writing several political poems including one to [[Maurice Thorez]], the general secretary of the PCF. During the [[World Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture]] (1935), Aragon opposed his former friend André Breton, who wanted to use the opportunity as a tribune to defend the writer [[Victor Serge]], associated with [[Leon Trotsky]]'s [[Left Opposition]].<ref name=":1" />

Aragon was also critical of the [[USSR]], particularly after the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1956) during which [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[personality cult]] was [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced]] by [[Nikita Khrushchev]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

The French surrealists had long claimed [[Lewis Carroll]] as one of their own, and Aragon published his translation of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''<ref>''La Chasse au Snark'', Pierre Seghers, Paris 1949</ref> in 1929, "shortly before he completed his transition from Snarxism to Marxism", as [[Martin Gardner]] puts it.<ref>''The Annotated Snark'', edited by Martin Gardner, Penguin Books, 1974</ref> Witness the key stanza of the poem in Aragon's translation:

{{cquote|''Ils le traquèrent avec des gobelets ils le traquèrent avec soin''<br />
''Ils le poursuivirent avec des fourches et de l'espoir''<br />
''Ils menacèrent sa vie avec une action de chemin de fer''<br />
''Ils le charmèrent avec des sourires et du savon''}}

Gardner, who calls the translation "pedestrian" and deems the rest of Aragon's writings on Carroll's nonsense poetry full of factual errors, says that there is no evidence that Aragon intended any of it as a joke.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

=== The ''Commune'' (1933–1939) ===

Apart from working as a journalist for ''L'Humanité'', Louis Aragon also became, along with [[Paul Nizan]], editor secretary of the journal ''[[Commune (journal)|Commune]]'', published by the ''[[Association des Écrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires]]'' (Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists), which aimed at gathering intellectuals and artists in a common front [[anti-fascism|against fascism]]. Aragon became a member of the directing committee of the ''Commune'' journal in January 1937, along with [[André Gide]], [[Romain Rolland]] and [[Paul Vaillant-Couturier]]. The journal then took the name of "French literary review for the defence of culture" (''« revue littéraire française pour la défense de la culture »''). With Gide's withdrawal in August 1937, Vaillant-Couturier's death in autumn 1937 and Romain Rolland's old age, Aragon became its effective director. In December 1938, he called as [[chief editor]] the young writer [[Jacques Decour]]. The ''Commune'' journal was strongly involved in the mobilization of French intellectuals in favor of the [[Spanish Second Republic|Spanish Republic]].{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

=== Director of ''Ce soir'' (1937–1953) ===

In March 1937, Aragon was called on by the PCF to head the new evening daily, ''[[Ce soir]]'', which he was charged with launching, along with the writer [[Jean-Richard Bloch]]. ''Ce soir'' attempted to compete with ''[[Paris-Soir]]''. Outlawed in August 1939, ''Ce soir'' was re-opened after the Liberation, and Aragon again became its lead, first with Bloch then alone after Bloch's death in 1947. The newspaper, which counted [[Emile Danoën]] among its collaborators, closed in March 1953.

== World War II (1939–1945) ==

In 1939, he married Russian-born author [[Elsa Triolet]], the sister of [[Lilya Brik]], a mistress and then partner of Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Elsa Triolet and Aragon|url=https://www.maison-triolet-aragon.com/elsa-triolet-and-louis-aragon|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> He had met her in 1928, and she became his [[muse]] starting in the 1940s. Aragon and Triolet collaborated in the [[French Left|left-wing French]] media before and during World War II, going underground for most of the [[Vichy France|German occupation]].<ref name=":0" />

Aragon was mobilized in 1939, and awarded the ''[[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]'' (War Cross) and the military medal for acts of bravery. After the [[Battle of France|May 1940 defeat]], he took refuge in the [[Vichy France|Southern Zone]]. He was one of several poets, along with [[René Char]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Jean Prévost]], [[Jean-Pierre Rosnay]], etc., to join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], both through literary activities and as an actual organizer of Resistance acts.

[[Otto Abetz]] was the German governor, and produced a series of "black lists" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Aragon and [[André Malraux]] were both on these "Otto Lists" of forbidden authors.<ref>Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21–22.</ref>

During the war, Aragon wrote for the underground press ''[[Les Éditions de Minuit]]'' and was a member of the [[National Front (Resistance)|National Front]] Resistance movement. His poetry was published along texts by Vercors ([[Jean Bruller]]), [[Pierre Seghers]] or [[Paul Éluard|Paul Eluard]] in Switzerland in 1943 after being smuggled out of occupied France by his friend and publisher [[François Lachenal]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONJXAAAAYAAJ&q=fran%C3%A7ois+lachenal+luis+aragon|title=Livres hebdo|date=1995|publisher=Éditions professionelles du livre.|isbn=9782877302500|language=fr}}</ref>

He participated with his wife in the setting-up of the National Front of Writers in the Southern Zone. This activism led him to break his friendly relationship with [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle]], who had chosen [[Collaborationism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Along with Paul Éluard, [[Pierre Seghers]] and [[René Char]], Aragon would maintain the memory of the Resistance in his post-war poems. He thus wrote, in 1954, ''[[L'affiche rouge (Poem)|Strophes pour se souvenir]]'' in commemoration of the role of foreigners in the Resistance, which celebrated the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigrée]]'' (FTP-MOI).

The theme of the poem was the [[Affiche Rouge|Red Poster]] affair, mainly the last letter that [[Missak Manouchian]], an Armenian-French poet and Resistant, wrote to his wife [[Mélinée Manouchian|Mélinée]] before his execution on 21 February 1944.<ref>Mélinée Manouchian: ''Manouchian'', EFR, Paris 1954</ref> This poem was then set to music by [[Léo Ferré]].

== After the war ==

At the Liberation, Aragon became one of the leading Communist intellectuals, assuming political responsibilities in the ''[[Comité national des écrivains]]'' (National Committee of Writers). He celebrated the role of the general secretary of the PCF, [[Maurice Thorez]], and defended the [[Kominform]]'s condemnation of the [[Titoist]] regime in [[Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2019-06-10|title=Louis Aragon, Surrealist Poet and Communist|url=https://www.headstuff.org/culture/history/terrible-people-from-history/louis-aragon-surrealist-poet-and-communist/|access-date=2020-10-19|website=HeadStuff|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Sponsored by Thorez, Aragon was elected, in 1950, to the central committee of the PCF. His post, however, did not protect him from all forms of criticism. Thus, when his journal, ''Les Lettres françaises'', published a drawing by [[Pablo Picasso]] on the occasion of Stalin's death in March 1953, Aragon was forced to make excuses to his critics, who judged the drawing iconoclastic. Through the years, he had been kept informed of [[Stalinist]] repression by his Russian-born wife, and so his political line evolved.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<ref name=":2" />

=== ''Les Lettres françaises'' (1953–1972) ===

In the days following the disappearance of ''Ce soir'', in March 1953, Aragon became the director of ''L'Humanité'' 's literary supplement, ''[[French Letters|Les Lettres françaises]]''. Assisted by its chief editor, [[Pierre Daix]], Aragon started in the 1960s a struggle against [[Stalinism]] and its consequences in Eastern Europe. He published the writings of dissidents such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] or [[Milan Kundera]]. The monetary loss caused by ''Les Lettres françaises'' led to its ceasing publication in 1972. It was later re-founded.

In 1956, Aragon supported the [[Budapest insurrection]], provoking the dissolution of the ''Comité national des écrivains'', which [[Vercors (writer)|Vercors]] quit. The same year, he was nevertheless granted the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. He now harshly condemned Soviet totalitarianism, opened his magazines to dissidents, and condemned [[show trial]]s against intellectuals (in particular the 1966 [[Sinyavsky-Daniel trial]]). He strongly supported the student movement of [[May '68]], although the PCF was skeptical about it. The crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 led him to a critical preface published in a translation of one of [[Milan Kundera]]'s books (''La Plaisanterie'').<ref>French: ''« Et voilà qu'une fin de nuit, au transistor, nous avons entendu la condamnation de nos illusions perpétuelles... »''</ref> Despite his criticisms, Aragon remained an official member of the PCF's central committee until his death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

=== The publisher ===

Beside his journalistic activities, Louis Aragon was also CEO of the ''[[Editeurs français réunis]]'' (EFR) publishing house, heir of two publishing houses founded by the Resistance, ''La Bibliothèque française'' and ''Hier et Aujourd'hui''. He directed the EFR along with [[Madeleine Braun]], and in the 1950s published French and Soviet writers commonly related to the "[[Socialist Realism]]" current. Among other works, the EFR published [[André Stil]]'s ''Premier choc'', which owed to the future [[Goncourt Academy|Goncourt Academician]] the [[Stalin Peace Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1953. But they also published other writers, such as [[Julius Fučík (journalist)|Julius Fučík]], [[Vítězslav Nezval]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Yánnis Rítsos]] or [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]. In the beginning of the 1960s, the EFR brought to public knowledge the works of non-Russian Soviet writers, such as [[Tchinguiz Aïtmatov]], or Russian writers belong to the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], such as [[Galina Nicolaëva]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]'s ''Babi Iar'' in 1967, etc. The EFR also published the first novel of [[Christa Wolf]] in 1964, and launched the poetic collection ''Petite sirène'', which collected works by [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Eugène Guillevic]], [[Nicolás Guillén]], but also less known poets such as [[Dominique Grandmont]], [[Alain Lance]] or [[Jean Ristat]].

=== Back to surrealism ===

Free from both his marital and editorial responsibilities (having ended publication of ''[[Les Lettres Françaises]]'' — ''[[L'Humanité]]'''s literary supplement – in 1972), Aragon was free to return to his surrealist roots. During the last ten years of his life, he published at least two further novels: ''[[Henri Matisse Roman]]'' and ''[[Les Adieux]]''.

Louis Aragon died on 24 December 1982, his friend [[Jean Ristat]] sitting up with him. He was buried in the parc of [[Moulin de Villeneuve]], in his property of [[Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines]], alongside his wife Elsa Triolet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gale Cengage|title=Modern French Poets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsoUAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-7876-5252-4|page=32}}</ref>

He was and still is a popular poet in France because many of his poems have been set to music and sung by various composers and singers : [[Lino Léonardi]], [[Hélène Martin]], [[Léo Ferré]] (the first one to dedicate an entire LP to Aragon, with his 1961 breakthrough ''[[Les Chansons d'Aragon]]'' album), [[Jean Ferrat]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Alain Barrière]], [[Isabelle Aubret]], [[Nicole Rieu]], [[Monique Morelli]], [[Marc Ogeret]], [[Marjo Tal]], et al. Many of his poems put into music by Jean Ferrat have been translated into German by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser) and are sung by his Duo.
