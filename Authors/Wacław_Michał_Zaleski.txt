'''Wacław Michał Zaleski''' (8 September 1799 in [[Olesko]], eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] – 24 February 1849 in [[Vienna]]), pseudonym ''Wacław from Olesko'' ({{lang-pl|Wacław z Oleska}}), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[nobleman]], poet, writer, researcher of folklore, theatre critic, political activist, and governor of Galicia (1848). Galician landowner and deputy to the Parliament.

His sons were [[Filip Zaleski]] - the governor of Galicia and the member of the Austrian House of Lords, and Antoni (1842-1866, writer) and Józef Mieczysław (1838-1899, cavalryman, later commander of the division and field marshal), married to Martyna Grabianszczanka from Ostapkowce.

Zaleski collected and published in [[Lviv]] ''Pieśni polskie i ruskie ludu galicyjskiego'' (Polish and Russian songs of the Galician Nation; 1833), which contained about 1,500 works, including 160 with piano accompaniment composed by [[Karol Lipiński]]. It was the largest collection of folk songs published in Poland before [[Oskar Kolberg]].

Zaleski was an author of patriotic songs, paraphrases, translations of Ukrainian [[duma (epic)|duma]]s and never-published stage works.

His grandson - austrian Minister [[Wacław Michal Artur Zaleski]] obtained the hereditary title of Austrian Count from Emperor Franz-Josef.
