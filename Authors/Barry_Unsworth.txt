''' Barry Unsworth''' [[FRSL]] (10 August 1930{{spaced ndash}}4 June 2012) was an English writer known for his historical fiction. He published 17 novels, and was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]] three times, winning once for the 1992 novel ''[[Sacred Hunger]]''.

==Biography==
Unsworth was born on 10 August 1930<ref>Some sources say 8 August</ref> in [[Wingate, County Durham|Wingate]], a mining village in [[County Durham]], England, to a family of miners.<ref name=flood/><ref name=crossen/> His father first entered the mines at age 12 and ordinarily Unsworth would have followed him as a [[miner]]. However, when his father was 19, he travelled to the United States for a few years and on returning to Britain entered the insurance business and thus began moving his family up the economic ladder and out of the mines.<ref name=crossen/> "He rescued my brother and me from that long chain of continuity that happens in mining villages," Unsworth said.<ref name=crossen/>

He graduated from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1951, and lived in France for a year teaching English. He also travelled extensively in [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] during the 1960s, lecturing at the [[University of Athens]] and the [[University of Istanbul]].<ref name=flood/> His novels about [[fin-de-siecle]] [[Ottoman Empire]], ''The Rage of the Vulture'' and ''[[Pascali's Island (novel)|Pascali's Island]]'', were inspired by these experiences. He published his first novel in 1966, his second novel, ''[[The Greeks Have a Word For It]]'', was an outgrowth of his teaching experience in Athens.

In 1999 he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Iowa]]'s [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. In 2004 he taught literature and creative writing classes at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Ohio]].

In the last years of his life, he lived in [[Perugia]], a city in the [[Umbria]] region of Italy, with his second wife, a Finnish national. His novel ''After Hannibal'' is a fictionalised description of his efforts at settlement in the Italian countryside.

Unsworth died in Perugia, Italy in 2012, of lung cancer.<ref name=flood>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/barry-unsworth-booker-prizewinner-dies |author=Alison Flood |date=8 June 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Barry Unsworth, Booker prizewinner, dies at 81 |access-date=8 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=crossen/><ref>Fox, Margalit (7 June 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/books/barry-unsworth-historical-novelist-dies-at-81.html?

Unsworth died the same day as [[Ray Bradbury]]; as [[Cynthia Crossen]] said in the ''Wall Street Journal'', "Mr. Bradbury invented the future; Mr. Unsworth invented the past."<ref name=crossen>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303734204577466801039528644 |author=Cynthia Crossen |date=18 June 2012 |title=A Tribute to Barry Unsworth |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=22 June 2012}}</ref>

==Work==
Unsworth's first novel, ''[[The Partnership (novel)|The Partnership]]'', was published in 1966 when he was 36. "...in my earlier novels, especially the two written in the early '70s, ''The Hide'' and ''Mooncranker's Gift'', there was a baroque quality in the style, a density. The mood was grim, but the language was more figurative and more high-spirited. There was more delight in it, more self-indulgence, too. Among my earliest influences as a writer were the American novelists of the deep south, especially Eudora Welty, and some of that elated, grotesque comedy stayed with me." ''[[Mooncranker's Gift]]'' (1973) won the [[Heinemann Award]]. Other novels included ''[[Stone Virgin]]'' (1985) and ''[[Losing Nelson]]'' (1999). In addition to [[Eudora Welty]], he counted [[William Faulkner]] and [[Carson McCullers]] as his major influences.

Unsworth did not start to write historical fiction until his sixth novel, ''[[Pascali's Island (novel)|Pascali's Island]]'' (1980), the first of his novels to be shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]]. ''Pascali's Island'' is set on an unnamed Aegean island during the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Reflecting on this shift, Unsworth explained: "Nowadays I go to Britain relatively rarely and for short periods; in effect, I have become an expatriate. The result has been a certain loss of interest in British life and society and a very definite loss of confidence in my ability to register the contemporary scene there – the kind of things people say, the styles of dress, the politics etc.– with sufficient subtlety and accuracy. So I have turned to the past. The great advantage of this, for a writer of my temperament at least, is that one is freed from a great deal of surface clutter. One is enabled to take a remote period and use it as a distant mirror (to borrow Barbara Tuchman’s phrase), and so try to say things about our human condition – then and now – which transcend the particular period and become timeless." A [[Pascali's Island (film)|film version]] directed by [[James Dearden]], starring [[Charles Dance]], [[Helen Mirren]] and [[Ben Kingsley]], as the title character, was released in 1988.

''[[Morality Play (novel)|Morality Play]]'', shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1995, is a murder mystery set in 14th century England about a travelling troupe of players that put on Bible plays.<ref name=crossen/> It was adapted as a film, ''[[The Reckoning (2003 film)|The Reckoning]]'' (2003), starring [[Paul Bettany]] and [[Willem Dafoe]].

''[[Sacred Hunger]]'' (1992) centres on the Atlantic slave trade that moves from [[Liverpool]] to West Africa, Florida and the West Indies. It was joint winner of the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1992, along with [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]''. It is generally considered his masterpiece.<ref name=crossen/> The story is set in the mid-18th century and centres around the ''Liverpool Merchant'', a slave ship employed in the [[triangular trade]], a central trade route in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The two main characters are cousins Erasmus Kemp, son of a wealthy merchant from [[Lancashire]], and Matthew Paris, a physician and scientist who goes on the voyage. The novel's central theme is [[greed]], with the subject of [[slavery]] being a primary medium for exploring how selfish desire for profit can result in evil and barbarism.<ref name=crossen/> The "sacred hunger" of the title refers to the [[profit motive]]. The story line has a very extensive cast of characters, some featuring in only one scene, others continually developed throughout the story, but most described in intricate detail. The narrative interweaves elements of appalling cruelty and horror with extended comedic interludes, and employs frequent period expressions. A sequel, ''[[The Quality of Mercy (Unsworth novel)|The Quality of Mercy]]'', was published in 2011, it was his last book.

''[[Sugar and Rum]]'' (1988) was a novel set in contemporary [[Liverpool]] about a writer who is trying to write a novel about the Liverpool slave trade, and who is suffering from [[writer's block]]; Unsworth wrote this novel to try to get over his own block during the writing of ''Sacred Hunger''.

==Style==
Unsworth's style is not heaped in historical minutiae, "I don't really care how many buttons someone had on his waistcoat. It would be good to get it right, but what really matters is trying to get hold of the spirit of the age, what it was like to be alive in that age, what it felt like to be…an ordinary person in the margins of history."<ref name=crossen/>

On writing and growing old, Unsworth said, "With time I have grown more sparing with the words. I think less of fire-works and flourishes. I try to get warmth and colour through precision of language. This is more difficult, I think, which may be why I find writing novels so challenging and exacting."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kwls.org/littoral/intensity_of_ilusiona_conversa/ |title=Intensity of Illusion: a conversation with Barry Unsworth |date=28 June 2008 |work=Littoral |publisher=KWLS (Key West Literary Seminar) |author=Arlo Haskell |access-date=21 June 2012}}</ref>

Some critics have attacked historical fiction as being un-literary, for example [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] writing in ''The New Yorker'' called it a "somewhat gimcrack genre not exactly jammed with greatness."<ref name=crossen/> However Unsworth defended the form, saying "The term historical fiction is a blunt instrument in literary criticism. When people ask, 'Is it a good historical novel?' they may as well ask, 'Is it a good Protestant novel?' or 'Is it a good transvestite novel?' I write stories that are set in the past. Fiction set in the past should be judged by the same criteria as any other fiction. Does the novel convey a sense of life, touch the reader's mind and heart? Does it belong to what [[D.H. Lawrence]] called the one bright book of life?"<ref name=crossen/>
