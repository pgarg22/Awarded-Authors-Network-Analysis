==Critical assessment==

Jon Davis received effusive praise from [[David Foster Wallace]] in an otherwise scathing criticism of prose poetry. Wallace commented "a poet whom this reviewer'd never heard of before but whose pieces in this anthology are so off-the-charts terrific that the reviewer has actually gone out and bought the one Jon Davis book mentioned in his bio-note and may very well decide to try to advertise it in this magazine, at reviewer's own expense if necessaryâ€”that's how good this guy is."<ref>Wallace, David Foster.
