  | quote= ... If you haven't read Diana's other books, look them up in ''Books in Print'': They're good. So good in fact, that when I decided to write the story mentioned at the end of ''[[Mists of Avalon]]''&mdash;about Roman Britain and the Druid priestess Eilan&mdash;it was Diana I chose to collaborate with me on it. Because of marketing decisions, Viking decided my name alone would sell better&mdash;I'm not sure why&mdash;but here among friends, so to speak, I'm happy to acknowledge Diana's help and input. It should be out in April 1994; look for ''The Forest House''. }}</ref>
