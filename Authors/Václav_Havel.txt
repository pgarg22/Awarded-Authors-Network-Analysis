He was the first democratically elected president of either country after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]]. As a writer of [[Czech literature]], he is known for his plays, essays, and memoirs.

His educational opportunities having been limited by his [[bourgeois]] background, when freedoms were limited by the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], Havel first rose to prominence as a playwright. In works such as ''[[The Garden Party (play)|The Garden Party]]'' and ''[[The Memorandum]]'', Havel used an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] style to criticize the Communist system. After participating in the [[Prague Spring]] and being blacklisted after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], he became more politically active and helped found several dissident initiatives, including [[Charter 77]] and the [[Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted]]. His political activities brought him under the surveillance of the [[StB]] secret police, and he spent multiple periods as a [[political prisoner]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barney|first=Timothy|date=2019-10-20|title=Václav Havel at the End of the Cold War: The Invention of Post-Communist Transition in the Address to U.S. Congress, February 21, 1990|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01463373.2019.1668444|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=67|issue=5|pages=560–583|doi=10.1080/01463373.2019.1668444|s2cid=210374087|issn=0146-3373}}</ref> the longest of his imprisoned terms being nearly four years, between 1979 and 1983.

Havel's [[Civic Forum]] party played a major role in the [[Velvet Revolution]] that toppled the Communist system in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He assumed the presidency shortly thereafter, and was re-elected in a landslide the following year and after [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Slovak independence]] in 1993. Havel was instrumental in dismantling the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[enlargement of NATO]] membership eastward. Many of his stances and policies, such as his opposition to Slovak independence, condemnation of the treatment of [[Sudeten Germans]], such as the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] after [[World War II]], and granting of general amnesty to all those imprisoned under the Communist era, were very controversial domestically. By the end of his presidency, he enjoyed greater popularity abroad than at home.

==Early life==
[[File:Vaclav Havel 1965.jpg|thumb|Havel in 1965]]
Havel was born in [[Prague]] on 5 October 1936<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/vaclav-havel|title=Václav Havel obituary|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=W.

His grandfather, Vácslav Havel, a real estate developer, built a landmark entertainment complex on Prague's Wenceslas Square. His father, Václav Maria Havel, was the real estate developer behind the suburban [[Barrandov Terraces]], located on the highest point of Prague—next door to which his uncle, [[Miloš Havel]], built one of the largest film studios in Europe.<ref name="Zantovsky">{{cite book |last=Zantovsky |first=Michael |date=2014 |title=Havel: A Life |url=https://archive.org/details/havellife0000anto/page/16 |location=New York |publisher=Grove Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/havellife0000anto/page/16 16 (family accomplishments), 55 (marriage)] |isbn=9780802123152 }}</ref> Havel's mother, Božena Vavrečková,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3416000082/havel-vaclav-1936.html|title=Havel, Vaclav, Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=18 December 2011}}</ref> also came from an influential family; her father was a Czechoslovak ambassador and a well-known journalist.

In the early 1950s, because of his [[Social class|class background]], Havel entered into a four-year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant and simultaneously took evening classes at a [[Gymnasium (school)#Czech Republic & Slovakia|gymnasium]]. He completed his secondary education in 1954. For political reasons, he was not accepted into any post-secondary school with a humanities program; therefore, he opted for studies at the Faculty of Economics of the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] but dropped out after two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaclavhavel.cz/cs/vaclav-havel/zivotopis/1936-1959 |title=::.Václav Havel.::The official website of Václav Havel, writer, dramatist, dissident, prisoner of conscience, human rights activist, former president of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic |publisher=Vaclavhavel.cz |access-date=2013-11-19}}</ref> On 9 July 1964, Havel married [[Olga Havlová|Olga Šplíchalová]].<ref name="Zantovsky" />

==Early theatre career==
[[File:Václav Havel, Obvestilo, Drama SNG v Ljubljani.jpg|thumb|''[[The Memorandum]]'' by the [[Ljubljana Drama Theatre]] in 1969]]
The intellectual tradition of his family was essential for Havel's lifetime adherence to the humanitarian values of the Czech culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrad.cz/en/president-of-the-cr/former-presidents/vaclav-havel.shtml |title=Václav Havel – Prague Castle |publisher=Hrad.cz |access-date=2013-11-19}}</ref> After finishing his [[military service]] (1957–59), Havel had to bring his intellectual ambitions in line with the given circumstances, especially with the restrictions imposed on him as a descendant of a bourgeois family. He found employment in Prague's theatre world as a [[stagehand]] at Prague's Theatre ABC&nbsp;– ''Divadlo ABC'', and then at the Theatre on Balustrade&nbsp;– ''Divadlo Na zábradlí''. Simultaneously, he was a student of dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the [[Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was ''[[The Garden Party (play)|The Garden Party]]'' (1963). Presented in a series of [[Theatre of the Absurd]], at the Theatre on Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon followed by ''[[The Memorandum]]'', one of his best known plays, and ''[[The Increased Difficulty of Concentration (play)|The Increased Difficulty of Concentration]]'', all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, ''The Memorandum'' was also brought to [[The Public Theater]] in New York, which helped to establish Havel's reputation in the United States. The Public Theater continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel's plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his works.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8964095/Vaclav-Havel.html |title=Václav Havel |newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=2013-11-19}}</ref>

During the first week of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968, Havel assisted the resistance by providing an on-air narrative via Radio Free Czechoslovakia station (at [[Liberec]]). Following the suppression of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968, he was banned from the theatre and became more politically active.<ref>Havel, V. (1975).

He was known for his essays, most particularly ''[[The Power of the Powerless]]'' (1978), in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to "live within a lie" under the Communist regime.<ref>Václav Havel, ''The Power of the Powerless'', in: Václav Havel, et al ''The power of the powerless.

On 29 December 1989, while he was leader of the [[Civic Forum]], Havel became President of Czechoslovakia by a unanimous vote of the [[Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia|Federal Assembly]]. He had long insisted that he was not interested in politics and had argued that political change in the country should be induced through autonomous civic initiatives rather than through the official institutions. In 1990, soon after his election, Havel was awarded the [[Prize For Freedom]] of the [[Liberal International]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal-international.org/editorial.asp?ia_id=707|title=Václav Havel (1990)|publisher=Liberal-international.org|access-date=2 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026170223/http://www.liberal-international.org/editorial.asp?ia_id=707|archive-date=26 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Stanger, Richard L.

In 1990, Czechoslovakia held [[1990 Czechoslovakian parliamentary election|its first free elections in 44 years]], resulting in a sweeping victory for Civic Forum and its Slovak counterpart, [[Public Against Violence]]. Between them, they commanded strong majorities in both houses of the legislature, and tallied the highest popular vote share recorded for a free election in the country. Havel retained his presidency.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Despite increasing political tensions between the Czechs and the Slovaks in 1992, Havel supported the retention of the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic]] prior to the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|dissolution of the country]]. Havel sought re-election in 1992. Although no other candidate filed, when the vote came on 3 July, he failed to get a majority due to a lack of support from Slovak deputies. The largest Czech political party, the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]], let it be known that it would not support any other candidate. After the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence, he resigned as president on 20 July, saying that he would not preside over the country's breakup.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/21/world/vaclav-havel-still-puckish-still-a-politician-no-longer-president.html Vaclav Havel: Still Puckish, Still a Politician, No Longer President], [[The New York Times]], 21 July 1992</ref>

However, when the Czech Republic was created as one of two successor states, he stood for election as its first president on 26 January 1993, and won. Although he was nominally the new country's chief executive, the framers of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] intended to vest most of the real power in the prime minister. However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great [[moral authority]], and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended. For instance, largely due to his influence, the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] (KSCM), successor to the KSC's branch in the Czech Lands, was kept on the margins for most of his presidency. Havel suspected that the KSCM was still an unreformed Stalinist party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe |last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>

Havel's popularity abroad surpassed his popularity at home,<ref>{{cite news|last=Ponikelska |first=Lenka |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-18/czechs-mourn-havel-as-leaders-gather-to-plan-funeral-1-.html |title=Czech Cabinet Meets to Plan Havel's Funeral as EU Holds Minute of Silence |newspaper=Bloomberg.com |date=19 December 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=2013-11-19}}</ref> and he was often the object of controversy and criticism. During his time in office, Havel stated that the expulsion of the indigenous [[Sudeten German]] population after [[World War II]] was immoral, causing a great controversy at home. He also extended general amnesty as one of his first acts as president, in an attempt to lessen the pressure in overcrowded prisons as well as to release political prisoners and persons who may have been falsely imprisoned during the Communist era. Havel felt that many of the decisions by the previous regime's courts should not be trusted, and that most of those in prison had not received fair trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.hrad.cz/president/Havel/speeches/1990/0101_uk.html|title=Havel's New Year's address|publisher=Old.hrad.cz|access-date=2 December 2011}}</ref> However, critics claimed that this amnesty led to a significant increase in the crime rate:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janda|first1=Vojtěch|title=Listopad 1989: Se svobodou přišel zločin|journal=Deník.cz|date=3 October 2009|url=http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/listopad_zlocin20091002.html|access-date=1 February 2016}}</ref> the total number of crimes doubled,<ref name="auto">{{cite book|title=Analýza trendů kriminality v roce 2010|year=2011|publisher=Institut pro kriminologii a sociální prevenci|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-7338-117-2|pages=124–128|url=http://lpxp.sweb.cz/392.pdf|access-date=1 February 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214210121/http://lpxp.sweb.cz/392.pdf|archive-date=14 February 2016}}</ref> as did the number of murders.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analýza trendů kriminality v roce 2010|year=2011|publisher=Institut pro kriminologii a sociální prevenci|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-7338-117-2|page=129|url=http://lpxp.sweb.cz/392.pdf|access-date=1 February 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214210121/http://lpxp.sweb.cz/392.pdf|archive-date=14 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Počet vražd v České republice|url=https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cr_od_roku_1989_vrazdy|website=czso.cz|publisher=Český statistický úřad|access-date=1 February 2016}}</ref> Several of the worst crimes in the history of the Czech criminology were committed by criminals released in this amnesty.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jedlička|first1=Miloslav|title=Jozef Slovák: pětinásobný vrah|url=http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/slovak/slovak.html|website=kriminalistika.eu|access-date=1 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115165750/http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/slovak/slovak.html|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jedlička|first1=Miloslav|title=Roman Kučerovský|url=http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/bezdekova/bezdek.html|website=kriminalistika.eu|access-date=1 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303021230/http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/bezdekova/bezdek.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jedlička|first1=Miloslav|title=Vraha tří žen našli kriminalisté po třinácti letech.

In an interview with Karel Hvížďala (included in ''To the Castle and Back''), Havel expressed his feeling that it was his most important accomplishment as president to have contributed to the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. According to his statement the dissolution was very complicated. The infrastructure created by the Warsaw Pact was part of the economies of all member states, and the Pact's dissolution necessitated restructuring that took many years to complete. Furthermore, it took time to dismantle the Warsaw Pact's institutions; for example, it took two years for Soviet troops to fully withdraw from Czechoslovakia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Following a legal dispute with his sister-in-law Dagmar Havlová (wife of his brother Ivan M. Havel), Havel decided to sell his 50% stake in the [[Lucerna Palace]] on [[Wenceslas Square]] in Prague, built from 1907 to 1921 by his grandfather, also named Václav Havel (spelled Vácslav,) one of the multifunctional "palaces" in the center of the once booming pre-World War I Prague. In a transaction arranged by [[Marián Čalfa]], Havel sold the estate to [[Václav Junek]], a former Communist [[spy]] in France and head of the soon-to-be bankrupt [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] Chemapol Group, who later openly admitted that he [[bribed]] politicians of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Paul | last=Berman | url=http://www.columbia.edu/~js322/nyl/1997/n5/havel.html | title=The Poet of Democracy and His Burdens | work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=11 May 1997 | access-date=18 March 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528191303/http://www.columbia.edu/~js322/nyl/1997/n5/havel.html | archive-date=28 May 2006 | url-status=dead }} (original inc. cover photo), as rpt. in English translation at ''Newyorske listy'' (New York Herald).

Reviewing a new biography by [[Michael Žantovský]], Yale historian Marci Shore summarized his challenges as president: "Havel's message, 'We are all responsible, we are all guilty,' was not popular. He enacted a general amnesty for all but the most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II expulsion of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. These things were not popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia."<ref>Marci Shore, "''Havel: A Life,'' by Michael Zantovsky," [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/havel-a-life-by-michael-zantovsky.html?ref=todayspaper ''New York Times Sunday Book Review'' (27 December 2014)]</ref>

On 4 July 1994, Václav Havel was awarded the [[Philadelphia Liberty Medal]]. In his acceptance speech, he said: "The idea of human rights and freedoms must be an integral part of any meaningful world order. Yet I think it must be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the subsiding waters of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world."<ref>[http://www.constitutioncenter.org/libertymedal/recipient_1994_speech.html 1994 Speech Václav Havel – Liberty Medal], National Constitution Center</ref>
