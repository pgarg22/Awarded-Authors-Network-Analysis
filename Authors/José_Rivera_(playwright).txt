'''José Rivera''' (born March 24, 1955) is a [[playwright]] and the first [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[screenwriter]] to be nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].

==Early years==
Rivera was born in the [[Santurce, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] section of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] in 1955. He was raised in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]] where he lived until 1959. Rivera's family migrated from [[Puerto Rico]] when he was 4 years old, and moved to [[New York City]]. They settled down in [[Long Island]], whose small town environment would be of an influence to him in the future. His parents were very religious and he grew up in a household whose only book was the [[Bible]]. His family enjoyed telling stories and he learned a lot by hearing these stories.  As a child, he also enjoyed watching ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' [[T.V.]] series. He received his primary and secondary education in the New York state public school system. In 1968, when Rivera was 12 years old, he saw a traveling company perform the play "[[Rumpelstiltskin]]" at his school. Witnessing the collective reaction of the audience towards the play convinced the young Rivera that someday, he too, would like to write plays.<ref name="VV">[http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-07-04/theater/diction-and-contradiction/ Diction and Contradiction by Michael Feingold, ''Village Voice'', July 4, 2006]</ref><ref name="BR">[http://www.bookrags.com/Jos%C3%A9_Rivera_(playwright) ''Book Rags'']</ref>

==Career==
Many of his plays have been produced across the nation and even translated into several languages, including: ''The House of Ramon Iglesias'', ''[[Cloud Tectonics]]'', ''The Street of the Sun'', ''Sonnets for an Old Century'', ''Sueño'', ''Giants Have Us in Their Books'', ''References to [[Salvador Dalí]] Make Me Hot'' and '' Adoration of the Old Woman''.  In 2003, ''Cloud Tectonics'' was presented in the XLII Festival of Puerto Rican Theater, an event sponsored by the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture, in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Rivera helped found the Los Angeles-based theater company, The Wilton Project.<ref name="VV"/><ref name="BR"/>

===Television===
Rivera contributed as a writer to the following shows: ''The House of Ramon Iglesias'' (1986) (TV), ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' (1989) (TV series), ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'' (1995) (TV series), ''[[The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story]]'' (1998), ''Night Visions'' (2001) (TV series) and the "Harmony" segment of ''[[Shadow Realm]]'' (2002). He also co-created and co-produced the [[NBC|NBC-TV]] series, ''[[Eerie, Indiana]]'' with [[Karl Schaefer]].<ref name="VV"/><ref name="BR"/>

===TV appearances===
Rivera was featured in The Dialogue interview series. In this 90 minute interview with producer Mike DeLuca, Rivera describes his transition from playwright to Oscar-nominated screenwriter.<ref name="VV"/><ref name="BR"/>

===''The Motorcycle Diaries''===
In 2002, Rivera was hired to write the screenplay for the film ''Diarios de Motocicleta'' (''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'') by director [[Walter Salles]]. The movie, which was released in 2004, is based on [[Che Guevara]]'s [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|diary about a motorcycle trip]] which he and [[Alberto Granado]] had, and how it changed their lives. In January 2005, Rivera became the first Puerto Rican to be nominated by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for "Best Adapted Screenplay" for the film. His screenplay won awards from the Cinema Writers Circle (Spain) and from the [[Argentine Film Critics Association]]; it was also nominated for awards by the American Screenwriters Association, the [[Online Film Critics Society]], and the [[Writers Guild of America]].<ref>[http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-01-20/entertainment/17151260_1_che-guevara-che-inspired-rivera-s-career Jose Rivera's Che Guevara Play: "School of the Americas" by Delfin Vigil, January 20, 2008]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1433580/awards Jose Rivera awards and nominations] at IMDB.com, accessed 1 August 2009.</ref>

This work with the subject of Che Guevara later led Rivera to write and perform a play entitled ''School of the Americas'' which focuses on Che's last few hours alive. The play starring John Ortiz as Che, imagines Che's final conversations, mainly with a young and fairly naive female schoolteacher, in the one-room village schoolhouse where he is imprisoned before his execution. The play was featured in [[New York City]] 2006-2007 and later [[San Francisco]] 2008.<ref name="BR"/><ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-07-04/theater/diction-and-contradiction/ Diction and Contradiction] by Michael Feingold, ''Village Voice'', July 4, 2006</ref>

==Influences==
In high school and later in college, he read everything that had to do with [[Shakespeare]], [[Ibsen]] and [[Molière]]. His education was directed towards the Anglo-Euro Cultures, without receiving any exposure to the literature and writers of [[Latin America]]. However, he was profoundly influenced later by a Latin American novel, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' by 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Gabriel García Márquez]]. Márquez later became his mentor at the [[Sundance Institute]].<ref name="VV"/><ref name="BR"/>

Rivera incorporates many of his life experiences into his plays. In ''The Promise'' and ''Each Day Dies With Sleep'', Rivera discusses his experiences as a Puerto Rican in a small American town, with an emphasis on family, [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], spirituality and the [[occult]].  ''Marisol'' was inspired by the situation of his homeless uncle.<ref name="VV"/>

==Awards and honors==
Rivera has won two [[Obie Award]]s for playwriting, a [[Kennedy Center]] Fund for New American plays Grant, a [[Fulbright]] Arts Fellowship in playwriting, a [[Whiting Awards|Whiting Award]], a McKnight Fellowship, the 2005 [[Norman Lear]] Writing Award, a 2005 Impact Award and a Berilla Kerr Playwriting Award.<ref name="VV"/>

==Currently==
His play, "''Brainpeople,''" premiered in San Francisco January 30, 2008, and was co-produced by the [[American Conservatory Theater]].  Rivera will also direct and write the screenplay for "Celestina", a film loosely adapted from his play "Cloud Tectonics", which will be produced by Walter Salles.  Among his recent projects is the movie adaptation of ''[[On the Road (2012 film)|On the Road]]'', based on the novel by [[Jack Kerouac]].<ref name="VV"/><ref name="BR"/>
