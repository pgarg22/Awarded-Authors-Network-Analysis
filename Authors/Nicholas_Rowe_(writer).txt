'''Nicholas Rowe''' ({{IPAc-en|r|oʊ}}; 20 June 1674 – 6 December 1718<ref name="EB1911" />), English dramatist, poet and miscellaneous writer, was appointed [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] in 1715. His plays and poems were well-received during his lifetime, with one of his translations described as one of the greatest productions in English poetry. He was also considered the first editor of the works of [[William Shakespeare]].

==Life==

Nicholas Rowe was born in [[Little Barford]], Bedfordshire, England, son of John Rowe (d. 1692), [[barrister]] and [[sergeant-at-law]], and Elizabeth, daughter of Jasper Edwards, on 20 June 1674.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|wstitle=Rowe, Nicholas|volume=23|pages=782–783}}</ref><ref name="Westminster">{{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/library/burial/rowe.htm |title=People Buried or Commemorated – Nicholas Rowe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625113129/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/library/burial/rowe.htm |archive-date=25 June 2006 |url-status=dead |publisher=Westminster Abbey |access-date=4 December 2018 }}</ref> His family possessed a considerable estate at Lamerton in Devonshire.

The future English [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] was educated first at [[Highgate School]], and then at [[Westminster School]] under the guidance of [[Richard Busby]]. In 1688, Rowe became a [[King's Scholar]], which was followed by his entrance into [[Middle Temple]] in 1691.<ref name="EB1911"/> His entrance into Middle Temple was decided upon by his father, who felt that Rowe had made sufficient progress to qualify him to study law.  While at Middle Temple, he read statutes and reports with proficiency proportionate to the force of his mind, which was already such that he endeavoured to comprehend law, not as a series of precedents, or collection of positive precepts, but as a system of rational government and impartial justice.<ref name="Johnson's" />

On his father's death, when he was nineteen, he became the master of an independent fortune.<ref name="EB1911" /> He was left to his own direction, and from that time ignored law to try his hand first at poetry, and then later at writing plays.<ref name="Johnson's" />

Rowe acted as under-secretary (1709–1711) to the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] when he was principal secretary of state for [[Scotland]]. On the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], Rowe was made a surveyor of customs, and in 1715 he succeeded [[Nahum Tate]] as [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]].<ref name="EB1911" />

He was also appointed clerk of the council to the Prince of Wales, and in 1718 was nominated by [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Lord Chancellor Parker]] as clerk of the presentations in Chancery. He died on 6 December 1718, and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name="EB1911" />

:The inscription on his tomb reads as follows:
::''To the Memory of NICHOLAS ROWE Esq: who died in 1718 Aged 45, And of Charlotte his only daughter the wife of Henry Fane Esq; who, inheriting her Father’s Spirit, and Amiable in her own Innocence & Beauty, died in the 22nd year of her age 1739.''
 
::''Thy Reliques, Rowe, to this sad Shrine we trust, and near thy Shakespear place thy honour’d Bust, Oh next him skill’ed to draw the tender Tear, For never Heart felt Passion more sincere: To nobler sentiment to fire the Brave. For never Briton more disdain’d a Slave: Peace to the gentle Shade, and endless Rest, Blest in thy Genius, in thy love too blest; And blest, that timely from Our Scene remov’d Thy Soul enjoys that Liberty it lov’d.''

::''To these, so mourn’d in Death, so lov’d in Life! The childless Parent & the widow’d wife With tears inscribes this monument Stone, That holds their Ashes & expects her own.''<ref name="Westminster" />

Upon his death his widow received a pension from George I in 1719 in recognition of her husband's translation of [[Lucan]]. This verse translation, or rather paraphrase of the ''Pharsalia'', was called by [[Samuel Johnson]] one of the greatest productions in English poetry, and was widely read, running through eight editions between 1718 and 1807.<ref name="EB1911" />

==Family==

Rowe was first married to a woman by the name of Parsons (given name is unknown), with whom he had a son John. His second wife was Anne Devenish, and they had a daughter named Charlotte.<ref name="Westminster" /> [[Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)|Daniel Lysons]] and [[Samuel Lysons]] noted that he did not have descendants after his son died childless.<ref>[[Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)|Daniel Lysons]] and [[Samuel Lysons]], "[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol6/clxxiii-ccxxv General history: Families removed since 1620]". In Magna Britannia: Volume 6, Devonshire (London, 1822), pp. clxxiii–ccxxv.</ref>

==Works==

''[[The Ambitious Stepmother]]'', Rowe's first play, produced in 1700 at Lincoln's Inn Fields by [[Thomas Betterton]] and set in [[Persepolis]], was well received.<ref name="Bartleby">[http://www.bartleby.com/218/0726.html ''Nicholas Rowe as a Link between the Later Restoration Drama and that of the Augustan Age'']</ref> This was followed in 1701 by ''Tamerlane''. In this play the conqueror [[Timur]] represented [[William III of England|William III]], and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] is denounced as Bajazet. It was for many years regularly acted on the anniversary of William's landing at [[Torbay]].<ref name="EB1911" /> In [[Dublin]] in 1712, at a time when political passions were running high, the performance provoked a serious riot.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ball |first=F. Elrington |title=The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1926 |page=42 |volume=2 |isbn=9781584774280 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqeSXWqKAD8C&pg=RA1-PA42}}</ref>

''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703), an adaptation of [[Philip Massinger|Massinger]] and [[Nathan Field|Field]]'s ''[[The Fatal Dowry]]'', was pronounced by Samuel Johnson as one of the most pleasing tragedies ever written in English. It featured the character of [[Lothario]] from ''The Impertinent Curious Man'', a [[story within a story]] in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' 1605 novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''. As a result of this play, the name became synonymous with a [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] (womaniser).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qo9VxxH1OGgC&pg=PA162 |title=The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution |last=Dabhoiwala |first=Faramerz |date=May 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199892419 |language=en |page=162}}</ref> Calista is said to have suggested to [[Samuel Richardson]] the character of [[Clarissa]] Harlowe, as Lothario suggested Lovelace.<ref name="EB1911" /> Samuel Johnson noted of ''The Fair Penitent'' that, "The story is domestic, and therefore easily received by the imagination, and assimilated to common life; the diction is exquisitely harmonious, and soft or spritely as occasion requires."<ref name="Johnson's" />

In 1704, Rowe tried his hand at comedy, producing ''[[The Biter]]'' at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], which was unsuccessful, and Rowe returned to tragedy in ''[[Ulysses (play)|Ulysses]]'' (1705).<ref name="EB1911" /> According to Johnson, this play was to share the fate of many such plays based on mythological heroes, as, "We have been too early acquainted with the poetical heroes to expect any pleasure from their revival"<ref name="Johnson's" />

''[[The Royal Convert]]'' (1707) was a story about a [[love triangle]] between two brothers, Hengist and Aribert, and a Christian woman named Ethelinda, who is martyred.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoM1AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA560 |title=A History of English Dramatic Literature to the Death of Queen Anne |last=Ward |first=Adolphus William |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1875 |location=London |volume=2 |page=560 |language=en}}</ref>

''The Tragedy of [[Jane Shore]]'', professedly an imitation of Shakespeare's style, was played at [[Drury Lane]] with [[Anne Oldfield]] in the title role in 1714. It ran for nineteen nights, and kept the stage longer than any other of Rowe's works.<ref name="EB1911" /> In the play, which consists chiefly of domestic scenes and private distress, the wife is forgiven because she repents, and the husband is honoured because he forgives.<ref name="Johnson's" />

''[[The Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey]]'' followed in 1715, and as this play was not successful, it was his last foray into the medium.<ref name="EB1911" />

Rowe published the first 18th-century edition of [[William Shakespeare]] in six volumes in 1709 (printed by Tonson) and is also considered the first editor of Shakespeare. His practical knowledge of the stage helped him divide the plays into scenes (and sometime acts), with the entrances and exits of the players noted. He also normalised the spelling of names and prefixed each play with a list of the ''dramatis personae''. This 1709 edition was also the first to be illustrated, a frontispiece engraving being provided for each play. Unfortunately, Rowe based his text on the corrupt Fourth Folio, a course which was followed by many later 18th-century editors who followed in his editorial footsteps.  Rowe also wrote a short biography of Shakespeare, entitled, ''Some Account of the Life &c. of Mr. William Shakespear''.<ref name="EB1911" /><ref name="Shakespear">{{cite web |url=http://shakespeare.palomar.edu/rowe.htm |title=Some Acount of the Life &c. of Mr. William Shakespear |access-date=21 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723160054/http://shakespeare.palomar.edu/ROWE.HTM |archive-date=23 July 2008  }}</ref>

Rowe wrote [[occasional verse]]s addressed to [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]] and [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]], adapted some of the odes of [[Horace]] to fit contemporary events, and translated the ''Caractères'' of [[Jean de La Bruyère]] and the ''Callipaedia'' of Claude Quillet. He also wrote a memoir of [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] prefixed to a translation of the ''Lutrin''.<ref name="EB1911" /> He also wrote a version of Lucan's [[Pharsalia]].<ref name="Johnson's" />
