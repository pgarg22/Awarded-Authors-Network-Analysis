Wertenbaker's best-known work is ''[[Our Country's Good]]'', which received six [[Tony Award|Tony nominations]] for its 1991 production. She has a propensity to write about political thinking and conflict, especially where there is a settled orthodoxy: "Then the rebel in me goes berserk, and I start pawing at it. I like the area where the questions are, and the ambiguities of political life, rather than the certainties."<ref name=post/>

== Background ==

Wertenbaker was born in [[New York City]] to [[Charles Wertenbaker]], a journalist, and Lael Wertenbaker, a writer.<ref name=guardian/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/29/arts/lael-wertenbaker-87-author-who-wrote-of-husband-s-death.html ''New York Times'', "Lael Wertenbaker, 87, Author Who Wrote of Husband's Death", 1997]</ref> Much of her childhood was spent in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]] in the small fishing village of [[Ciboure]].<ref name=guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/30/timberlake-wertenbaker-playwright-renaissance-winter-hill-interview ''The Guardian'', "Timberlake Wertenbaker: ‘I got to feel that nobody wanted me’", April 29, 2017]</ref>

She has been described as possessing a "characteristic reticence"; she has indicated that this may spring partly from her upbringing in Ciboure: "One thing they would tell you as a child was never to say anything because you might be betraying someone who had done something politically or whatever. So I was inculcated with this idea of emotional privacy."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/jun/30/theatre ''The Guardian'', "It's All So Public", 30 June 2004]</ref>

==Career==
Wertenbaker was the resident writer for [[Shared Experience]] in 1983 and the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from 1984 to 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/timberlake-wertenbaker|title=Timberlake Wertenbaker|work=Literature Matters|publisher=[[British Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313215125/https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/timberlake-wertenbaker|archive-date=12 March 2016}}</ref> She was on the Executive Council of the [[English Stage Company]] from 1992 to 1997 and on the Executive Committee of PEN from 1998 to 2001. She served as the Royden B. Davis professor of Theatre at [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington D.C.]], for 2005–06. She was the Leverhulme Artist in Residence at the [[Freud Museum]] in 2011. She was also the artistic director of [[New Perspective Theatre Company]].

Currently, Wertenbaker is the Chair in Playwriting at  the [[University of East Anglia]]. In addition, she is artistic adviser to the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] and on the council of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Themes==
Central topics in her work are the efforts of individuals, particularly women: pursuing quests, seeking change, breaking boundaries, and constructing or challenging gender roles. A central technique is the revisioning of actual or imaginary lives from the past, sometimes remote in place as well as in time.

There is a further recurring theme in her work: displacement. In her plays, characters are often removed from the familiarity of home and are forced to live in new cultures, sometimes defined by national boundaries, other times by cultural and class divisions. From this central theme emerge related themes, including isolation, dispossession, and the problem of forging an identity within a new cultural milieu. In her work, individuals often seem to assume roles, as if identity were a matter of persons performing themselves. Wertenbaker's work also demonstrates a keen awareness that communication occurs through language that often inadequately expresses experience.

==Personal life==
She has a home in [[north London]], where she lives with her husband, the writer [[John Man (author)|John Man]]. They have one daughter.

== Legacy ==
In 1997, the [[British Library]] acquired Wertenbaker's archive consisting of manuscripts, correspondence and papers relating to her works.<ref>[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-001980324 Timberlake Wertenbaker Papers], archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library.
