'''E. M. Almedingen''' (born Marta Aleksandrovna Almedingen, also known as '''Martha Edith Almedingen''' or '''von Almedingen'''; 21 July 1898 – 5 March 1971) was a British novelist, biographer, children's author,<ref name="gale">{{Cite web |url=https://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/H1000001677/GVRL?u=j043914&sid=GVRL&xid=15b93177 |title=Martha Edith von Almedingen |website=Contemporary Authors Online |publisher=Gale |year=2003 |access-date=2019-02-04 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> and member of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].<ref name="necropolis" /><ref name="gale" />

== Family ==
On her mother's side, she was descended from the aristocratic Poltoratsky family; her maternal grandfather was [[Serge Poltoratzky]], the literary scholar and bibliophile who ended his days in exile, shuttling between France and England. His second wife, Ellen Sarah Southee, the daughter of an English gentleman farmer, grew up in [[Kent]]. She was related to poet [[Robert Southey]]. Their children had English governesses and grew up speaking English. Their daughter and the novelist's mother, Olga Sergeevna, grew up in [[Kent]]— but, fascinated by her father's native Russian, moved to Russia in 1800s. There, she married Alexander Almedingen,<ref>E. M. Almedingen, ''Tomorrow Will Come'' (Holt Rinehart Winston, 1968), p. 19.</ref> who had turned his back on his family's military traditions to become a scientist.

== Early life ==
After her father abandoned his family in 1900, they increasingly lived in impoverishment. Despite this, the author was able to attend the [[Nicholas Palace|Xenia Institute]] in 1913<ref name="gale" /> and eke out a living in the increasingly desperate times of the Russian [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War|civil war]]. She received the highest honors in history and literature at Xenia.<ref name="gale" /> She transferred from Xenia to Petrograd University in 1916, where she attended until she earned her first doctorate in 1920.<ref name="necropolis" /><ref name="guide">{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lfh&AN=103331LM98939790100219&site=ehost-live|title = E.M.
