In 1970, Belli published her first poems in the literary supplement of Nicaraguan newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]].''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Gioconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/countryundermysk00gioc/page/37 37-38]|url=https://archive.org/details/countryundermysk00gioc/page/37}}</ref> In 1972, she won the Premio de Poesía Mariano Fiallos Gil award from the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.los-poetas.com/n/biobelli.htm|title=Biografia de Gioconda Belli|website=www.los-poetas.com|access-date=2017-10-23|archive-date=March 11, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311081532/http://www.los-poetas.com/n/biobelli.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Gioconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/countryundermysk00gioc/page/42 42]|url=https://archive.org/details/countryundermysk00gioc/page/42}}</ref>

1988, Belli's book ''La Mujer Habitada'' (The Inhabited Woman), a [[semi-autobiographical novel]] that raised gender issues for the first time in the Nicaraguan revolutionary narratives, brought her increased attention; this book has been published in several languages and was on the reading list at four universities in the United States. The novel follows two parallel stories: the indigenous resistance to the Spanish and modern insurgency in Central America with various points in common: women's emancipation, passion, and a commitment to liberation. In 2000, she published her autobiography, emphasizing her involvement in the revolutionary movement, ''El país bajo mi piel,'' published under the name ''The Country Under My Skin'' in the United States; it was a finalist for the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news | title =REVOLUTION: A User's Manual | url =http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/pep/pepdesc.cfm?id=1973 | work =The New York Public Library | access-date =2008-02-13 | archive-date =June 10, 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080610145700/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/pep/pepdesc.cfm?id=1973 | url-status =live }}</ref> Belli continues publishing and maintains that poetry is her most important work.

Belli's books have been published in numerous languages.

Her 2010 book was submitted with the title "Crónicas de la Izquierda Erótica", but had to be changed to "El País de las Mujeres", since the previous title was too similar to that of a 1973 book by [[Ana María Rodas]]: ''Poemas de la Izquierda Erótica''. The book tells the story of a world governed by women. In the novel she portrays a group of women that take power by means of a Political Party named "Partido de la Izquierda Erótica". This is the same name as a movement formed by women during the 80s, to which Belli belonged, which had been named as a tribute to Rodas´ work.

=== Political activity ===
Belli opposed the dictatorship of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. From 1970, when she began writing her poems and like many intellectuals of her generation, she joined the ranks of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), at that time a clandestine and persecuted organization whose aim was the overthrow of the Somoza regime. She was a clandestine courier, transported weapons, travelled around Europe and Latin America obtaining resources and spreading the word about the Sandinista struggle. She became a member of the FSLN's Political-Diplomatic Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gioconda Belli: la escritora rebelde que ya no cree en la lucha armada|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/cultura/musica-y-libros/gioconda-belli-la-escritora-rebelde-que-ya-no-cree-en-la-lucha-armada-47591|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|date=2016-10-16|website=El Tiempo|language=es|access-date=2020-05-14|archive-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904183722/http://www.eltiempo.com/cultura/musica-y-libros/gioconda-belli-la-escritora-rebelde-que-ya-no-cree-en-la-lucha-armada-47591|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2018, Belli took a stand against the government of [[Daniel Ortega]], which emerged from the 2016 elections, and became an active member of the Sandinista renewal movement.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gioconda Belli: "La gente más de izquierda no está con Daniel Ortega"|url=https://www.lamarea.com/2018/06/27/entrevista-gioconda-belli-nicaragua/|date=2018-06-27|website=lamarea.com|language=es|access-date=2020-05-14|archive-date=May 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501180520/https://www.lamarea.com/2018/06/27/entrevista-gioconda-belli-nicaragua/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=‘Daniel sembró vientos y está cosechando tempestades’|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/mundo/latinoamerica/entrevista-con-la-escritora-gioconda-belli-sobre-nicaragua-234816|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|date=2018-06-23|website=El Tiempo|language=es|access-date=2020-05-14|archive-date=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728131200/http://www.eltiempo.com/mundo/latinoamerica/entrevista-con-la-escritora-gioconda-belli-sobre-nicaragua-234816|url-status=live}}</ref>
