Gorky's most famous works are a short story collection ''[[Sketches and Stories]]'' (1899), plays ''[[The Philistines]]'' (1901), ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' (1902) and ''[[Children of the Sun (play)|Children of the Sun]]'' (1905), a poem ''[[The Song of the Stormy Petrel]]'' (1901), his autobiographical trilogy ''[[My Childhood (Gorky book)|My Childhood, In the World, My Universities]]'' (1913–1923), and a novel ''[[Mother (novel)|Mother]]'' (1906). Gorky himself judged some of these works as failures, and ''Mother'' has been frequently criticized (Gorky himself thought of ''Mother'' as one of his biggest failures<ref>{{cite book

However, there have been warmer judgements of some less-known post-revolutionary works such as the cycles ''[[Fragments from My Diary]]'' (1924) and ''[[Stories of 1922–1924]]'' (1925), the novels ''[[The Artamonov Business]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Life of Klim Samgin]]'' (1925–1936); the  latter is considered Gorky's masterpiece and sometimes being viewed by critics as a [[Literary modernism|modernist]] work. Unlike his pre-revolutionary writings (known for their "anti-psychologism"), these differ with an ambivalent portrayal of the [[Russian Revolution]] and "unmodern interest to human psychology" (as noted by [[D. S. Mirsky]]).<ref>{{cite book

Gorky was active in the emerging [[Marxist]] communist movement. He publicly opposed the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] regime, and for a time closely associated himself with [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov|Bogdanov]]'s [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik wing]] of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|party]]. For a significant part of his life, he was exiled from Russia and later the Soviet Union. In 1932, he returned to the USSR on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s personal invitation and lived there until his death in June 1936. After his return he was officially declared the "founder of [[Socialist Realism]]". Despite his official reputation, Gorky's relations with the Soviet regime were rather difficult. Modern scholars consider his ideology of [[God-Building]] as distinct from the official [[Marxism-Leninism]], and his work fits uneasily under the Socialist Realist label. His work remains controversial.

==Life==
===Early years===
[[File:E. M. Lilien Ex Libris Gorki.jpg|thumb|"Ex Libris Maxim Gorki" [[bookplate]] from his personal library depicts the unchained [[Prometheus]] rising from pages of a book, crushing a [[Cat o' nine tails|multi-tailed whip]] and shooing away black crows. [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] portrayed in the background]]
Born as Alexei Maximovich Peshkov on {{OldStyleDate|28 March|1868|16 March}}, in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], Gorky became an orphan at the age of eleven. He was brought up by his grandmother<ref name="kirjasto" /> and ran away from home at the age of twelve in 1880. After an attempt at suicide in December 1887, he travelled on foot across the [[Russian Empire]] for five years, changing jobs and accumulating impressions used later in his writing.<ref name="kirjasto" />

As a journalist working for provincial newspapers, he wrote under the pseudonym {{lang|ru|Иегудиил Хламида}} (Jehudiel Khlamida).<ref name="librarything">{{cite web |url=http://www.librarything.com/author/gorkymaxim|title=Maxim Gorky|work=Library Thing|access-date=21 July 2009}}</ref> He started using the pseudonym "Gorky" (from горький; literally "bitter") in 1892, when his first short story, "[[Makar Chudra]]", was published by the newspaper ''Kavkaz'' (The Caucasus) in [[Tiflis]], where he spent several weeks doing menial jobs, mostly for the Caucasian Railway workshops.<ref name="comment">[http://gorkiy-lit.ru/gorkiy/proza/rasskaz/makar-chudra.htm Commentaries to Макар Чудра].

The Biography] // И.М.Нефедова. Максим Горький. Биография писателя  Л.: Просвещение, 1971.</ref> The name reflected his simmering anger about life in Russia and a determination to speak the bitter truth. Gorky's first book ''Очерки и рассказы'' (''Essays and Stories'') in 1898 enjoyed a sensational success, and his career as a writer began. Gorky wrote incessantly, viewing literature less as an aesthetic practice (though he worked hard on style and form) than as a moral and political act that could change the world. He described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalisation, but also their inward spark of humanity.<ref name="kirjasto" />

===Political and literary development===
[[File:1900 yalta-gorky and chekhov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anton Chekhov]] and Gorky. 1900, [[Yalta]]]]

Gorky's reputation grew as a unique literary voice from the bottom stratum of society and as a fervent advocate of Russia's social, political, and cultural transformation. By 1899, he was openly associating with the emerging [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] movement, which helped make him a celebrity among both the [[intelligentsia]] and the growing numbers of "conscious" workers. At the heart of all his work was a belief in the inherent worth and potential of the human person. In his writing, he counterposed individuals, aware of their natural dignity, and inspired by energy and will, with people who succumb to the degrading conditions of life around them. Both his writings and his letters reveal a "restless man" (a frequent self-description) struggling to resolve contradictory feelings of faith and scepticism, love of life and disgust at the vulgarity and pettiness of the human world.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1916, Gorky said that the teachings of the ancient Jewish sage [[Hillel the Elder]] deeply influenced his life: "In my early youth I read...the words of...Hillel, if I remember rightly: 'If thou art not for thyself, who will be for thee? But if thou art for thyself alone, wherefore art thou'? The inner meaning of these words impressed me with its profound wisdom...The thought ate its way deep into my soul, and I say now with conviction: Hillel's wisdom served as a strong staff on my road, which was neither even nor easy. I believe that Jewish wisdom is more all-human and universal than any other; and this not only because of its immemorial age...but because of the powerful humaneness that saturates it, because of its high estimate of man."<ref>Joseph Herz, ''A Book of Jewish Thoughts'', Bloch Publishing, p. 158</ref>

He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime and was arrested many times. Gorky befriended many revolutionaries and became a personal friend of [[Vladimir Lenin]] after they met in 1902. He exposed governmental control of the press (see [[Matvei Golovinski]] affair). In 1902, Gorky was elected an honorary Academician of Literature, but [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] ordered this annulled. In protest, [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Vladimir Korolenko]] left the Academy.<ref>''Handbook of Russian Literature,'' Victor Terras, Yale University Press, 1990.</ref>

[[File:1900 yasnaya polyana-gorky and tolstoy.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leo Tolstoy]] with Gorky in [[Yasnaya Polyana]], 1900]]
From 1900 to 1905, Gorky's writings became more optimistic. He became more involved in the opposition movement, for which he was again briefly imprisoned in 1901. In 1904, having severed his relationship with the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in the wake of conflict with [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], Gorky returned to [[Nizhny Novgorod]] to establish a theatre of his own.{{efn|[[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] had insulted Gorky with his critical assessment of Gorky's new play ''[[Summerfolk]]'', which Nemirovich described as shapeless and formless raw material that lacked a plot. Despite [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski's]] attempts to persuade him otherwise, in December 1904 Gorky refused permission for the [[Moscow Art Theatre|MAT]] to produce his ''[[Enemies (play)|Enemies]]'' and declined "any kind of connection with the Art Theatre."{{sfn |Benedetti |1999 |pp=149–150}}}} Both [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Savva Morozov]] provided financial support for the venture.{{sfn |Benedetti |1999 |p=150}} Stanislavski believed that Gorky's theatre was an opportunity to develop the network of provincial theatres which he hoped would reform the art of the stage in Russia, a dream of his since the 1890s.{{sfn |Benedetti |1999 |p=150}}  He sent some pupils from the Art Theatre School—as well as [[Ioasaf Tikhomirov]], who ran the school—to work there.{{sfn |Benedetti |1999 |p=150}}  By the autumn, however, after the censor had banned every play that the theatre proposed to stage, Gorky abandoned the project.{{sfn |Benedetti |1999 |p=150}}

As a financially successful author, editor, and playwright, Gorky gave financial support to the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), as well as supporting liberal appeals to the government for civil rights and social reform. The brutal shooting of workers marching to the Tsar with a petition for reform on 9 January 1905 (known as the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|"Bloody Sunday"]]), which set in motion the [[Revolution of 1905]], seems to have pushed Gorky more decisively toward radical solutions. He became closely associated with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s [[Bolshevik]] wing of the party, with Bogdanov taking responsibility for the transfer of funds from Gorky to [[Vpered]].<ref>{{Citation
|last=Biggart|first=John|year=1989|title=Alexander Bogdanov, Left-Bolshevism and the Proletkult 1904–1932|publisher=University of East Anglia}}</ref> It is not clear whether he ever formally joined, and his relations with Lenin and the Bolsheviks would always be rocky. His most influential writings in these years were a series of political plays, most famously ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' (1902). While briefly imprisoned in [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] during the abortive 1905 Russian Revolution, Gorky wrote the play ''[[Children of the Sun (play)|Children of the Sun]]'', nominally set during an 1862 [[cholera]] epidemic, but universally understood to relate to present-day events. He was released from the prison after a European-wide campaign, which was supported by [[Marie Curie]], [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Anatole France]], amongst others.<ref>Figes, p. 181</ref>

In 1906, the Bolsheviks sent him on a fund-raising trip to the United States with [[Ivan Narodny]]. When visiting the [[Adirondack Mountains]], Gorky wrote {{lang|ru|Мать}} (''Mat''', ''[[Mother (Gorky novel)|Mother]]''), his notable novel of revolutionary conversion and struggle. His experiences in the United States—which included a scandal over his travelling with his lover (the actress [[Maria Fyodorovna Andreyeva|Maria Andreyeva]]) rather than his wife—deepened his contempt for the "bourgeois soul."

===Capri years===
[[File:Villa Behring on Capri.jpg|thumb|Between 1909–1911 Gorky lived on the island of Capri in the burgundy-coloured "Villa [[Emil Adolf von Behring|Behring]]".]]
From 1906 to 1913, Gorky lived on the island of [[Capri]] in southern Italy, partly for health reasons and partly to escape the increasingly repressive atmosphere in Russia.<ref name="kirjasto" /> He continued to support the work of Russian social-democracy, especially the Bolsheviks and invited [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] to stay with him on Capri. The two men had worked together on ''Literaturny Raspad'' which appeared in 1908. It was during this period that Gorky, along with Lunacharsky, [[Alexander Bogdanov|Bogdanov]] and [[Vladimir Bazarov]] developed the idea of an ''Encyclopedia of Russian History'' as a socialist version of [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. 

In 1906, Maxim Gorky visited New York City at the invitation of Mark Twain and other writers.   An invitation to the White House was withdrawn after the New York World reported that the woman accompanying Gorky was not his wife.<ref>Sorel, New York Times March 5, 2021</ref>

During a visit to Switzerland, Gorky met Lenin, who he charged spent an inordinate amount of his time feuding with other revolutionaries, writing: "He looked awful. Even his tongue seemed to have turned grey".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=117}} Despite his [[atheism]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Political Economy of Socialist Realism|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12280-0|page=76|author=Evgeniĭ Aleksandrovich Dobrenko|quote=Gorky hated religion with all the passion of a former God-builder. Probably no other Russian writer (unless one considers Dem'ian Bednyi a writer) expressed so many angry words about God, religion, and the church. But Gorky's atheism always fed on that same hatred of nature. He wrote about God and about nature in the very same terms.}}</ref> Gorky was not a materialist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=86|author=Tova Yedlin|quote=Gorky had long rejected all organized religions. Yet he was not a materialist, and thus he could not be satisfied with Marx's ideas on religion. When asked to express his views about religion in a questionnaire sent by the French journal Mercure de France on April 15, 1907, Gorky replied that he was opposed to the existing religions of Moses, Christ, and Mohammed. He defined religious feeling as an awareness of a harmonious link that joins man to the universe and as an aspiration for synthesis, inherent in every individual.}}</ref> Most controversially, he articulated, along with a few other maverick Bolsheviks, a philosophy he called "[[God-Building]]" (богостроительство, ''bogostroitel'stvo''),<ref name="kirjasto" /> which sought to recapture the power of myth for the revolution and to create religious atheism that placed collective humanity where God had been and was imbued with passion, wonderment, moral certainty, and the promise of deliverance from evil, suffering, and even death. Though 'God-Building' was ridiculed by Lenin, Gorky retained his belief that "culture"—the moral and spiritual awareness of the value and potential of the human self—would be more critical to the revolution's success than political or economic arrangements.

===Return from exile===
An amnesty granted for the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty]] allowed Gorky to return to Russia in 1914, where he continued his social criticism, mentored other writers from the common people, and wrote a series of important cultural memoirs, including the first part of his autobiography.<ref name="kirjasto" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Times|first=Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph To the New York|date=19 January 1914|title=GORKY BACK IN RUSSIA.; Amnesty Permits His Return -- Is Still In Ill Health. (Published 1914)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1914/01/19/archives/gorky-back-in-russia-amnesty-permits-his-return-is-still-in-ill.html|access-date=16 January 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> On returning to Russia, he wrote that his main impression was that "everyone is so crushed and devoid of God's image." The only solution, he repeatedly declared, was "culture".

After the [[February Revolution]], Gorky visited the headquarters of the [[Okhrana]] (secret police) on Kronversky Prospekt together with [[Nikolai Sukhanov]] and Vladimir Zenisinov.{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=91 & 95}} Gorky described the former Okhrana headquarters, where he sought literary inspiration, as derelict, with windows broken, and papers lying all over the floor.{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=91}} Having dinner with Sukhanov later the same day, Gorky grimly predicted that revolution would end in "Asiatic savagery".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=95}} Initially a supporter of the Socialist-Revolutionary [[Alexander Kerensky]], Gorky switched over to the Bolsheviks after the [[Kornilov affair]].{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=246}} In July 1917, Gorky wrote his own experiences of the Russian working class had been sufficient to dispel any "notions that Russian workers are the incarnation of spiritual beauty and kindness".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=201}} Gorky admitted to feeling attracted to Bolshevism, but admitted to concerns about a creed that made the entire working class "sweet and reasonable - I had never known people who were really like this".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=202}} Gorky wrote that he knew the poor, the "carpenters, stevedores, bricklayers", in a way that the intellectual Lenin never did, and he frankly distrusted them.{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=202}}

During [[World War I]], his apartment in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] was turned into a Bolshevik staff room, and his politics remained close to the Bolsheviks throughout the revolutionary period of 1917. On the day after the Bolshevik coup of 7 November 1917, Gorky observed a gardener working the Alexander Park who had cleared snow during the February Revolution while ignoring the shots in the background, asked people during the July Days not to trample the grass and was now chopping off branches, leading Gorky to write that he was "stubborn as a mole, and apparently as blind as one too".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=318}} Gorky's relations with the Bolsheviks became strained, however, after the [[October Revolution]]. One contemporary remembered at how Gorky would turn "dark and black and grim" at the mere mention of Lenin.{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=330}} Gorky wrote that Lenin together with Trotsky "have become poisoned with the filthy venom of power", crushing the rights of the individual to achieve their revolutionary dreams.{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=330}} Gorky wrote that Lenin was a "cold-blooded trickster who spares neither the honor nor the life of the proletariat. ... He does not know the popular masses, he has not lived with them".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=330}} Gorky went on to compare Lenin to a chemist experimenting in a laboratory with the only difference being the chemist experimented with inanimate matter to improve life while Lenin was experimenting on the "living flesh of Russia".{{sfn|Moynahan|1992|p=330}} A further strain on Gorky's relations with the Bolsheviks occurred when his newspaper ''[[Novaya Zhizn (Mensheviks)|Novaya Zhizn]]'' (''Новая Жизнь'', "''New Life''") fell prey to Bolshevik censorship during the ensuing civil war, around which time Gorky published a collection of essays critical of the Bolsheviks called ''Untimely Thoughts'' in 1918. (It would not be re-published in Russia until after the collapse of the Soviet Union.) The essays call Lenin a tyrant for his senseless arrests and repression of free discourse, and an anarchist for his conspiratorial tactics; Gorky compares Lenin to both the Tsar and [[Sergey Nechayev|Nechayev]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1921, he hired a secretary, [[Moura Budberg]], who later became his mistress. In August 1921, the poet [[Nikolay Gumilev]] was arrested by the Petrograd [[Cheka]] for his [[monarchist]] views. There is a story that Gorky hurried to Moscow, obtained an order to release Gumilev from Lenin personally, but upon his return to Petrograd he found out that Gumilev had already been shot – but [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], a close friend of Gumilev's widow, [[Anna Akhmatova]] wrote that: "It is true that people asked him to intervene. ... Gorky had a strong dislike of Gumilev, but he nevertheless promised to do something. He could not keep his promise because the sentence of death was announced and carried out with unexpected haste, before Gorky had got round to doing anything."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandelstam |first1=Nadezhda |title=Hope Against Hope, a Memoir |date=1971 |publisher=Collins & Harvill |location=London |isbn=0-00-262501-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/hopeagainsthopem00mand/page/110 110] |url=https://archive.org/details/hopeagainsthopem00mand/page/110 }}</ref> In October, Gorky returned to Italy on health grounds: he had [[tuberculosis]].

=== Povolzhye famine ===
In July 1921, Gorky published an appeal to the outside world, saying that millions of lives were menaced by crop failure. The [[Russian famine of 1921–22]], also known as [[Volga region|Povolzhye]] famine, killed an estimated 5 million, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheBlackBookofCommunism10/the-black-book-of-communism-jean-louis-margolin-1999-communism#page/n71/|title=The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression|last1=Courtois|first1=Stéphane|last2=Werth|first2=Nicolas|last3=Panné|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Paczkowski|first4=Andrzej|last5=Bartošek|first5=Karel|last6=Margolin|first6=Jean-Louis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780674076082|pages=123}}</ref> [[Herbert Hoover]], then head of the [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA) expedition responded.

===Second exile===
Gorky left Russia in September 1921, for Berlin. There he heard about the impending [[1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries|Moscow Trial of 12 Socialist Revolutionaries]], which hardened his opposition to the Bolshevik regime. He wrote to [[Anatole France]] denouncing the trial as a "cynical and public preparation for the murder" of people who had fought for the freedom of the Russian people. He also wrote to the Soviet vice-premier, [[Alexei Rykov]] asking him to tell [[Leon Trotsky]] that any death sentences carried out on the defendants would be "premeditated and foul murder."{{sfn |McSmith |2015 |p=86}} This provoked a contemptuous reaction from Lenin, who described Gorky as "always supremely spineless in politics", and Trotsky, who dismissed Gorky as an "artist whom no-one takes seriously.{{sfn |McSmith |2015 |p=82}} He was denied permission by Italy's fascist government to return to Capri, but was permitted to settle in Sorrento, where he lived from 1922 to 1932, with an extended household that included Moura Budberg, his ex-wife Andreyeva, her lover, [[Pyotr Kryuchkov]], who acted as Gorky's secretary for the remainder of his life, Gorky's son Max Peshkov, Max's wife, Timosha, and their two young daughters.

He wrote several successful books while there,<ref>{{cite book|author=Tova Yedlin|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|publisher=Praeger |page=229|year=1999}}</ref> but by 1928 he was having difficulty earning enough to keep his large household, and began to seek an accommodation with the communist regime. The General Secretary of the Communist Party [[Joseph Stalin]] was equally keen to entice Gorky back to the USSR. He paid his first visit in May 1928 – at the very time when the regime was staging its first show trial since 1922, the so-called [[Shakhty Trial]] of 53 engineers employed in the coal industry, one of whom, Pyotr Osadchy, had visited Gorky in Sorrento. In contrast to his attitude to the trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries, Gorky accepted without question that the engineers were guilty, and expressed regret that in the past he had intervened on behalf of professionals who were being persecuted by the regime. During the visit, he struck up friendships with [[Genrikh Yagoda]] (deputy head of the [[OGPU]]) and two other OGPU officers, Semyon Firin and Matvei Pogrebinsky, who held high office in the [[Gulag]]. Pogrebinsky was Gorky's guest in Sorrento for four weeks in 1930. The following year, Yagoda sent his brother-in-law, [[Leopold Averbakh]] to Sorrento, with instructions to induce Gorky to return to Russia permanently.{{sfn |McSmith |2015 |pp=84–88}}

===Return to Russia===
[[File:Avel Enukidze Joseph Stalin and Maxim Gorky Red Square 1931.jpg|right|thumb|[[Avel Enukidze]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and Maxim Gorky celebrate the 10th anniversary of [[Red Sport International|Sportintern]]. Red Square, Moscow USSR. August 1931]]

Gorky's return from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] was a major propaganda victory for the Soviets. He was decorated with the [[Order of Lenin]] and given a mansion (formerly belonging to the millionaire [[Pavel Ryabushinsky]], which was for many years the [[Gorky Museum]]) in Moscow and a [[dacha]] in the suburbs. The city of Nizhni Novgorod, and the surrounding province were renamed Gorky. [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Moscow's main park]], and one of the central Moscow streets, Tverskaya, were renamed in his honour, as was the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. The largest fixed-wing aircraft in the world in the mid-1930s, the [[Tupolev ANT-20]] was named ''Maxim Gorky'' in his honour.

He was also appointed President of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]], founded in 1932, to coincide with his return to the USSR. On 11 October 1931 Gorky read his fairy tale poem "A Girl and Death" (which he wrote in 1892) to his visitors [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], an event that was later depicted by Viktor Govorov in his [[#Gallery|painting]]. On that same day Stalin left his autograph on the last page of this work by Gorky: "This piece is stronger than [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']] (love defeats death)" Voroshilov also left a "resolution": "I am illiterate, but I think that Comrade Stalin more than correctly defined the meaning of A. Gorky's poems. On my own behalf, I will say: I love M. Gorky as my and my class of writer, who correctly defined our forward movement".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maximgorkiy.narod.ru/PHOTOS/6/stalin.jpg |title=Scan of the page from "A Girl And Death" with autograph by Stalin |access-date=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907055526/www.maximgorkiy.narod.ru/PHOTOS/6/stalin.jpg |archive-date=7 September 2012 }}</ref>

As [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] remembers, Gorky was very upset:
{{quote|They wrote their resolution on his fairy tale "A Girl and Death". [[Vsevolod Ivanov|My father]], who spoke about this episode with Gorky, insisted emphatically that Gorky was offended. Stalin and Voroshilov were drunk and fooling around. }}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Горький: страсти по Максиму|last=Basinsky|first=Pavel|publisher=АСТ}}</ref>

===Apologist for the gulag===
In 1933, Gorky co-edited, with Averbakh and Firin, an infamous book about the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]], presented as an example of "successful rehabilitation of the former enemies of proletariat". For other writers, he urged that one obtained realism by extracting the basic idea from reality, but by adding the potential and desirable to it, one added romanticism with deep revolutionary potential.<ref>R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p188 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}</ref> For himself, Gorky avoided realism. His denials that even a single prisoner died during the construction of the aforementioned canal was refuted by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] who claimed thousands of prisoners froze to death not only in the evenings from the lack of adequate shelter and food, but even in the middle of the day. Most tellingly, Solzhenitsyn and [[Dmitry Likhachov]] document a visit, on June 20, 1929 to [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], the “original” forced labour camp, and the model upon which thousands of others were constructed. Given Gorky's reputation, (both to the authorities and to the prisoners), the camp was transformed from one where prisoners (Zeks) were worked to death to one befitting the official Soviet idea of “transformation through labour”. Gorky did not notice the relocation of thousands of prisoners to ease the overcrowding, the new clothes on the prisoners (used to labouring in their underwear), or even the hiding of prisoners under tarpaulins, and the removal of the torture rooms. The deception was exposed when Gorky was presented with children “model prisoners”, one of who challenged Gorky if he “wanted to know the truth”. On the affirmative, the room was cleared and the 14-year-old boy recounted the truth - starvation, men worked to death, and of the pole torture, of using men instead of horses, of the summary executions, of rolling prisoners, bound to a heavy pole down stairs with hundreds of steps, of spending the night, in underwear, in the snow. Gorky never wrote about the boy, or even asked to take the boy with him. The boy was executed after Gorky left.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Воспоминания|last=Likhachov|first=Dmitry|publisher=Logos|year=1995|pages=183–188}}</ref> Gorky left the room in tears, and wrote in the visitor book “I am not in a state of mind to express my impressions in just a few words. I wouldn’t want, yes, and I would likewise be ashamed to permit myself the banal praise of the remarkable energy of people who, while remaining vigilant and tireless sentinels of the Revolution, are able, at the same time, to be remarkably bold creators of culture”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gulag Archepelago|last=Solzhenitsyn|first=Alexander|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2007 |pages=199–205}}</ref>[[File:M Dmitrovka Ryabushinsky Schechtel side.jpg|right|thumb|On his definitive return to the Soviet Union in 1932, Maxim Gorky received the Ryabushinsky Mansion, designed in 1900 by [[Fyodor Schechtel]] for the Ryabushinsky family. The mansion today houses a museum about Gorky.]]

As Gorky's biographer [[Pavel Basinsky]] notes, it was impossible for Gorky to "take the boy with him" even with his reputation of a "great proletarian writer". As he says, Gorky had to spent over 2 years to free [[Julia Danzas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2018/02/18/basinskij-pravda-istorii-ne-sovpadaet-s-nashimi-predstavleniiami-o-nej.html|title=Басинский: Правда истории не совпадает с нашими представлениями о ней|website=Российская газета}}</ref> Some of the Solovki historians doubt that there was a boy. 

Gorky also helped other political prisoners (not without the influence of his wife, [[Yekaterina Peshkova]]). For example, because of Gorky's interference [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s initial verdict (5 years of Solovki) was changed to 6 years of exile.

===Hostility to homosexuality===
{{see also|Gay fascism}}
Gorky strongly supported efforts in getting a law passed in 1934, making [[homosexuality]] a criminal offense. His attitude was coloured by the fact that some members of the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung]] were homosexual. The phrase "exterminate all homosexuals and fascism will vanish" is often attributed to him.{{sfn |McSmith |2015 |p=160}}<ref name="Lingiardi 2002 p. 89">{{cite book |last=Lingiardi |first=Vittorio |author-link= Vittorio Lingiardi |translator-last1=Hopcke |translator-first1=Robert H. |translator-last2=Schwartz |translator-first2=Paul |title=Men in Love: Male Homosexualities from Ganymede to Batman |year=2002 |publisher=Open Court |publication-place=Chicago, IL, US |isbn=9780812695151 |oclc=49421786 |page=89 |chapter=6.

=== Gorky and the Soviet censorship ===
{{quote|And in my opinion, he ([[Vladislav Khodasevich]]) is right when he says that the Soviet critics have made up an anti-Soviet play from ''[[The Days of the Turbins|The Turbin Brothers]]''. [[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov]] is "not a brother" to me; I have no a slightest desire to defend him. But he is a talented writer, and we don't have many people like that.

Сталину. &#124; Документы XX века|website=doc20vek.ru}}</ref>}}
Gorky was following Bulgakov's literary career since 1925, when he first read ''[[The Fatal Eggs]]''. According to his letters, even then he admired his talent. Partly because of Gorky Bulgakov's plays ''[[The Cabal of Hypocrites]]'' and ''The Days of the Turbins'' were allowed for staging.<ref>{{cite book

===Conflicts with Stalinism===
Gorky's relationship with the regime got colder after his return to the Soviet Union in 1933: the Soviet authorities would never let him out in Italy again. He continued to write the propagandist articles in ''Pravda'' and glorify Stalin. However, by 1934 his relationship with the regime was getting more and more distant. [[Leopold Averbakh]], whom Gorky regarded as a protege, was denied a role in the newly created Writers Union, and objected to interference by the Central Committee staff in the affairs of the union{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}; Gorky's conception of "Socialist realism" and creation of the Writers Union, instead of ending the RAPP "literary dictatorship" and uniting the "proletarian" writers with the denounced "poputchicks" becomes a tool to increase the censorship. This conflict, which may have been exacerbated by Gorky's despair over the early death of his son, Max, came to a head just before the first Soviet Writers Congress, in August 1934.

His meetings with Stalin were getting more rare. At that time he gets influenced by [[Lev Kamenev]], who was made the director of '' [[Academia (Soviet publishing house)|Academia]]'' publishing House because of Gorky's request, and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who had been Gorky's friend since 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=|title=Время Горького и проблемы истории: ''Горький. Материалы и исследования''» Выпуск 14 |date=2018 |publisher=ИМЛИ РАН |location=Moscow|isbn=978-5-9208-0515-7}}</ref> On 11 August, Gorky submitted an article for publication in ''Pravda'' which attacked the deputy head of the press department, [[Pavel Yudin]] with such intemperate language that Stalin's deputy, [[Lazar Kaganovich]] ordered its suppression, but was forced to relent after hundreds of copies of the article circulated by hand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Gorky's draft of the keynote speech he was due to give at the congress caused such consternation when he submitted it to the Politburo that four of its leading members – Kaganovich, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and [[Andrei Zhdanov]] – were sent to persuade him to make changes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=R.W.Davies |first1=et al (editors) |title=The Stalin-Kaganovich Correspondence 1931–36 |date=2003 |publisher=Yale U.P |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-09367-5 |pages=249–253}}</ref>
{{quote|Yesterday we, having familiarized ourselves with M. Gorky's speech to the Congress of Writers, came to the conclusion that the speech is not suitable in this form. First of all - the very construction and arrangement of the material - 3/4, if not more, is occupied by general historical and philosophical reasoning, and even then incorrect. Primitive society is presented as the ideal, and capitalism at all of its stages is portrayed as a reactionary force that hindered the development of technology and culture. It is clear that this position is non-Marxist. Soviet literature is almost not covered, but the speech is called "On Soviet Literature." <...> ...after a long talk he agreed to make some edits and changes. It seems that he is in a bad mood. <...> The point, of course, is not what he says, but how he says it. These talks have reminded me of [[Nadezhda Krupskaya|comrade Krupskaya]]. I think that [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] plays an important role in shaping these sentiments of Gorky. <...>

He also wrote an article about Panferov's novel ''Brusski'': "One could, of course, not note the verbal errors and careless technique of the gifted writer, but he acts as an adviser and teacher, and he teaches the production of literary waste".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://az.lib.ru/g/gorxkij_m/text_1934_po_povodu_odnoy_diskussii.shtml|title=Lib.ru/Классика: Горький Максим. По поводу одной дискуссии|website=az.lib.ru}}</ref>

Gorky also tried to fight the Soviet censorship as it was growing more power. For example, he tried to defend an issue of Dostoevsky's ''Demons''.

As the conflict was becoming more visible, Gorky's political and literary positions became weaker. Panferov wrote an answer to Gorky, in which he criticized him. David Zaslavsky published an ironical response to Gorky's defense of ''Demons''. 

According to some sources (such as [[Romain Rolland]]'s diary), because of Gorky's refusal to blindly obey the policies of Stalinism, he had lost the Party' s goodwill and spent his last days under unannounced house arrest.<ref>Tovah Yedlin. ''[https://archive.org/details/MaximGorkyAPoliticalBiography/ Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography]''</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Kremlin Wall Necropolis - Gorky, Maxim 04.jpg|thumb|Grave of Maxim Gorky in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]]]
With the increase of [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repression and especially after the assassination of [[Sergei Kirov]] in December 1934, Gorky was placed under unannounced house arrest in his house near Moscow in [[Gorki-10]] (the name of the place is a completely different word in Russian unrelated to his surname). His long-serving secretary [[Pyotr Kryuchkov]] had been recruited by Yagoda as a paid informer.{{sfn |McSmith |2015 |p=91}} Before his death from a lingering illness in June 1936, he was visited at home by Stalin, Yagoda, and other leading communists, and by Moura Budberg, who had chosen not to return to the USSR with him but was permitted to stay for his funeral.

The sudden death of Gorky's son Maxim Peshkov in May 1934 was followed by the death of Maxim Gorky himself in June 1936 from pneumonia. Speculation has long surrounded the circumstances of his death. Stalin and [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] were among those who carried Gorky's urn during the funeral. During the [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]] trial in 1938 (one of the three [[Moscow Trials]]), one of the charges was that Gorky was killed by [[Genrikh Yagoda|Yagoda]]'s [[NKVD]] agents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neworleans.media.indypgh.org/uploads/2007/02/the.treason.case.18feb07.pdff4mrvk.pdf|title=New Orleans Media}}</ref>

In Soviet times, before and after his death, the complexities in Gorky's life and outlook were reduced to an iconic image (echoed in heroic pictures and statues dotting the countryside): Gorky as a great Soviet writer who emerged from the common people, a loyal friend of the Bolsheviks, and the founder of the increasingly canonical "[[socialist realism]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}
