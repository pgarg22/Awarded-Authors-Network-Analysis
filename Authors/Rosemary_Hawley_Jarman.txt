'''Rosemary Hawley Jarman''' (27 April 1935 – 17 March 2015) was an English novelist and writer of short stories. Her first novel in 1971 shed light on [[King Richard III]] of England.

==Life==
Jarman was born in [[Worcester, England|Worcester]]. She was educated first at Saint Mary's Convent and then at The Alice Ottley School, leaving at 18 to study singing in [[London]] for the next three years, having developed a fine soprano voice.

Family circumstances prevented her from continuing with this, and she worked for a time in local government. She married David Jarman in 1958, but divorced amicably from him in 1970. She lived most of her time at [[Callow End]], [[Worcestershire]], between Worcester and [[Upton on Severn]].

Jarman lived for 18 years with the prize-winning naturalist author R. T. Plumb in a [[West Wales]] cottage. They married in September 2002, but Plumb died of cancer in October 2003.

==Writings==
Jarman began to write for pleasure. She developed an obsession with the character of [[King Richard III]] (1452–1485, reigned 1483–1485), and with no thought of publication completed a 228,000 word novel showing the king in his true colours, away from Tudor and Shakespearian propaganda. The book was taken up almost accidentally by an agent. Within six weeks a contract for its publication and for four other novels was signed with William Collins Publishers (now [[Harper Collins]]).

The author had short stories published in magazines in the UK and France and was a member of the [[Society of Authors]] from 1970. She was dubbed "A Daughter of Mark Twain" by the [[Samuel Clemens Society]] in the US for her services to literature.
