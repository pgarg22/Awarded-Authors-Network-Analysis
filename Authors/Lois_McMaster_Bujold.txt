==Biography==
[[File:Bujold2012.png|thumb|Bujold at [[Finncon]] 2012 in [[Tampere]]]]
Bujold is the daughter of [[Robert Charles McMaster]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dendarii.com/tribute.html |title=A Tribute to Robert Charles McMaster |website=Dendarii.com |access-date=2021-08-07 |archive-date=2020-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221123149/http://www.dendarii.com/tribute.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1384&page=266 |title=Memorial Tributes: Volume 3 |chapter=Robert Charles McMaster |pages=266–271 |last=Jaffee |first=Robert I| year=1989 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727045810/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1384&page=266 |archive-date=2015-07-27 |url-status=live}}</ref> and attributes her early interest in science fiction, as well as certain aspects of the [[Vorkosigan Saga]], to his influence. He was editor<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-0318215020 |title=Nondestructive Testing Handbook (9780318215020): Robert C. McMaster: Books |last1=McMaster |first1=Robert C. |date=June 1959 }}</ref> of the ''Nondestructive Testing Handbook''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Third Edition NDT Handbook|work = The American Society for Nondestructive Testing|url = http://www.asnt.org/publications/handbook/third/thirdedition.htm|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120904181446/http://www.asnt.org/publications/handbook/third/thirdedition.htm|archive-date = 2012-09-04}}</ref>

Bujold writes that her experience growing up with a famous father is reflected in the same experience that her characters (Miles, Fiametta) have of growing up in the shadow of a "[[Great Man theory|Great Man]]".  Having observed this tendency in both genders, she wonders why it is always called "great man's son syndrome", and never "great man's daughter's syndrome."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bujold|first=Lois Mcmaster|title=Young Miles|year=1997|publisher=BAEN|page=830}}</ref> Her brother, an engineer like their father, helped provide technical details to support her writing of ''[[Falling Free]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bujold |first=Lois McMaster |chapter=Foreword |title=Miles, Mutants and Microbes |type=omnibus edition |location=Paragraphs 11 & 13 |year=2007}}</ref>

She has stated that she was always a "voracious reader".<ref name="LMBbiolog">{{Cite web|url=http://dendarii.com/biolog.html|title=Lois McMaster Bujold, Biolog|website=dendarii.com|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-date=2019-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321130416/http://www.dendarii.com/biolog.html|url-status=live}}</ref> She started reading adult science fiction at the age of nine, picking up the habit from her father. She became a member of [[science fiction fandom]], joined the [[Central Ohio Science Fiction Society]], and co-published ''StarDate'', a [[science fiction fanzine]] in which a story of hers appeared under the byline Lois McMaster. Her reading tastes later expanded and she stated she now reads "history, mysteries, romance, travel, war, poetry, etc".<ref name="LMBbiolog" />

She attended [[Ohio State University]] from 1968 to 1972. While she was interested in writing, she didn't pursue an English major, feeling it was too concerned with literary criticism instead of literary creation.<ref name="LMBbiolog" />

She married John Fredric Bujold in 1971, but they divorced in the early 1990s. The marriage produced two children, a daughter named Anne (born 1979) and a son named Paul (born 1981).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dendarii.com/locus.html |title=Locus Lois McMaster Bujold Biography |publisher=Dendarii.com |access-date=2014-01-28 |archive-date=2013-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803145021/http://www.dendarii.com/locus.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Anne Bujold is currently (January 2020) Artist-In-Residence for the Metals Department at the Appalachian Center for Craft, a campus of [[Tennessee Technological University|Tennessee Tech]];<ref>{{cite web |url= https://annebujold.com/ |title= Anne Bujold |last= Bujold |first= Anne |date= 2019-12-26 |website= Rivited [sic] Rabbit Studio |publisher= Anne Bujold |access-date= 2020-03-26 |quote= Bujold is currently the Artist-In-Residence for the Metals Department at the Appalachian Center for Craft in Smithville, TN. |archive-date= 2020-03-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200326200145/https://annebujold.com/ |url-status= live }}</ref> formerly she was a metal artist and welder in Portland, Oregon<ref>{{cite web |url=https://craftedincarhartt.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/anne-the-riveter-and-her-riveted-rabbit/ |title=Ann the Riveter and her Riveted Rabbit |date=5 June 2014 |publisher=CraftedInCarhartt.com |access-date=2015-12-26 |archive-date=2015-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130183459/https://craftedincarhartt.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/anne-the-riveter-and-her-riveted-rabbit/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and vice president of the Northwest Blacksmith Association.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blacksmith.org/wp-content/uploads/NWBADocs/2015-01-24-Board-Meeting-Minutes.pdf |work=Northwest Blacksmith Association |title=January 24, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Minutes |publisher=Northwest Blacksmith Association |date=2015-01-24 |access-date=2020-03-26 |quote=Anne Bujold was named Vice President. |archive-date=2020-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326193948/https://blacksmith.org/wp-content/uploads/NWBADocs/2015-01-24-Board-Meeting-Minutes.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bujold currently lives in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spectrumliteraryagency.com/bujold.htm|title=Spectrum Literary Agency - Lois McMaster Bujold|website=www.spectrumliteraryagency.com|publisher=Spectrum Literary Agency|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-date=2019-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224031639/http://www.spectrumliteraryagency.com/bujold.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
Bujold had been friends with [[Lillian Stewart Carl]] since high school, where they "collaborated on extended story lines [but where] only a fragment of the total was written out.".<ref name="LMBbiolog"/> At one point, she even co-produced a ''[[Star Trek]]'' zine called ''StarDate''<ref name="fan_fiction_essay" /> which she wrote for. In college, she wrote a Sherlock Holmes mystery as well.<ref name="fan_fiction_essay" /> However, she stopped writing after that, being busy with marriage, family, and a career in hospital patient care.<ref name="amazingstories">{{Cite web|url=https://amazingstories.com/2013/07/interview-with-award-winning-author-lois-mcmaster-bujold/|title=Interview with Award-Winning Author Lois McMaster Bujold|date=2013-07-03|website=Amazing Stories|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-date=2020-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919021849/https://amazingstories.com/2013/07/interview-with-award-winning-author-lois-mcmaster-bujold/|url-status=live}}</ref>

It wasn't until her thirties<ref name="amazingstories"/> that she returned to writing. Bujold has credited her friend Lillian Stewart Carl's first book sales with inspiring her to return to the field: "it occurred to me that if she could do it, I could do it too."<ref name="LMBbiolog"/> She originally planned to write as a hobby again, but discovered the amount of work required was too much for anything other than a profession, so she decided to turn professional. With support from Carl and [[Patricia Wrede]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dearauthor.com/features/interviews/my-first-sale-by-lois-mcmaster-bujold-she-got-by-with-a-little-help-from-her-friends/|title=My First Sale by Lois McMaster Bujold, She Got By with a Little Help From Her Friends|date=2008-04-25|website=Dear Author|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-date=2020-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918133035/https://dearauthor.com/features/interviews/my-first-sale-by-lois-mcmaster-bujold-she-got-by-with-a-little-help-from-her-friends/|url-status=live}}</ref> she was able to complete her first novel.

==Science fiction==
Lois Bujold wrote three books (''[[Shards of Honor]]'', ''[[The Warrior's Apprentice]]'' and ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'') before ''The Warrior's Apprentice'' was finally accepted, after four rejections. ''The Warrior's Apprentice'' was the first book purchased, though not the first Vorkosigan book written, nor would it be the first one to be published. On the strength of ''The Warrior's Apprentice'', [[Baen Books]] agreed to a three-book deal to include the two bracketing novels. By 2010, [[Baen Books]] claimed to have sold 2 million copies of Bujold's books.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/bujold_interview/| title=A Conversation With Lois McMaster Bujold| author=Jeremy L. C. Jones| magazine=[[Clarkesworld Magazine]]| access-date=2012-04-01| archive-date=2011-09-18| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918115842/http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/bujold_interview/| url-status=live}}</ref>

Bujold is best known for her [[Vorkosigan Saga]], a series of novels featuring [[Miles Vorkosigan]], a physically impaired interstellar [[spy]] and [[mercenary]] admiral from the planet Barrayar, set approximately 1000 years in the future. The series also includes prequels starring Miles' parents, along with companion novels centered on secondary characters. Earlier titles are generally firmly in the [[space opera]] tradition with no shortage of battles, conspiracies, and wild twists, while in more recent volumes, Miles becomes more of a [[detective fiction|detective]]. In ''[[A Civil Campaign]]'', Bujold explores yet another genre: a high-society romance with a plot that pays tribute to [[Regency romance]] novelist [[Georgette Heyer]] (as acknowledged in the dedication). It centers on a catastrophic dinner party, with misunderstandings and dialogue justifying the subtitle "A Comedy of Biology and Manners".

The author has stated that the series structure is modeled after the [[Horatio Hornblower]] books, documenting the life of a single person. In themes and echoes, they also reflect [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' mystery character [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]. Bujold has also said that part of the challenge of writing a series is that many readers will encounter the stories in "utterly random order", so she must provide sufficient background in each of them without being excessively repetitious. Most recent printings of her Vorkosigan tales do include an appendix at the end of each book, summarizing the internal chronology of the series.

Bujold has discussed her own views on the optimum reading order for the Vorkosigan series in her blog.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dendarii.com/reading_order.html| title=The chef recommends| author=Lois McMaster Bujold| access-date=2015-09-23| archive-date=2015-09-23| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213525/http://www.dendarii.com/reading_order.html| url-status=live}}</ref>

==Fantasy==
Bujold also wanted to break into the fantasy genre, but met with early setbacks. Her first foray into fantasy was ''[[The Spirit Ring]]''. She wrote the book "on spec", shopped it around, and found low offers, sending her back to [[Baen Books]], where [[Jim Baen]] bought it for a fair price in exchange for the promise of more Vorkosigan books. Bujold called this experience very educational; the book received little critical acclaim, and had only mediocre sales.

She would not attempt to break into the fantasy market again for almost another decade, with ''[[The Curse of Chalion]]''. This book was also written on spec and offered up to a book auction. This time, she met with considerable critical and commercial success by tapping into a crossover market of fantasy and romance genre fans. The fantasy world of [[Chalion]] was first conceived as a result of a [[University of Minnesota]] course she was taking about [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval Spain]] in her spare time.

The next fantasy world she created was the [[tetralogy]] set in the universe of ''[[The Sharing Knife]]'', borrowing inspiration for its landscapes and for the dialect of the "farmers" from ones she grew up with in central Ohio.<ref name="essays">{{cite book |last1=Lennard |first1=John |title=Lois McMaster Bujold: Essays on a Modern Master of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=(Absent) Gods and Sharing Knives|editor1-last=Croft|editor1-first=Janet Brennan|date=2013 |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-7864-6833-1 |pages=183–184}}</ref> She writes that her first readers who helped proofread it said she got it exactly right and they could recognize Ohio features in the descriptions and [[dialect]]s.

== Relation to fan fiction ==
Bujold has generally been supportive of fan fiction written about her characters and universe. Amy H. Sturgis, in her essay "From Both Sides Now: Bujold and the Fan Fiction Phenomenon",<ref name="fan_fiction_essay">{{cite book |last1=Sturgis|first1=Amy H.|title=Lois McMaster Bujold: Essays on a Modern Master of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=From Both Sides Now: Bujold and the Fan Fiction Phenomenon|editor1-last=Croft|editor1-first=Janet Brennan|date=2013 |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=978-0-7864-6833-1 |pages=16–25}}</ref> notes that this is unusual for writers of Bujold's generation, most of whom are opposed to fan fiction. Sturgis relates this to Bujold's own production of ''Star Trek'' and Sherlock Holmes fan fiction early in her life, which Sturgis saw as an apprenticeship for her professional writing career.

Bujold herself ties her appreciation of fan fiction to her appreciation of "active" readers. To her, good readers are the "unsung collaborators" who make the story work, by actually constructing the world and characters in their heads. Books, to her, don't actually exist until they enter the reader's head and grow there. And sometimes, the characters and stories in a book grow so much that they escape the writer's original confines and become fan fiction. To Bujold, great literature is never "sterile", stopping with only what the original author wrote.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sidelines: Talks and Essays|last=Bujold|first=Lois McMaster|year=2013|chapter=The Unsung Collaborator}}</ref> She further believes that fan fiction gives authors a unique chance to see into the minds of those "invisible collaborators", the readers.<ref name="sidelines_fan_fiction">{{Cite book|title=Sidelines: Talks and Essays|last=Bujold|first=Lois McMaster|year=2013|chapter='Here's Looking At You, Kid...': On Fan Fiction}}</ref>

Despite this, she no longer reads fan fiction about her own characters due to legal and financial concerns, "fascinating as [she] finds it".<ref name="sidelines_fan_fiction" />
