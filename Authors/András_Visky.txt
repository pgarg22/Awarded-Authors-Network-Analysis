His plays have been staged in several countries including Romania, Hungary, France, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, England, Scotland and the United States.
He has a DLA (Doctor of Liberal Arts) from the University of Theatre and Film, Budapest and since 1994 he has lectured at the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] in the Department of Theatre and Television.  He is one of the co-founders and the former executive director of Koinónia Publishing.<ref>[http://www.huntheater.ro/cv.php?soid=1 Official Website of the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj]</ref>

== Childhood ==
Visky's father, Ferenc Visky, was a minister of the Hungarian Reformed Church who in 1958 was sentenced to 22 years in prison and forced labor by the Romanian Communist authorities for "the crime of organization against socialist public order."<ref>[http://www.koinonia.ro/?konyv=30&kategoria= Ferenc Visky, ''The Foolishness of God''. Cluj: Koinónia Publishing, 2010]</ref>  Shortly after, his wife and their seven children were deported<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.filmintezet.hu/uj/kiadvanyok/filmevkonyv/2004/dokfilm_e.htm |title=''Két hét pihenõ (Two Weeks Off).''

In 1964, his father and other political prisoners were released during a short-lived period of relative thaw in which the regime relaxed its repressive policies.  Visky himself was released the same year along with his mother and siblings.

== Professional life ==
Visky joined the [http://www.huntheater.ro Hungarian Theatre of Cluj] as dramaturg in 1990.  This was also the beginning of his long professional collaboration with [[Gábor Tompa]], the artistic director of the theatre.  The pair have worked together on innumerable performances, including plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov, Ionesco, Caragiale, Gombrowicz and Beckett, and Tompa has directed Visky's ''Júlia'', ''Tanítványok'', ''Hosszú péntek'', ''Visszaszületés'' and ''Alkoholisták''.  Visky has also worked with directors [https://web.archive.org/web/20091218063111/http://www.teatrul-odeon.ro/eng/oameni/regizori/galgotiu.htm Dragoş Galgoţiu], [[Mihai Măniuţiu]], Robert Raponja, David Zinder, [[Robert Woodruff (director)|Robert Woodruff]] and [[Karin Coonrod]].

For the 2009–2010 academic year, Visky was the Spoelhof Chair at [[Calvin College]], Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he taught courses in playwriting and Hungarian and Romanian theatre.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2009/11/two_playwrights_to_close_out_w.html Michigan Live, November 29, 2009]</ref> He has also led workshops or taught as a guest lecturer at the [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design]] (Budapest), [[Northern Illinois University]] (DeKalb IL), the [[University of Michigan]] (Kalamazoo MI), the [[University of California, San Diego]] (CA), [[Yale School of Drama]] (New Haven CT), [[Károli Gáspár University]] (Budapest), [[Josai International University]] (Tokyo, Japan), and [[Osaka University]] (Osaka, Japan).

== Plays ==
Over the course of his play writing, Visky has developed what he terms a "barrack dramaturgy".<ref>[http://clubs.calvin.edu/chimes/article.php?id=4841 Chimes, Apriŀ 23, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928213905/http://clubs.calvin.edu/chimes/article.php?id=4841 |date=September 28, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-09-14/entertainment/ct-live-0914-juliet-review-20100914_1_juliet-war-era-gulag Chicago Tribune, September 14, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415658492/ András Visky, "Barrack-dramaturgy and the captive audience" in ''The Routledge Companion to Dramaturgy'' edited by Magda Romanska.
