'''Arturo Pérez-Reverte Gutiérrez''' (born 25 November 1951 in [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]) is a Spanish novelist and journalist.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://biblioteca.ucm.es/escritores/arturo_perez_reverte/ |title=Arturo Pérez Reverte |access-date=29 March 2018 |language=es |work=[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]] |author=Vicerrectorado de Innovación de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid}}</ref>  He worked as a [[war correspondent]] for [[RTVE]] and was a war correspondent for 21 years (1973–1994). His first novel, ''El húsar'', set in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], was released in 1986.  

He is well known outside Spain for his "[[El Capitán Alatriste|Alatriste]]" series of novels, which have been translated into multiple languages. Since 2003 he has been a member of the [[Royal Spanish Academy]].

==Writing==
Pérez-Reverte's novels are usually centered on one strongly defined character, and his plots move along swiftly, often featuring a narrator who is part of the story but apart from it. Most of his novels take place in Spain or around the [[Mediterranean]]. They often draw on numerous references to [[Spanish history]], [[Spanish Empire|colonial past]], art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea. The novels frequently deal with some of the major issues of modern Spain, such as drug trafficking or the relationship of religion and politics.

Often, Pérez-Reverte's novels have two plots running in parallel with little connection between them except for shared characters.  For example, in ''[[The Club Dumas]]'', the protagonist is searching the world for a lost book and keeps meeting people who parallel figures from [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]]'s novels; in ''[[The Flanders Panel]]'', a contemporary serial killer is juxtaposed with the mystery of a 500-year-old assassination.

In his often polemical newspaper columns and the main characters of his novels, Pérez-Reverte frequently expresses pessimism about human behaviour, shaped by his wartime experiences in such places as [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]], [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatia]] or [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.xlsemanal.com/firmas/20070609/perez-reverte-fantasmas-de-los-balcanes.html |title=Fantasmas de los Balcanes |last=Pérez-Reverte |first=Arturo |date=9 June 2007 |access-date=4 August 2018 |magazine=XL Semanal |language=es |publisher=Taller de Editores}}</ref> His views have also been shaped by his research for crime shows.

Throughout his career, and especially in its latter half, he has been noted for cultivating his  trademark maverick, non-partisan and at times abrasive persona. This has occasionally been a source of conflict with other journalists and writers.<!-- First two sentences are covered by this cite --><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/periodismo/tv/2011/02/21/perez-reverte-arremete-contra-maria-antonia-iglesias-y-pilar-rahola-son-joyas-de-la-telemierda-viven-de-la-demagogia-pseudofeminista-imbecil.shtml |title=Pérez-Reverte arremete contra María Antonia Iglesias y Pilar Rahola: "Son joyas de la telemierda. Viven de la demagogia pseudofeminista imbécil" |last=Perezagua |first=Irene |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=4 August 2018 |work=Periodista Digital |language=es}}</ref> He originally refused to have his novels translated from the original Spanish to any language other than French. However, English translations were eventually published for some of his works, and most of his work is also available in Portuguese and Polish.

Pérez-Reverte was elected to seat ''T'' of the [[Real Academia Española]] on 23 January 2003; he took up his seat on 12 June the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rae.es/academicos/arturo-perez-reverte-gutierrez |title=Arturo Pérez-Reverte Gutiérrez |language=es |work=[[Real Academia Española]] |access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Awards and recognition ===
*''The Painter of Battles'' was the winner of the 2008 [[Premio Gregor von Rezzori]] award for foreign fiction translated into Italian.
*In 2016 Pérez-Reverte was named as one of the 10 most important writers of the year by the Spanish national newspaper ''ABC'', alongside novelists including [[Eduardo Mendoza Garriga|Eduardo Mendoza]] and [[Andrés Pascual]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rioja2.com/n-108237-2-andres-pascual-entre-los-10-mejores-escritores-del-ano/|title=Rioja news - 10 Best Writers}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nuevecuatrouno.com/2016/12/27/andres-pascual-los-diez-mejores-escritores-del-2016-abc/|title=ABC Spain, 27/12/2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:PacoLucía-Reverte-Jerez-Dsc03028.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Sherry barrel signed by Pérez-Reverte]]
Pérez-Reverte started his journalistic career writing for the now-defunct newspaper ''Pueblo'' and then for [[Televisión Española]] (the Spanish state-owned television broadcaster), often as a war correspondent. Becoming weary of the internal affairs at TVE, he resigned as a journalist and decided to work full-time as a writer.

His teenage daughter Carlota was billed as a co-author of his first Alatriste novel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/el-capitan-alatriste_arturo-y-carlota-perez-reverte.html |title=El capitán Alatriste; Arturo y Carlota Pérez-Reverte |author=Irene |access-date=4 August 2018 |work=[[Rincón del Vago]] |language=es}}</ref> He lives between La Navata (near Madrid) and his native Cartagena, from where he enjoys sailing solo in the Mediterranean. He is a friend of [[Javier Marías]], who presented Pérez-Reverte with the title of Duke of Corso of the [[Kingdom of Redonda]] micro nation.

His nephew [[Arturo Juan Pérez-Reverte]] is a professional footballer playing for [[FC Cartagena]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/2013/09/27/futbol/mas_futbol/1380272444.html |title=El Alatriste de La Mancha |newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]] |language=es |date=27 September 2013 |access-date=29 May 2017 |last=Rodríguez |first=Ángel |publisher=[[Unidad Editorial]]}}</ref>

==Controversies==

Mexican novelist Verónica Murguía accused Arturo Pérez-Reverte of plagiarizing her work. On 10 November 1997 Murguía published a short story, titled "Historia de Sami", in the magazine ''El laberinto urbano''. Months later, in March 1998, Pérez-Reverte published a story in ''El Semanal'', with the title "Un chucho mejicano", bearing close similarities in narration, chronology, phrases, and in the anecdote. Pérez-Reverte's story was recently republished in a re-compilation for the text ''Perros e hijos de perra'' (Alfaguara), and Murguía noticed the plagiarism at that time. Murguía would not proceed with a legal case but asked for an apology and the removal of the story from his text.  Meanwhile, Pérez-Reverte apologized and noted that the story he published he wrote exactly as it was told to him by writer Sealtiel Alatriste.<ref name="vanguardia.com.mx">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/veronicamurguiaatribuyeelplagiodeuntextoaperezreverte-2286507.html |title=Verónica Murguía atribuye el plagio de un texto a Pérez-Reverte |access-date=20 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331220848/http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/veronicamurguiaatribuyeelplagiodeuntextoaperezreverte-2286507.html |archive-date=31 March 2015 |work=Vanguardia |language=es}}</ref>

Pérez-Reverte's script for the film ''Gitano'' in the late 1990s also brought another charge of plagiarism against him. In May 2011 the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid ordered Pérez-Reverte and Manuel Palacios, director and co-writer of ''Gitano'', to pay 80,000 euros to filmmaker Antonio González-Vigil, who had sued them for alleged plagiarism of the film's script. Pérez-Reverte described this decision as "a clear ambush" and a "clear manoeuvre to extort money."<ref>{{cite news|author=EFE|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2011/05/06/actualidad/1304632809_850215.html|title=El escritor Arturo Pérez-Reverte, condenado a pagar 80.000 euros por plagio|date=6 May 2011|newspaper=[[El País]]|access-date=22 October 2011|url-status=live|publisher=Prisa|location=Madrid|language=es|trans-title=Writer Arturo Pérez-Reverte ordered to pay 80,000 euros for plagiarism|author-link=EFE}}</ref> The ruling contradicted two previous criminal rulings, and one from a merchant judiciary which had all decided in favor of  Pérez-Reverte and Palacios. In July 2013 the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid ordered Pérez-Reverte to pay 200,000 euros to González-Vigil for plagiarism.<ref name="vanguardia.com.mx"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Gómez|first=Xabi|url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20130716/mas-actualidad/cultura/reverte-condenado-plagio-201307152113.html|title=Arturo Pérez-Reverte paga más de 200.000 euros por el plagio de un guión|date=16 July 2013|newspaper=[[El Correo]]|access-date=4 August 2018|url-status=live|publisher=[[Vocento]]|location=Bilbao|language=es|trans-title=Arturo Pérez-Reverte pays more than 200,000 euros for plagiarising a script}}</ref>
