==Biography==
Guru Arjan was born in [[Goindval]] to Bibi Bhani and Jetha Sodhi. Bibi Bhani was the daughter of [[Guru Amar Das]], and her husband Jetha Sodhi later came to be known as [[Guru Ram Das]].

The alternate versions include stories about the role of Guru Arjan in a conflict between the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and his son who Jahangir suspected of trying to organize a patricidal coup. An alternate version highlights the role of a Hindu minister of Jahangir named Chandu Shah. He, in one version, takes revenge on Guru Arjan for not marrying his son Hargobind to Chandu Shah's daughter. In another Lahore version, Chandu Shah actually prevents Guru Arjan from suffering torture and death by Muslims by paying 200,000 rupees (100,000 crusados) to Jahangir, but then keeps him and emotionally torments him to death in his house.<ref>Kirpal Singh (2000), Perspectives on Sikh Gurus, National Book Shop, pp. 125-127</ref> Several alternative versions of the story try to absolve Jahangir and the Mughal empire of any responsibility,<ref name=ps6/><ref>Pashaura Singh (2011), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/11_InResponse.pdf Reconsidering the Sacrifice of Guru Arjan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022617/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/11_InResponse.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}, Journal of Punjab Studies, University of California Press, 18(1&2), pp. 295-316</ref> but have no trace or support in the documentary evidence from early 17th century, such as the records of Jesuit priest Jerome Xavier and the memoirs of Jahangir.<ref name=ps5/><ref name=thackston/><ref>Louis E.

===Amritsar===
Guru Arjan's father Guru Ram Das founded the town named after him "Ramdaspur", around a large man-made water pool called "Ramdas Sarovar". Guru Arjan continued the infrastructure building effort of his father. The town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan, financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The pool area grew into a temple complex with the [[gurdwara]] [[Harmandir Sahib]] near the pool. Guru Arjan installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new temple in 1604.<ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"/> The city that emerged is now known as [[Amritsar]], and is the holiest pilgrimage site in Sikhism.<ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"/><ref name="McLeod1990p28">{{cite book|author=W.H. McLeod|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xIT7OMSJ44C&pg=PA28 |year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56085-4|pages=28–29}}</ref>

Continuing the efforts of Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan established Amritsar as a primary Sikh pilgrimage destination. He wrote a voluminous amount of Sikh scripture including the popular [[Sukhmani Sahib]]. Guru Arjan is credited with completing many other infrastructure projects, such as water reservoirs called ''Santokhsar'' (lake of peace) and ''Gongsar'' (lake of Gongaga), founding the towns of Tarn Taran, Kartarpur and Hargobindpur.<ref name=mandair42>{{cite book|author=Mohinder Singh Joshi|title=Guru Arjan Dev |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCQaSH_29i4C&pg=PA6 |year= 1994| publisher=Sahitya Akademi| isbn=978-81-7201-769-9|pages=6–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1|pages=42–43}}</ref>

====Community expansion====
While having completing the [[Harmandir Sahib]] with ''[[dasvand]]'' donations during the first decade of his guruship between 1581 and 1589, creating a rallying point for the community and a center for Sikh activity, and a place for the installment of the [[Adi Granth]], Guru Arjan had also gone on a tour of [[Majha]] and [[Doaba]] in Punjab, where he would found the towns. Due to their central location in the Punjab heartland, the ranks of Sikhs would swell, especially among the Jatt peasantry, and create a level of prosperity for them; Guru Arjan would serve not only as a spiritual mentor but as a sovereign leader (''sacchā pādshāh'') for his followers in his own right.<ref name=mandair42/>

===Adi Granth===
According to the Sikh tradition, Guru Arjan compiled the Adi Granth by collecting hymns of past Gurus from many places, then rejecting those that he considered as fakes or to be diverging from the teachings of the Gurus.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mohinder|first1=Joshi|title=Guru Arjan Dev|date=1994|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=9788172017699|page=4}}</ref> His approved collection included hymns from the first four Gurus of Sikhism, those he composed, as well as 17 Hindu bards and 2 Muslim bards.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mohinder|first1=Joshi|title=Guru Arjan Dev|date=1994|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=9788172017699|pages=4–5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Nikky-Guninder Kaur|title=Sikhism: An Introduction|date=2011|location=New York|page=30}}</ref> The compilation was completed on August 30, 1604, according to the Sikh tradition and installed in the Harmandir Sahib temple on September 1, 1604.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Largen|first1=Kristin|title=Finding God Among our Neighbors, Volume 2: An Interfaith Systematic Theology|date=2017|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781506423302|page=39}}</ref>

Guru Arjan was a prolific poet and composed 2,218 hymns. More than half of the volume of ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the largest collection of hymns has been composed by Guru Arjan. According to Christopher Shackle and Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, Guru Arjan's compositions combined spiritual message in an "encyclopedic linguistic sophistication" with "Braj Bhasha forms and learned Sanskrit vocabulary".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher Shackle|author2=Arvind Mandair|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvoJV8mw0LwC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45101-0|pages=xviii–xix, xxii}}</ref>

After Guru Arjan completed and installed the Adi Granth in the Harimandir Sahib, Emperor Akbar was informed of the development with the allegation that it contained teachings hostile to Islam. He ordered a copy be brought to him. Guru Arjan sent him a copy on a ''thali'' (plate), with the following message that was later added to the expanded text:

{{Quote|
<poem>
In this ''thali'' (dish) you will find three things – truth, peace and contemplation:
in this too the nectar [[Nāma|Name]] which is the support of all humanity.

The ''[[Akbarnama]]'' by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl Allami]] mentions that Guru Arjan met the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] and his cortege in 1598. According to Louis Fenech, this meeting likely influenced the development of Sikh [[manuscriptology]] and the later martial tradition.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|pages=45–46|publisher=Oxford University Press| editor=Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech|author=Louis Fenech| year= 2014| isbn= 978-0-19-969930-8}}</ref>

One of the Sikh community disputes following Guru Ram Das was the emergence of new hymns claiming to have been composed by Nanak. According to the faction led by Guru Arjan, these hymns were distorted and fake, with some blaming Prithi Chand and his Sikh faction for having composed and circulated them.<ref name="Syan2013p50"/><ref>{{cite book|author=W.H. McLeod|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xIT7OMSJ44C&pg=PA29 |year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56085-4|pages=29–30}}</ref> The concern and the possibility of wrong propaganda, immoral teachings and inauthentic ''Gurbani'' led Guru Arjan to initiate a major effort to collect, study, approve and compile a written official scripture, and this he called ''Adi Granth'', the first edition of the Sikh scripture by 1604.<ref name=fenech39/><ref name=pashaura171/>

The composition of both Prithi Chand and his followers have been preserved in the Mina texts of Sikhism, while the mainstream and larger Sikh tradition adopted the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' scripture that ultimately emerged from the initiative of Guru Arjan.<ref name=pashaura171/><ref name="Syan2013p52-54">{{cite book|author=Hardip Singh Syan|title=Sikh Militancy in the Seventeenth Century: Religious Violence in Mughal and Early Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RzzxcEL4C0C&pg=PA52|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78076-250-0|pages=52–54}}</ref>
