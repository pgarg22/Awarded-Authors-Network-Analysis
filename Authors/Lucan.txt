'''Marcus Annaeus Lucanus''' (3 November 39 AD – 30 April 65 AD), better known in [[English language|English]] as '''Lucan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|k|ən}}), was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[poet]], born in Corduba (modern-day [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]), in [[Hispania Baetica]]. He is regarded as one of the outstanding figures of the [[Classical Latin#Imperial Latin|Imperial Latin]] period, known in particular for his epic ''[[Pharsalia]]''. His youth and speed of composition set him apart from other poets.

==Life==
Three brief ancient accounts allow for the reconstruction of a modest biography – the earliest attributed to [[Suetonius]], another to an otherwise unknown [[Vacca (grammarian)|Vacca]], and the third anonymous and undated – along with references in [[Martial]], [[Cassius Dio]], [[Tacitus]]'s ''Annals'', and one of [[Statius]]'s ''Silvae''.  Lucan was the son of [[Marcus Annaeus Mela]] and grandson of [[Seneca the Elder]]; he grew up under the tutelage of his uncle [[Seneca the Younger]].  Born into a wealthy family, he studied rhetoric at Athens<ref>{{cite book |last=Suetonius |author-link=Suetonius |title=The Life of Lucan |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/de_Poetis/Lucan*.html }}</ref> and was probably provided with a philosophical and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] education by his uncle.

He found success under [[Nero]], became one of the emperor's close friends and was rewarded with a quaestorship in advance of the legal age. In 60 AD, he won a prize for extemporizing ''Orpheus'' and ''Laudes Neronis'' at the [[quinquennial Neronia]], and was again rewarded when the emperor appointed him to the augurate. During this time he circulated the first three books of his epic poem ''[[Pharsalia]]'' (labelled ''De Bello civili'' in the manuscripts), which told the story of the [[Roman Civil War|civil war]] between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]].

At some point, a feud began between Nero and Lucan. Two very different accounts of the events have survived that both trivialize the feud. According to Tacitus, Nero became jealous of Lucan and forbade him to publish his poems.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XV.49</ref> According to Suetonius, Nero disrupted a public reading by Lucan, by leaving and calling a meeting of the senate, and Lucan responded by writing insulting poems about Nero.<ref>{{cite book |last=Suetonius |author-link=Suetonius  |title=The Life of Lucan |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/de_Poetis/Lucan*.html }}</ref>

Other works, though, point to a more serious basis to the feud. Works by the grammarian Vacca and the poet Statius may support the claim that Lucan wrote insulting poems about Nero. Vacca mentions that one of Lucan's works was entitled ''De Incendio Urbis'' (On the Burning of the City).<ref>Vacca, ''Life of Lucan''</ref> Statius's ode to Lucan mentions that Lucan described how the "unspeakable flames of the criminal tyrant roamed the heights of Remus."<ref>Statius, ''[[Silvae]]'' II.vii</ref> Additionally, the later books of ''Pharsalia'' are anti-Imperial and pro-Republic. This criticism of Nero and office of the Emperor may have been the true cause of the ban.

Lucan later joined the 65 AD conspiracy of [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso (conspirator)|Gaius Calpurnius Piso]] against Nero. The conspiracy was discovered and he was obliged, at the age of 25, to commit [[suicide]] by opening a vein, but not before incriminating his mother, among others, in the hopes of a [[pardon]].  According to Tacitus, as Lucan bled to death, "(he) recalled some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded soldier dying a similar kind of death and he recited the very lines. These were his last words."<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XV.70.1.  Scholars have vainly tried to locate Lucan's last words in his work but no passage in Lucan's extant poem exactly matches Tacitus's description at "Annals" 15.70.1.  See, e.g., P. Asso, "A Commentary on Lucan 'De Bello Civili IV.'" Berlin: De Gruyter, 2010, p. 9n38.</ref>

His father was involved in the [[proscription]] but his mother escaped. Statius's poem about Lucan was addressed to his widow, Polla Argentaria, upon the occasion of his birthday during the reign of [[Domitian]] (''Silvae'', ii.7, the ''Genethliacon Lucani'').
