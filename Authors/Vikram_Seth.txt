==Early life and education==
Seth was born on 20 June 1952 in [[Calcutta]]. His father, Prem Nath Seth, was an executive of [[Bata Shoes]] and his mother, [[Leila Seth]], a [[barrister]] by training, became the first female judge of the [[Delhi High Court]] and first woman to become Chief Justice of a state High Court in India.<ref name="Atkins2002">{{cite book|author=Angela Atkins|title=Vikram Seth's Suitable Boy: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqiNnpMOxlYC&pg=PA7|date=26 June 2002|publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-5707-3|page=7}}</ref>

He received his primary education at [[St. Xavier's High School, Patna|St. Xavier's High School]] in [[Patna]], and then went to [[The Doon School ]] in [[Dehradun]], where he was editor-in-chief of ''[[The Doon School Weekly]]''.<ref name="Seth2007">{{cite book|author=Leila Seth|title=On Balance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8byMR-HFBMC&pg=PT137|date=7 February 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-055-3|pages=137–}}</ref> At Doon, he was influenced by his teacher, the mountaineer [[Gurdial Singh (mountaineer)|Gurdial Singh]], who taught him geography and, according to Leila Seth, "guided Vikram in many ways...encouraged him to appreciate Western classical music and instilled in him a love of adventure and daring."<ref name="Seth2007">{{cite book|author=Leila Seth|title=On Balance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8byMR-HFBMC&pg=PT137|date=7 February 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-055-3|pages=137–}}</ref> Singh later described Seth as an "indefatigable worker, and he maintains without difficulty his distinguished level in studies...he has put in enormous amount of energy in other spheres of school life, in dramatics, in debating, in first aid, in music, and in editing the Doon School Weekly."<ref name="Seth2007" /> After graduating from Doon, Seth went to [[Tonbridge School]], England, to complete his [[A-levels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/mar/27/books.guardianreview1 |title=A suitable joy &#124; Books |work=The Guardian |date=26 March 1999 |access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=Vikram Seth's Suitable Boy: A Reader's Guide|author=Atkins, A.|date=2002|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9780826457073|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqiNnpMOxlYC&pg=PA8|page=8|access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref>  Later he read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

==Work and style==
Seth has published eight books of poetry and three novels. In 1980, he wrote ''[[Mappings (poetry)|Mappings]]'', his first book of poetry. The publication of ''[[A Suitable Boy]]'', a 1,349-page novel, propelled Seth into the public limelight. It was adapted into a BBC television drama miniseries in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Suitable Boy: BBC miniseries|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000lbh9}}</ref> His second novel, ''[[An Equal Music]],'' deals with the troubled love-life of a violinist. Seth's work ''[[Two Lives (non-fiction)|Two Lives]],'' published in 2005, is a memoir of the marriage of his great-uncle and aunt.

In addition to ''[[The Golden Gate (Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]],'' Seth has written other works of poetry including ''[[Mappings (poetry)|Mappings]]'' (1980), ''[[The Humble Administrator's Garden]]'' (1985), ''[[All You Who Sleep Tonight]]'' (1990) and ''[[Three Chinese Poets]]'' (1992). His children's book, ''[[Beastly Tales from Here and There]]'' (1992) consists of 10 stories about animals. He has written a travel book, ''From Heaven Lake: Travels through Sinkiang and Tibet'' (1983), an account of a journey through [[Tibet]], China and [[Nepal]]. He was also commissioned by the [[English National Opera]] to write a libretto based on the Greek legend of [[Arion]] and the Dolphin. The opera was performed for the first time in June 1994.

A sequel to ''A Suitable Boy,'' ''[[A Suitable Girl]]'', was announced in 2009.

==Life and career==
Seth's former literary agent [[Giles Gordon]] recalled being interviewed by Seth for the position, "Vikram sat at one end of a long table and he began to grill us. It was absolutely incredible. He wanted to know our literary tastes, our views on poetry, our views on plays, which novelists we liked".<ref name="guardiansaturday">{{citation |title=A suitable joy |date=27 March 1999 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/mar/27/books.guardianreview1 |periodical=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=5 September 2007 |first=Jeremy |last=Gavron |location=London}}."</ref> Seth later explained to Gordon that he had passed the interview not because of commercial considerations, but because unlike the others he was the only agent who seemed as interested in his poetry as in his other writing. Seth followed what he has described as "the ludicrous advance for that book" (£250,000 for ''A Suitable Boy'')<ref>{{cite news |last1=Flood |first1=Alison |title=Vikram Seth writes Suitable Boy sequel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/03/vikram-seth-suitable-boy-sequel#:~:text=There's%20no%20word%20yet%20as,to%20his%20most%20popular%20novel.&text=Seth%20described%20the%20time%20shift,in%20an%20interview%20with%20Reuters. |access-date=25 September 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=3 July 2009 |language=en}}</ref> with £500,000 for ''An Equal Music'' and £1.4&nbsp;million for ''Two Lives''.<ref name="rediff">{{citation |title=Seth to get at least $3 million advance |first=Shyam |last=Bhatia |date=1 September 2003 |access-date=5 September 2007 |work=[[Rediff.com]] |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/sep/01seth.htm?zcc=rl}}</ref> He prepared an [[acrostic]] poem<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/vikram_seth_tribute.html |title=Curtis Brown |access-date=26 February 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815212235/http://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/vikram_seth_tribute.html |archive-date=15 August 2004 }}</ref> for his address at Gordon's 2005 memorial service.<ref name="poemhunter">{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/vikram-seth/biography/|title=Vikram Seth – Vikram Seth Biography – Poem Hunter|publisher=poemhunter.com|access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref>
