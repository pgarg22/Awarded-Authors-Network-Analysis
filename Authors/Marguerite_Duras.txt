'''Marguerite Germaine Marie Donnadieu''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁɡ(ə)ʁit ʒɛʁmɛn maʁi dɔnadjø}}, 4 April 1914 – 3 March 1996), known as '''Marguerite Duras''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁɡ(ə)ʁit dyʁas|lang}}), was a French novelist, playwright, screenwriter, essayist, and experimental filmmaker. Her script for the film ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'' (1959) earned her a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[Academy Awards]].

==Early life and education==
Duras was born Marguerite Donnadieu on 4 April 1914, in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Gia Định]],<ref name=bnf>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb119013498.public|title=Bnf: Notice de personne: Duras, Marguerite ((1914–1996)|language=fr|access-date=18 September 2018}}</ref> [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], [[French Indochina]] (now [[Vietnam]]). Her parents, Marie (née Legrand, 1877–1956) and Henri Donnadieu (1872–1921), were teachers from France who likely had met at Gia Định High School.<ref name="NYTObit">{{cite news|last1=Riding|first1=Alan|title=Marguerite Duras, 81, Author Who Explored Love and Sex|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/04/nyregion/marguerite-duras-81-author-who-explored-love-and-sex.html|access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Adler|first=Laure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRxxlYQTzNYC|title=Marguerite Duras: A Life|date=2000-12-15|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-00758-8|language=en}}</ref> They both had previous marriages. Marguerite had two older brothers: Pierre, the elder, and Paul.

Duras' father fell ill and he returned to France, where he died in 1921. Between 1922 and 1924, the family lived in France while her mother was on administrative leave. They then moved back to [[French Indochina]] when she was posted to [[Phnom Penh]] followed by [[Vĩnh Long]] and [[Sa Đéc]]. The family struggled financially, and her mother made a bad investment in an isolated property and area of rice farmland in [[Prey Nob District|Prey Nob]],<ref name="NYTObit" /> a story which was fictionalized in ''[[The Sea Wall (novel)|Un barrage contre le Pacifique]]'' (''The Sea Wall'').

In 1931, when she was 17, Duras and her family moved to France where she successfully passed the first part of the baccalaureate with the choice of Vietnamese as a foreign language, as she spoke it fluently. Duras returned to [[Saigon]] in late 1932 where her mother found a teaching post. There, Marguerite continued her education at the Lycée Chasseloup-Laubat and completed the second part of the baccalaureate, specializing in philosophy.

In autumn 1933, Duras moved to Paris, graduating with a degree in public law in 1936. At the same time, she took classes in mathematics.  She continued her education, earning a ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' (DES) in public law and, later, in political economy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=André|first=Labarrère|title=Marguerite Duras|publisher=Editions de l'Herne|year=2005|isbn=2851971492|pages=364}}</ref> After finishing her studies in 1937, she found employment with the French government at the Ministry of the Colonies. In 1939, she married the writer [[Robert Antelme]], whom she had met during her studies.<ref name="NYTObit" />

During World War II, from 1942 to 1944, Duras worked for the [[Vichy government]] in an office that allocated paper quotas to publishers and in the process operated a ''de facto'' book-censorship system. She also became an active member of the [[French Communist Party|PCF]] (the [[French Communist Party]])<ref name="NYTObit" /> and a member of the [[French Resistance]] as a part of a small group that also included [[François Mitterrand]], who later became President of France and remained a lifelong friend of hers.<ref name="NYTObit" /> Duras' husband, [[Robert Antelme|Antelme]], was deported to [[Buchenwald]] in 1944<ref name=deport>{{cite web|language=fr

She nursed him back to health, but they divorced once he recovered.

In 1943, when publishing her first novel, she began to use the surname Duras, after the town that her father came from, [[Duras, Lot-et-Garonne]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kushner|first=Rachel|title="A Man and a Woman, Say What You Like, They're Different": On Marguerite Duras|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-man-and-a-woman-say-what-you-like-theyre-different-on-marguerite-duras|access-date=2020-09-29|website=[[The New Yorker]]|language=en-us}}</ref>

In 1950, her mother returned to France from Indochina, wealthy from property investments and from the boarding school she had run.<ref name=":0" />

==Career==
Duras was the author of many novels, plays, films, interviews, essays, and works of short fiction, including her best-selling, highly fictionalized autobiographical work ''[[The Lover (Duras novel)|L'Amant]]'' (1984), translated into English as ''The Lover'', which describes her youthful affair with a Chinese-Vietnamese man. It won the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academie-goncourt.fr/?article=1229180042|title=Le Palmarès|website=Académie Goncourt}}</ref> The story of her adolescence also appears in three other books: ''The Sea Wall'', ''Eden Cinema'' and ''The North China Lover''. A [[The Lover (1992 film)|film version]] of ''The Lover'', produced by [[Claude Berri]] and directed by [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], was released in 1992. Duras's novel ''[[The Sea Wall (novel)|The Sea Wall]]'' was first adapted into the 1958 film ''[[This Angry Age]]'' by [[René Clément]], and again in 2008 by Cambodian director [[Rithy Panh]] as ''[[The Sea Wall (film)|The Sea Wall]]''.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Other major works include ''[[Moderato Cantabile]]'' (1958), which was the basis of the 1960 film ''[[Seven Days... Seven Nights]]''; ''[[Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein]]'' (1964); and her play ''India Song'', which Duras herself later directed as [[India Song|a film in 1975]]. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'', which was directed by [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/217-hiroshima-mon-amour|title=The Criterion Collection – Hiroshima Mon Amour|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> Duras's early novels were fairly conventional in form, and were criticized for their "romanticism" by fellow writer [[Raymond Queneau]]; however, with ''Moderato Cantabile'', she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the ''[[nouveau roman]]'' French [[literary movement]], although she did not belong definitively to any one group. She was noted for her command of dialogue.<ref name="brit">{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Marguerite Duras|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174178/Marguerite-Duras|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|access-date=4 April 2012|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>

In 1971, Duras signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]], thereby publicly announcing that she had had an abortion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidem.org/themes/egalite_hommes_femmes/ega_infos/eclairages/ega_k003.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010423084113/http://www.cidem.org/themes/egalite_hommes_femmes/ega_infos/eclairages/ega_k003.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-04-23|title=manifeste des 343|date=2001-04-23|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>

Many of her works, such as ''Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein'' and ''[[L'Homme assis dans le couloir]]'' (1980), deal with human sexuality.<ref>Alex Hughes, "Erotic Writing" in Hughes and Keith Reader,
''Encyclopedia of contemporary French culture'', (pp. 187–88). London, Routledge, 1998, {{ISBN|0415131863}}</ref>

Towards the end of her life, Duras published a short, 54-page autobiographical book as a goodbye to her readers and family. The last entry was written on August 1, 1995 and read "I think it is all over. That my life is finished. I am no longer anything. I have become an appalling sight. I am falling apart. Come quickly. I no longer have a mouth, no longer a face".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/04/nyregion/marguerite-duras-81-author-who-explored-love-and-sex.html|title=Marguerite Duras, 81, Author Who Explored Love and Sex|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1996-03-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Duras died at her home in Paris on March 3, 1996, aged 81.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Passion into Prose: Obituary: Marguerite Duras|last=Coward|first=David|date=March 4, 1996|work=The Guardian|page=12}}</ref>

==Personal life==
During the latter stages of World War Two she experienced separation from her husband Robert Antelme owing to his imprisonment in Buchenwald . She wrote [[La Douleur|''La Douleur'']] during his captivity. While married to Antelme, Duras acted on her belief that fidelity was absurd. She created a ''[[ménage à trois]]'' when she started an affair with the writer [[Dionys Mascolo]], who fathered her son Jean Mascolo.<ref name="Vircondelet">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-03-19-9503190038-story.html|title=Overstepping Boundaries: A Life of Maguerite Duras|last=Vircondelet|first=Alain|date=1996-03-15|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>

During the final two decades of Duras’ life, she experienced various health problems. Starting in 1980 she was hospitalized for the first time, from a combination of alcohol and tranquilizers.<ref name="Vircondelet"/> She was also undergoing various detoxification procedures to help her recover from her alcohol addiction. After being hospitalized in October 1988 she fell into a coma that lasted until June 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/duras-marguerite-1914-1996|title=Duras, Marguerite (1914–1996)
|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>

Paralleling her health problems in the 1980s, Duras began having a relationship with a homosexual actor named [[Yann Andréa]].<ref name="Vircondelet"/> Yann Andréa helped Duras through her health difficulties. Duras would later detail these interactions and companionship in her final book ''Yann Andréa Steiner''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/duras-marguerite-1914-1996|title=Duras, Marguerite (1914–1996)|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>

Duras’ health continued to decline into the 1990s, resulting in her death on March 3, 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/duras-marguerite-1914-1996|title=Duras, Marguerite (1914–1996)
