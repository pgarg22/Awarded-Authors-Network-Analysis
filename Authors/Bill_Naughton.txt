{{unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
His stage play, ''[[Alfie (play)|Alfie]]'', adapted for the [[Alfie (1966 film)|1966 film]] starring [[Michael Caine]] in the eponymous role, originated in a radio play, ''Alfie Elkins and His Little Life'', first broadcast on the [[BBC Third Programme]] in 1962, which became a production at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in 1963. It transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] before a very brief run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Naughton was a prolific writer of plays, novels, short stories and children's books. His preferred environment was working-class society, which is reflected in much of his written work.

In addition to ''Alfie'', two of his other plays have been made into feature films, ''[[All in Good Time (play)|All in Good Time]]'' (1963), filmed as ''[[The Family Way]]'' (1966), starring [[John Mills]], and ''[[Spring and Port Wine]]'' (1970), starring [[James Mason]] in the role of Rafe Crompton, an adaptation of a play first performed in 1959. His novel ''Alfie Darling'', the sequel to his earlier novel and play, [[Alfie Darling|was also filmed]], with [[Alan Price]] succeeding Michael Caine in the lead role. Both ''Alfie'' and ''Alfie Darling'' were drawn upon for the [[Alfie (2004 film)|2004 film]] with Jude Law in the eponymous role.

His work also includes the novel ''One Small Boy'' (1957), and the collection of short stories ''The Goalkeeper's Revenge And Other Stories'' (1961). His 1977 children's novel ''My Pal Spadger'' is an account of his childhood in 1920s Bolton.

Many of his plays were performed at the [[Octagon Theatre, Bolton]].  An 85-seat adaptable studio theatre within the Octagon is named after him.

==Awards==
During his lifetime, he received the following awards:
*Screenwriters Guide Award (1967 and 1968)
*Italia Prize for Radio Play (1974)
*Children's Rights Workshop Other Award (1978)
