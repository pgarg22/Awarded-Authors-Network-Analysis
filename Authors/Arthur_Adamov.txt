'''Arthur Adamov''' (23 August 1908 – 15 March 1970) was a [[playwright]], one of the foremost exponents of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/5080/Arthur-Adamov|title=Arthur Adamov: Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Esslin|first=Martin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7iQNBOp7Q4C&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&q=Arthur+Adamov&hl=en|title=The Theatre of the Absurd|date=2009-04-02|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-54801-6|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Adamov (originally Adamian) was born in [[Kislovodsk]] in the [[Terek Oblast]] of the [[Russian Empire]] to a wealthy [[Armenians|Armenian]] family.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:92</sup> At the outbreak of the First World War, the family was at risk of being interned as 'enemy citizens', and only 'through the special intervention of the King of Wurttemberg' were they able to escape to Geneva, Switzerland.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:93</sup> Adamov was educated in Switzerland and Germany,<ref name=":0" /><sup>:93</sup> with [[French language|French]] as his primary language. In 1924, when he was sixteen years old, he moved to [[Paris]].<ref name=":0" /><sup>:93</sup> There he met artists associated with the [[surrealist|Surrealist Movement]] and edited the surrealist journal ''[[Discontinuité]]''.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:93</sup>

== Postwar career ==
He began to write [[Play (theatre)|plays]] at the end of [[World War II]].<ref name=":0" /><sup>:98</sup> ''[[La Parodie]]'' (1947) was his first play, which Martin Esslin has identified as 'an attempt to come to terms with neurosis, to make psychological states visible in concrete terms.'<ref name=":0" /><sup>:98</sup> His work, influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}and August Strindberg,<ref name=":0" /><sup>:98</sup> is often [[dream]]-like and later works in particular have a [[political]] element. The title character of one of his best known works, ''[[Le Professeur Taranne]]'' (1953), is accused of various things (public nudity, littering, plagiarism), all of which he strenuously denies, only to have his denials turned against him into more evidence of [[misdemeanours]]. This particular play was directly influenced by a dream Adamov had.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Lesser known to the public is his prose work with short stories like ''Fin Août'' (in ''Je... Ils...'', 1969). Their themes revolve around topics like [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], which the author regarded as "immunisation against death". Adamov translated a number of works by German authors ([[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], [[Georg Büchner|Büchner]]) and Russian classics ([[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]) into French.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

[[Algerian War|The Algerian war]] radicalised his political views and in the 1960s he became a [[Communism|Communist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oberonbooks.com/arthur-adamov.html|title=Arthur Adamov|website=Oberon Books|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12|archive-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707132037/https://www.oberonbooks.com/arthur-adamov.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During his later years, he began to [[alcohol (drug)|drink]] and use drugs.<ref>Albee, Edward, ''The American Dream'', Coward, 1961.</ref>

Adamov's death in 1970 was due to an overdose of [[barbiturates]].<ref>Banarjee, R. B., "The Theatre of the Absurd," in ''Literary Criterion'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1965, pp. 59-62.</ref>
