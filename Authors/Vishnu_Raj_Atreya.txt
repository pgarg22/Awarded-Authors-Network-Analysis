}}</ref> He started his education from Harihar Sanskrit Vidhyapeeth, Khidim (now affiliated to [[Nepal Sanskrit University]]). He then went to India for further education, where he completed undergraduate in Sankhya-Yog-Puran-History from [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Varanasi]]. He finished his master's degree in Navya Vyakarana from [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya]], Varanasi. He further completed master's degree in Nepali and Political Science from [[Tribhuvan University]], [[Nepal]]. He then completed his PhD in Navya Vyakarana from [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya]], [[Varanasi]], [[India]].  He was visiting professor at [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Varanasi]], [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya]], [[Varanasi]], [[India]] and professor at [[Nepal Sanskrit University]], Valmiki Vidyapeeth, [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]].<ref name="pravat"/> He retired after 47 years of teaching.

===Family===
He was married to Guneshwori Acharya (Arya Atreya after marriage) in July 1974.<ref name="pravat"/>

===Health===
In early 2019, Atreya suffered from [[Gallbladder cancer]]. He was admitted to the [[Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre]], [[India]], for four months. He has been undergoing treatment at [[Patan Hospital]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]]. After he was diagnosed with this condition, he started writing a novel titled 'वररुची कात्यायन' (Vararuchi Katyayan) which is in press for publication.

===Death===
Atreya died on July 18, 2020, at the age of 75, due to gallbladder cancer.<ref>[https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/litterateur-lato-sathi-passes-away-at-74/ Litterateur ‘Lato Sathi’ passes away at 74]</ref>

==Latosaathi Title==
[[File:Dr Atreya receiving Pradesh ratna.jpg|thumb|Dr. Atreya was awarded Pradesh Ratna on 2019 for his contribution on Language and Literature.|alt=]]
Although his name is Vishnu Raj Atreya, he introduced himself as 'Latosaathi' since 1963 A.D. He believed that literature itself is mute and a person adds life and sense to it.<ref name="chalise"/> This might be the reason that he added 'Latosaathi' as his literary title. He has expressed this view in his first short-epic 'कपिलवस्तु' (Kapilvastu) as:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
"लिपि छ मूक लेखेनी मूक लेखक पनि स्वयं म मूकै छु।"
</poem>
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
The script is silent, the writing is silent and me being the main writer am also silent. 
</poem>
{{col-end}}

Poet of the nation, [[Madhav Prasad Ghimire]] writes his view on Atreya's Latosathi title as: "I think Atreya was influenced from द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया (dwa suparna sayuja sakhaya) from [[Rigveda]]. The metaphore of that bird of [[Rigveda]] is life that undergoes karma and god who looks after as a witness. As such, Latosathi is that clever friend who looks after his friends as a witness. If I would ask him about this, he would not speak but write sarcasm on deformed society and social Distortion and simply keep on laughing."<ref>{{cite journal 
|last=Ghimire

|page=101

Stone, I consider you to be the form of God.
</poem>
