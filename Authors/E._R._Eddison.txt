'''Eric Rücker Eddison''', [[Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (24 November 1882 – 18 August 1945) was an English [[civil servant]] and author, writing [[epic fantasy]] novels under the name E. R. Eddison. His notable works include ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'' (1922) and the [[Zimiamvian Trilogy]] (1935–1958).

==Biography==
Born in [[Adel, Leeds|Adel]], [[Leeds]], Eddison's early education came from a series of private tutors, whom he shared with the young [[Arthur Ransome]].  Ransome recalls Eddison's daring and Machiavellian methods of getting rid of unpopular teachers in his autobiography.<ref>Arthur Ransome, ''The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome'', ed. R. Hart-Davis (London: Jonathan Cape, 1976), 37–40.</ref>  Afterwards Eddison was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford and joined the Board of Trade in 1906, retiring in 1938 to work full-time on his fiction. He was also a member of the [[Viking Society for Northern Research]].<ref>"Books and Authors", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', 13 June 1926, p.&nbsp;23</ref> During a distinguished career he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George]] in 1924 and a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1929 for public service with the [[Board of Trade]]. He and his wife, Molly Eddison, had one child, a daughter. Their son-in-law, Kenneth Hesketh Higson, a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot, died in an air fight over Italy in the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/quuxa/Eddison/|title=The Works of E.R.

==Writing==
Eddison is best known for the early romance ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'' (1922) and for three volumes set in the imaginary world Zimiamvia, known as the [[Zimiamvian Trilogy]]: ''[[Mistress of Mistresses]]'' (1935), ''[[A Fish Dinner in Memison]]'' (1941), and ''[[The Mezentian Gate]]'' (1958).

Eddison was an occasional member of the [[Inklings]], an informal [[Literature|literary]] discussion group associated with the [[University of Oxford]], and his early works of [[high fantasy]] drew strong praise from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]<ref name="Tolkien_letter_199">J.R.R. Tolkien, ''Letters'', ed. Humphrey Carpenter (Houghton Mifflin, 1981), Letter No. 199.</ref> and [[C. S. Lewis]],<ref>C. S. Lewis, ''On Stories and Other Essays on Literature'', "Tribute to E. R. Eddison.</ref> both of whom were also members of the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inklings-studies.com/web-resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030070635/http://www.inklings-studies.com/web-resources.html |archive-date=30 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Later, these early works would also draw praise from [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].<ref>Ursula Le Guin,  ''The Language of the Night'', "From Elfland to Poughkeepsie".</ref> Tolkien generally approved Eddison's literary style, but found the underlying philosophy unpleasant and unattractive; while Eddison in turn thought Tolkien's views "soft".<ref name="Tolkien_letter_199" /> Other admirers of Eddison's work included [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]], who wrote the introduction to the 1922 edition; [[James Branch Cabell]], who provided a foreword for the 1926 American edition; [[Robert Silverberg]], who described ''The Worm Ouroboros'' as "the greatest high fantasy of them all";<ref>Quoted in ''The Worm Ouroboros'', Millenium [[Fantasy Masterworks]] Series, 2000 (pg. 1).</ref> and [[Clive Barker]].<ref>[[Douglas E. Winter]], ''Clive Barker: The Dark Fantastic'', HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 67, 305.</ref>

Eddison's books are written in a meticulously recreated [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] prose style, seeded throughout with fragments, often acknowledged but often directly copied from his favorite authors and genres: [[Homer]] and [[Sappho]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Norse saga]]s and French medieval lyric poems. Critic Andy Sawyer has noted that such fragments seem to arise naturally from the "barbarically sophisticated" worlds Eddison has created.<ref name="StJames">Andy Sawyer, "Eddison, E(ric) R(ücker)", ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', ed. [[David Pringle]], St. James Press, 1996, {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}}, pp. 176–8.</ref> The books exhibit a thoroughly aristocratic sensibility; heroes and villains alike maintain an Olympian indifference to convention.  Fellow fantasy author [[Michael Moorcock]] wrote that Eddison's characters, particularly his villains, are more vivid than Tolkien's.<ref>[[Michael Moorcock]], ''Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'', {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}, p. 47.</ref>  Others have observed that while it is historically accurate to depict the great of the world trampling on the lower classes, Eddison's characters often treat their subjects with arrogance and insolence, and this is depicted as part of their greatness.<ref>[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}, pp. 132–3.</ref> Indeed, at the end of ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'', the heroes, finding peace dull, pray for – and get – the revival of their enemies, so that they may go and fight them again.<ref>L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}, p. 116.</ref> Fantasy historian [[Brian Attebery]] notes that "Eddison's fantasies uphold a code that is unabashedly [[Nietzschean]]; had he written after World War II, his enthusiasm for supermen and heroic conflict might perhaps have been tempered".<ref name="SFW">Brian Attebury, "E.R. Eddison", ''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror'', ed. [[E. F. Bleiler]], Scribner, 1985. {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}, pp. 529–534</ref>

The Zimiamvia books were conceived not as a trilogy but as part of a larger work left incomplete at Eddison's death.  ''The Mezentian Gate'' itself is unfinished, though Eddison provided summaries of the missing chapters shortly before his death. C. S. Lewis wrote a blurb for the cover of ''The Mezentian Gate'' when it was published calling Eddison's works "first and foremost, of art."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Company They Keep|last = Glyer|first = Diana|publisher = Kent State UP|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-87338-890-0|location = Kent, OH|pages = 13}}</ref> Some additional material from this book was published for the first time in the volume ''Zimiamvia: A Trilogy'' (1992).

Eddison wrote three other books: ''Poems, Letters, and Memories of Philip Sidney Nairn'' (1916), ''[[Styrbiorn the Strong]]'' (1926) and ''Egil's Saga'' (1930). The first was his tribute to a [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] friend, a poet, who, according to this source, died May 18, 1914, age 30, in Malaya, where he was a colonial administrator. According to another, possibly less reliable source, he is said to have died in his youth during [[World War I]].<ref name="StJames"/> The other two relate to the [[Icelandic literature|saga literature]]; the first is a historical novel which retells ''[[Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa]]'' (alluded to in ''[[Eyrbyggja Saga]]'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'').<ref name="SFW" /> The second is a direct translation from ''[[Egil's saga]]'', supplemented with extensive notes, some which explain Eddison's aesthetic and philosophical outlook.<ref name="SFW" />
