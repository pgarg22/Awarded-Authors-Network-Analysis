His spell as haiku poet in residence in the 'Parade of Life' [[ukiyo-e]] (Japanese woodblock prints) exhibition at [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]] as part of the Japan 21 celebrations part-funded by the Japanese Government led to the publication of ''Parade of Life: Poems inspired by Japanese Prints''<ref>[http://www.japan21.org.uk/downloads/jif_pdf/jif18.pdf Japan in Focus Summer 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007054014/http://www.japan21.org.uk/downloads/jif_pdf/jif18.pdf |date=7 October 2011 }}</ref> featuring Japanese woodblock prints alongside haiku written by children and visitors to the museum in workshop with Conneally and co-edited by former British Haiku Society Secretary and haiku poet Alan Summers.<ref name=hsapdf /> The book had launches in [[Bristol]], UK and [[Akita, Akita|Akita]], Japan.
