==Life and career==
===Early years===
García Lorca was born on 5 June 1898, in [[Fuente Vaqueros]], a small town 17&nbsp;km west of [[Granada]], southern Spain.<ref name="Maurerix" /> His father, Federico García Rodríguez, was a prosperous landowner with a farm in the fertile ''vega'' (valley) near Granada and a comfortable villa in the heart of the city. García Rodríguez saw his fortunes rise with a boom in the [[sugar]] industry. García Lorca's mother, Vicenta Lorca Romero, was a teacher. After Fuente Vaqueros, the family moved in 1905 to the nearby town of [[Valderrubio]] (at the time named Asquerosa). In 1909, when the boy was 11, his family moved to the regional capital of Granada, where there was the equivalent of a high school; their best-known residence there is the summer home called the [[Huerta de San Vicente]], on what were then the outskirts of the city of Granada. For the rest of his life, he maintained the importance of living close to the natural world, praising his upbringing in the country.<ref name="Maurerix">Maurer (2001) p. ix</ref> All three of these homes—Fuente Vaqueros, Valderrubio, and Huerta de San Vicente—are today museums.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.patronatogarcialorca.org/casamuseo.php |title=Patronato Federico García Lorca, Fuentevaqueros, Granada, Spain |website=www.patronatogarcialorca.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museolorcavalderrubio.com/ |title=Casa Museo Federico Garcia Lorca – Valderrubio |website=www.museolorcavalderrubio.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://huertadesanvicente.com/recuerdos.php |title=Huerta de San Vicente |website=huertadesanvicente.com}}</ref>

[[File:Federico García Lorca a los seis años de edad.jpg|thumb|García Lorca c. 1904]]
In 1915, after graduating from secondary school, García Lorca attended the [[University of Granada]]. During this time his studies included law, literature, and composition. Throughout his adolescence, he felt a deeper affinity for music than for literature. When he was 11 years old, he began six years of piano lessons with Antonio Segura Mesa, a harmony teacher in the local conservatory and a composer. It was Segura who inspired Federico's dream of a career in music.<ref name=Stevenson2007>{{cite journal |last1=Stevenson |first1=Robert |title='Musical Moments' in the Career of Manuel de Falla's Favorite Friend Federico García Lorca |journal=Inter-American Music Review |volume=17 |issue=1–2 |date=Summer 2007 |pages=265–276 |id={{ProQuest|1310726}} |url=https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/IAMR/article/view/53424/56060 }}</ref> His first artistic inspirations arose from scores by [[Claude Debussy]], [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].<ref name=Stevenson2007/> Later, with his friendship with composer [[Manuel de Falla]], Spanish folklore became his muse. García Lorca did not turn to writing until Segura's death in 1916, and his first prose works, such as "Nocturne", "Ballade", and "Sonata", drew on musical forms.<ref name="Maurerx">Maurer (2001) p. x</ref> His milieu of young intellectuals gathered in El Rinconcillo at the Café Alameda in Granada. In 1916 and 1917, García Lorca traveled throughout [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[León (historical region)|León]], and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in northern Spain, with a professor of his university, who also encouraged him to write his first book, ''{{lang|es|Impresiones y paisajes}}'' (''Impressions and Landscapes''—printed at his father's expense in 1918). [[Fernando de los Rios]] persuaded García Lorca's parents to let him move to the progressive, [[Oxbridge]]-inspired [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid in 1919, while nominally attending classes at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].<ref name="Maurerx" />

===As a young writer===
[[File:Huerta de San Vicente.jpg|thumb|Huerta de San Vicente, summer home of Lorca's family in Granada, Spain, now a museum]]
At the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, García Lorca befriended [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] and many other creative artists who were, or would become, influential across Spain.<ref name="Maurerx" /> He was taken under the wing of the poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], becoming close to playwright [[Eduardo Marquina]] and [[Gregorio Martínez Sierra]], the Director of [[Madrid]]'s Teatro Eslava.<ref name="Maurerx" />

In 1919–20, at Sierra's invitation, he wrote and staged his first play, ''[[The Butterfly's Evil Spell]]''. It was a verse play dramatising the impossible love between a cockroach and a butterfly, with a supporting cast of other insects; it was laughed off the stage by an unappreciative public after only four performances and influenced García Lorca's attitude to the theatre-going public for the rest of his career. He would later claim that ''[[Mariana Pineda (play)|Mariana Pineda]]'', written in 1927, was, in fact, his first play. During the time at the Residencia de Estudiantes, he pursued degrees in law and philosophy, though he had more interest in writing than study.<ref name="Maurerx" />

García Lorca's first book of poems, ''Libro de poemas'', was published in 1921, collecting work written from 1918 and selected with the help of his brother Francisco (nicknamed Paquito). They concern the themes of religious faith, isolation, and nature that had filled his prose reflections.<ref name="Maurerxi">Maurer (2001) p. xi</ref> Early in 1922 at Granada García Lorca joined the composer [[Manuel de Falla]] in order to promote the [[Concurso de Cante Jondo]], a festival dedicated to enhance [[flamenco]] performance. The year before Lorca had begun to write his ''Poema del cante jondo'' ("Poem of the Deep Song", not published until 1931), so he naturally composed an essay on the art of [[flamenco]],<ref>Federico García Lorca, "El cante jondo (Primitivo canto andaluz)" (1922), reprinted in a collection of his essays entitled ''Prosa'' (Madrid: Alianza Editorial 1969, 1972) at 7–34.</ref> and began to speak publicly in support of the ''Concurso''. At the music festival in June he met the celebrated [[Manuel Torre]], a flamenco ''cantaor''. The next year in Granada he also collaborated with Falla and others on the musical production of a play for children, ''La niña que riega la albahaca y el príncipe preguntón'' (''The Girl that Waters the Basil and the Inquisitive Prince'') adapted by Lorca from an Andalusian story.<ref>José Luis Cano, ''García Lorca'' (Barcelona: Salvat Editores 1985) at 54–56 (''Concurso''), at 56–58 (play), and 174.</ref> Inspired by the same structural form of sequence as "Deep Song", his collection ''Suites'' (1923) was never finished and not published until 1983.<ref name="Maurerxi" />

Over the next few years, García Lorca became increasingly involved in Spain's [[avant-garde]]. He published a poetry collection called ''Canciones'' (''Songs''), although it did not contain songs in the usual sense. Shortly after, Lorca was invited to exhibit a series of drawings at the [[Galeries Dalmau#1927: Federico García Lorca|Galeries Dalmau]] in Barcelona, from 25 June to 2 July 1927.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934456&view=dalmau&lang=en |title=Exposició de dibuixos de Federico García Lorca |last=Dalmau |first=Josep |date=July 2, 1927 |place=Barcelona}}</ref> Lorca's sketches were a blend of popular and avant-garde styles, complementing ''Canción''. Both his poetry and drawings reflected the influence of traditional [[Andalusians|Andalusian]] motifs, Cubist syntax, and a preoccupation with sexual identity. Several drawings consisted of superimposed dreamlike faces (or shadows). He later described the double faces as self-portraits, showing "man's capacity for crying as well as winning," inline with his conviction that sorrow and joy were inseparable, just as life and death.<ref name="Stainton">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSPQXJGRt6oC&q=dalmau&pg=PT502 |last=Leslie |first=Stainton |title=Lorca – a Dream of Life |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |date=2013 |isbn=978-1448213443}}</ref>

''Romancero Gitano'' (''Gypsy Ballads'', 1928), part of his Cancion series, became his best known book of poetry.<ref name="Maurerxii">Maurer (2001) p. xii</ref> It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. García Lorca describes the work as a "carved altar piece" of Andalusia with "gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles."<ref name="Maurerxii" /> In 1928, the book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world, and it was only much later that he gained notability as a playwright. For the rest of his life, the writer would search for the elements of Andaluce culture, trying to find its essence without resorting to the "picturesque" or the clichéd use of "local colour".<ref name="Maurerxiii">Maurer (2001) p. xiii</ref>

His second play, ''[[Mariana Pineda (play)|Mariana Pineda]]'', with stage settings by Salvador Dalí, opened to great acclaim in [[Barcelona]] in 1927.<ref name="Maurerx" /> In 1926, García Lorca wrote the play ''[[The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife (play)|The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife]]'', which would not be shown until the early 1930s. It was a farce about fantasy, based on the relationship between a flirtatious, petulant wife and a hen-pecked shoemaker.

[[File:Postal de Federico a Antonio de Luna.jpg|thumb|Postcard from Lorca and Dalí to Antonio de Luna, signed "Federico". "Dear Antonito: In the midst of a delicious ambience of sea, phonographs and cubist paintings I greet you and I hug you. Dalí and I are preparing something that will be 'moll bé.' Something 'moll bonic.' Without realizing it, I have deposited myself in the Catalan. Goodbye Antonio. Say hello to your father. And salute yourself with my finest unalterable friendship. You've seen what they've done with Paquito! (Silence)" Above, penned by Dalí: "Greetings from Salvador Dalí"]]

From 1925 to 1928, he was passionately involved with Dalí.<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: "From 1925 to 1928, García Lorca was passionately involved with Salvador Dalí. The intensity of their relationship led García Lorca to acknowledge, if not entirely accept, his own homosexuality."</ref> Although Dali's friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion,{{efn|For more in-depth information about the Lorca-Dalí connection see ''Lorca-Dalí: el amor que no pudo ser'' and ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dalí'', both by [[Ian Gibson (author)|Ian Gibson]].}} Dalí said he rejected the erotic advances of the poet.<ref name="conversations">{{cite web |last=Bosque |first=Alain |url=http://www.ubu.com/historical/dali/dali_conversations.pdf |title=Conversations with Dalí |date=1969 |pages=19–20 |quote=S.D.: He was homosexual, as everyone knows, and madly in love with me. He tried to screw me twice... I was extremely annoyed, because I wasn't homosexual, and I wasn't interested in giving in. Besides, it hurts. So nothing came of it. But I felt awfully flattered vis-à-vis the prestige. Deep down I felt that he was a great poet and that I owe him a tiny bit of the Divine Dalí's asshole.}}</ref> With the success of "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of a love affair with sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his [[homosexuality]]. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could acknowledge only in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a "gypsy poet". He wrote: "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast."<ref name="Maurerxiii" />

Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when [[surrealist]]s Dalí and [[Luis Buñuel]] collaborated on their 1929 film ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (''An Andalusian Dog''). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself.<ref>Buñuel, Luis. ''My Last Sigh''. Translated by Abigail Israel. University of Minnesota Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8166-4387-3}}. P. 66.</ref> At this time Dalí also met his future wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]]. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to make a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.

In June 1929, García Lorca travelled to the US with Fernando de los Rios on the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], a sister liner to the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].<ref name="Maurerxiv" /> They stayed mostly in New York City, where Rios started a lecture tour and García Lorca enrolled at [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], funded by his parents. He studied English but, as before, was more absorbed by writing than study. He also spent time in [[Vermont]] and later in [[Havana]], Cuba.

His collection ''Poeta en Nueva York'' (''Poet in New York'', published posthumously in 1942) explores alienation and isolation through some graphically experimental poetic techniques and was influenced by the [[Wall Street crash]] which he personally witnessed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/43294226 |last=García Lorca |first=Federico |title=Poeta en Nueva York |place=Madrid |date=1958}}</ref>

This condemnation of urban capitalist society and materialistic modernity was a sharp departure from his earlier work and label as a folklorist.<ref name="Maurerxiv">Maurer (2001) p. xiv</ref> His play of this time, ''[[The Public (play)|El público]]'' (''The Public''), was not published until the late 1970s and has never been published in its entirety, the complete manuscript apparently lost.

===The Second Republic===
[[File:Lorca CloseUp.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Lorca in the [[Plaza de Santa Ana]], Madrid]]
García Lorca's return to Spain in 1930 coincided with the fall of the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].<ref name="Maurerxiv" /> In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic's]] Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to classical Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: "Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part of the life of the people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [La Barraca] are going to give it back to them."<ref name="Maurerxiv" /> His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African-American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action.<ref name="Maurerxiv" /> He wrote "The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart."<ref name="Maurerxiv" />

While touring with ''La Barraca'', García Lorca wrote his now best-known plays, the "Rural Trilogy" of ''[[Blood Wedding]]'', ''[[Yerma]]'' and ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba]]'', which all rebelled against the norms of bourgeois Spanish society.<ref name="Maurerxiv" /> He called for a rediscovery of the roots of European theatre and the questioning of comfortable conventions such as the popular drawing-room comedies of the time. His work challenged the accepted role of women in society and explored taboo issues of homoeroticism and class. García Lorca wrote little poetry in this last period of his life, declaring in 1936, "theatre is poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair."<ref name="Maurerxv">Maurer (2001) pxv</ref>
[[File:Federicogarcialorca1.jpg|thumb|Bust of Federico García Lorca in [[Santoña]], Cantabria]]
Travelling to Buenos Aires in 1933 to give lectures and direct the Argentine premiere of ''Blood Wedding'', García Lorca spoke of his distilled theories on artistic creation and performance in the famous lecture ''Play and Theory of the [[Duende (art)|Duende]]''. This attempted to define a schema of artistic inspiration, arguing that great art depends upon a vivid awareness of death, connection with a nation's soil, and an acknowledgment of the limitations of reason.<ref name="Maurerxv" /><ref>''Arriving Where We Started'' by Barbara Probst, 1998. She interviewed surviving FUE/Barraca members in Paris.</ref>

As well as returning to the classical roots of theatre, García Lorca also turned to traditional forms in poetry. His last poetic work, ''Sonetos de amor oscuro'' (''Sonnets of Dark Love'', 1936), was long thought to have been inspired by his passion for Rafael Rodríguez Rapun, secretary of La Barraca. Documents and mementos revealed in 2012 suggest that the actual inspiration was [[Juan Ramírez de Lucas]], a 19-year-old with whom Lorca hoped to emigrate to Mexico.<ref name="Guardian">{{Citation |last=Tremlett |first=Giles |title=Name of Federico García Lorca's lover emerges after 70 years: Box of mementoes reveals that young art critic Juan Ramírez de Lucas had brief affair with Spanish poet |date=10 May 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/may/10/name-garcia-lover-emerges |place=UK |work=The Guardian}}</ref> The love sonnets are inspired by the 16th-century poet [[San Juan de la Cruz]].<ref name="Maurerxvii">Maurer (2001) pxvii</ref> La Barraca's subsidy was cut in half by the rightist government elected in 1934, and its last performance was given in April 1936.

Lorca spent summers at the Huerta de San Vicente from 1926 to 1936. Here he wrote, totally or in part, some of his major works, among them ''[[When Five Years Pass]]'' (''Así que pasen cinco años'') (1931), ''Blood Wedding'' (1932), ''Yerma'' (1934) and ''Diván del Tamarit'' (1931–1936). The poet lived in the Huerta de San Vicente in the days just before his arrest and assassination in August 1936.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huertadesanvicente.com/e_pre_huerta.php |title=Huerta de San Vicente |publisher=Huerta de San Vicente |access-date=14 August 2012}}</ref>

Although García Lorca's drawings do not often receive attention, he was also a talented artist.<ref>Cecilia J. Cavanaugh "Lorca's Drawings And Poems",</ref><ref>Mario Hernández "Line of Light and Shadow" (trans) 383 drawings</ref>

==Assassination==
Political and social tensions had greatly intensified after the murder of prominent monarchist and anti-[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] spokesman [[José Calvo Sotelo]] by [[Guardia de Asalto|Republican Assault Guards]] ([[Guardia de Asalto|Guardias de asalto]]).<ref>Zhooee,'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 20 July 1936</ref> García Lorca knew that he would be suspect to the rising [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] for his outspoken [[Socialism|socialist]] views.<ref name="Maurerxvii" /> Granada was so tumultuous that it had not had a mayor for months; no one dared accept the job. When Garcia Lorca's brother-in-law, Manuel Fernández-Montesinos, agreed to accept the position, he was assassinated within a week. On the same day he was shot, 18 August, Garcia Lorca was arrested.<ref name="Gibson 1996 255">{{Cite book |last=Gibson |first=Ian |title=El assasinato de García Lorca |publisher=Plaza & Janes |year=1996 |isbn=978-84-663-1314-8 |location=Barcelona |page=255 |language=es}}</ref>

It is thought that García Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia<ref>Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A very short introduction.'' Oxford University. 2006.

Significant controversy exists about the motives and details of Garcia Lorca's murder. Personal, non-political motives have been suggested. García Lorca's biographer, Stainton, states that his killers made remarks about his sexual orientation, suggesting that it played a role in his death.<ref>Stainton, ''Lorca: A Dream of Life''.</ref> Ian Gibson suggests that García Lorca's assassination was part of a campaign of mass killings intended to eliminate supporters of the Leftist Popular Front.<ref name="Gibson 1996 255" /> However, Gibson proposes that rivalry between the right-wing [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA) and the fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falange]] was a major factor in Lorca's death. Former CEDA Parliamentary Deputy [[Ramón Ruiz Alonso]] arrested García Lorca at the Rosales's home, and was the one responsible for the original denunciation that led to the arrest warrant being issued.

It has been argued that García Lorca was apolitical and had many friends in both Republican and Nationalist camps. Gibson disputes this in his 1978 book about the poet's death.<ref name="Gibson 1996 255" /> He cites, for example, ''[[Mundo Obrero]]''{{'}}s published manifesto, which Lorca later signed, and alleges that Garcia Lorca was an active supporter of the Popular Front.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gibson |first=Ian |title=El assasinato de García Lorca |publisher=Plaza & Janes |year=1996 |isbn=978-84-663-1314-8 |location=Barcelona |page=52 |language=es}}</ref> Garcia Lorca read out this manifesto at a banquet in honour of fellow poet [[Rafael Alberti]] on 9 February 1936.

Many anti-communists were sympathetic to Garcia Lorca or assisted him. In the days before his arrest he found shelter in the house of the artist and leading [[FET y de las JONS|Falange]] member [[Luis Rosales]]. Indeed, evidence suggests that Rosales was very nearly shot as well by the Civil Governor Valdés for helping García Lorca. Poet [[Gabriel Celaya]] wrote in his memoirs that he once found García Lorca in the company of [[Falangism|Falangist]] José Maria Aizpurua. Celaya further wrote that Lorca dined every Friday with Falangist founder and leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Arnaud Imatz, "La vraie mort de Garcia Lorca" 2009 40 La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire, 31–34, at pp. 31–2, quoting from the Memoirs}}</ref> On 11 March 1937 an article appeared in the [[Falangist]] press denouncing the murder and lionizing García Lorca; the article opened: "The finest poet of Imperial Spain has been assassinated."<ref>Luis Hurtado Alvarez, Unidad (11 March 1937)</ref> Jean-Louis Schonberg also put forward the 'homosexual jealousy' theory.<ref>{{Cite book |title="Federico Garcia Lorca.

The first published account of an attempt to locate Garcia Lorca's grave can be found in a 1949 book by British Hispanist [[Gerald Brenan]] ''The Face of Spain''.<ref>Gerald Brenan, ''The Face of Spain'', Chapter 6, 'Granada'. (Serif, London, 2010).</ref> However, the grave has remained undiscovered.

==Search for remains==
In the 20th century there was speculation as to the location of Lorca's remains, for example by the hispanists Gerard Brenan and Ian Gibson, but attempts to locate and identify began in the 21st century.  By this time, advances in technology gave scope for identifying remains of victims of Francoist repression. The year 2000 saw the foundation of the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]] which grew out of the quest by a sociologist, Emilio Silva-Barrera, to locate and identify the remains of his grandfather, who was shot by Franco's forces in 1936.

Claims in 2016, by Stephen Roberts, an associate professor in Spanish literature at Nottingham University, and others that the poet's body was buried in a well in Alfacar have not been substantiated.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/13/remains-of-federico-garca-lorca-hidden-at-the-bottom-of-a-well/ |title=Remains of Federico García Lorca 'hidden at the bottom of a well' |website=The Telegraph |last=Badcock |first=James |date=13 April 2016 |access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref>

In 2021 it was reported that there would be an investigation of mass graves at Barranco de Viznar (a locality near [[Víznar]] where there is a memorial to Lorca). This project had the support of families who believe that relatives were buried there. The archaeologist directing the investigation explained that the poet was only one of hundreds of people whose remains might be there.<ref name="Publico">{{Cite news |last=Cano |title=Fusilados en el Barranco |language=Spanish |url=https://www.publico.es/sociedad/fusilados-barranco-viznar-historia-400.html?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Los%20impuestos%20se%20ceban%20con%20las%20familias%20que%20soportan%20ms%20del%2075%20de%20la%20presin%20fiscal&utm_content=Los%20impuestos%20se%20ceban%20con%20las%20familias%20que%20soportan%20ms%20del%2075%20de%20la%20presin%20fiscal+CID_d9988231eaa1a |access-date=17 May 2021}}</ref>

==Censorship==
[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangist]] regime placed a general ban on García Lorca's work, which was not rescinded until 1953. That year, a (censored) ''Obras completas'' (''Complete Works'') was released. Following this, ''Blood Wedding'', ''Yerma'' and ''The House of Bernarda Alba'' were successfully played on the main Spanish stages. ''Obras completas'' did not include his late heavily homoerotic ''Sonnets of Dark Love'', written in November 1935 and shared only with close friends. They were lost until 1983/4 when they were finally published in draft form. (No final manuscripts have ever been found.) It was only after Franco's death that García Lorca's life and death could be openly discussed in Spain. This was due not only to political censorship, but also to the reluctance of the García Lorca family to allow publication of unfinished poems and plays prior to the publication of a critical edition of his works.

South African Roman Catholic poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]], who enthusiastically supported the Nationalists both during and after the Civil War, later produced acclaimed translations of Lorca's work. In his poem, ''The Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca'', Campbell wrote,

<blockquote><poem>
Not only did he lose his life
By shots assassinated:
But with a hammer and a knife
Was after that 
– translated.<ref>Roy Campbell, ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], 1955. Page 283. "On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca."</ref></poem></blockquote>

==Memorials==

In Granada, the city of his birth, the [[Park Federico García Lorca|Parque Federico García Lorca]] is dedicated to his memory and includes the Huerta de San Vicente, the Lorca family summer home, opened as a museum in 1995. The grounds, including nearly two hectares of land, the two adjoining houses, works of art, and the original furnishings have been preserved.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huertadesanvicente.com |title=Huertadesanvicente.com |publisher=Huertadesanvicente.com |access-date=14 August 2012}}</ref> There is a statue of Lorca on the Avenida de la Constitución in the city center, and a cultural center bearing his name is under construction{{when|date=March 2016}} and will play a major role in preserving and disseminating his works.

The Parque Federico García Lorca, in Alfacar, is near Fuente Grande; in 2009 excavations in it failed to locate Lorca's body. Close to the olive tree indicated by some as marking the location of the grave, there is a stone memorial to Federico García Lorca and all other victims of the Civil War, 1936–1939. Flowers are laid at the memorial every year on the anniversary of his death, and a commemorative event including music and readings of the poet's works is held every year in the park to mark the anniversary. On 17 August 2011, to remember the 75th anniversary of Lorca's assassination and to celebrate his life and legacy, this event included dance, song, poetry and dramatic readings and attracted hundreds of spectators.

At the Barranco de Viznar, between Viznar and Alfacar, there is a memorial stone bearing the words "''Lorca eran todos, 18-8-2002''" ("All were Lorca"). The Barranco de Viznar is the site of mass graves and has been proposed as another possible location of the poet's remains.

García Lorca is honored by a statue prominently located in Madrid's [[Plaza de Santa Ana]]. Political philosopher David Crocker reported in 2014 that "the statue, at least, is still an emblem of the contested past: each day, the Left puts a red kerchief on the neck of the statue, and someone from the Right comes later to take it off."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/957.html |title=Democratic Development and Reckoning with the Past: The Case of Spain in Comparative Context |access-date=16 November 2014}}</ref>

In [[Paris]], France, the memory of García Lorca is honored on the Federico García Lorca Garden, in the center of the French capital, on the [[Seine]].

The Fundación Federico García Lorca, directed by Lorca's niece Laura García Lorca, sponsors the celebration and dissemination of the writer's work and is currently{{when|date=March 2016}} building the Centro Federico García Lorca in Madrid. The Lorca family deposited all Federico documents with the foundation, which holds them on their behalf.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.garcia-lorca.org/Home/Idioma.aspx |title=The Lorca Foundation |publisher=Garcia-lorca.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718184329/http://www.garcia-lorca.org/Home/Idioma.aspx |archive-date=18 July 2012 |access-date=14 August 2012}}</ref>

In the Hotel Castelar in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Lorca lived for six months in 1933, the room where he lived has been kept as a shrine and contains original writings and drawings of his.

In 2014 Lorca was one of the inaugural honorees in the [[Rainbow Honor Walk]], a [[List of halls and walks of fame|walk of fame]] in San Francisco's [[Castro District, San Francisco|Castro neighborhood]] noting [[LGBTQ]] people who have "made significant contributions in their fields."<ref name=":022">{{Cite web |url=https://quirkytravelguy.com/lgbt-walk-fame-rainbow-honor-san-francisco/ |title=The Rainbow Honor Walk: San Francisco's LGBT Walk of Fame |last=Shelter |first=Scott |date=14 March 2016 |website=Quirky Travel Guy |language=en-US |access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sfist.com/2014/09/02/castros_rainbow_honor_walk_dedicate/ |title=Castro's Rainbow Honor Walk Dedicated Today|date=2 September 2014 |website=SFist – San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810075052/https://sfist.com/2014/09/02/castros_rainbow_honor_walk_dedicate/ |archive-date=10 August 2019 |access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gaysonoma.com/2016/07/second-lgbt-honorees-selected-for-san-franciscos-rainbow-honor-walk/ |title=Second LGBT Honorees Selected for San Francisco's Rainbow Honor Walk |last=Carnivele |first=Gary |date=2 July 2016 |website=We The People |access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>

===Poetry and novels based on García Lorca===

* Greek surrealist poet and painter [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] wrote the poem: ''News on the death of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca on 19 August 1936 in the ditch of Camino de la Fuente'', a poem that juxtaposes the actual death of a poet and the symbolic death of poets that are depreciated by their contemporaries.
* Greek poet [[Nikos Kavvadias]]'s poem ''Federico García Lorca'', in Kavvadias' ''Marabu'' collection, is dedicated to the memory of García Lorca and juxtaposes his death with war crimes in the village of [[Distomo]], Greece, and in [[Kessariani]] in Athens, where the [[Nazi]]s executed over two hundred people in each city.
* [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s poem "A Supermarket in California" makes mention to Lorca mysteriously acting out with a watermelon.
