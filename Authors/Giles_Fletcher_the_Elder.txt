Giles Fletcher was the son of Richard Fletcher, vicar of [[Bishop's Stortford]].<ref name=Venn>{{acad|id=FLTR565G|name=Fletcher, Giles}}</ref>

Fletcher was born in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]].  He spent his early life at [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] before entering [[Eton College]] in about 1561. From there, Fletcher continued his education at [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he was appointed a fellow in 1568 and gained his B.A. in the academic year 1569-70.<ref name=Venn />

Studying Greek and poetry, Fletcher contributed to the translation of several of [[Demosthenes]]' orations. On 22 March 1572, Fletcher became a lecturer in King's and held this position until March the following year, until he became a lecturer in Greek, a position which he held until Michaelmas term 1579. Continually rising within the academia, Fletcher rose to dean of arts, the highest position he was to attain at Kings, in 1580-81. However, this would not last long, for he decided to marry, forcing him to give up his fellowship. On 16 January, in his father's church, he married Joan Sheafe. Returning to Cambridge later, he received his Doctor of Civil Law degree. After attaining his law degree, the family settled back in Cranbrook, where once again the family was united. On 8 April 1582, Giles and Joan's first child, [[Phineas Fletcher|Phineas]], was baptized. During the same year, Giles was made chancellor of the diocese of Sussex.

In 1584, Fletcher was elected to the parliament which began on 23 November, for [[Winchelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchelsea]], one of the [[Cinque Ports]]. It was at this point that the Fletchers would permanently call London home. During his stint in Parliament, Fletcher served on three committees. In 1586, Fletcher was appointed as the [[City Remembrancer|Remembrancer]] of the [[City of London]], an office which he held until 1605.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/index-remembrancia/1579-1664/x-xv|title=The Remembrancers of the City of London - British History Online|website=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref> In 1588 he was an ambassador to [[Russia]] to reestablish the treaty with [[tsar]] [[Feodor I of Russia]]. Fletcher published a treatise, ''Of the Russe Common Wealth'' (1591). The treaty to be reestablished was primarily concerning the English trade, but before he departed [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] made him a Master of Requests. Fletcher's account gives a vivid description of the Russian world pre-1600.

He is best known for his sonnet ''Licia''. He is the father of the poet [[Giles Fletcher, the Younger]].
