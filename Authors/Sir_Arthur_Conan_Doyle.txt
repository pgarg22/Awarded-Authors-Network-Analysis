'''Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle''' {{postnom|country=GBR|KStJg|DL}} (22 May 1859&nbsp;– 7 July 1930) was a British writer and physician. He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 for ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].

Doyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, "[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.

== Name ==
Doyle is often referred to as "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle" or "Conan Doyle", implying that "Conan" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives "Arthur Ignatius Conan" as his given names and "Doyle" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of "Conan Doyle" (Stashower 20–21). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as "A. Conan Doyle" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat "Doyle" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009). ''Sherlock Holmes Handbook'' 2nd ed. Dundurn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X3OIoRbJFhAC&pg=PA97&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p.&nbsp;97]. Google Books. Retrieved 11 February 2017.</ref>

Steven Doyle, editor of ''[[The Baker Street Journal]]'', wrote: "Conan was Arthur's middle name. Shortly after he graduated from high school he began using Conan as a sort of surname. But technically his last name is simply 'Doyle'."<ref>Doyle, Steven; Crowder, David A. (2010). ''Sherlock Holmes for Dummies''. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons.

Supported by wealthy uncles, Doyle was sent to England, to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|Hodder Place]], [[Stonyhurst]] in Lancashire at the age of nine (1868–70). He then went on to [[Stonyhurst College]], which he attended until 1875. While Doyle was not unhappy at Stonyhurst, he said he did not have any fond memories of it because the school was run on medieval principles: the only subjects covered were rudiments, [[rhetoric]], [[Euclidean geometry]], [[algebra]] and the classics.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Arthur Conan Doyle: Beyond Baker Street|last=Pascal|first=Janet|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-19-512262-3|location=New York|pages=14}}</ref> Doyle commented later in his life that this academic system could only be excused "on the plea that any exercise, however stupid in itself, forms a sort of mental [[dumbbell]] by which one can improve one's mind."<ref name=":0" /> He also found the school harsh, noting that, instead of compassion and warmth, it favoured the threat of [[corporal punishment]] and ritual humiliation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Sherlock Holmes: Cracking the Case with Science and Forensics|last=O'Brien|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-979496-6|location=New York|pages=1}}</ref>

From 1875 to 1876, he was educated at the Jesuit school [[Stella Matutina (Jesuit school)|Stella Matutina]] in [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], Austria.<ref name="NDB" /> His family decided that he would spend a year there in order to perfect his German and broaden his academic horizons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle|last=Miller|first=Russell|publisher=Random House|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4070-9308-6|location=New York}}</ref> He later rejected the Catholic faith and became an [[agnostic]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Arthur Conan Doyle|year=2011|publisher=BookCaps Study Guides|isbn=978-1-62107-027-6|author=Golgotha Press |quote=In time, he would reject the Catholic religion and become an agnostic.}}</ref> One source attributed his drift away from religion to the time he spent in the less strict Austrian school.<ref name=":1" /> He also later became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[mysticism|mystic]].<ref>Pascal, Janet B.

== Medical career ==
From 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]]; during this period he spent time working in [[Aston Manor|Aston]] (then a town in [[Warwickshire]], now part of [[Birmingham]]), [[Sheffield]] and [[Ruyton-XI-Towns]], Shropshire.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Yoland|title=Ruyton XI Towns, Unusual Name, Unusual History|year=1988|publisher=Brewin Books|pages=92–93|isbn=0-947731-41-5}}</ref> Also during this period, he studied practical botany at the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|Royal Botanic Garden]] in Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14185595.Mystery_solved_of_how_Sherlock_Holmes_knew_so_much_about_poisonous_plants/?ref=mr&lp=7|title=Mystery solved of how Sherlock Holmes knew so much about poisonous plants|last=McNeill|first=Colin|date=6 January 2016|work=Herald Scotland|access-date=9 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126142652/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14185595.Mystery_solved_of_how_Sherlock_Holmes_knew_so_much_about_poisonous_plants/?ref=mr&lp=7|archive-date=26 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> While studying, Doyle began writing short stories.

After graduating with Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery (M.B. C.M.) degrees from the University of Edinburgh in 1881, he was ship's surgeon on the SS ''Mayumba'' during a voyage to the West African coast.<ref Name="NDB" /> He completed his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) degree (an advanced degree beyond the basic medical qualification in the UK) with a dissertation on ''[[tabes dorsalis]]'' in 1885.<ref name="Archive">Available at the [http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/418 Edinburgh Research Archive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111130617/http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/418 |date=11 November 2007 }}.</ref>

In 1882, Doyle partnered with his former classmate George Turnavine Budd in a medical practice in [[Plymouth]], but their relationship proved difficult, and Doyle soon left to set up an independent practice.<ref Name="NDB" /><ref>Stashower, pp. 52–59.</ref> Arriving in [[Portsmouth]] in June 1882, with less than £10 (£{{Inflation|UK-GDP|10|1882|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}}{{Inflation-fn|UK-GDP|df=y}}) to his name, he set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, [[Southsea]].<ref>Stashower, pp. 55, 58–59.</ref> The practice was not successful. While waiting for patients, Doyle returned to writing fiction.

Doyle was a staunch supporter of compulsory [[vaccination]] and wrote several articles advocating the practice and denouncing the views of [[Vaccine controversies|anti-vaccinators]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=Compulsory_Vaccination_-_The_Evening_Mail|title=Compulsory Vaccination – The Evening Mail – The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia|website=www.arthur-conan-doyle.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=Compulsory_Vaccination_-_The_Hampshire_County_Times|title=Compulsory Vaccination – The Hampshire County Times – The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia|website=www.arthur-conan-doyle.com}}</ref>

In early 1891, Doyle embarked on the study of [[ophthalmology]] in Vienna. He had previously studied at the Portsmouth Eye Hospital in order to qualify to perform eye tests and prescribe glasses. Vienna had been suggested by his friend Vernon Morris as a place to spend six months and train to be an eye surgeon. But Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms being used in his classes in Vienna, and soon quit his studies there. For the rest of his two-month stay in Vienna, he pursued other activities, such as [[ice skating]] with his wife Louisa and drinking with Brinsley Richards of the London ''Times''. He also wrote ''The Doings of Raffles Haw''.

After visiting [[Venice]] and [[Milan]], he spent a few days in Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on diseases of the eye. Within three months of his departure for Vienna, Doyle returned to London. He opened a small office and consulting room at 2 Upper Wimpole Street, or 2 Devonshire Place as it was then. (There is today a [[Westminster City Council]] [[commemorative plaque]] over the front door.) He had no patients, according to his autobiography, and his efforts as an ophthalmologist were a failure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Higham|first1=Charles|title=The Adventures of Conan Doyle|date=1976|publisher=W.W.

Doyle struggled to find a publisher. His first work featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', was written in three weeks when he was 27 and was accepted for publication by [[Ward Lock & Co]] on 20 November 1886, which gave Doyle £25 ({{Inflation|UK-GDP|25|1886|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-2}}) in exchange for all rights to the story. The piece appeared a year later in the ''[[Beeton's Christmas Annual]]'' and received good reviews in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]''.<ref Name="NDB" />

Holmes was partially modelled on Doyle's former university teacher [[Joseph Bell]]. In 1892, in a letter to Bell, Doyle wrote, "It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man",<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/conan-doyle-and-joseph-bell-the-real-sherlock-holmes-surgeons-hall-museums-edinburgh-410821.html Independent, 7 August 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222141444/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/conan-doyle-and-joseph-bell-the-real-sherlock-holmes-surgeons-hall-museums-edinburgh-410821.html |date=22 February 2011 }};</ref> and in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, "It is no wonder that after the study of such a character [viz., Bell] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal."<ref>Doyle, Arthur Conan, ''Memories and Adventures'' (Reprint), Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge) 2012, p. 26.</ref> [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] was able to recognise the strong similarity between [[Joseph Bell]] and Sherlock Holmes: "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp;... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?"<ref>Letter from R L Stevenson to Doyle 5 April 1893 [[s:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 2/Chapter XII|The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 2/Chapter XII]].</ref> Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s character [[C. Auguste Dupin]], who is mentioned, disparagingly, by Holmes in ''A Study in Scarlet''.<ref>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''.

[[File:Sherlock Holmes Statue, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright|Sherlock Holmes statue in Edinburgh, erected opposite the birthplace of Doyle, which was demolished c. 1970]]
A sequel to ''A Study in Scarlet'' was commissioned, and ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' appeared in ''[[Lippincott's Magazine]]'' in February 1890, under agreement with the Ward Lock company. Doyle felt grievously exploited by Ward Lock as an author new to the publishing world, and so, after this, he left them.<ref Name="NDB" /> Short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the ''[[Strand Magazine]]''. Doyle wrote the first five Holmes short stories from his office at 2 Upper Wimpole Street (then known as Devonshire Place), which is now marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques City of Westminster green plaques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |date=16 July 2012 }}; accessed 22 March 2014.</ref>

Doyle's attitude towards his most famous creation was ambivalent.<ref name="Life" /> In November 1891, he wrote to his mother: "I think of slaying Holmes,&nbsp;... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things." His mother responded, "You won't! You can't! You mustn't!"<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to the Detective Story|last=Panek|first=LeRoy Lad|year=1987|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|location=Bowling Green, OH|isbn=0-87972-377-7|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xstGp7cOObMC&pg=PA78}}</ref> In an attempt to deflect publishers' demands for more Holmes stories, he raised his price to a level intended to discourage them, but found they were willing to pay even the large sums he asked.<ref name="Life" /> As a result, he became one of the best-paid authors of his time.

[[File:AufSherlocksSpuren5.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Holmes and the English Church in Meiringen]]
In December 1893, to dedicate more of his time to his historical novels, Doyle had Holmes and [[Professor Moriarty]] plunge to their deaths together down the [[Reichenbach Falls]] in the story "[[The Final Problem]]". Public outcry, however, led him to feature Holmes in 1901 in the novel ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''. Holmes' fictional connection with the Reichenbach Falls is celebrated in the nearby town of [[Meiringen]].

In 1903, Doyle published his first Holmes short story in ten years, "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]", in which it was explained that only Moriarty had fallen, but since Holmes had other dangerous enemies—especially [[Colonel Sebastian Moran]]—he had arranged to make it look as if he too were dead. Holmes was ultimately featured in a total of 56 [[short story|short stories]]—the last published in 1927—and four novels by Doyle, and has since appeared in [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|many novels and stories by other authors]].

[[Jane Stanford]] compares some of Moriarty's characteristics to those of the [[Fenian]] [[John O'Connor Power]]. "The Final Problem" was published the year the Second [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule Bill]] passed through the House of Commons. "The Valley of Fear" was serialised in 1914, the year Home Rule, the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Government of Ireland Act]] (18 September) was placed on the Statute Book.<ref>Stanford Jane (2011).

Between 1888 and 1906, Doyle wrote seven historical novels, which he and many critics regarded as his best work.<ref name="Life" /> He also wrote nine other novels, and—later in his career (1912–29)—five narratives (two of novel length) featuring the irascible scientist [[Professor Challenger]]. The Challenger stories include his best-known work after the Holmes oeuvre, ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. His historical novels include ''[[The White Company]]'' and its [[prequel]] ''[[Sir Nigel]]'', set in the [[Middle Ages]]. He was a prolific author of short stories, including two collections set in [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic times]] and featuring the French character [[Brigadier Gerard]].

Doyle's works for the stage include: ''Waterloo'', which centres on the reminiscences of an English veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and features a character Gregory Brewster, written for [[Henry Irving]]; ''The House of Temperley'', the plot of which reflects his abiding interest in boxing; ''[[The Speckled Band (play)|The Speckled Band]]'', adapted from his earlier short story "[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band]]"; and an 1893 collaboration with [[J.&nbsp;M. Barrie]] on the [[libretto]] of ''[[Jane Annie]]''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1893/05/28/archives/jane-annie-jm-barrie-and-conan-doyles-libretto-rather-puzzles.html "''Jane Annie'' – J.&nbsp;M.

== Sporting career ==
While living in [[Southsea]], the seaside resort of [[Portsmouth]], Doyle played [[Association football|football]] as a goalkeeper for [[A. E.

Doyle was a keen [[cricket]]er, and between 1899 and 1907 he played 10 [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).<ref name="cric">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/10932.html |title=Arthur Conan Doyle |work=ESPN Cricinfo |access-date=17 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118065720/http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/10932.html |archive-date=18 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> He also played for the amateur cricket teams the [[Allahakbarries]] and the [[Authors Cricket Club|Authors XI]] alongside fellow writers [[J.&nbsp;M.

In 1901, Doyle was one of three judges for the world's first major [[bodybuilding]] competition, which was organized by the "Father of Bodybuilding", [[Eugen Sandow]].

Doyle wrote: "I was much inclined to accept&nbsp;... though my friends pictured me as winding up with a revolver at one ear and a razor at the other. However, the distance and my engagements presented a final bar."<ref name="SI" />

Also a keen [[golf]]er, Doyle was elected captain of the Crowborough Beacon Golf Club in [[Sussex]] for 1910. He had moved to Little Windlesham house in [[Crowborough]] with Jean Leckie, his second wife, and resided there with his family from 1907 until his death in July 1930.<ref>Arthur Conan Doyle.

In 1885 Doyle married Louisa (sometimes called "Touie") Hawkins (1857–1906). She was the youngest daughter of J. Hawkins, of [[Minsterworth]], Gloucestershire, and the sister of one of Doyle's patients. Louisa suffered from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Leeman">Leeman, Sue, "Sherlock Holmes fans hope to save Doyle's house from developers", Associated Press, 28 July 2006.</ref> In 1907, the year after Louisa's death, he married Jean Elizabeth Leckie (1874–1940). He had met and fallen in love with Jean in 1897, but had maintained a platonic relationship with her while his first wife was still alive, out of loyalty to her.<ref>Janet B. Pascal (2000).

Doyle fathered five children. He had two with his first wife: Mary Louise (1889–1976) and Arthur Alleyne Kingsley, known as Kingsley (1892–1918). He had an additional three with his second wife: Denis Percy Stewart (1909–1955), who became the second husband of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Princess [[Nina Mdivani]]; [[Adrian Conan Doyle|Adrian Malcolm]] (1910–1970); and [[Jean Conan Doyle|Jean Lena Annette]] (1912–1997).<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-air-commandant-dame-jean-conan-doyle-1295551.html "Obituary: Air Commandant Dame Jean Conan Doyle"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071230/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-air-commandant-dame-jean-conan-doyle-1295551.html |date=18 October 2017 }}.

== Political campaigning ==
Doyle served as a volunteer doctor in the Langman Field Hospital at [[Bloemfontein]] between March and June 1900,<ref>Miller, Russell. ''The Adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle''. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2008. pp. 211–217; {{ISBN|0-312-37897-1}},</ref> during the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa (1899–1902). Later that same year, he wrote a book on the war, ''[[The Great Boer War]]'', as well as a short work titled ''The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct'', in which he responded to critics of the United Kingdom's role in that war, and argued that its role was justified. The latter work was widely translated, and Doyle believed it was the reason he was [[Knight#Honorific orders of knighthood|knighted]] (given the rank of [[Knight Bachelor]]) by [[King Edward VII]] in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]].<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804}}</ref> (He received the accolade from the King in person at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 24 October of that year.)<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27494 |date=11 November 1902 |page=7165 }}</ref>

He stood for Parliament twice as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]]: in 1900 in [[Edinburgh Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]]; and in 1906 in the [[Hawick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Hawick Burghs]]. He received a respectable share of the vote, but was not elected.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10561577/Arthur-Conan-Doyle-19-things-you-didnt-know.html "Arthur Conan Doyle: 19 things you didn't know"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501080223/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10561577/Arthur-Conan-Doyle-19-things-you-didnt-know.html |date=1 May 2018 }}.

Doyle was a supporter of the campaign for the reform of the [[Congo Free State]] that was led by the journalist [[E. D. Morel]] and diplomat [[Roger Casement]]. In 1909 he wrote ''[[The Crime of the Congo]]'', a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors of that colony. He became acquainted with Morel and Casement, and it is possible that, together with [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]], they inspired several characters that appear in his 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spiring, Paul |url=http://www.bfronline.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=9 |title=B.

"Twentieth Century Classics: Reflections on Writers and Their Times". Cambridge University Press.</ref>

As the [[First World War]] loomed, and having been caught up in a growing public swell of [[Germanophobia]], Doyle gave a public donation of 10 shillings to the anti-immigration [[British Brothers' League]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Winder |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Winder |date=2004 |title=Bloody Foreigners |location=London |publisher=Little, Brown |page=264 |isbn=978-0-349-13880-0}}</ref>

== Justice advocate ==
[[File:conandoylestatue.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Doyle statue in [[Crowborough]], East Sussex]]
Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two men being exonerated of the crimes of which they were accused. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]], who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in [[Great Wyrley]]. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Bardes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D. Michael Risinger</ref> Apart from helping George Edalji, Doyle's work helped establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice, as it was partially as a result of this case that the [[Court of Criminal Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Criminal Appeal]] was established in 1907.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Barnes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D. Michael Risinger</ref>

The story of Doyle and Edalji was dramatised in an episode of the 1972 BBC television series, ''The Edwardians''. In Nicholas Meyer's pastiche ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy [[Parsi]] Indian character wronged by the English justice system. Edalji was of Parsi heritage on his father's side. The story was fictionalised in [[Julian Barnes]]'s 2005 novel ''[[Arthur and George]]'', which was adapted into a three-part drama by ITV in 2015.

The second case, that of [[Oscar Slater]]—a Jew of German origin who operated a gambling den and was convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in 1908—excited Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution's case and a general sense that Slater was not guilty. He ended up paying most of the costs for Slater's successful 1928 appeal.<ref>{{cite book|title=Famous Trials|volume=1|last1=Roughead|first1=William|contribution=Oscar Slater|page=108|editor1-last=Hodge|editor1-first=Harry|publisher=Penguin Books|author-link=William Roughead|year=1941}}</ref>

== Freemasonry and spiritualism ==
Doyle had a longstanding interest in [[Mysticism|mystical]] subjects and remained fascinated by the idea of [[paranormal]] phenomena, even though the strength of his belief in their reality waxed and waned periodically over the years.

In 1887, in Southsea, influenced by Major-General [[Alfred Wilks Drayson]], a member of the Portsmouth Literary and Philosophical Society, Doyle began a series of investigations into the possibility of psychic phenomena and attended about 20 [[seance]]s, experiments in [[telepathy]], and sittings with mediums. Writing to [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] journal ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'' that year, he declared himself to be a spiritualist, describing one particular event that had convinced him psychic phenomena were real.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wingett |first=Matt |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887–1920 |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=19–32}}</ref> Also in 1887 (on 26&nbsp;January), he was initiated as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] at the Phoenix Lodge No.&nbsp;257 in Southsea. (He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, returned to it in 1902, and resigned again in 1911.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html |title=Arthur Conan Doyle, Spiritualist and Freemason |last=Beresiner |first=Yasha |date=2007 |work=Masonic papers |publisher=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309065258/http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html |archive-date=9 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1889, he became a founding member of the Hampshire Society for Psychical Research; in 1893, he joined the London-based [[Society for Psychical Research]]; and in 1894, he collaborated with Sir Sidney Scott and [[Frank Podmore]] in a search for poltergeists in Devon.<ref name="Wingett32-36">{{cite book |last=Wingett |first=Matt |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887–1920 |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=32–36}}</ref>

Doyle and the spiritualist [[William Thomas Stead]] (before the latter was lost in the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]) were led to believe that [[Julius and Agnes Zancig]] had genuine psychic powers, and they claimed publicly that the Zancigs used [[telepathy]]. However, in 1924, the Zancigs confessed that their [[Mentalism|mind reading]] act had been a trick; they published the secret code and all other details of the trick method they had used under the title "Our Secrets!!" in a London newspaper.<ref>[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. p.&nbsp;8; {{ISBN|978-0-87975-358-0}}.</ref> Doyle also praised the [[psychic]] phenomena and spirit [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] that he believed had been produced by [[Eusapia Palladino]] and [[Mina Crandon]], both of whom were also later exposed as frauds.<ref name= Houdini>William Kalush, Larry Ratso Sloman. (2006). ''The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero''. Atria Books. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-7208-7}}.</ref>

In 1916, at the height of the First World War, Doyle's belief in psychic phenomena was strengthened by what he took to be the psychic abilities of his children's nanny, Lily Loder Symonds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wingett |first=Matt |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887–1920 |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=43–44}}</ref> This and the constant drumbeat of wartime deaths inspired him with the idea that spiritualism was what he called a "New Revelation"<ref name="auto">{{cite book |last=Wingett |first=Matt |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887–1920 |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=44–48}}</ref> sent by God to bring solace to the bereaved. He wrote a piece in ''Light'' magazine about his faith and began lecturing frequently on spiritualism. In 1918, he published his first spiritualist work, ''The New Revelation''.

Some have mistakenly assumed that Doyle's turn to spiritualism was prompted by the death of his son Kingsley, but Doyle began presenting himself publicly as a spiritualist in 1916, and Kingsley died on 28&nbsp;October 1918 (from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]]).<ref name="auto" /> Nevertheless, the war-related deaths of many people who were close to him appears to have even further strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication. Doyle's brother [[Brigadier-general (United Kingdom)|Brigadier-general]] Innes Doyle died, also from pneumonia, in February 1919. His two brothers-in-law (one of whom was [[Ernest William Hornung|E.&nbsp;W. Hornung]], creator of the literary character [[A. J. Raffles|Raffles]]), as well as his two nephews, also died shortly after the war. His second book on spiritualism, ''[[The Vital Message]]'', appeared in 1919.

Doyle found solace in supporting spiritualism's ideas and the attempts of spiritualists to find proof of an [[Afterlife|existence beyond the grave]]. In particular, according to some,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Did Conan Doyle Go Too Far? |journal=Psychic News |first=Leslie |last=Price |issue=4037 |year=2010}}</ref> he favoured [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualism]] and encouraged the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to accept an eighth precept – that of following the teachings and example of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. He was a member of the renowned supernaturalist organisation [[The Ghost Club]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ian Topham |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |title=The Ghost Club – A History by Peter Underwood |publisher=Mysteriousbritain.co.uk |date=31 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003858/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |archive-date=3 July 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and family.jpg|thumb|Doyle with his family in New York City, 1922]]

In 1919, the magician [[P.&nbsp;T. Selbit]] staged a séance at his flat in [[Bloomsbury]], which Doyle attended. Although some later claimed that Doyle had endorsed the apparent instances of [[clairvoyance]] at that séance as genuine,<ref>Baker, Robert A. (1996).

Greenwood Publishing Group. p.&nbsp;264. {{ISBN|978-0-435-07016-8}}.</ref> a contemporaneous report by the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' quoted Doyle as saying "I should have to see it again before passing a definite opinion on it" and "I have my doubts about the whole thing".<ref>{{cite book |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887–1920 |last=Wingett |first=Matt |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=160–161}}</ref> In 1920, Doyle and the noted sceptic [[Joseph McCabe]] held a public debate at Queen's Hall in London, with Doyle taking the position that the claims of [[spiritualism]] were true. After the debate, McCabe published a booklet ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?'', in which he laid out evidence refuting Doyle's arguments and claimed that Doyle had been duped into believing in spiritualism through deliberate [[mediumship]] trickery.<ref>[[Joseph McCabe]].

Doyle also debated the psychiatrist [[Harold Dearden]], who vehemently disagreed with Doyle's belief that many cases of diagnosed [[mental illness]] were the result of [[spirit possession]].<ref>Dearden, Harold. (1975 edition). ''Devilish But True: The Doctor Looks at Spiritualism''. EP Publishing Limited. pp. 70–72. {{ISBN|0-7158-1041-3}}.</ref>

In 1920, Doyle travelled to Australia and New Zealand on spiritualist missionary work, and over the next several years, until his death, he continued his mission, giving talks about his spiritualist conviction in Britain, Europe, and the United States.<ref name="Wingett32-36" />
[[File:Cottingley Fairies 1.jpg|thumb|One of the five photographs of Frances Griffiths with the [[Cottingley Fairies|alleged fairies]], taken by Elsie Wright in July 1917]]

Doyle wrote a novel ''[[The Land of Mist]]'' centered on spiritualist themes and featuring the character Professor Challenger. He also wrote many non-fiction spiritualist works. Perhaps his most famous of these was ''The Coming of the Fairies'' (1922),<ref>{{cite web |title=The Coming of the Fairies |url=http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?doc=BLL01015503689&tabs=detailsTab |work=British Library catalogue |publisher=[[British Library]] |access-date=12 June 2013}}</ref> in which Doyle described his beliefs about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits, reproduced the five [[Cottingley Fairies]] photographs, asserted that those who suspected them being faked were wrong, and expressed his conviction that they were authentic. Decades later, the photos were definitively shown to have been faked, and their creators admitted to the fakery.

Doyle was friends for a time with the American magician [[Harry Houdini]]. Even though Houdini explained that his feats were based on illusion and trickery, Doyle was convinced that Houdini had supernatural powers and said as much in his work ''The Edge of the Unknown''. Houdini's friend [[Bernard M.&nbsp;L. Ernst]] recounted a time when Houdini had performed an impressive trick at his home in Doyle's presence. Houdini had assured Doyle that the trick was pure illusion and had expressed the hope that this demonstration would persuade Doyle not to go around "endorsing phenomena" simply because he could think of no explanation for what he had seen other than supernatural power. However, according to Ernst, Doyle simply refused to believe that it had been a trick.<ref name="Polidoro 2006">{{cite web |last1=Polidoro |first1=Massimo |author-link=Massimo Polidoro |title=Houdini's Impossible Demonstration |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2006/07/houdinis-impossible-demonstration/ |website=Skeptical Inquirer |date=July 2006 |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |access-date=7 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412193049/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/houdinirsquos_impossible_demonstration |archive-date=12 April 2017}}</ref> Houdini became a prominent opponent of the spiritualist movement in the 1920s, after the death of his beloved mother. He insisted that spiritualist mediums employed trickery, and consistently exposed them as frauds. These differences between Houdini and Doyle eventually led to a bitter, public falling-out between them.<ref>[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003).

In 1922, the psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] accused the "spirit photographer" [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]] of fraud.

==Doyle and the Piltdown Hoax==
[[Richard Milner (historian)|Richard Milner]], an American historian of science, has presented a case that Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax of 1912, creating the counterfeit [[hominidae|hominid]] [[fossil]] that fooled the scientific world for over 40&nbsp;years. Milner noted that Doyle had a plausible motive—namely, revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics—and said that [[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|''The Lost World'']] appeared to contain several clues referring cryptically to his having been involved in the hoax.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/archaeology/piltdown_man_01.shtml |title=Piltdown Man: Britain's Greatest Hoax |date=17 February 2011 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 October 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6I1z8lk85?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/archaeology/piltdown_man_01.shtml |archive-date=11 July 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/05/piltdown-man-archaeologys-greatest-hoax |title=Piltdown Man: British archaeology's greatest hoax |date=5 February 2012 |work=The Guardian |access-date=5 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008100450/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/05/piltdown-man-archaeologys-greatest-hoax |archive-date=8 October 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Samuel Rosenberg (writer)|Samuel Rosenberg]]'s 1974 book ''[[Naked is the Best Disguise]]'' purports to explain how, throughout his writings, Doyle had provided overt clues to otherwise hidden or suppressed aspects of his way of thinking that seemed to support the idea that Doyle would be involved in such a hoax.<ref>[[Samuel Rosenberg (writer)|Samuel Rosenberg]]. (1974). ''Naked is the Best Disguise: The Death and Resurrection of Sherlock Holmes''. Bobbs-Merrill. {{ISBN|0-14-004030-7}}.</ref>

However, more recent research suggests that Doyle was not involved. In 2016, researchers at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and [[Liverpool John Moores University]] analyzed DNA evidence showing that responsibility for the hoax lay with the amateur archaeologist [[Charles Dawson]], who had originally "found" the remains. He had initially not been considered the likely perpetrator, because the hoax was seen as being too elaborate for him to have devised. However, the DNA evidence showed that a supposedly ancient tooth he had "discovered" in 1915 (at a different site) came from the same jaw as that of the Piltdown Man, suggesting that he had planted them both. That tooth, too, was later proven to have been planted as part of a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man |title=Piltdown Man |website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk |language=en |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref>

Dr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: "Conan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy[,] and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence[,] you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition. He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE [sic<ref>The latter honour did not exist in the lifetime of Dawson, who died in August 1916; the Order of the British Empire was founded on 4 June 1917.</ref>]. He wanted people to stop seeing him as an amateur".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/08/10/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-cleared-of-piltdown-man-hoax/ |title=Sir Arthur Conan Doyle cleared of Piltdown Man hoax |last=Knapton |first=Sarah |date=10 August 2016 |work=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
[[File:UndershawCirca1900.jpg|thumb|Façade of [[Undershaw]] with Doyle's children, Mary and Kingsley, on the drive]]
Another of Doyle's longstanding interests was architectural design. In 1895, when he commissioned an architect friend of his, Joseph Henry Ball, to build him a home, he played an active part in the design process.<ref>Cooke, Simon, 2013, [http://www.victorianweb.org/art/illustration/doylecharles/cooke.html Introduction: Life and Controversy], "Charles Altamont Doyle", The Victorian Web.</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1244471|desc=Undershaw|access-date=19 October 2021}}</ref> The home in which he lived from October 1897 to September 1907, known as [[Undershaw]] (near [[Hindhead]], in Surrey),<ref>{{cite book |last=Duncan |first=Alistair |title=An Entirely New Country: Arthur Conan Doyle, Undershaw and the Resurrection of Sherlock Holmes |publisher=MX Publishing |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-908218-19-3}}</ref> was used as a hotel and restaurant from 1924 until 2004, when it was bought by a developer and then stood empty while conservationists and Doyle fans fought to preserve it.<ref name="Leeman" /> In 2012, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London ruled in favor of those seeking to preserve the historic building, ordering that the redevelopment permission be quashed on the ground that it had not been obtained through proper procedures.<ref name="BBC121112">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-20303200 |title=Sir Arthur Conan Doyle house development appeal upheld |date=12 November 2012 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116032748/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-20303200 |archive-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The building was later approved to become part of Stepping Stones, a school for children with disabilities and special needs.

Doyle made his most ambitious foray into architecture in March 1912, while he was staying at the [[Glasshayes|Lyndhurst Grand Hotel]]: He sketched the original designs for a third-storey extension and for an alteration of the front facade of the building.<ref>Griffith, Carolyn. "Campaigner says hotel's writer link should secure landmark building". Lymington Times, 15 September 2017.</ref> Work began later that year, and when it was finished, the building was a nearly exact manifestation of the plans Doyle had sketched. Superficial alterations have been subsequently made, but the essential structure is still clearly Doyle's.<ref>[https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=Glasshayes_House:_the_1912_extension_of_The_Lyndhurst_Grand_Hotel Glasshayes House: the 1912 extension of The Lyndhurst Grand Hotel]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917075627/https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=Glasshayes_House:_the_1912_extension_of_The_Lyndhurst_Grand_Hotel |date=17 September 2017 }}, The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia, 2017.</ref>

In 1914, on a family trip to the Jasper National Park in Canada, he designed a golf course and ancillary buildings for a hotel. The plans were realised in full, but neither the golf course nor the buildings have survived.<ref>The Golfball Factory, accessed September 2017, [http://www.thegolfballfactory.com/the-golf-course/hole5/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-golf-architect.htm Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – Golf Course Architect]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917033126/http://www.thegolfballfactory.com/the-golf-course/hole5/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-golf-architect.htm |date=17 September 2017 }}.</ref>

In 1926, Doyle laid the foundation stone for a Spiritualist Temple in Camden, London. Of the building's total £600 construction costs, he provided £500.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/property/blur-guitarist-leads-fight-to-save-camden-road-spiritualist-temple-1-5152950 |title=Blur guitarist leads fight to save Camden Road Spiritualist Temple |first=Frankie |last=Crossley |website=Hampstead Highgate Express|date=17 August 2017 }}</ref>

Doyle was found clutching his chest in the hall of Windlesham Manor, his house in [[Crowborough]], East Sussex, on 7 July 1930. He died of a heart attack at the age of 71. His last words were directed toward his wife: "You are wonderful."<ref>Stashower, p. 439.</ref> At the time of his death, there was some controversy concerning his burial place, as he was avowedly not a Christian, considering himself a [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]].

He was later reinterred together with his wife in [[Minstead]] churchyard in the [[New Forest]], Hampshire.<ref Name="NDB" /> Carved wooden tablets to his memory and to the memory of his wife, originally from the church at Minstead, are on display as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition at Portsmouth Museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-wooden-headstone-of-sir-arthur-conan-doyle-at-a-special-display--33668994.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=BD2C7240-7D76-4D4E-9632-6F01BA8962F7&p=3609&n=1&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%253dbar%2526st%253d0%2526sortby%253d2%2526qt%253dsir%252520arthur%252520conan%252520doyle%252520portsmouth%252520museum%2526qt_raw%253dsir%252520arthur%252520conan%252520doyle%252520portsmouth%252520museum%2526qn%253d%2526lic%253d3%2526mr%253d0%2526pr%253d0%2526aoa%253d1%2526creative%253d%2526videos%253d%2526nu%253d%2526ccc%253d%2526bespoke%253d%2526apalib%253d%2526ag%253d0%2526hc%253d0%2526et%253d0x000000000000000000000%2526vp%253d0%2526loc%253d0%2526ot%253d0%2526imgt%253d0%2526dtfr%253d%2526dtto%253d%2526size%253d0xFF%2526blackwhite%253d%2526cutout%253d%2526archive%253d1%2526name%253d%2526groupid%253d%2526pseudoid%253d%2526userid%253d%2526id%253d%2526a%253d%2526xstx%253d0%2526cbstore%253d1%2526lightbox%253d%2526resultview%253dsortbyPopular%2526gname%253d%2526gtype%253d%2526apalic%253d%2526tbar%253d1%2526pc%253d%2526simid%253d%2526cap%253d1%2526customgeoip%253d%2526vd%253d0%2526cid%253d%2526saveQry%253d%2526editorial%253d1%2526t%253d0%2526edoptin%253d|title=Stock Photo – Wooden headstone of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle at a special display in the Town's museum.
