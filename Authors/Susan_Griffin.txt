==Life==
Griffin was born in [[Los Angeles]], California, in 1943<ref name="Poetry Foundation" /> and has resided in California since then. She is the adoptive child of a Jewish family. Her biological family were of Irish, Scottish, Welsh and German ancestry. Having grown up in a post-War Jewish home, her German heritage wasn't openly spoken of and she initially demonized Germans, but later made several trips to Germany (including to the [[Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp]]) to reconcile her Jewish and German heritages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utne.com/arts/susan-griffin-author-gender-roles-montage-fields |title=Susan Griffin |publisher=Utne Visionary |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulse-berlin.com/?p=152 |title=SUSAN GRIFFIN: FEMININE AND MASCULINE |publisher=Pulse Berlin |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> She attended the [[University of California]], Berkeley for two years, then transferred to [[San Francisco State College]], where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Creative Writing (1965) and her Master of Arts degree (1973), both degrees under the tutelage of [[Kay Boyle]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2017-03-29/hear-her-roar-ecofeminist-author-susan-griffin-isnt-going|title=Hear Her Roar: Ecofeminist Author Susan Griffin Isn't Going Away|date=2017-03-28|work=Cal Alumni Association|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}</ref>  She has taught as an adjunct professor at UC Berkeley as well as at [[Stanford University]] and [[California Institute of Integral Studies]].<ref name=":0" /> Griffin has taught at the California Institute for Integral Studies, Pacifica Graduate Institute, [[the Wright Institute]], and the University of California.

She currently lives in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref name="Griffin">{{Cite web|url=http://susangriffin.com/bio/|title=Bio – Susan Griffin|work=susangriffin.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref>

==Work==
Griffin has written 21 books, including works of nonfiction, poetry, anthologies, plays, and a [[Berkeley in the Sixties|screenplay]].<ref name=":0" /> Her work has been translated into over 12 languages. Griffin describes her work as "draw[ing] connections between the destruction of nature, the diminishment of women and racism, and trac[ing] the causes of war to denial in both private and public life."<ref name="Griffin" />

''Woman and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her'' (1978) has sold more than 100,000 copies,<ref name=":0" /> and draws connections between ecological destruction, sexism, and racism.<ref name="Griffin" /> Considered a form of prose-poetry, this work is believed to have launched [[ecofeminism]] in the United States.<ref name=":0" /> Griffin attributes her connection to ecofeminism to her upbringing along the Pacific Coast in the High Sierras of California, which she believes cultivated her awareness of ecology.<ref name="Griffin" />

Griffin articulated her anti-pornography feminism in ''Pornography and Silence: Culture's Revenge Against Nature'' (1981).<ref name="NATURE'S REVENGE">{{cite news|last1=Willis|first1=Ellen|title=NATURE'S REVENGE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/nature-s-revenge.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1981-07-12|access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/nature-s-revenge.html|title=NATURE'S REVENGE|last=Willis|first=Ellen|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}</ref> In this work she makes the case that although the pursuit of freedom of speech, could lead to a position against the censorship of pornography, in the case of pornography the freedom to create pornography leads to a compromise of "human liberation" when this term includes liberation for all of humankind including the emancipation of women. She argues against the elision of pornography and [[eros]], arguing that they are separate and opposing ideas.<ref name="KPFA">{{cite web|last1=Tonella|first1=Karla|title=Susan Griffin Pornography and Silence: transcript of KPFA broadcast|url=http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/wstudies/griffin.html|website=bailiwick @ the university of iowa libraries|publisher=The University of Iowa|access-date=27 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="Pornography and Silence - Kindle">{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Susan|title=Pornography and Silence: Culture's Revenge Against Nature|date=28 July 2015|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pornography-Silence-Cultures-Revenge-Against-ebook/dp/B00Z8POVUW/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1|publisher=Harper & Row|access-date=27 March 2017}}</ref> According to Griffin, pornography's origins are rooted in a widespread fear of nature,<ref name=":1" /> and in a pornographic culture, men are told to take on the role of the "Killer", while women become the "victims".<ref name=Douglas>{{cite book|title=Love and Politics : Radical Feminist and Lesbian Theories|author=Douglas, Carol Anne|chapter=Male Biology as a Problem : Woman the Natural|page=78-9|publisher=ISM PRESS|date=July 1990|location=San Francisco, CA, USA|isbn=9780910383172}}</ref> This, according to Griffin, teaches women to self-deprecate, and fuels an unhealthy, perverted culture.<ref name=":1" />
In contrast, Griffin argues that "real sexual liberation requires a reconciliation with nature, a healing between body and spirit".<ref name=":1" /> Critics largely responded to ''Pornography and Culture'' with contempt, many complaining that it came off as more of a rant than realistic philosophical discussion.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/susan-griffin-6/woman-and-nature-the-roaring-inside-her/|title=WOMAN AND NATURE: The Roaring Inside Her by Susan Griffin {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}</ref>

==Awards==
Griffin has received a [[MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur]] grant for Peace and International Cooperation, [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] and [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] fellowships, and an [[Emmy Award]] for the play ''Voices''. She is featured in the 2014 feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.<ref name="Huffington">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/05/shes-beautiful-when-shes-angry_n_6278698.html |title='She's Beautiful When She's Angry' Tells The Feminist History Left Out Of Your School Textbook |work=The Huffington Post |date=2014-12-15 |access-date=2017-03-04}}</ref> She was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Nonfiction in 1993<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/223|title=The Pulitzer Prizes: General Nonfiction|website=Pulitzer}}</ref> for ''A Chorus of Stones: The Private Life of War.''

== Criticism ==
Many critics praise Griffin's blunt takes and insights to the role of feminism in every major issue today, while others have criticized her writings for being too convoluted or ranting. Largely, reviews for Griffin's work take opposing views on the intertwining and complicated connections she suggests between the woman and larger worldly issues such as war, disease, pornography, and nature itself.<ref name=Douglas></ref> These webs are mirrored in her unique writing style which critics have reflected upon extensively.<ref name=Douglas></ref>

In a 1994 review by Carol H. Cantrell, Griffins' ''Woman and Nature'' is dubbed "hard to describe. Most of it looks like prose on the page but the thought is fragmented, metaphorical, and discontinuous; there are plenty of stories, but they too are often elliptical and metaphorical."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cantrell|first=Carol H.|date=1994|editor-last=Griffin|editor-first=Susan|title=Women and Language in Susan Griffin's Woman and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her|jstor=3810198|journal=Hypatia|volume=9|issue=3|pages=225–238|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1994.tb00459.x}}</ref> In a review of ''What Her Body Thought: A Journey into the Shadows'', Susan Dion of ''The Women's Review of Books'' wrote, "...Griffin is not merely reiterating old themes in feminist scholarship or the history of medicine; rather, she probes, ponders, and suggests different ways of considering many interrelated issues...Griffin's musings and hypotheses are fresh, smart, and instructive, if not always convincing."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dion|first=Susan|date=1999|editor-last=Griffin|editor-first=Susan|title=Sick and Tired|jstor=4023361|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=17|issue=1|pages=11–12|doi=10.2307/4023361}}</ref>
