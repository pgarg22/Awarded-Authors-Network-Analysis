'''Gratien Gélinas''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|CQ|FRSC}} (December 8, 1909 &ndash; March 16, 1999) was a Canadian author, playwright, actor, director, producer and administrator who is considered one of the founders of modern Canadian theatre and film.

His major works include ''Tit-Coq'' (1948), ''Bousille et les Justes'' (1959), and ''Hier, les enfants dansaient'' (1968). He also wrote a series of satirical revues known as the ''Fridolinades''.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dennis|title=The Oxford companion to theatre and performance|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199574193|pages=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXCcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA229&dq=%22Yesterday+the+Children+were+Dancing%22#q=%22Yesterday%20the%20Children%20were%20Dancing%22|access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref>

The ''Fridolinades'' revues, consisting of comic sketches, songs, and monologues, were named for the often-featured character Fridolin. A poor boy from Montreal, he wore a tri-colour [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens]] hockey jersey, knee socks, and suspenders.  While not quite [[joual]], the French he spoke was reflective of what a person would hear on the streets of Montreal, which made it stand out in sharp contrast to the continental French being spoken in most other theatres.  Fridolin's boundless optimism in the face of constant disappointment came to emblemize the Quebec spirit of "survivance", and made him one of the first distinctly Canadian heroes of the stage.  His success was considerable: Gélinas was declared by an adoring public to be the first playwright "de chez nous" (from our place).<ref name=Kennedy/>

Gélinas' play ''Hier, les enfants dansaient'' (''[[Yesterday the Children were Dancing]]'') takes place entirely in one night. Based in 1966, it revolves around the tumultuous politics in Quebec around that time though its characters are entirely fictitious. Pierre Gravel is debating whether or not to accept a prominent position within the Liberal party. Throughout the course of the play, Gravel's sons, André and Larry, admit that they are active members of the separatist party and responsible for the bombs that had been threatening the city and destroying historical landmarks.<ref name=Kennedy/>

Gélinas also founded the ''Comédie-Canadienne'', which was active until 1972.<ref name=Kennedy/>

In 1967, Gélinas was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Companion in 1989. In 1985, he was made a Knight of the [[National Order of Quebec]]. He received an honorary doctorate from the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in St-Jean in 1989.

He married [[Huguette Oligny]] in 1973 and is the grandfather of actor and pop singer [[Mitsou|Mitsou Gélinas]], [[MusiquePlus]] veejay, writer and actor [[Abeille Gélinas]], and writer [[Anne-Marie Sicotte]] who has written the biography  "Gratien Gélinas : la ferveur et le doute", published by the Éditions Québec/Amérique in 1995 et 1996. After his death in 1999, he was entombed at the [[Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery]] in Montreal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Répertoire des personnages inhumés au cimetière ayant marqué l'histoire de notre société|publisher=Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery|location=Montreal|language=fr}}</ref> The [[Library and Archives Canada]] contains sound recordings and transcriptions of Anne-Marie Sicotte's interview with Gelinas.<ref>[http://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.redirect?app=fonandcol&id=189776&lang=eng Fonds Anne Marie Sicotte], Library and Archives Canada</ref>
