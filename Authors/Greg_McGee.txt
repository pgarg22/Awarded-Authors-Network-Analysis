==Biography==
McGee was born in 1950 in the [[South Island]] town of [[Oamaru]].  In his early 20s McGee played rugby as a Junior [[All Black]] and became an All Black trialist. He graduated from the [[University of Otago]] with a law degree in 1972.

In 1980 his first play, ''[[Foreskin's Lament]]'', a drama set in [[Rugby football|rugby]] changing rooms and at the after-match party, became an immediate success. The play shows the player nicknamed "Foreskin" and his attempt to fit in with university liberals and with rugby-playing conservatives.  In New Zealand a rugby player is an everyman, and the game and play present a model of society in the end of the 1970s on the eve of the [[1981 Springbok Tour]]. The play has a stylistically unusual ending, with the main character directly addressing the audience with a very long speech — or rather interrogation — questioning their own values: "Whaddarya?".

*''Tooth and Claw'', 1983, retained the same microcosm, but used the courtroom as a metaphor.
*''Out in the Cold'', 1983, moved the scene to a freezing works, and extended the women's-rights sub-themes of earlier plays.
*''Whitemen'', 1986, returned to rugby, tackling the [[New Zealand Cavaliers|Cavaliers]]' 1986 tour of South Africa, but was a box-office failure.

McGee script-wrote for television, notably two mini-series: ''[[Erebus: The Aftermath]]'' (an examination of the inquiry following the crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in Antarctica) and ''Fallout'' (a dramatisation of [[David Lange]]'s government and the end of [[ANZUS]]). He also produced work for shows such as ''[[Cover Story (TV series)|Cover Story]]'', ''Marlin Bay'', ''[[Street Legal (2000)|Street Legal]]'' and, more recently, ''[[Orange Roughies]]''.  He co-wrote movie scripts for ''[[Crooked Earth]]'', ''[[Via Satellite]]'' (1998), with Anthony McCarten and the Kiwi Welsh rugby comedy ''[[Old Scores]]'' with Dean Parker. He returned to the theatre with ''This Train I'm On'' in 1999. ''Foreskin's Lament'' is being reprised{{when|date=December 2014}} for the screen as ''Skin and Bone''.

McGee became a founder of the Screenworks TV production company, a member of the New Zealand Film Council and a past President of the [[New Zealand Writers Guild]]. He admitted in 2011 to being the pseudonymous writer [[Alix Bosco]] who has written two highly successful crime novels, one of which won the inaugural [[Ngaio Marsh Award]] for Best Crime in 2010.<ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5436176">

===Reviews===
*''"Oh, it was such fun playing spot-the-Kiwi-celeb in this cracking thriller from Alix Bosco. A rugby star is found dead, murdered while making love to a beautiful woman. Mikky St Clair is a gorgeous media tart, [[famous for being famous]] and for her conquests. Sound like anyone you might have seen in the social pages?"'' Kerre Woodham, Paper Plus Book Talk<ref>[http://www.paperplus.co.nz/books/book-talk/kerres-book-reviews?wpkerre_month=8&wpkerre_year=2009&wpkerre_day=false&wpkerre_start=0&authorSearch=Alix+Bosco Paper Plus Book Talk website]</ref>
*''"An edgy and fast paced thriller... I look forward to more from Bosco."'' Joanne Taylor, Latitude magazine
*''"Bosco creates an enjoyable page-turner not only through the ‘did Fifita really do it?’ plotline hook, kicked up a notch when subsequent discoveries put Markunas in danger, but through her creation of characters with some nice depth and complexity."'' Craig Sisterson, NZLawyer magazine <ref>[http://kiwicrime.blogspot.com/2009/10/my-reviews-of-alix-boscos-cut-run-and.html Reprint of NZLawyer review on Crime Watch website]</ref>
*''"This bleak, topical novel is a substantial achievement and a welcome addition to the slim canon of New Zealand crime fiction"'' [[Paul Thomas (writer)|Paul Thomas]], [[New Zealand Herald]]
