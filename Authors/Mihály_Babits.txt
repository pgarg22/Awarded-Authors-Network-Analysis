== Biography ==
Babits was born in [[Szekszárd]]. He studied at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] from 1901 to 1905, where he met [[Dezső Kosztolányi]] and [[Gyula Juhász (poet)|Gyula Juhász]]. He worked to become a teacher and taught at schools in [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (1905&ndash;06), [[Szeged]] (1906&ndash;08), [[Făgăraş|Fogaras]] (1908&ndash;11), [[Újpest]] (1911), and [[Budapest]] (1912&ndash;18).

His reputation for his poems in the literary life started in 1908.

He made a trip to [[Italy]] in the same year, which made him interested in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]; he made several other trips in later years. This experience led him to translate Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (''Hell'', 1913, ''Purgatory'', 1920, and ''Paradise'', 1923).

Briefly after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1919]] he became a Professor of Foreign Literature and modern Hungarian literature at the University of Budapest, but was soon removed for his [[pacifism]] after the revolutionary government fell.

In 1911, he became a staff writer on the magazine ''[[Nyugat]]''.

Babits' 1918 novel ''The Nightmare'' (also known as ''King's Stork'') is a [[science fiction]] novel about a split personality influenced by [[Freudian psychology]].<ref>"The Nightmare" by [[Franz Rottensteiner]] in [[Frank N.

He became the editor-in-chief of ''Nyugat'' in 1929 (sharing the role until 1933 with [[Zsigmond Móricz]]), a position he held until his death.

In 1937, he was diagnosed as having [[laryngeal cancer]]. He died in Budapest in 1941.
