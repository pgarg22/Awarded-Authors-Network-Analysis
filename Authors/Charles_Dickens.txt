'''Charles John Huffam Dickens''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|ɪ|n|z}}; 7 February 1812&nbsp;– 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}.</ref> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today.<ref>{{harvnb|Mazzeno|2008|p=76}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chesterton|2005|pp=100–126}}.</ref>

Born in [[Portsmouth]], Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a factory when [[John Dickens|his father]] was incarcerated in a [[debtors' prison]]. After three years he was returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five [[novellas]], hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed [[Penny reading|readings]] extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education and other social reforms.

Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', a publishing phenomenon—thanks largely to the introduction of the character [[Sam Weller (character)|Sam Weller]] in the fourth episode—that sparked ''Pickwick'' merchandise and spin-offs. Within a few years Dickens had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.<ref name="Grossman 2012 54">{{harvnb|Grossman|2012|p=54}}</ref><ref name="Lodge 2002 118">{{harvnb|Lodge|2002|p=118}}.</ref> [[Cliffhanger]] endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.<ref name="NewYorker">{{cite magazine |title=Tune in next week |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week |magazine=The New Yorker |date=2 December 2017 |access-date=2 December 2017 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week |url-status=live }}</ref> The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.<ref name="Lodge 2002 118"/> For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46–47}}.</ref> His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267–268}}.</ref> Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}.</ref>

His 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.<ref name="Garratt"/> The term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian "Oxford Dictionaries&nbsp;– Dickensian"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126014426/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian |date=26 January 2014 }}.

==Early life==
{{Main article|Dickens family}}
[[File:CharlesDickens house Portsmouth.JPG|thumbnail|Charles Dickens's birthplace, 393 Commercial Road, Portsmouth]]
[[File:ChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|2 Ordnance Terrace, [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]], Dickens's home 1817&nbsp;– May 1821<ref name=Callow2012p9>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=9}}</ref>]]

Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), [[Landport]] in [[Portsea Island]] ([[Portsmouth]]), [[Hampshire]], the second of eight children of [[Elizabeth Dickens]] (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and [[John Dickens]] (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,<ref name=West1999>{{cite journal |last=West |first=Gilian |title=Huffam and Son |journal=The Dickensian |volume=95 |number=447 |date=Spring 1999 |pages=5–18 |publisher=Dickens Fellowship}}</ref> rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848).<ref name=West1999/>

In January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London and the family moved to Norfolk Street, [[Fitzrovia]].<ref name=Callow2012p5>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=5}}</ref> When Charles was four, they relocated to [[Sheerness]] and thence to [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Kent]], where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a "very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy".<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}.</ref>

Charles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''. He read and reread ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and the Collected Farces of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]].<ref name=Callow2012p7>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=7}}</ref> He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=22–24:29–30}}.</ref> His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a [[dame school]] and then at a school run by William Giles, a [[English Dissenters|dissenter]], in Chatham.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.</ref>
[[File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=drawing|Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the [[Marshalsea]], published in the 1892 edition of Forster's ''Life of Charles Dickens''<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=158}}.</ref>]]

This period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at [[Somerset House]] and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term at school) moved to [[Camden Town]] in London.<ref name=Callow2009p13>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=13}}</ref> The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and, living beyond his means,<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.</ref> John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtors' prison]] in [[Southwark]], London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.</ref> Mrs Roylance was "a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family", whom Dickens later immortalised, "with a few alterations and embellishments", as "Mrs Pipchin" in ''Dombey and Son''. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [[Insolvency|Insolvent Court]], Archibald Russell, "a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman ... with a quiet old wife" and lame son, in [[Lant Street]] in Southwark.<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}.</ref> They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}.</ref>

On Sundays – with his sister [[Fanny Dickens|Frances]], free from her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] – he spent the day at the Marshalsea.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=53}}.</ref> Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered "how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age".<ref name=Foster23/> As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''Life of Charles Dickens''):

<blockquote>The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.<ref name=Foster23>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23–24}}.</ref></blockquote>

When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of [[Covent Garden]], the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street. Small audiences gathered and watched them at work – in Dickens's biographer [[Simon Callow]]'s estimation, the public display was "a new refinement added to his misery".<ref name=Callow2009p25>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=25}}</ref>

[[File:Courtyard of the former Marshalsea prison, 1897 (2).png|upright|thumb|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed. Dickens based several of his characters on the experience of seeing his father in the debtors' prison, most notably [[Little Dorrit|Amy Dorrit]] from ''Little Dorrit''.]]
A few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the [[Act of Parliament|Insolvent Debtors Act]], Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors and he and his family left the Marshalsea,<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}.</ref><!-- not for the bequest --> for the home of Mrs Roylance.

Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back." His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=58}}.</ref>

Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which [[working class |working-class]] people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most [[autobiographical novel|autobiographical, novel]], ''[[David Copperfield]]'':<ref>{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=91}}.</ref> "I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!"<ref name="Wilson61"/>

Dickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in [[Camden Town]], where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: "Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle's Establishment in ''David Copperfield''."<ref name="Wilson61">{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=61}}.</ref>

Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, [[Gray's Inn]], as a junior [[Law clerk|clerk]] from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively: he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was [[Charles Mathews]] and Dickens learnt his "monopolylogues" (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart.<ref name=Callow2009p34>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=34, 36}}</ref> Then, having learned [[Thomas Gurney (shorthand writer)|Gurney]]'s system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at [[Doctors' Commons]] and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=18}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=64}}.</ref> This education was to inform works such as [[Nicholas Nickleby]], ''Dombey and Son'' and especially ''Bleak House'', whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to "go to law".

In 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in ''David Copperfield''. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1998|p=23}}.</ref>

===Journalism and early novels===

[[File:Catherine Dickens.jpg|thumb|upright|Catherine Hogarth Dickens by [[Samuel Laurence|Samuel Lawrence]] (1838). She met the author in 1834, and they became engaged the following year before marrying in April 1836.]]
In 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.<ref name=Callow2009p48>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=48}}</ref> He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre – he became an early member of the [[Garrick Club]]<ref name=Tomalin1992p7>{{harvnb|Tomalin|1992|p=7}}</ref> – he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager [[George Bartley (comedian)|George Bartley]] and the actor [[Charles Kemble]] were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.<ref name=Tomalin1992p76>{{harvnb|Tomalin|1992|p=76}}</ref> 

In 1833, Dickens submitted his first story, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk", to the London periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref name="Patten(2001)16ff">{{harvnb|Patten|2001|pp=16–18}}.</ref> William Barrow, Dickens's uncle on his mother's side, offered him a job on ''The Mirror of Parliament'' and he worked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at [[Furnival's Inn]] and worked as a political journalist, reporting on [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]''. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'' – Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=174–176}}.</ref><ref name="Glancy 1999 6">{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=6}}.</ref> Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname 'Moses', which he had given to his youngest brother [[Augustus Dickens]], after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, "Moses" became "Boses" – later shortened to ''Boz''.<ref name="Glancy 1999 6"/><ref>{{harvnb|Van De Linde|1917|p=75}}.</ref> Dickens's own name was considered "queer" by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: "Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations." Dickens contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.<ref name="Patten(2001)16ff"/> In January 1835, the ''Morning Chronicle'' launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s music critic, [[George Hogarth]]. Hogarth invited him to contribute ''Street Sketches'' and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house – excited by Hogarth's friendship with [[Walter Scott]] (whom Dickens greatly admired) and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters: Georgina, Mary and 19-year-old Catherine.<ref name=Callow2009p54>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=54}}</ref>

Dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with [[William Harrison Ainsworth]], the author of the highwayman novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' (1834), whose bachelor salon in [[Harrow Road]] had become the meeting place for a set that included [[Daniel Maclise]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] and [[George Cruikshank]]. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.<ref name=Callow2012p56>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=56}}</ref> The success of ''Sketches by Boz'' led to a proposal from publishers [[Chapman and Hall]] for Dickens to supply text to match [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]]'s engraved illustrations in a monthly [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]]. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired "[[Hablot Knight Browne|Phiz]]" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' and, although the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character [[Sam Weller (character)|Sam Weller]] in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.<ref name=Callow2012p60>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=60}}</ref> The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.<ref name="Patten(2001)16ff"/> On the impact of the character, ''[[The Paris Review]]'' stated, "arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump."<ref name="Paris Review"/> A publishing phenomenon, [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] called ''The Pickwick Papers'' "[t]he most important single novel of the Victorian era".<ref>{{cite news |title=Chapter One - The Pickwick Phenomenon |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/plagiarizing-the-victorian-novel/pickwick-phenomenon/D6F9FF564AD9BDD6865963E107255374 |access-date=26 June 2021 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |archive-date=26 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210626213458/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/plagiarizing-the-victorian-novel/pickwick-phenomenon/D6F9FF564AD9BDD6865963E107255374 |url-status=live }}</ref> The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise ranging from ''Pickwick'' cigars, playing cards, china figurines, Sam Weller puzzles, Weller boot polish and joke books.<ref name="Paris Review"/>

{{quote|The Sam Weller Bump testifies not merely to Dickens’s comic genius but to his acumen as an "authorpreneur," a portmanteau he inhabited long before ''The Economist'' took it up. For a writer who made his reputation crusading against the squalor of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Dickens was a creature of capitalism; he used everything from the powerful new printing presses to the enhanced advertising revenues to the expansion of railroads to sell more books. Dickens ensured that his books were available in cheap bindings for the lower orders as well as in morocco-and-gilt for people of quality; his ideal readership included everyone from the pickpockets who read ''Oliver Twist'' to Queen Victoria, who found it "exceedingly interesting."

On 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of ''The Pickwick Papers'', Dickens married [[Catherine Dickens|Catherine Thomson Hogarth]] (1815–1879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the ''[[Evening Chronicle]]''.<ref name="Schlicke1999">{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=160}}</ref> They were married in [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea|St Luke's Church]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseaparish.org/stlukes.htm |work=St Luke’s and Christ Church |title=Notable people connected with St Luke's |location=Chelsea |access-date=25 February 2019 |archive-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061548/https://www.chelseaparish.org/stlukes.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London.

Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on [[Hampstead Heath]] for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her, [[Rose Maylie]], he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction,<ref name=Callow2012p74>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=74}}</ref> and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of [[Little Nell (Dickens)|Little Nell]] and Florence Dombey.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=225–229:p=227}}.</ref> His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of ''The Pickwick Papers'' and had to cancel the ''Oliver Twist'' instalment that month as well.<ref name="Smiley12ff"/> The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work.<ref name=Callow2012p77>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|pp=77, 78}}</ref>

[[File:Dolly Varden by William Powell Frith.jpg|thumb|left|upright| ''Barnaby Rudge'' was Dickens's first popular failure but the character of Dolly Varden, "pretty, witty, sexy, became central to numerous theatrical adaptations"<ref name=Callow2012p97>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=97}}</ref>]]

His success as a novelist continued. The young [[Queen Victoria]] read both ''Oliver Twist'' and ''The Pickwick Papers'', staying up until midnight to discuss them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItem.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=2738809599926&filterSequence=1&PageNumber=1&ItemNumber=3&ItemID=qvj02315&volumeType=ESHER |title=Queen Victoria's Journals |date=26 December 1838 |publisher=RA VIC/MAIN/QVJ (W) |access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref> ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' (1838–39), ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' (1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel, ''[[Barnaby Rudge|Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty]]'', as part of the ''[[Master Humphrey's Clock]]'' series (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=514}}.</ref>

In the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while [[Richard Bentley (publisher)|Richard Bentley]] signed over all his rights in ''Oliver Twist''. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerged; in [[Broadstairs]] he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fiancée of his solicitor's best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the "sad sea waves". She finally got free, and afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841, he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September 1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.<ref name=Callow2012p98>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=98}}</ref> ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' was shut down, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine, a form he liked, an appreciation that had begun with his childhood reading of the 18th-century magazines ''[[Tatler (1709 journal)|Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]''.

Dickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories, whom he described as "people whom, politically, I despise and abhor."<ref name=Slater2009p167>{{harvnb|Slater|2009|pp=167–168}}</ref> He had been tempted to stand for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] in Reading, but decided against it due to financial straits.<ref name=Slater2009p167/> He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires ("The Fine Old English Gentleman", "The Quack Doctor's Proclamation", and "Subjects for Painters") which were published in ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schlicke |first1=Paul |title=The Oxford Companion to Charles Dickens |edition=Anniversary |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199640188 |pages=462–463}}</ref>

===First visit to the United States===
On 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] aboard the [[RMS Britannia|RMS ''Britannia'']] during their first trip to the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Sandra A. |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2012/03/17/when-charles-dickens-came-boston/LwCtpA83DGQWqFfVEoyfZL/story.html |title=When Charles Dickens came to Boston |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=18 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214082528/http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2012/03/17/when-charles-dickens-came-boston/LwCtpA83DGQWqFfVEoyfZL/story.html |archive-date=14 February 2014 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> At this time [[Georgina Hogarth]], another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, [[Marylebone]] to care for the young family they had left behind.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=7}}</ref> She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens's death in 1870.<ref name="Smith10ff"/> Dickens modelled the character of [[Agnes Wickfield]] after Georgina and Mary.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=225–229}}</ref>

He described his impressions in a [[Travel literature|travelogue]], ''[[American Notes|American Notes for General Circulation]]''. In ''Notes'', Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as ''The Pickwick Papers'', correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|2004|pp=44–45}}</ref> citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens's views on racial inequality. For instance, he has been criticized for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor [[Edward John Eyre|Eyre's]] harsh crackdown during the 1860s [[Morant Bay rebellion]] in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.<ref>{{cite news |title=Marlon James and Charles Dickens: Embrace the art, not the racist artist |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2015/10/marlon-james-and-charles-dickens |access-date=21 October 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=20 October 2015 |archive-date=21 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021125219/http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2015/10/marlon-james-and-charles-dickens |url-status=live }}</ref> From [[Richmond, Virginia]], Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward to St Louis, Missouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into [[Illinois]].

During his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving lectures, raising [[History of copyright law|the question of international copyright laws]] and the pirating of his work in America.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=345–346}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2011|p=127}}.</ref> He persuaded a group of 25 writers, headed by [[Washington Irving]], to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.<ref>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2011|pp=128–132}}.</ref>

The popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he "found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control", causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels.<ref name="flint35">{{harvnb|Flint|2001|p=35}}.</ref> She writes that he assumed a role of "influential commentator", publicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books.<ref name="flint35"/> His trip to the U.S. ended with a trip to Canada – Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and Montreal – where he appeared on stage in light comedies.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charles Dickens in Toronto |url=https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/sites/fisher.library.utoronto.ca/files/halcyon_nov_1992.pdf |work=Halcyon: The Newsletter of the Friends of the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]] |publisher=University of Toronto |date=November 1992 |access-date=13 October 2017 |archive-date=14 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014034207/https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/sites/fisher.library.utoronto.ca/files/halcyon_nov_1992.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Portrait of Charles John Huffman Dickens.png|thumb|upright|Dickens's portrait by [[Margaret Gillies]], 1843. Painted during the period when he was writing ''A Christmas Carol'', it was in the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]' 1844 summer exhibition. After viewing it there, [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] said that it showed Dickens with "the dust and mud of humanity about him, notwithstanding those eagle eyes".<ref name="Brown"/>]]
Soon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', written in 1843, which was followed by ''[[The Chimes]]'' in 1844 and ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]'' in 1845. Of these, ''A Christmas Carol'' was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.<ref>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=146–148}}</ref> The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane [[Ragged School]], caused Dickens to resolve to "strike a sledge hammer blow" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he "wept and laughed, and wept again" as he "walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed".<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=98}}.</ref>

After living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846–48). This and ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1849–50) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.

At about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, [[Augustus Dickens|Augustus]], worked (John Chapman & Co). It had been carried out by [[Thomas Powell (1809-1887)|Thomas Powell]], a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]'') on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moss |first1=Sidney P. |last2=Moss |first2=Carolyn J. |title=The Charles Dickens-Thomas Powell Vendetta |date=1996 |publisher=The Whitston Publishing Company |location=Troy New York |pages=42–125}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of [[Fallen woman|fallen women]] of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named [[Urania Cottage]], in the Lime Grove area of [[Shepherd's Bush]], which he managed for ten years,<ref>{{harvnb|Nayder|2011|p=148}}.</ref> setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=249; 530–538; 549–550; 575}}</ref> Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartley|2009|pp={{Pages needed|date=October 2017}}}}.</ref>

===Religious views===
[[File:Portrait of Charles Dickens (4671094).jpg|thumb|175px|Portrait of Dickens, ca. 1850. [[National Library of Wales]]]]

As a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled ''Sunday Under Three Heads'', he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. "Look into your churches – diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around."<ref name=Callow2012p63>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=63}}</ref><ref name=Dickens1836>{{cite web |url=http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/dickens/sun_3hea.pdf |last=Dickens |first=Charles |title=Sunday under Three Heads |publisher=Electronics Classics Series |year=2013 |orig-year=1836 |access-date=25 February 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925203511/http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/dickens/sun_3hea.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

Dickens disapproved of [[Roman Catholicism]] and 19th-century [[evangelicalism]], seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression, and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like [[spiritualism]], all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity, as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846.<ref name="KSmith">{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Karl |title=Dickens and the Unreal City: Searching for Spiritual Significance in Nineteenth-Century London |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=11–12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/religion1.html |title=Dickens and Religion: ''The Life of Our Lord'' (1846) |date=June 2011 |publisher=Victorian Web |editor-first=Philip V |editor-last=Allingham |access-date=25 February 2019 |archive-date=15 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315073824/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/religion1.html |url-status=live }}</ref> While Dickens advocated equal rights for Catholics in England, he strongly disliked how individual civil liberties were often threatened in countries where Catholicism predominated and referred to the Catholic Church as "that curse upon the world."<ref name="KSmith"/> Dickens also rejected the Evangelical conviction that the Bible was the infallible word of God.

In December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', a [[liberalism|liberal]] paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, "the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation."<ref name="Roberts">{{cite journal |last1=Roberts |first1=David |title=Charles Dickens and the "Daily News": Editorials and Editorial Writers |journal=Victorian Periodicals Review |date=1989 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=51–63 |jstor=20082378}}</ref> Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist [[Thomas Hodgskin]] and the social reformer [[Douglas William Jerrold]], who frequently attacked the [[Corn Laws]].<ref name="Roberts"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Slater |first1=Michael |title=Douglas Jerrold |date=2015 |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co |pages=197–204 |isbn=978-0715646588}}</ref> Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners.<ref name="Roberts"/>

The Francophile Dickens often holidayed in France and, in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French, called the French "the first people in the universe".<ref name="Soubigou pages 154-167">Soubigou, Gilles "Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries" pp. 154–167 from ''The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe'' edited by Michael Hollington London: A&C Black 2013 p. 159.</ref> During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Eugène Scribe]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and [[Eugène Sue]].<ref name="Soubigou pages 154-167"/> In early 1849, Dickens started to write ''[[David Copperfield]]''. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens's biography, ''Life of Charles Dickens'' (1872), [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] wrote of ''David Copperfield'', "underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hiu Yen Lee |first1=Klaudia |title=Charles Dickens and China, 1895–1915: Cross-Cultural Encounters |date=2015 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=56}}</ref> It was Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels, as he wrote in the author's preface to the 1867 edition of the novel.<ref>{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Dickens |title=David Copperfield |chapter=Preface |edition=1867 |location=London |publisher=Wordsworth Classics |page=4}}</ref>

In late November 1851, Dickens moved into [[Tavistock House]] where he wrote ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852–53), ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'' (1854) and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' (1856).<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=628; 634–638}}.</ref> It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forster's ''Life of Charles Dickens''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=648; 686–687; 772–773}}</ref> During this period, he worked closely with the novelist and playwright [[Wilkie Collins]]. In 1856, his income from writing allowed him to buy [[Gads Hill Place]] in [[Higham, Kent]]. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and this literary connection pleased him.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=32:723:750}}.</ref>

During this time Dickens was also the publisher, editor and a major contributor to the journals ''Household Words'' (1850–1859) and ''[[All the Year Round]]'' (1858–1870).<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=589–95; 848–852}}.</ref> In 1855, when Dickens's good friend and Liberal MP [[Austen Henry Layard]] formed an Administrative Reform Association to demand significant reforms of Parliament, Dickens joined and volunteered his resources in support of Layard's cause.<ref name="Slater 2009 389–390">{{harvnb|Slater|2009|pp=389–390}}</ref> With the exception of [[Lord John Russell]], who was the only leading politician in whom Dickens had any faith and to whom he later dedicated ''A Tale of Two Cities'', Dickens believed that the political aristocracy and their incompetence were the death of England.<ref name="Cotsell">{{cite journal |last1=Cotsell |first1=Michael |title=Politics and Peeling Frescoes: Layard of Nineveh and "Little Dorrit" |journal=Dickens Studies Annual |date=1986 |volume=15 |pages=181–200}}</ref><ref name="Slater 2009 389–390"/> When he and Layard were accused of fomenting class conflict, Dickens replied that the classes were already in opposition and the fault was with the aristocratic class.

Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny of 1857]], Dickens joined in the widespread criticism of the [[East India Company]] for its role in the event, but reserved his fury for the rebels themselves, wishing that he was the commander-in-chief in India so that he would be able to, "do my utmost to exterminate the Race upon whom the stain of the late cruelties rested."<ref>{{Citation |last=Robins |first=Nick |title=A Skulking Power |date=2012 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183pcr6.16 |work=The Corporation That Changed the World |pages=171–198 |series=How the East India Company Shaped the Modern Multinational |publisher=Pluto Press |jstor=j.ctt183pcr6.16 |isbn=978-0-7453-3195-9 |access-date=30 January 2021 |archive-date=3 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203145408/https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183pcr6.16 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Ellen Ternan.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ellen Ternan]], 1858]]

In 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for the play ''[[The Frozen Deep]]'', written by him and his [[Mentorship|protégé]], [[Wilkie Collins]]. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses, [[Ellen Ternan]], and this passion was to last the rest of his life.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=788–799}}.</ref> Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18 when he made the decision, which went strongly against Victorian convention, to separate from his wife, Catherine, in 1858; divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as he was.

During this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] to help it survive its first major financial crisis.

Other works soon followed, including ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1861), which were resounding successes. Set in London and Paris, ''A Tale of Two Cities'' is his best-known work of historical fiction and includes the famous opening sentence which begins with "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." It is regularly cited as one of the best-selling novels of all time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charles Dickens novel inscribed to George Eliot up for sale |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/charles-dickens-george-eliot-a-tale-of-two-cities |access-date=7 September 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |archive-date=26 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026175742/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/charles-dickens-george-eliot-a-tale-of-two-cities |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Tale of Two Cities, King's Head, review |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/10340407/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Kings-Head-review.html |access-date=7 September 2019 |newspaper=The Telegraph |archive-date=8 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708082104/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/10340407/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Kings-Head-review.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Themes in ''Great Expectations'' include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.<ref>Charles Dickens (1993), ''Great Expectations'', p. 1, introduction.

In early September 1860, in a field behind Gads Hill, Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence; only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her,<ref>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2011|pp=332}}.</ref> the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=881–883}}.</ref> In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=914–917}}.</ref> That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929.

On his death, Dickens settled an [[Life annuity|annuity]] on Ternan which made her financially independent. [[Claire Tomalin]]'s book, ''The Invisible Woman'', argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play, ''Little Nell'', by [[Simon Gray]], and [[The Invisible Woman (2013 film)|a 2013 film]]. In the same period, Dickens furthered his interest in the [[paranormal]], becoming one of the early members of [[The Ghost Club]].<ref>{{harvnb|Henson|2004|p=113}}.</ref>

==Later life==
[[File:Staplehurst rail crash.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Staplehurst rail crash]] in 1865]]

On 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the [[Staplehurst rail crash]] in Kent. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a [[cast iron]] bridge that was under repair. The only [[first class travel|first-class]] carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'', and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=959–961}}.</ref>

Dickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short [[ghost story]], "[[The Signal-Man]]", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous [[Lists of rail accidents|rail accidents]], such as the [[Clayton Tunnel rail crash]] in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the [[inquest]] to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://omf.ucsc.edu/dickens/staplehurst-disaster.html |title=The Staplehurst Disaster |access-date=28 February 2015 |archive-date=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107132217/http://omf.ucsc.edu/dickens/staplehurst-disaster.html |url-status=live }}</ref> After the crash, Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available.<ref name="UOC">{{cite web |url=http://omf.ucsc.edu/dickens/staplehurst-disaster.html |title=The Staplehurst Disaster |publisher=University of California: Santa Cruz |access-date=15 November 2012 |archive-date=9 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909075818/http://omf.ucsc.edu/dickens/staplehurst-disaster.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1868 he wrote, "I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable." Dickens's son, Henry, recalled, "I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands."<ref name="UOC"/>

===Second visit to the United States===
[[File:Buying tickets for a Charles Dickens reading at Steinway Hall, New York, New York, 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Crowd of spectators buying tickets for a Dickens reading at [[Steinway Hall]], New York City in 1867]]
While he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from [[Liverpool]] for his second American reading tour. Landing in [[Boston]], he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and his American publisher, [[James T. Fields]]. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.<ref name="Hobsbaum1998">{{harvnb|Hobsbaum|1998|p=271}}.</ref> Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at [[Steinway Hall]]. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the "true American [[catarrh]]", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in [[Central Park]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Forster |first1=John |title=The Life of Charles Dickens: 1852 - 1870, Volume 3 |date=1874 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |page=363}}</ref>

During his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Delmonico's]] on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the [[Cunard]] liner {{SS|Russia|1867|2}} to return to Britain,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wills |first1=Elspeth |title=The Fleet 1840 - 2010 |date=2010 |publisher=The Open Agency |location=London |isbn=9-780954-245184 |page=23}}</ref> barely escaping a [[tax lien|federal tax lien]] against the proceeds of his lecture tour.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|1995|p=333}}.</ref>{{clear}}

===Farewell readings===
[[File:Dickensposter nottingham1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Poster promoting a reading by Dickens in [[Nottingham]] dated 4 February 1869, two months before he suffered a mild stroke]]

Between 1868 and 1869, Dickens gave a series of "farewell readings" in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to deliver 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London.<ref name="Hobsbaum1998"/> As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He suffered a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester.<ref name=Tomalin2011p377>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2011|p=377}}</ref> He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in Lancashire and, on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=1043–1044}}.</ref> After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]''. It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited [[opium den]]s in [[Shadwell]], where he witnessed an elderly addict known as "[[Lascar|Laskar]] Sal", who formed the model for the "Opium Sal" subsequently featured in ''Edwin Drood''.<ref>{{harvnb|Foxcroft|2007|p=53}}.</ref>

After Dickens had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were 12 performances, running between 11 January and 15 March 1870, the last at 8:00&nbsp;pm at [[St. James's Hall]] in London. Although in grave health by this time, he read ''A Christmas Carol'' and ''The Trial from Pickwick''. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a [[Royal Academy]] Banquet in the presence of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]], paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, the illustrator Daniel Maclise.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=1069–1070}}.</ref>

On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on ''Edwin Drood''. He never regained consciousness and, the next day, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he suffered the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship.<ref name=Tomalin2011p395>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2011|pp=395–396, 484}}</ref> Contrary to his wish to be buried at [[Rochester Cathedral]] "in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner",<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=628}}.</ref> he was laid to rest in the [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:

{{quote|To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9&nbsp;June 1870, aged 58 years.

Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that "the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue."<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1870|pp=144–147:146}}.</ref>

==Literary style==

Dickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the [[picaresque novel]] tradition,<ref name=Levin1970p676>{{harvnb|Levin|1970|p=676}}</ref> [[melodrama]]<ref name=Levin1970p674>{{harvnb|Levin|1970|p=674}}</ref> and the [[novel of sensibility]].<ref name=Purton2012pxvii>{{harvnb|Purton|2012|p=xvii}}</ref> According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of ''[[The Arabian Nights]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=44–45}}.</ref> [[Satire]] and [[irony]] are central to the picaresque novel.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/picaresque-novel |title=Picaresque novel |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |last=Luebering |first=J E |access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref> Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of [[Laurence Sterne]], [[Henry Fielding]] and [[Tobias Smollett]].

No other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as [[William Shakespeare]]. 
On Dickens's veneration of Shakespeare, [[Alfred Harbage]] wrote "No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius"— ''A Kind of Power: The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy'' (1975).<ref name="Schlicke"/> Regarding Shakespeare as "the great master" whose [[Shakespeare's plays|plays]] "were an unspeakable source of delight", Dickens's lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years.<ref name="Schlicke">{{cite book |last1=Schlicke |first1=Paul |title=The Oxford Companion to Charles Dickens: Anniversary Edition |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=537}}</ref> In 1838 Dickens travelled to [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born, leaving his autograph in the visitors' book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work, ''Nicholas Nickleby'' (1838–39), expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeare's birthplace: the character [[Nicholas Nickleby#Around London|Mrs Wititterly]] states, "I don't know how it is, but after you've seen the place and written your name in the little book, somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one."<ref>{{cite news |title=Dickens and Shakespeare |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/knowledgecentre/arts/literature/dickens-shakespeare/ |access-date=1 September 2020 |agency=University of Warwick |archive-date=13 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813105534/https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/knowledgecentre/arts/literature/dickens-shakespeare |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Dickens dream.jpg|thumb|''Dickens's Dream'' by [[Robert William Buss]], portraying Dickens at his desk at [[Gads Hill Place]] surrounded by many of his characters]]

Dickens's writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.<ref name="Mee2010">{{harvnb|Mee|2010|p=20}}.</ref> Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.<ref>{{harvnb|Vlock|1998|p=30}}.</ref> Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an "allegorical impetus" to the novels' meanings.<ref name="Mee2010"/> To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in ''David Copperfield'' conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=xx–xxi}}.</ref> His literary style is also a mixture of [[fantasy]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]]. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery – he calls one character the "Noble Refrigerator" – are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.

The author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. [[Marcus Stone]], illustrator of ''Our Mutual Friend'', recalled that the author was always "ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and&nbsp;... life-history of the creations of his fancy".<ref>{{harvnb|Cohen|1980|p=206}}.</ref> Dickens employs [[Cockney English]] in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as [[ain't]], and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in 'ere (here) and wot (what).<ref>{{cite news |title=London dialect in Dickens |url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126779.html |access-date=19 May 2020 |publisher=British Library |archive-date=9 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609021116/http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126779.html |url-status=live }}</ref> An example of this usage is in ''Oliver Twist''.

His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. "Gamp" became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character [[Sarah Gamp|Mrs Gamp]], and "Pickwickian", "Pecksniffian" and "Gradgrind" all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, [[Quixotism|quixotic]], hypocritical and vapidly factual.

===Autobiographical elements===

[[File:David Copperfield, We are disturbed in our cookery.jpg|thumb|right|An original illustration by [[Phiz]] from the novel ''David Copperfield'', which is widely regarded as Dickens's most autobiographical work]]

Authors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. ''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.<ref>{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}.</ref> Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.</ref> Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''<ref>{{harvnb|Slater|1983|pp=43, 47}}</ref>{{refn|Slater detects also Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.|group="nb"}}

Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}.</ref>

===Episodic writing===
[[File:Publicité pour Great Expectations dans All the Year Round.jpeg|thumb|right|225px|Advertisement for ''Great Expectations'', serialised in the weekly literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' from December 1860 to August 1861. The advert contains the plot device "to be continued".]]
A pioneer of the [[Serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''[[Master Humphrey's Clock]]'' and ''[[Household Words]]'', later reprinted in book form.<ref name="Grossman 2012 54"/><ref name="Lodge 2002 118"/> These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous.<ref name="Howsam">{{cite book |last1=Howsam |first1=Leslie |title=The Cambridge Companion to the History of the Book |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=85 |quote=It inspired a narrative that Dickens would explore and develop throughout his career. The instalments would typically culminate at a point in the plot that created reader anticipation and thus reader demand, generating a plot and sub-plot motif that would come to typify the novel structure.}}</ref> His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular [[cliffhanger]]s made each new episode widely anticipated.<ref name="NewYorker"/><ref name="Howsam"/> When ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in [[New York harbor|New York harbour]], shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, "Is little Nell dead?"<ref>{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}.</ref> Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.

Another important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166–169}}.</ref>

Dickens was at the helm in popularising cliffhangers and serial publications in Victorian literature.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cliffhangers poised to make Dickens a serial winner again |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cliffhangers-poised-to-make-dickens-a-serial-winner-again-96jplgjhrp5 |access-date=3 September 2021 |work=The Times |archive-date=3 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210903003603/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cliffhangers-poised-to-make-dickens-a-serial-winner-again-96jplgjhrp5 |url-status=live }}</ref> His influence can also be seen in television [[soap operas]] and [[film series]], with ''The Guardian'' stating "the DNA of Dickens’s busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything."<ref>{{cite news |title=Streaming: the best Dickens adaptations |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/13/streaming-best-dickens-adaptations-film-tv-personal-history-david-copperfield-armando-iannucci |access-date=3 September 2021 |work=The Guardian |archive-date=3 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210903003923/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/13/streaming-best-dickens-adaptations-film-tv-personal-history-david-copperfield-armando-iannucci |url-status=live }}</ref> His serialisation of his novels also drew comments from other writers. In Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'', Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship, remarked: "See! They were writing up the log," said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. "Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=Robert Louis |title=The Novels and Tales of Robert Louis Stevenson: The Wrecker |date=1895 |publisher=Scribner’s |page=245}}</ref>

===Social commentary===

Dickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. [[Simon Callow]] states, "From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it."<ref>{{cite news |title=My hero: Charles Dickens by Simon Callow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/04/my-hero-charles-dickens-callow |date=12 February 2012 |access-date=7 November 2021 |work=The Guardian |archive-date=7 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107140015/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/04/my-hero-charles-dickens-callow |url-status=live }}</ref> He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that "Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen".<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}.</ref> Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.</ref> 

At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues – such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]] – but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed "Hands" by the factory owners; that is, not really "people" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens "issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together".<ref name="KucichSadoff">{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] even remarked that ''Great Expectations'' was more seditious than Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name="KucichSadoff"/> The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|1990|p=48}}, citing [[Gillian Beer]]'s ''Darwin's Plots'' (1983, p.8).</ref>

Dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]. "One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell", he said in a famous remark, "without dissolving into tears ... of laughter."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html |title=Deconstructing Little Nell |last=Boev |first=Hristo |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=11 October 2018 |archive-date=11 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011133356/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ellmann|1988|p=441}}: In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]].</ref> [[G. K. Chesterton]] stated, "It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his "despotic" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.<ref>{{harvnb|Chesterton|1911|pp=54–55}}.</ref>

The question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the [[sentimental novel]] is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her book ''Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition'', sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his "sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes", and that "''Dombey and Son'' is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition".<ref>{{cite book |last=Purton |first=Valerie |title=Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition: Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Lamb |series=Anthem nineteenth century studies |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2012 |pages=xiii, 123 |isbn=978-0857284181}}</ref> The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online comments that, despite "patches of emotional excess", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in ''A Christmas Carol'' (1843), "Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |title=novel (literature) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=7 July 2013 |archive-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430021713/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |url-status=live }}</ref>

In ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149–150}}.</ref> For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]],'' which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=44}}.</ref>

From the beginning of his career in the 1830s, Dickens's achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare.<ref name="Schlicke"/> Dickens created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1/> His literary reputation, however began to decline with the publication of ''Bleak House'' in 1852–53. Philip Collins calls ''Bleak House'' ‘a crucial item in the history of Dickens's reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, saw a "drear decline" in Dickens, from a writer of "bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social" commentary.<ref>Adam Roerts, "Dickens Reputation",''Oxford Reader's Companion to Dickens'', ed.

Among fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet laureate]], [[William Wordsworth]] (1770–1850), thought him a "very talkative, vulgar young person", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist [[George Meredith]] (1828–1909), found Dickens "intellectually lacking".<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_fiuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=Not+much+of+Dickens+will+live,+because+it+has+so+little+correspondence+to+life.+He+was+the+incarnation+of+cockneydom,+a+caricaturist+who+aped+the+moralist;+he+should+have+kept+to+short+stories.+If+his+novels+are+read+at+all+in+the+future,+people+will+wonder+what+we+saw+in+them.&source=bl&ots=RCbLV-oFmU&sig=ACfU3U29Onvdso8VoklEJmhhQFZuFwt7HQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjL7euEyMDiAhWjtVkKHQRGBXYQ6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Not%20much%20of%20Dickens%20will%20live%2C%20because%20it%20has%20so%20little%20correspondence%20to%20life.%20He%20was%20the%20incarnation%20of%20cockneydom%2C%20a%20caricaturist%20who%20aped%20the%20moralist%3B%20he%20should%20have%20kept%20to%20short%20stories.%20If%20his%20novels%20are%20read%20at%20all%20in%20the%20future%2C%20people%20will%20wonder%20what%20we%20saw%20in%20them.&f=false Neil Roberts, ''Meredith and the Novel''.

Around 1940–41, the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens – led by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays]]'' (March 1940), [[Edmund Wilson]] in ''The Wound and the Bow'' (1941) and Humphry House in ''Dickens and his World''.<ref>Philip Collins, "Dickens reputation".

In the 1950s, "a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began, and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels: ''Bleak House'', ''Little Dorrit'', and ''Great Expectations – ''and (less unanimously) in ''Hard Times'' and ''Our Mutual Friend''".<ref>Britannica Academica, subscription required.</ref> Dickens was a favourite author of [[Roald Dahl]]; the best-selling children's author would include three of Dickens's novels among those read by the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] in his 1988 novel ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosen |first1=Michael |title=Fantastic Mr Dahl |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin UK}}</ref> An avid reader of Dickens, in 2005, [[Paul McCartney]] named ''Nicholas Nickleby'' his favourite novel.
