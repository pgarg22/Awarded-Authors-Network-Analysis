([[Jeremiah Meyer]])]]So great was Hayley's fame that on [[Thomas Warton]]'s death in 1790 he was offered the [[Poet Laureate|laureateship]], which he refused. In 1792, while writing the ''Life'' of [[John Milton|Milton]], Hayley made Cowper's acquaintance. A warm friendship sprang up between the two which lasted till Cowper's death in 1800. Hayley indeed was mainly instrumental in getting Cowper his pension. In 1800 Hayley also lost his natural son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley, to whom he was devotedly attached. He had been a pupil of [[John Flaxman]]'s, to whom Hayley's ''Essay on Sculpture'' (1800) is addressed. Flaxman introduced [[William Blake]] to Hayley, and after the latter had moved in 1800 to his marine hermitage at [[Felpham]], Sussex. Blake settled near him for three years to engrave the illustrations for the ''Life of Cowper''. This, Hayley's best known work, was published in 1803–1804 (Chichester) in 5 vols.<ref name="e1911"/>

Hayley died at Felpham on 12 November 1820.<ref name="e1911"/>

==Works==
Hayley had already written occasional poems, when in 1771 his [[tragedy]], ''The Afflicted Father'', was rejected by [[David Garrick]]. In the same year his translation of [[Pierre Corneille]]'s ''Rodogune'' as ''The Syrian Queen'' was also declined by [[George Colman the Elder|George Colman]]. Hayley won the fame he enjoyed amongst his contemporaries by his poetical ''Essays and Epistles''; a ''Poetical Epistle to an Eminent Painter'' (1778), addressed to his friend [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], an ''Essay on History'' (1780), in three epistles, addressed to [[Edward Gibbon]]; ''Essay on Epic Poetry'' (1782) addressed to [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]; ''A Philosophical Essay on Old Maids'' (1785); and the ''Triumphs of Temper'' (1781). The last-mentioned work was so popular as to run to twelve or fourteen editions; together with the ''Triumphs of Music'' (Chichester, 1804) it was ridiculed by [[Lord Byron|Byron]] in ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers''.<ref name="e1911"/> His 1789 tragedy ''[[Marcella (play)|Marcella]]'' was performed at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].

In 1805 he published ''Ballads founded on Anecdotes of Animals'' (Chichester), with illustrations by Blake, and in 1809 ''The Life of Romney''. For the last twelve years of his life Hayley received an allowance for writing his ''Memoirs''.<ref name="e1911"/>

==Legacy==
In 2007, the exhibition "Poets in the Landscape: the Romantic Spirit in British Art" curated by Simon Martin and held at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester explored Hayley's role as patron and friend of artists including [[William Blake]], [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], [[John Flaxman]] and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Attempts+toward+fame+and+fortune%3A+Joseph+Wright+of+Derby+and...-a0240017216 Attempts toward fame and fortune: Joseph Wright of Derby and late-renaissance Humanism.] Free Library</ref>
It was appropriate that the gallery's new wing is situated on 8 North Pallant, which formed part of the house in which Hayley was born. A portrait of Hayley by George Romney is currently on long-term display in the gallery.

==Family==
In 1769 Hayley married [[Eliza Hayley|Eliza Ball]] (1750-1797), daughter of [[Thomas Ball (Archdeacon of Chichester)|Thomas Ball]], [[dean of Chichester]]. Eliza Ball Hayley was a translator and an essayist. She translated into English two essays by the French essayist [[Anne-Therese de Marguenat de Courcelles|Anna Thèrese de Lambert]] (1647 – 1733), ''Traité de l’Amitié'' (1732) and ''Traité de la Vieillesse'' (1732), published in 1780 as ''Essays on Friendship and Old Age by the Marchioness de Lambert''. Sixteen years later she published an original essay, ''The Triumph of Acquaintance over Friendship: an Essay for the Times'' (1796).  She died in 1797; after being separated from William since 1789. He attributed the mental illness she suffered as reasoning for the separation. He married in 1809 Mary Welford, but they also separated after three years. He left no child.<ref name="e1911"/>
