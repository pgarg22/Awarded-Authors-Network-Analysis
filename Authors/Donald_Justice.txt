'''Donald Rodney Justice''' (August 12, 1925 – August 6, 2004) was an American teacher of writing and [[poet]] who won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1980. In summing up Justice's career [[David Orr (journalist)|David Orr]] wrote, "In most ways, Justice was no different from any number of solid, quiet older writers devoted to traditional short poems. But he was different in one important sense: sometimes his poems weren't just good; they were great. They were great in the way that Elizabeth Bishop's poems were great, or Thom Gunn's or Philip Larkin's. They were great in the way that tells us what poetry used to be, and is, and will be."<ref name=Orr>{{cite news |last=Orr |first=David |title='Collected Poems': The Ironist of Nostalgia |date=August 29, 2004 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/books/review/29ORRL.html}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Justice grew up in Florida, and earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Miami]] in 1945. He received an M.A. from the [[University of North Carolina]] in 1947, studied for a time at [[Stanford University]], and ultimately earned a doctorate from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1954. He went on to teach for many years at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], the nation's first graduate program in creative writing. He also taught at [[Syracuse University]], the [[University of California]] at Irvine, [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Virginia]], and the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news |title=Donald Justice, 78, a Poet Admired for Precise Beauty |work=The New York Times |date=August 10, 2004 |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/arts/donald-justice-78-a-poet-admired-for-precise-beauty.html}}</ref><ref>Date of birth taken from the [[Social Security Death Index]].<!--Donald R.

Justice published thirteen collections of his poetry. The first collection, ''The Summer Anniversaries'', was the winner of the [[James Laughlin Award|Lamont Poetry Prize]] given by the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1961; ''Selected Poems'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1980. He was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in Poetry in 1991, and the [[Lannan Literary Award for Poetry]] in 1996.

His honors also included grants from the [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. He was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], and a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] from 1997 to 2003. His ''Collected Poems'' was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] in 2004. Justice was also a National Book Award Finalist in 1961, 1974, and 1995.

In his obituary, Andrew Rosenheim notes that Justice "was a legendary teacher, and despite his own Formalist reputation influenced a wide range of younger writers — his students included [[Mark Strand]], [[Rita Dove]], [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]], [[C. Dale Young]], [[Ellen Bryant Voigt]], Will Schmitz, [[Jorie Graham]], [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]], and the novelist [[John Irving]]."<ref name=Rosenheim>{{cite news |last=Rosenheim |first=Andrew |date=August 18, 2004 |title=Donald Justice: Award-winning poet revered by his peers and influential to a wide range of younger writers |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/donald-justice-550298.html}}</ref><!--unsourced claim in earlier version includes [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], Will Schmitz, [[Mark Jarman]], [[Chase Twichell]]--> His student and later colleague [[Marvin Bell]] said in a reminiscence, "As a teacher, Don chose always to be on the side of the poem, defending it from half-baked attacks by students anxious to defend their own turf. While he had firm preferences in private, as a teacher Don defended all turfs. He had little use for poetic theory..."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=Marvin |journal=[[The Iowa Review]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |title=A Garland for Donald Justice: A Reminiscence |pages=177–178 |date=Winter 2004–2005 |doi=10.17077/0021-065X.5933 |jstor=20151937|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Of Justice's accomplishments as a poet, his former student, the poet and critic [[Tad Richards]], noted that "Donald Justice is likely to be remembered as a poet who gave his age a quiet but compelling insight into loss and distance, and who set a standard for craftsmanship, attention to detail, and subtleties of rhythm."<ref>Richards, Tad (2005).
