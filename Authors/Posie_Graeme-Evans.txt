==Career==
===Early work===
Her first job, at age 25, was with New Zealand TV props department<ref name="Moses" /> and she went on to work at the Tasmanian Film Corporation as an assistant editor and then editor. Credits there include assistant editor (sound and picture) on "Manganinie" and "Fatty and George", plus editing a number of documentaries. Work at the ABC followed including directing on [[1982 Commonwealth Games]], directing seasons of football and basketball and, also, field and gallery director for "Nationwide", the forerunner of the 7.30 report.

Selected to be part of a course run by [[Alan Bateman]] to identify the ABC's next generation of Executive Producers – one of eight of the hundreds who applied nationally – she topped the course. Fellow attendees included Kris Noble, later Director of Drama, Nine Network and EP of Big Brother; Graham Thorburn, formerly Head of Film and Television, Australian Film, Television and Radio School; Helena Harris, who, with Graeme-Evans, later co-created ''[[Hi-5 (Australian band)|Hi-5]]'' and Ric Pellizari, long-time producer of ''Blue Heelers'' in its glory days and later, EP of ''Neighbours''.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMDb entry on Posie Jacobs|publisher= Internet Movie Database|url=https://uk.imdb.com/name/nm1715653 |accessdate=25 September 2007}}</ref>

In 1983, Graeme-Evans moved to Sydney to direct episodes of [[Australian Broadcasting Commission|ABC-TV]] music drama series ''[[Sweet and Sour (1984 TV series)|Sweet and Sour]]'' (1984) produced by [[Jan Chapman]].<ref>{{cite web|title= BFI entry on ''Sweet and Sour''|publisher= British Film Institute|url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/363893?view=credit|accessdate= 25 September 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120225052554/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/363893?view=credit|archive-date= 25 February 2012|url-status= dead}}</ref> She later went on to produce serial drama ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' for the [[Grundy Organisation]], and the multi award winner, ''[[Rafferty's Rules]]'' for the [[Seven Network]].

Graeme-Evans married her second husband Andrew Blaxland in 1990, the same year they co-founded their production company [[Millennium Pictures]].<ref name="Moses" />

Her first success under the Millennium banner was as producer of the two AFI nominated children's series ''[[The Miraculous Mellops]]'' (1991–92). Then in the mid 1990s came ''[[Mirror, Mirror (TV series)|Mirror, Mirror]]'' created by Posie and co produced by Andrew Blaxland and Dave Gibson (later head of the New Zealand Film Commission.) "Mirror Mirror" was also nominated for best children's drama in both New Zealand and Australia. In 1996 it won an AFI for best new talent with Petra Yared and was nominated for best children's drama, losing to [[Spellbinder (TV series)|Spellbinder]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1996 Winners & Nominees|url=http://www.aacta.org/winners-nominees/1990-1999/1996.aspx|website=aacta.org|publisher=AACTA|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> and won Best Children's Drama in the annual Listener awards in New Zealand.

Graeme-Evans then went on to co-create and co-produce the many times Logie winning and Daytime Emmy nominated ''[[Hi-5 (Australian TV series)|Hi-5]],'' seen now in more than 80 countries worldwide. In 1997, she produced ''[[Doom Runners]]''. Starring [[Tim Curry]] commissioned by Nickelodeon and Showtime. This made-for-TV film about a group of children in a post-apocalyptic Earth trying to reach the last unpolluted place on Earth, New Eden, was shot with great ingenuity all around Sydney's spectacular coastline.

Posie was also creator and producer of the high-rating, much loved and many times awarded Australian drama series ''[[McLeod's Daughters]]'' (2000–08). She also produced the 1996 pilot TV movie of the same name starring Jack Thompson as Jack McLeod. Shown on mothers day 1996 the pilot became the highest rating Australian TV movie of all time. Her husband, Andrew Blaxland also worked on ''McLeod's Daughters'' as Executive in Charge of Production. During this period, Posie also co-wrote three best selling CDs of "[[McLeod's Daughters: Songs from the Series|''McLeod's Daughters:'' Songs from the Series]]" with composer and long-time collaborator, multiple Aria winner, Chris Harriott.

In 2001, the Screen Producers of Australia awarded Graeme-Evans its inaugural Independent Producer of the Year award for her body of work and in late 2002, she was named alongside [[Meryl Streep]] by Variety Magazine as "one of 20 Significant woman working in film and television" in its annual worldwide survey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}
