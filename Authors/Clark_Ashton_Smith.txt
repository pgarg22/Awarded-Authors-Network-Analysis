'''Clark Ashton Smith''' (January 13, 1893 – August 14, 1961) was an American writer and artist. He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of [[George Sterling]], for traditional verse in the vein of [[Swinburne]]. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside [[Joaquin Miller]], Sterling, and [[Nora May French]] and remembered as "The Last of the Great Romantics" and "The Bard of Auburn". Smith's work was praised by his contemporaries. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] stated that "in sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Clark Ashton Smith is perhaps unexcelled", and [[Ray Bradbury]] said that Smith "filled my mind with incredible worlds, impossibly beautiful cities, and still more fantastic creatures".<ref>[[Michael Dirda]], "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2007/02/18/a-journey-to-the-fantastic-realms-of-clark-ashton-smith-span-classbankheada-journey-to-the-fantastic-realms-of-clark-ashton-smithspan/86dc2cb0-1714-4594-88f6-0c7da8d467ed/ A Journey to the Fantastic Realms of Clark Ashton Smith"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421234419/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2007/02/18/a-journey-to-the-fantastic-realms-of-clark-ashton-smith-span-classbankheada-journey-to-the-fantastic-realms-of-clark-ashton-smithspan/86dc2cb0-1714-4594-88f6-0c7da8d467ed/ |date=April 21, 2019 }}.

Smith was one of "the big three of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', with [[Robert E. Howard]] and H. P. Lovecraft",<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=G. W.|title=A Reader's Guide to Sword & Sorcery S-V|url=http://www.gwthomas.org/ssrgsv.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528033423/http://www.gwthomas.org/ssrgsv.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 28, 2010|access-date=September 27, 2012}}</ref> but some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. The fantasy critic [[L. Sprague de Camp]] said of him that "nobody since [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] has so loved a well-rotted corpse."<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 206</ref> Smith was a member of the Lovecraft circle and his literary friendship with Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937. His work is marked by an extraordinarily rich and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humor.

Of his writing style, Smith stated: "My own conscious ideal has been to delude the reader into accepting an impossibility, or series of impossibilities, by means of a sort of verbal black magic, in the achievement of which I make use of prose-rhythm, metaphor, simile, tone-color, counter-point, and other stylistic resources, like a sort of incantation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldritchdark.com/articles/reviews/68/introduction-to-%27tales-of-zothique%27|title=Introduction to 'Tales of Zothique' by Will Murray|website=eldritchdark.com|access-date=March 15, 2016|archive-date=March 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193753/http://www.eldritchdark.com/articles/reviews/68/introduction-to-'tales-of-zothique'|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Smith was born January 13, 1893, in [[Long Valley, Placer County, California|Long Valley, California]], into a family of English and New England heritage. He spent most of his life in the small town of [[Auburn, California]], living in a cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. Smith professed to hate the town's provincialism but rarely left it until he married late in life.

His formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including intense [[agoraphobia]], and although he was accepted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school, his parents decided it was better for him to be taught at home. An insatiable reader with an extraordinary [[eidetic memory]], Smith appeared to retain most or all of whatever he read. After leaving formal education, he embarked upon a self-directed course of literature, including ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the fairy tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and the poems of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He read the entire unabridged 13th edition of Webster's Dictionary word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their [[etymology]].<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 197-98</ref>

The other main course in Smith's self-education was to read the complete [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' at least twice.<ref>Behrends 1990, p. 5</ref> Smith later taught himself French and Spanish to translate verse out of those languages, including works by [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Amado Nervo]], [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]] and all but 6 of [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s 157 poems in ''[[Les Fleurs du mal|The Flowers of Evil]]''.

===Early writing ===
[[File:Clark Ashton Smith WS 3010.jpg|thumb|right|Smith as depicted in ''[[Wonder Stories]]'' in 1930]]

His first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called ''The Black Diamonds'' which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years: ''[[The Sword of Zagan]]'' (unpublished until 2004). Like ''The Black Diamonds'', it uses a [[Middle Ages|medieval]], ''Arabian Nights''-like setting, and the ''Arabian Nights'', like the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], are known to have strongly influenced Smith's early writing, as did [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s ''[[Vathek]]''.

At age 17, he sold several tales to ''[[The Black Cat (magazine)|The Black Cat]]'', a magazine which specialized in unusual tales. He also published some tales in the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'' in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career.

However, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts to poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith made the acquaintance of the San Francisco poet [[George Sterling]] through a member of the local [[Auburn Monday Night Club]], where he read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in [[Carmel, California]], Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of [[Baudelaire]].<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 200</ref>

He became Sterling's [[protégé]] and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, ''[[The Star-Treader and Other Poems]]'', at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection. ''[[The Star-Treader]]'' was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith "the [[John Keats|Keats]] of the Pacific". Smith briefly moved among the circle that included [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Jack London]], but his early fame soon faded away.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Health breakdown period===

A little later, Smith's health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, ''Odes and Sonnets'', was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft's circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet [[Samuel Loveman]] and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced [[Donald Wandrei]] to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a "Smith" circle as Smith was a member of a Lovecraft one.<ref>Schultz & Connors 2003, p. xix</ref>

In 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in [[blank verse]], ''The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil'' which was published in ''[[Ebony and Crystal]]'' (1922).<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith |first=Clark Ashton |title=Ebony and Crystal: Poems in Verse and Prose |year=1922 |location=[[Auburn, California]]}}</ref> This was followed by a fan letter from [[H. P. Lovecraft]], which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other's coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith's treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the "Clark Ashton Smythos."<ref>Murray 1990</ref>

In 1925 Smith published ''Sandalwood'', which was partly funded by a gift of $50 from [[Donald Wandrei]]. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or [[prose poem]]s. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as fruit picking and [[Logging|woodcutting]] to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to ''The Auburn Journal'' and sometimes worked as its night editor.<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 203</ref>

One of Smith's artistic patrons and frequent correspondents was San Francisco businessman [[Albert M. Bender]].

===Prolific fiction-writing period===
At the beginning of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in 1929, with his aged parents' health weakening, Smith resumed fiction writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories between 1929 and 1934, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. [[Brian Stableford]] has written that the stories written during this brief phase of hectic productivity "constitute one of the most remarkable oeuvres in imaginative literature".<ref>Brian Stableford, "Clark Ashton Smith" in David Pringle (ed), ''St James Guide to Fantasy Writers'', Detroit MI: St James Press, 1996, pp.529–30</ref>

He published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, ''The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies'', in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the ''Auburn Journal''. The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.

Most of Smith's weird fiction falls into four series set variously in [[Hyperborean cycle|Hyperborea]], [[Poseidonis]], [[Averoigne]] and [[Zothique]]. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterized by bizarreness, cruelty, death and postmortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith's version of pre-modern France, comparable to [[James Branch Cabell]]'s Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is "the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished". These tales have been compared to the ''Dying Earth'' sequence of [[Jack Vance]].

In 1933 Smith began corresponding with [[Robert E. Howard]], the Texan creator of [[Conan the Barbarian]]. From 1933 to 1936, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the [[Weird Tales]] school of fiction and corresponded frequently, although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies [[E. Hoffmann Price]] is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.

Critic Steve Behrends has suggested that the frequent theme of 'loss' in Smith's fiction (many of his characters attempt to recapture a long-vanished youth, early love, or picturesque past) may reflect Smith's own feeling that his career had suffered a "fall from grace":
{{quote|Smith's late teens and early twenties had certainly been a heady period: he'd been taken under the wing of a personal idol, the poet George Sterling, and his first book of poetry had brought him comparisons to Keats and Shelley. This notoriety must surely have raised his standing in his small hometown. And yet the depression found Smith without a job or viable occupation, unable to eke out a living as a poet, with girlfriends berating him for his lack of ambition. And while his turn to writing fiction did put bread on the table, he found it a very distasteful business at times—he had once said to Sterling that writing prose was "a hateful task, for a poet, and [one which] wouldn't be necessary in any true civilisation." In short, it may be that Smith experienced that variety of "let-down" or loss peculiar to the child prodigies.<ref>Steve Behrends. "The Song of the Necromancer: 'Loss' in Clark Ashton Smith's Fiction". ''Studies in Weird Fiction'' 1, No 1 (Summer 1986), 3–12.</ref>}}

===Mid-late career: return to poetry and sculpture===

In September 1935, Smith's mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: [[Robert E. Howard]]'s death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft's death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of ''Weird Tales''' [[Golden Age]]. He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Rah Hoffman]], [[Francis T. Laney]] and others.

In 1942, three years after [[August Derleth]] founded [[Arkham House]] for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith's fiction, ''Out of Space and Time'' (1942). This was followed by ''Lost Worlds'' (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith's prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith's poems in press.

===Later life, marriage and death===

In 1953, Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on November 10, 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to [[Pacific Grove, California]], where he set up a household including her three children. (Carol had been married before). For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and their house in Pacific Grove. Smith having sold most of his father's tract, in 1957 the old house burned – the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident.

Smith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth's badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction.<ref>Haefele 2010, p.170</ref> In 1961 he suffered a series of strokes and in August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith's death, Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.

The poet's ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker. Plaques recognizing Smith have been erected at the Auburn Placer County Library in 1985 and in Bicentennial Park in Auburn in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alangullette.com/lit/smith/sorcerer.htm|title=Clark Ashton Smith: The Sorcerer of Auburn|website=alangullette.com|access-date=June 2, 2018|archive-date=September 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926021004/http://alangullette.com/lit/smith/sorcerer.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bookseller [[Roy A. Squires]] was appointed Smith's "west coast executor", with [[Jack L. Chalker]] as his "east coast executor".<ref>Haefele 2010, p.172</ref> Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems.

Smith's literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. [[Arkham House]] owns the copyright to many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.

==Artistic periods==

While Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.

===Poetry: until 1925===
Smith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned ''[[The Star-Treader and Other Poems]]'', as well as ''[[Odes and Sonnets]]'' (1918), ''[[Ebony and Crystal]]'' (1922) and ''Sandalwood'' (1925). His [[long poem]] ''[[The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil]]'' was written in 1920.

===Weird fiction: 1926–1935===

[[File:Strange tales 193210.jpg|thumb|"The Hunters from Beyond", one of Clark Ashton Smith's best-known stories, was first published in the October 1932 issue of ''[[Strange Tales (pulp magazine)|Strange Tales]]''.]]

Smith wrote most of his [[weird fiction]] and [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories, partially inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Creatures of his invention include [[Aforgomon]], [[Rlim-Shaikorth]], [[Mordiggian]], [[Tsathoggua]], the wizard [[Eibon]], and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in "The Whisperer in Darkness" and "The Battle That Ended the Century" (written in collaboration with R. H. Barlow) to an Atlantean high-priest, "Klarkash-Ton".

Smith's weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: [[Averoigne]], [[Hyperborean cycle|Hyperborea]], [[Mars in fiction|Mars]], [[Poseidonis]], [[Zothique]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackgate.com/articles/zothique.htm |title=The Fantasy Cycles of Clark Ashton Smith PART III: Tales of Zothique |last=Harvey |first=Ryan |work=[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]] |date=April 9, 2008 |access-date=September 16, 2013 |archive-date=September 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924094850/http://www.blackgate.com/articles/zothique.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the writings of [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Stories set in Zothique belong to the [[Dying Earth subgenre]]. Amongst Smith's science fiction tales are stories set on [[Mars]] and the invented planet of [[Xiccarph]].

His short stories originally appeared in the magazines ''[[Weird Tales]]'', ''[[Strange Tales]]'', ''[[Astounding Stories]]'', ''[[Science fiction magazine|Stirring Science Stories]]'' and ''[[Wonder Stories]]''.

Clark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of ''Weird Tales'', with Lovecraft and [[Robert E. Howard]].

Many of Smith's stories were published in six hardcover volumes by [[August Derleth]] under his [[Arkham House]] imprint.  For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, ''Emperor of Dreams'' (cited below). [[S.T. Joshi]] is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography of Smith's work.

===Visual art: 1935–1961===

By this time his interest in writing fiction began to lessen and he turned to creating sculptures from soft rock such as [[soapstone]].<ref>Many examples are reproduced in {{cite book|author=Dennis Rickard | title=The Fantastic Art of Clark Ashton Smith | publisher=The Mirage Press| year=1973|location=Baltimore}}</ref> Smith also made hundreds of fantastic paintings and drawings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eldritchdark.com/galleries/by-cas|title=Gallery of Art by Clark Ashton Smith|access-date=October 29, 2012|date=December 30, 2009|archive-date=January 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105143109/http://www.eldritchdark.com/galleries/by-cas/|url-status=live}}</ref>

* "Mother of Toads" was adapted as segment one of the six-segment horror anthology film ''[[The Theatre Bizarre]]'' (2011).

===Audio===
* ''Clark Ashton Smith: Live from Auburn: The Elder Tapes''. In the late 1950s Smith recorded a number of his poems on the tape-recorder of his friend Robert B. Elder. Elder chose the 11 poems at random from Smith's books ''The Dark Chateau'' and "Spells and Philtres". (Elder had first met Smith when reporting on his 1954 wedding to the former Carol Dorman for ''The Auburn Courier'' and they became friends when Smith praised Elder's novel ''Whom the Gods Destroy''.) In 1995 Necronomicon Press released the audiocassette ''Clark Ashton Smith: Live from Auburn: The Elder Tapes'', which includes an introduction by Elder and then Smith reading his poems. The recording was produced by Wayne Haigh. The cassette was accompanied by a booklet featuring a c.1960 photo of Smith and reprints all 11 poems. [[Gahan Wilson]] provided the cover art for the cassette and booklet. The recording has not been released on CD.   
* ''The Hashish-Eater and Other Poems.''. Nampa, Idaho Fedogan and Bremer, 2018. Running time 68 mins. Includes Donald Sidney-Fryer's readings of "The Hashish-Eater" and a selection of other Smith poems, identical to the selection on the CD which accompanied the 2008 Hippocampus Press volume "The Hashish-Eater"; here, however, an orchestral soundtrack by Graham Plowman has been added. Booklet notes by Ron Hilger.
