'''Abdillahi Suldaan Mohammed "Timacadde"''' ({{lang-so|Cabdilaahi Suldaan Maxamed}}, {{lang-ar|عبد الله سلطان محمد}}) was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[poet]]. He was among the most prominent bards of his day.

==Biography==
Timacade was born in 1920 in the small town of Galooley, situated near [[Gabiley]] in [[British Somaliland]], now ([[Somaliland]]). He hailed from the Jibril Abokor, a [[Sacad Muuse |Sa'ad Musa]] sub-division of the [[Habr Awal]] [[Isaaq]] clan that predominately inhabits the [[Gabiley]] region.  In Galooley, Abdillahi Suldaan attended the local Qur’anic school. In his early teens he started composing and reciting poetry (initially, he could neither read nor write). His father and mother died when Abdillahi was very young. In 1936, Abdillahi Suldaan migrated to [[Harar]], where he worked in a restaurant owned by one of his uncles.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mukhtar|first=Mohamed Haji|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2003|isbn=9780810866041|location=United States of America|pages=14}}</ref> After having spent some time in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Djibouti]] in the 1940s and 1950s, he returned to Gabiley and took part in the independence movements against the then ruling [[United Kingdom|British]] administration of the former [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]].

Timacade was famous for his numerous poems, particularly his one euphoric [[paean]] to liberty that marked the 26 June 1960 celebrations of [[Somaliland]]'s independence from the British and pending reunification with [[Somalia]] 5 days later to form the [[Somali Republic]].

In the mid-1960s, he joined the Somali Democratic Union (SDU) and became its main poet, continuing his anticlanist themes. He later refused to vote in the 1967 elections and welcomed the October 1969 coup d'état.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of African Biography|date=2 February 2012|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780195382075|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&q=timacadde+african+biography+dictionary&pg=RA5-PA23}}</ref>

==Later years==
In his fifties, Timacade suffered from a throat illness. He was eventually taken to [[Jomo Kenyatta Hospital]] in [[Nairobi]], the capital of [[Kenya]], to undergo a number of treatments.

Timacade died on 6 February 1973 in [[Kalabaydh]], Somaliland. He was buried in Gabiley.
