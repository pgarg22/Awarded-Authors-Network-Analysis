'''David Ives''' (born July 11, 1950) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. He is perhaps best known for his comic one-act plays; ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1997 referred to him as the "maestro of the short form".<ref>Marks, Peter. "Theatre Review; Mere Mortals and Others". ''The New York Times''. 13 May 1997</ref> Ives has also written dramatic plays, narrative stories, and screenplays, has adapted French 17th and 18th-century classical comedies, and adapted 33 musicals for New York City's ''Encores!'' series.<ref>Wren, Celia.

==Early life and education==
Ives wrote his first play when he was nine. He attended a boys Catholic seminary.  "We would-be priests were groomed for gravitas," he has said. At the end of the year the seniors could be a part of a school show called "The Senior Mock," in which the students satirized the teachers. Ives played the role of "the chain-smoking English teacher who coached the track team (while smoking)", and he wrote and performed a song. This school experience, along with seeing a production of [[Edward Albee]]’s ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'', starring [[Hume Cronyn]] and [[Jessica Tandy]], were two early events that inspired his interest in theatre.<ref name="auto">Ives, David.

Ives attended [[Northwestern University]], majoring in English. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree  in 1971. He traveled to Germany, where he taught English. Ives graduated from the Yale School of Drama with a Master of Fine Arts in 1984.<ref>Grimes, William.

''The Blizzard'' is a short play that was written as part of a theatrical concept that began in 1995 on the lower East Side of Manhattan, in which a group of writers, actors and directors would gather together to create a play from scratch, rehearse it, and perform it — all within 24 hours.
