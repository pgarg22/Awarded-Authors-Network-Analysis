'''Jerome Klapka Jerome''' (2 May 1859 – 14 June 1927) was an [[English people|English]] [[writer]] and [[humourist]], best known for the comic travelogue ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' (1889). Other works include the essay collections ''[[Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow]]'' (1886) and ''Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow''; ''[[Three Men on the Bummel]]'', a sequel to ''Three Men in a Boat''; and several other novels. Jerome was born in Walsall, England, and, whilst he was able to attend grammar school, his family suffered from poverty at times, as did he as a young man trying to earn a living in various occupations. In his twenties he was able to publish some work, and success followed. He married in 1888, and the honeymoon was spent on a boat on the Thames; he published ''Three Men in a Boat'' soon afterwards. He continued to write fiction, non-fiction and plays over the next few decades, though never with the same level of success. He died in 1927 and his body was cremated.

== Early life ==

Jerome was born in [[Caldmore]], [[Walsall]], England. He was the fourth child of Marguerite Jones and Jerome Clapp (who later renamed himself Jerome Clapp Jerome),<ref>Oulton, Carolyn (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Q9br1Yh4EC&pg=PA22 Below the Fairy City: A Life of Jerome K. Jerome]''. Victorian Secrets. p. 22. {{ISBN|1906469377}}.</ref> an ironmonger and [[lay preacher]] who dabbled in architecture. He had two sisters, Paulina and Blandina, and one brother, Milton, who died at an early age. Jerome was registered as Jerome Clapp Jerome,<ref>Oulton, Carolyn (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Q9br1Yh4EC&pg=PA23 Below the Fairy City: A Life of Jerome K. Jerome]''. Victorian Secrets. p. 23. {{ISBN|1906469377}}.</ref> like his father's amended name, and the Klapka appears to be a later variation (after the exiled Hungarian general [[György Klapka]]). The family fell into poverty owing to bad investments in the local mining industry, and debt collectors visited often, an experience that Jerome described vividly in his autobiography ''My Life and Times'' (1926).<ref>{{cite book | title= My Life and Times | last= Jerome | first= Jerome | year= 1926 | publisher= Hodder & Stoughton}}</ref>

The young Jerome attended [[St Marylebone Grammar School]]. He wished to go into politics or be a [[man of letters]], but the death of his father when Jerome was 13 and of his mother when he was 15 forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself. He was employed at the [[London and North Western Railway]], initially collecting coal that fell along the railway, and he remained there for four years.

== Acting career and early literary works ==

Jerome was inspired by his elder sister Blandina's love for the theatre, and he decided to try his hand at acting in 1877, under the stage name Harold Crichton. He joined a [[repertory]] troupe that produced plays on a shoestring budget, often drawing on the actors' own meagre resources – Jerome was penniless at the time – to purchase costumes and props. After three years on the road with no evident success, the 21-year-old Jerome decided that he had  enough of stage life and sought other occupations. He tried to become a journalist, writing essays, satires, and short stories, but most of these were rejected. Over the next few years, he was a school teacher, a packer, and a solicitor's clerk. Finally, in 1885, he had some success with ''[[On the Stage{{spnd}}and Off|On the Stage – and Off]]'' (1885), a comic memoir of his experiences with the acting troupe, followed by ''[[Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow]]'' (1886), a collection of humorous essays which had previously appeared in the newly founded magazine, ''[[Home Chimes]]'',<ref name=oulton>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Q9br1Yh4EC&pg=PA54&dq=Brett+Harte+home+chimes&hl=es&sa=X&ei=-IaOUcLHH7SV7AaYgYHQDg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Brett%20Harte%20home%20chimes&f=false Oulton, Carolyn (2012) ''Below the Fairy City: A Life of Jerome K. Jerome''. Victorian Secrets]  at Google Books. Retrieved 11 May 2013.</ref> the same magazine that would later serialise ''Three Men in a Boat''.<ref name=oulton/>

On 21 June 1888, Jerome married Georgina Elizabeth Henrietta Stanley Marris ("Ettie"), nine days after she divorced her first husband. She had a daughter from her previous, five-year marriage nicknamed Elsie (her actual name was also Georgina). The honeymoon took place on the [[River Thames|Thames]] "in a little boat,"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6cAeAAAAMAAJ&q=honeymoon+%22Jerome+k.+Jerome%22&dq=honeymoon+%22Jerome+k.+Jerome%22&lr=&as_brr=0&pgis=1 Joseph Connolly. ''Jerome K. Jerome'', p. 183]</ref> a fact that was to have a significant influence on his next and most important work, ''Three Men in a Boat''.

== ''Three Men in a Boat'' and later career ==
[[File:jerome-k-jerome.jpg|thumb|right|Jerome in about 1889]]
Jerome sat down to write ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' as soon as the couple returned from their honeymoon. In the novel, his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave (George) and Carl Hentschel (Harris). This allowed him to create comic (and non-sentimental) situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region. The book, published in 1889, became an instant success and has never been out of print. Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty percent in the year following its publication, and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction. In its first twenty years alone, the book sold over a million copies worldwide. It has been adapted into films, [[Three Men in a Boat (TV Series)|TV]], radio shows, stage plays, and even a musical. Its writing style has influenced many humourists and satirists in England and elsewhere.

With the financial security that the sales of the book provided, Jerome was able to dedicate all of his time to writing. He wrote a number of plays, essays, and novels, but was never able to recapture the success of ''Three Men in a Boat''. In 1892, he was chosen by [[Robert Barr (writer)|Robert Barr]] to edit ''[[The Idler (1892-1911)|The Idler]]'' (over [[Rudyard Kipling]]). The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen (who, following the theme of the publication, appreciated idleness). In 1893, he founded ''To-Day'', but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a [[libel]] suit.

Jerome's play ''Biarritz'' had a run of two months at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] between April and June 1896.<ref>J. P. Wearing, ''The London Stage 1890-1899: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel'' (Scarecrow Press, 2013),  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nF8pAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA291#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 291]</ref>

In 1898, a short stay in Germany inspired ''[[Three Men on the Bummel]]'', the sequel to ''Three Men in a Boat'', reintroducing the same characters in the setting of a foreign bicycle tour. The book was nonetheless unable quite to recapture the sheer comic energy and historic rootedness of its celebrated predecessor (lacking as it does the unifying thread that is the river Thames itself) and it has enjoyed only modest success by comparison. This said, some of the individual comic [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] that make up "Bummel" are as fine as (or even finer than) those of "Boat".<ref>Jeremy Nicholas: [http://www.jeromekjerome.com/jerome-in-words/three-men/ Three Men in a Boat and on the Bummel—The story behind Jerome's two comic masterpieces]</ref>

In 1902, he published the novel ''[[Paul Kelver]]'', which is widely regarded as autobiographical. His 1908 play ''The Passing of the Third Floor Back'' introduced a more sombre and religious Jerome. The main character was played by one of the leading actors of the time, [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]], and the play was a tremendous commercial success. It was twice made into film, [[The Passing of the Third Floor Back (1918 film)|in 1918]] and [[The Passing of the Third Floor Back|in 1935]].
However, the play was condemned by critics – [[Max Beerbohm]] described it as "vilely stupid" and as written by a "tenth-rate writer".<ref>{{cite book | title= Three Men in a Boat, Annotated and Introduced by Cristopher Matthew and Benny Green | last=Jerome | chapter= Introduction| first= Jerome | year= 1982 | publisher= Michael Joseph| isbn=0-907516-08-4}}</ref>

== First World War and last years ==
[[File:Jerome Klapka Jerome - geograph.org.uk - 1604687.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|Jerome's grave at [[Ewelme]] (2009)]]
Jerome volunteered to serve his country at the outbreak of the war but being 55 years old, he was rejected by the British Army. Eager to serve in some capacity, he volunteered as an ambulance driver for the French Army. In 1926, Jerome published his autobiography, ''My Life and Times''. Shortly afterwards, the Borough of Walsall conferred on him the title [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the Borough]]. During these last years, Jerome spent more time at his farmhouse Gould's Grove south-east of [[Ewelme]] near [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]].

Jerome suffered a paralytic stroke and a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] in June 1927, on a motoring tour from [[Devon]] to London via [[Cheltenham]] and [[Northampton]]. He lay in Northampton General Hospital for two weeks before dying on 14 June.<ref>[http://www.jeromekjerome.com/jerome-the-man-2/jerome-the-man/ Jerome K. Jerome: The Man], from the Jerome K. Jerome Society.  Accessed 3 March 2012</ref>  He was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] and his ashes buried at St Mary's Church, Ewelme, Oxfordshire. Elsie, Ettie and his sister Blandina are buried beside him. His gravestone reads "For we are labourers together with God".  A small museum dedicated to his life and works was opened in 1984 at his birth home in Walsall, but it closed in 2008 and the contents were returned to [[Walsall Museum]].
