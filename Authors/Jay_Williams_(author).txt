==Early life==
Williams was born in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]],<ref name=den>{{cite web| url= http://www.bookloversden.com/series/boys_children/Dunn.html| website= BookLoversDen.com| title= Danny Dunn: About the author| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120307123951/http://www.bookloversden.com/series/boys_children/Dunn.html| archive-date= March 7, 2012| access-date= October 19, 2017| df= mdy-all}}</ref> the son of Max and Lillian Jacobson.<ref name= NYT-obit /> He cited the experience of growing up as the son of a [[vaudeville]] show producer as leading him to pursue his acting career as early as college.

He attended both the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1932–33) and [[Columbia University]] (1934),<ref name= den /> participating in amateur theatrical productions.

==Career==
===Early endeavors===
Out of school and out of work during the end of the [[Great Depression]], he worked as a comedian on the upstate New York [[Borscht Belt]] circuit. From 1936 until 1941, Jay Williams worked as a [[press agent]] for [[Dwight Deere Winman]], [[Jed Harris]] and the [[Hollywood Theatre Alliance]].<ref name= NYT-obit /> Williams even played a feature role in the [[Cannes]] prize winning film, ''[[Little Fugitive (1953 film)|Little Fugitive]]'', produced in 1953.

Williams served in the Army during World War II, receiving a [[Purple Heart]]. While serving, he published his first book ''The Stolen Oracle'' in 1943. After his discharge from the military in 1945, he turned his attention to writing as a full-time career.

===Writing===
In all, Williams authored at least 79 books including 11 picture books, 39 children's novels, 7 adult mysteries, 4 nonfiction books, 8 historical novels and a play.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.magicdragon.com/UltimateMystery/authorsD.html| title= Mystery/Detective Authors | website= magicdragon.com| publisher= Magic Dragon Multimedia| date= | access-date= October 19, 2017}}</ref> He is probably best known for his young adult "[[Danny Dunn]]" science fiction/fantasy series which he co-authored with [[Raymond Abrashkin]].<ref name= NYT-obit /> Though Abrashkin died in 1960, Williams insisted Abrashkin should continue to receive credit as co-author of all 15 books of this series, which continued from 1956 until 1977. Williams was reported to personally reply to over 1,000 fan letters from his juvenile readers each year.<ref name= "Arnsan SFF Book Review">{{cite news| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=K9P1T0doSpkC&q=%22Jay+Williams%22+%22Danny+Dunn%22+1978&pg=PA163| via= Google Books| first= Daniel C. | last= Arnsan| title= 79-815: Danny Dunn on a Desert Island | work= Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review| date= November 2009| page= 163| isbn= 9780893706241| access-date= October 19, 2017}}</ref>

Like his first novel, ''The Stolen Oracle'', Williams wrote mysteries for young adults, including ''The Counterfeit African'' (1945) and ''The Roman Moon Mystery''. He also wrote adult crime fiction, using the pseudonym Michael Delving.<ref name= NYT-obit /> (This may be a reference to [[Michel Delving]], a large hobbit-populated town in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.) One of his series of mysteries features the American rare book and manuscript collector, Dave Cannon, and takes place in Britain.

Jay Williams also wrote a number of successful historical novels for adults, including ''The Witches'', a look at the eradication of the healing women in Scotland; ''Solomon and Sheba''; ''The Siege'', a tale of the 13th-century wars initiated by the [[Pope]] against the [[Albigensian heresy]]; ''Tomorrow's Fire'' (1964), set during the [[Third Crusade]];<ref name= NYT-obit /> and ''The Rogue from Padua'', a novel that takes place in the [[Renaissance]].

He was also interested in the future in his many speculative science fiction tales, often published in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction''; eight of these stories were published under the title, ''Unearthly Beasts''. His novel ''Uniad'' sees a world in which individuality has shrunk.

His novel ''The Forger'' examines commercialism and art, and the relation of art to real life.

Williams also wrote non-fiction books: ''The [[Middle Ages]]'', ''Knights of the [[Crusades]]'', ''The [[Spanish Armada]]'', and ''[[Joan of Arc]]'', as well as his young adult Landmark book on [[World War II]], ''The Battle for the North Atlantic''. He was known for his extensive research in both his fiction and non-fiction.<ref name= NYT-obit />

He wrote about the environment in his ''Fall of the Sparrow'', describing the [[extinction|loss]] of numerous animal and bird species, often due to man; and he wrote a travel book, ''A Change of Climate'', a European trip with his son, Chris.

==Personal life==
Williams and his wife Barbara Girsdansky were married June 3, 1941.<ref name= den /> They had a son, Christopher ("Chris"), and a daughter, Victoria.<ref name= den />

Jay Williams died at age 64 from a [[heart attack]] while on a trip to London on July 12, 1978.<ref name= NYT-obit /><ref name= den />
