'''Jason Goodwin''' (born 1964) is an English writer and historian.

==Biography==
He studied [[Byzantine]] history at [[Cambridge University]]. Following the success of ''The Gunpowder Gardens or, A Time For Tea: Travels in China and India in Search of Tea'', he walked from [[Poland]] to [[Istanbul, Turkey]]. His account of the journey, ''On Foot to the Golden Horn'', won the John Llewellyn Rhys/Mail on Sunday Prize in 1993.

Subsequently, he wrote ''Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire'', which was featured on the cover of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''. Later, he became popular as the author of a series of [[historical mystery]] novels beginning with ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'', which pivot on the Ottoman investigator Yashim, a [[eunuch]] living in Istanbul during the 1830s-1840s. ''The Janissary Tree'' won the [[Edgar Award]] for Best Novel in 2007 and novels in the series have been translated into over 40 languages.

''The Snake Stone'' involves a French archaeologist and Byron's doctor. ''The Bellini Card'' takes the action to Venice, and involves Italian painter [[Gentile Bellini]]'s portrait of Mehmed II. The fourth Yashim novel, ''An Evil Eye'', centres on the Ottoman sultan's harem, and the final Istanbul adventure, ''The Baklava Club'', involves Italian and Polish revolutionaries in Istanbul.

In 2016 Goodwin published a cookbook, ''Yashim Cooks Istanbul'', based on the detective series, which was selected by NPR's Book Concierge <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2016/#/_|title=NPR's Book Concierge}}</ref> as one of its Great Reads of the year. From January 2018 he has written the weekly Spectator column for Country Life magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.countrylife.co.uk/author/jasongoodwin|title = Jason Goodwin, Author at Country Life}}</ref>
