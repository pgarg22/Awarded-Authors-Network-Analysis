'''Howard Moss''' (January 22, 1922 – September 16, 1987) was an [[Poetry of the United States|American poet]], [[dramatist]] and [[literary criticism|critic]]. He was poetry editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine from 1948 until his death and he won the [[National Book Award]] in 1972 for ''Selected Poems''.<ref name=nba1972/>

==Biography==
Moss was born in [[New York City]]. He attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he won a [[Hopwood Award]]. He is credited with discovering a number of major American poets, including [[Anne Sexton]] and [[Amy Clampitt]].

[[W. H. Auden]] and [[Chester Kallman]] co-wrote a famously concise [[clerihew]] in his honor:

<poem>
;TO THE POETRY EDITOR OF THE NEW YORKER
:Is [[Robert Lowell]]
:Better than [[Noël Coward|Noël]]
:[[Noël Coward|Coward]],
:Howard?
</poem>

According to [[Edmund White]], Moss was a [[closeted]] homosexual,<ref>Kat Long, "Edmund White's New York", ''[[The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide]]'', Jan-Feb 2010, p. 21.</ref> a notion exploited in White's thinly disguised [[roman à clef]], ''The Farewell Symphony'', in which the character "Tom" is a prominent New York poetry editor;<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|date=September 14, 1997|accessdate=March 12, 2013|first=Christopher|last=Benfey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/14/reviews/970914.14benfeyt.html|title=The Dead}}</ref> the "closet" characterization is at odds with the memory of literary friends who remember Moss as openly gay. Moss died of a heart attack related to [[AIDS]].
