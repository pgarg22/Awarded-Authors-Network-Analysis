== Biography ==
Maria Barrell claimed to have been born in the West Indies but appears to have spent her early life in England. She moved to Grenada in 1763 and ten years later married Theodore Barrell. Together they had a son, William, and a daughter, whose name is unknown. In 1777, Maria and Theodore were in America and were accused of having loyalist sympathies during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. They were forced to separate when Maria was allowed to leave Boston to see her daughter in England, but was not allowed to return.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=1 August 2021|editor-last=Goodridge|editor-first=John|title=A Catalogue of British and Irish Labouring-class and Self-taught Poets c. 1700-1900|url=https://www.academia.edu/23444877/A_Catalogue_of_British_and_Irish_Labouring_class_and_Self_taught_Poets_c_1700_1900|url-status=live|access-date=13 September 2021|website=[[Academia.edu]]}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Jackson Bibliography of Romantic Poetry|url=https://jacksonbibliography.library.utoronto.ca/author/details/barrell-maria/820|url-status=live|access-date=13 September 2021|website=jacksonbibliography.library.utoronto.ca|publisher=[[University of Toronto Libraries]]}}</ref>

''British Liberty Vindicated'' is a prose tract<ref name=":2" /> written in 1788 whilst Barrell was a prisoner in the [[King's Bench Prison|King's Bench]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=1788|title=Impartial Review of British Literature|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_General_Magazine_and_Impartial_Revie/79Ueg5YPkkwC?hl=en&gbpv=1|magazine=The General Magazine and Impartial Review|page=251|access-date=14 September 2021|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> In an introduction preceding the poem she describes herself as an "unfortunate loyalist" facing "perpetual imprisonment". The poem praises British liberty but appeals to the right of debtors and explores the futility of imprisoning them.<ref name=":0" /> 

Barrell's play ''The Captive'' was written in 1790 and is dedicated to the [[George IV|Prince of Wales]]. Her address was again given as the Kings Bench, and in the preface she states that she is writing from "the gloomy walls of a prison".<ref name=":0" /> Barrell compares the [[Storming of the Bastille]] to how she feels like a captive in her own country.<ref name=":4" /> She encourages readers to petition Parliament for reform so that debtors can work to repay their debt. She also condemns long-term imprisonment, claiming a person will find it hard to work after such a confinement.<ref name=":0" /> The plot focusses on a soldier starving to death in prison and his wife on the outside who cannot help.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781414434803/page/28/mode/2up?q=maria+barrell|title=Literature criticism from 1400 to 1800|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale, Cengage Learning]]|year=2009|isbn=1-4144-3480-4|editor-last=Schoenberg|editor-first=Thomas J.|location=United States|pages=29|editor-last2=Trudeau|editor-first2=Lawrence J.|via=[[The Internet Archive]]}}</ref> The play explores how bankruptcy is treated as the worst of crimes, despite it arising  from bad luck.<ref name=":0" /> The play was never performed, but it demonstrates how play-writing was a potential method of income for women in desperate need of money, or as a way to attract a patron.<ref name=":5" />

Barrell married James Makitterick Adair in 1791, but the marriage was short-lived and Adair remarried the following year. In 1801, Barrell was convicted of passing counterfeit coin in [[Fleet Street]] and was sentenced to one year in prison. She was convicted of counterfeit again in 1803 and faced the [[Death penalty in the UK|death penalty]], but received a royal pardon. Her punishment was reduced to [[Convicts in Australia|transportation]] to [[New South Wales]]. Barrell died in [[Newgate Prison]] before she could leave.<ref name=":3" />
