'''Jia Dao''' ({{CJKV|t=賈島|s=贾岛|p=Jiǎ Dǎo|w='''Chia Tao'''}}) (779–843), [[courtesy name]] '''Langxian''' ({{lang|zh|浪仙}}), was a Chinese Buddhist monk and [[Chinese poetry|poet]] active during the [[Tang dynasty]].

== Biography ==
Jia Dao was born near modern [[Beijing]]; after a period as a [[Buddhist]] [[monk]], he went to [[Chang'an]]. He became one of [[Han Yu]]'s disciples, but failed the ''[[Jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'' exam several times. He wrote both discursive ''[[Shi (poetry)#Gushi|gushi]]'' and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] ''[[Shi (poetry)#Jintishi|jintishi]]''. His works were criticised as "thin" by [[Su Shi]], and some other commentators have considered them limited and artificial.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010717221551/http://www.renditions.org/renditions/authors/jiadao.html Renditions Magazine]</ref>

According to Dr. James J.Y. Liu (1926–1986), a professor of Chinese and comparative literature, Jia's poem "The Swordsman" ({{lang|zh-hant|劍客}}) "seems...to sum up the spirit of [[Chinese knight errant|knight errantry]] in four lines."<ref name=liu>Liu, James J.Y. ''The Chinese Knight Errant''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967 ({{ISBN|0-2264-8688-5}})</ref><ref>[http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/LiuJ.pdf MEMORIAL RESOLUTION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609210613/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/LiuJ.pdf |date=2007-06-09 }}</ref> "The Swordsman" reads in Liu's translation as follows:

:''For ten years I have been polishing this sword;''
:''Its frosty edge''<ref>Extremely sharp.</ref>'' has never been put to the test.''
:''Now I am holding it and showing it to you, sir:''
:''Is there anyone suffering from injustice?''<ref name=liu/>

:''A decade long I honed a single sword,''
:''Its steel-cold blade still yet to test its song.''
:''Today I hold it out to you, my lord,''
:''and ask: "Who seeks deliverance from a wrong?"''
