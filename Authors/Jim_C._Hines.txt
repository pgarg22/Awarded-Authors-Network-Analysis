== "Striking a Pose" ==
In January 2012, Hines posted on his blog with the headline "Striking a Pose (Women and Fantasy Covers)", a discussion triggered by some of the poses in which female characters are drawn on the covers of books in his Princess Series. Hines attempted to mirror some of these anatomically incorrect poses on the covers of one of his own works and those of a variety of other fantasists. The resulting discussion continued, in such venues as [[Jezebel.com]].<ref>[http://jezebel.com/jim-hines/ North, Anna. "Male Fantasy Author Dabbles in the Dark Art of Fantasy Female Buttocks" jezebel.com January 26, 2012]</ref> Hines has participated in several panel discussions at [[science fiction conventions]] such as one at the feminist convention [[WisCon]], where a group of women including a gymnast and a dancer attempted (with limited success) to recreate such poses; and in a posing competition (benefits to charity) with fellow Hugo-winner [[John Scalzi]],<ref>[http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/12/05/dear-whateverians-choose-my-pose/ Scalzi, John. "Dear Whateverians: Choose My Pose!" whatever.scalzi.com December 5, 2012]</ref> which has brought the discussion and others like it such as [[The Hawkeye Initiative]] to the attention of [[Boing Boing]] and other publications,<ref>[http://boingboing.net/2012/12/12/sf-writers-jim-c-hines-and-joh.html [[Cory Doctorow|Doctorow, Cory]].

Jig is going to have to use all of his brains and luck if he is going to keep himself alive...oh, and save his tribe as well, if at all possible.
* ''[[Goblin Tales (novel)|Goblin Tales]]''  (2011) 	A [[vengeful ghost]] trapped in a goblin's ear ... a flaming spider who must help stop a goddess from conquering a science fiction convention ... a goblin nursery worker who finds herself trapped in the middle of a war.

She loves her prince, Armand, but going from the life of a slave to that of princess is not easy. To complicate matters, three months after her wedding, Danielle is attacked by her stepsister, Charlotte. The assassination attempt fails, but Charlotte escapes - after telling Danielle she will never see her beloved Armand again. This is the set up. Danielle, along with two other princesses ([[Snow White]] and Talia, aka [[Sleeping Beauty]]), must rescue her prince. Along the way, the true histories of all three princesses are revealed, vs. the "tales" circulating about them.

Since the undine are usually a matriarchal culture, it makes sense for the Princess and Queen to take the lead. Unfortunately, things go very wrong, very quickly. For instead of the King they are expecting, they are greeted by his mad daughter, Lirea, wronged by her human lover and looking for vengeance against all humans. In the ensuing conflict, Queen Beatrice is grievously injured. This leaves Danielle and her friends Talia and Snow to find both a cure for her ailment, and to find a way to stop Lirea from making war against their kingdom - and all of humanity.
* ''[[Red Hood's Revenge (novel)|Red Hood's Revenge]]'' (2010) [[DAW Books|DAW]] ({{ISBN|0-7564060-8-0}}) Roudette's story was a simple one. A red cape. A wolf. A hunter.

Roudette is the hunter now, an assassin known throughout the world as the Lady of the Red Hood. Her mission will take her to the country of Arathea and an ancient fairy threat. At the heart of the conflict between humans and fairies stands the woman Roudette has been hired to kill, the only human ever to have fought the Lady of the Red Hood and survived-the princess known as Sleeping Beauty.
