==Biography==
Konopacka was born in [[Rawa Mazowiecka]], [[Russian Empire]], and grew up in [[Warsaw]], where she trained in horse riding, swimming and skating. Her whole family also played tennis, including her father Jakub, sister Czesława, and brother Tadeusz. While studying at the Faculty of [[Philology]] of the [[Warsaw University]] she also took up skiing and athletics but soon abandoned winter sports because the training facilities were too far from her home. In 1926 she set her first [[Women's discus throw world record progression|world record]] in the discus throw, after only a few months of training, which was followed by two more records in 1927 and 1928.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

Konopacka had dark skin and brown eyes, owing to her [[Tatar]] ancestors. She always wore a red beret while competing, and was nicknamed "Miss Olympia". In 1928 she married [[Ignacy Matuszewski]], who was soon to become the Minister of the Treasury, in which function he served in five consecutive governments of Poland. She retired from athletics in 1931 but continued to do sports recreationally, including skiing, tennis and car racing. She continued to be listed as one of the best Polish tennis players up until 1937. She was a guest of honor at both the 1936 Winter as well as Summer Olympics, and in 1938–1939 also a member of the Polish Olympic Committee.<ref name=":0" /> Being a well-educated woman, fluent in three foreign languages, she engaged in writing poetry. She wrote her first volume of poems titled ''Któregoś dnia'' (''Some Day'') in 1929, and later published her verses in the [[literary magazine]] of the [[Skamander]] group as well as in the ''Wiadomości Literackie'', the premier literary periodical of the [[interbellum]] Poland, earning recognition among established writers of the day such as [[Mieczysław Grydzewski]], [[Kazimierz Wierzyński]] and [[Antoni Słonimski]]. According to professor Anna Nasiłowska, Konopacka's works were valued for their feminist approach to analyzing the relationship between a man and a woman, and for their reminiscences of youth and the treatment of the topic of jealousy.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="WM">Witold Malesa, "Silna ręka i miękkie serce", a [[Polish Radio]] programme [http://www.polskieradio.pl/8/1594/Artykul/661323,Silna-reka-i-miekkie-serce (see online).]</ref>

In September 1939, at the onset of [[World War II]], she helped her husband, [[Ignacy Matuszewski]], the former Minister of the Treasury in the Polish Government, evacuate the gold reserves of the [[Polish National Bank]] to France to help finance the [[Polish government-in-exile]]. After France surrendered to Germany in June 1940, the couple immigrated to the United States, arriving there through Spain, Portugal and Brazil in September 1941. After her husband died suddenly in New York in 1946, she founded a skiing school near New York City, as well as tried her hand at fashion design and ran a boutique shop there. In 1949, she married George Szczerbiński, an accomplished tennis player. After her second husband's death in 1959, she moved to Florida, where in 1960 she graduated from an art college at which point she became a painter, working under the alias of Helen George. She painted mostly flowers. She died on January 28, 1989,<ref name=":0" /> and soon thereafter was awarded posthumously the [[Cross of Merit (Poland)|Silver Cross of Merit]] by the Polish Government. Her ashes were laid to rest in her parents' grave at the Bródno Cemetery of Warsaw.<ref name=r1/><ref name=":0" />
