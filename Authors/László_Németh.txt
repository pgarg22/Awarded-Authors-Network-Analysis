'''László Németh''' (18 April 1901&nbsp;– 3 March 1975) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] dentist, writer, dramatist and essayist. He was born in [[Baia Mare|Nagybánya]] the son of József Németh (1873–1946) and Vilma Gaál (1879–1957). Over the Christmas of 1925, he married Ella Démusz (1905–1989), the daughter of János Démusz, a keeper of a [[Pub|public house]]. Between 1926 and 1944 they had six daughters, but two of them died in infancy. In 1959 he visited the [[Soviet Union]]. In the last part of his life he lived and worked in [[Tihany]].  He died from a [[stroke]] on 3 March 1975 in Budapest and was buried in [[Farkasréti Cemetery]], Budapest, where he shares a grave with his wife.

==Medical and teaching career==
Németh was awarded a degree in [[dentistry]] in 1925, and worked in Szent János ({{lang-en|Saint John}}) Hospital. He founded a dental practice, but later became a medical practitioner for schools.

In 1926 he opened his dental surgery, although he continued to work as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] at the Saint John's Hospital in the Department of [[Neurology]]. He was a medical practitioner for Toldy School from 1926 to 1927, at the Egressy Street School from 1928 to 1931, and at Medve Street School from 1933 to 1943, when he retired as a medical practitioner. In the winter of 1927 he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and travelled to [[Italy]] and [[Göd|Felsőgöd]] to [[convalescence|convalesce]], retiring from his career as a dentist.

Between 1945 and 1948 he was a casual teacher in the history of Hungarian literature, in mathematics, and other subjects, at the grammar school in [[Hódmezővásárhely]]. In 1946 Minister of Education [[Dezső Keresztury]] offered him a job as a school inspector for the College of Further Education, and he worked arranging the college's [[curriculum]].

==Literary career==
In December 1925 Németh won the first prize in a competition run by [[Nyugat]] magazine for his novel {{lang|hu|Horváthné meghal}}, ("Mrs Horváth Dies").

From 1926 he wrote articles and book reviews for Nyugat magazine, the {{lang|hu|Protestáns Szemle}} ("[[Protestantism|Protestant]] Review", {{lang|hu|Társadalomtudomány}} ("Social Science"), {{lang|hu|Erdélyi Helikon}} ("[[Transylvania]]n Helikon") and {{lang|hu|Napkelet}} ("Sunrise"), for which he was the leading critic until 1931. (In the "Protestant Review" and "Sunrise" he wrote under the [[pen name]] of László Lelkes.

In 1927 he became a staff writer for {{lang|hu|Napkelet}}. The following year he and his wife travelled to [[Italy]] and [[France]]. In 1929 he had his first [[novel]] published in that magazine, {{lang|hu|Emberi színjáték}} ("Human [[Play (theatre)|Play]]"). In 1930, he was awarded the [[Baumgarten Prize]], but he returned it after receiving criticism from {{ill|Lajos Hatvany|hu|Hatvany Lajos}}. In 1931 he took a {{lang|hu|érettségi}} – the equivalent of a [[General Certificate of Education]] – in [[Greek language]], and later he studied it at university for a short while.

On 29 November 1931 he attended a literary dinner in [[Debrecen]] hosted by the Ady Association, where five [[folklore|folk writers]] ({{ill|József Erdélyi|hu|Erdélyi József (költő)}}, [[Gyula Illyés]], [[János Kodolányi]], [[Lőrinc Szabó]] and himself) were warmly received at their public reading.

His relationship with ''Nyugat'' magazine was somewhat strained,<ref>{{citation

}}</ref> and in the 1930s he had confrontations with the editor, [[Mihály Babits]], who was a trustee of the Baumgarten Foundation, because of his criticism of {{ill|Sophie Török|hu|Tanner Ilona}}. His relationship with Nyugat broke down. In 1943 he wrote a monograph {{lang|hu|Magam helyett}} ("Instead of me")<ref>{{citation
  | title             = Magam helyett – tanulmányok az életemről

}}</ref> in which he stated that one of the reasons for this breakdown was Kodolányi, who disliked the fact that Németh had written a strongly worded letter to Lóránt Basch, who was also a trustee of the Baumgarten Foundation, suggesting that Kodolányi should be given financial assistance. Because of this, the other trustee, [[Mihály Babits]] didn't want to help him. It ended embarrassingly, as Németh was in Babits' flat when Basch telephoned Babits to tell him about Németh's letter. From 1932 Németh wrote no more for Nyugat.

On 26 September Németh founded the {{lang|hu|Tanú}} ("Witness")  magazine, which published 17 issues until 1937. From April 1934 he edited the {{lang|hu|Válasz}} ("Answer") newspaper with {{ill|Lajos Fülep|hu|Fülep Lajos}} and {{ill|Pál Gulyás|hu|Gulyás Pál (költő)}} and from 1934 to 1935 he was Head of the Department of Literature at the [[Magyar Rádió]] (Hungarian Radio Corporation). During his leadership he tried to encourage and promote contemporary Hungarian literature. In his programmes there were many writers and poets who read their own works and discussed them with Németh – they became well known at the time. The programme became very popular and it influenced later Hungarian literature and the Hungarian Radio Corporation's programme scheduling policy.

In 1934 Németh's had his first book published, {{lang|hu|Ember és szerep}} ("Human and role"). In 1935 he joined in the {{lang|hu|Új Szellemi Front}} ("New Intellectual Front") and worked for the ''Sziget'' ("Island") periodical and ''Magyarságtudomány'' ("Hungarian Science").

On 30 March 1938 the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]] [[premiere]]d one of his plays, ''Villámfénynél'' ("Lightning"). Later on the theatre had two other productions based on his works: ''Papucshős'' ("Silent Hero") on 4 November 1939, and ''Cseresznyés'' ("Cherry Orchard")<ref>not to be confused with [[The Cherry Orchard]] by [[Anton Chekhov]].</ref> on 10 January 1942.  On 13 May 1939 the National Theatre introduced his historical play, ''VII. Gergely'' ("Gregory VII").

Between 1939 and 1942 he was assistant to [[Zsigmond Móricz]] at the ''{{ill|Kelet Népe|hu|Kelet Népe (folyóirat, 1935–1942)}}'' ("Eastern Nation") magazine. During [[World War II]] he worked for ''Kelet Népe'', the ''Híd'' ("Bridge") and the ''{{ill|Magyar Csillag|hu}}'' ("Hungarian Star") periodicals. Németh collected his monographs and published them in a book called ''A minőség forradalma'' ("The Revolution of Quality"). He was one of the lecturers at a conference in [[Balatonszárszó]]. At this conference<ref>{{citation

From 1944 and on, when he made the same speech at conferences he omitted his remarks about Judaism.

From 19 March 1944, during the German occupation he lived in [[Göd]], [[Mezőszilas|Szilasbalhás]] and [[Budapest]]. For a short while he stopped writing articles for magazines. After the Soviet [[Red Army]] occupied Budapest, Németh and his family moved to [[Békés]].

In 1969 the publishers [[Magvető]] and {{ill|Szépirodalmi|hu|Szépirodalmi Könyvkiadó}} issued his ''Collected Works''.
