==Approach to writing==
Modesitt has stated, “When all the research, all the writing group support, all the cheerleading, and all the angst fade away, and they should, the bottom line is simple: As a writer, you first must entertain your readers. To keep them beyond a quick and final read, you have to do more than that, whether it’s to educate them, make them feel, anger them by challenging their preconceptions—or all of that and more. But if you don’t entertain first, none of what else you do matters, because they won’t stay around.”<ref name=interview>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180122071609/http://writingraw.com/files/7+Question+Interview+with+LE+Modesitt+Jr.pdf "The 7 Question Interview with L.
