==Biography==
After having studied medicine in his native town, García Gutiérrez moved to Madrid in 1833 and earned a meager living by translating plays of [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]. Lacking success, he was on the point of enlisting when he suddenly sprang into fame as the author of a play called ''[[El trovador]]'' (''The [[Troubadour]]''), which was played for the first time on 1 March 1836. His next great success was ''Simón Bocanegra'', in 1843.
His ''Poesías'' (1840) and another volume of lyrics, ''Luz y tinieblas'' (1842), are comparatively minor, but the versification of his plays, and his power of analysing feminine emotions, have given García Gutiérrez a leading position among the Spanish dramatists of the 19th century.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=García Gutiérrez, Antonio|volume=11|page=458}}</ref>

Although recognized as one of the leaders of the Romantic movement in Spain, his plays were not immediately lucrative, and García Gutiérrez emigrated to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish America]], working as a journalist in [[Cuba]] and [[Mexico]], until 1850, when he returned to Spain.<ref name="EB1911"/>

After his return to Spain in 1850, however, García Gutiérrez became known all over Europe through [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (1853), adapted from ''[[El trovador]]''. Verdi then adapted ''Simón Bocanegra'' into the opera ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' (1857).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The best works of his later period are a ''[[zarzuela]]'' titled ''El grumete'' (1853), ''La venganza catalana'' (1864), and ''Juan Lorenzo'' (1865). García Gutiérrez became head of the archaeological museum at Madrid, the city where he died.<ref name="EB1911"/>
