'''Gerlinde Obermeier''' (1942-1984) was [[feminist]] writer known for her critiques on [[mental health care]].

She wrote ''I Will Not'' and ''San Francisco, of Course'' (or ''Positively San Francisco'' as she herself translated the title).

Obermeier has been credited by some critics with mystical insights in her writing. This perhaps makes too much of a visit to [[India]]. In 1976 she spent three weeks in India with Swami Paramananda Saraswati. This visit is detailed in [[Malachi O'Doherty]]'s memoir, ''I Was A Teenage Catholic''. It seems more appropriate to read her explorations of madness as relating to a celebration of anarchic thinking than as grounded in Eastern religion.

She died by [[suicide]] in her early forties in [[Vienna]] in 1984.
