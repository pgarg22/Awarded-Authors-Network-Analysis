'''Rae Armantrout''' (born April 13, 1947) is an [[United States poetry|American poet]] generally associated with the [[Language poets]]. She has published ten books of poetry and has also been featured in a number of major anthologies. Armantrout currently teaches at the [[University of California, San Diego]], where she is Professor of Poetry and Poetics.
On March 11, 2010, Armantrout was awarded the 2009 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for her book of poetry ''[[Versed]]'' published by the [[Wesleyan University Press]], which had also been nominated for the National Book Award.<ref>[http://www.articleant.com/gen/48945-faculty-poet-honored-for-new-collection.html "Faculty poet honored for new collection"], Aricleant''</ref> The book later earned the 2010 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]].  She is the recipient of numerous other awards for her poetry, including an award in poetry from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts in 2007 and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 2008.<ref>[http://www.gf.org/fellows/433-rae-armantrout "Rae Armantrout – 2008 - US & Canada Competition, Creative Arts - Poetry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603153040/http://www.gf.org/fellows/433-rae-armantrout |date=June 3, 2013 }}, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.</ref>

==Early life==
Armantrout was born in Vallejo, California. An only child, she was raised among military communities on naval bases, predominantly in San Diego. In her autobiography ''True'' (1998), she describes herself as having endured an insular childhood, a sensitive child of working class, Methodist fundamentalist parents.<ref Name="Green">[http://www.greeninteger.com/pipbios_detail.cfm?PIPAuthorID=14 ''Green Integer'' profile]</ref> In 1965, whilst living in the [[Allied Gardens, San Diego|Allied Gardens]] district with her parents, Armantrout attended San Diego State University, intending to major in anthropology. During her studies she transferred to English and American literature, later studying at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref Name="Green"/> At Berkeley, she studied with poet [[Denise Levertov]] and befriended [[Ron Silliman]], who would become involved with the Language poets of late 1980s San Francisco.  Armantrout graduated from Berkeley in 1970 and married Chuck Korkegian in 1971, whom she had dated since her first year of university.

==Literary career==
Armantrout published poetry in ''Caterpillar'' and from this point began to view herself as a poet. She took a master's degree in creative writing from San Francisco State University, and wrote ''Extremities'' (1978), her first book of poetry.<ref Name="Green"/>

Armantrout was a member of the original West Coast Language group. Although Language poetry can be seen as advocating a poetics of nonreferentiality, Armantrout's work, focusing as it often does on the local and the domestic, resists such definitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/ablit/amerlit/armant.html |title=Rae Armantrout Papers at Stanford University |publisher=Sul.stanford.edu |access-date=2011-08-19}}</ref> However, unlike most of the group, her work is firmly grounded in experience of the local and domestic worlds and she is widely regarded as the most lyrical of the Language Poets.<ref>[http://www.literaturfestival.com/bios1_3_6_717.html Author Page at ''Internationales Literatufestival Berlin''] Armantrout was a Guest of the ILB (''Internationales Literatufestival Berlin'' / Germany) in 2005</ref>

Critic [[Stephanie Burt]] at the ''Boston Review'' commented:  "[[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Emily Dickinson]] together taught Armantrout how to dismantle and reassemble the forms of stanzaic lyric— how to turn it inside out and backwards, how to embody large questions and apprehensions in the conjunctions of individual words, how to generate productive clashes from arrangements of small groups of phrases. From these techniques, Armantrout has become one of the most recognizable, and one of the best, poets of her generation".<ref>{{cite journal

 }}</ref>  As Burt noted, and as Armantrout herself acknowledges, her writing was significantly influenced by reading William Carlos Williams, whom she credits with developing her "sense of the line" and her understanding that "line breaks can create suspense and can destabilize meaning through delay." The basic unit of meaning in Armantrout's poetry is either the [[stanza]] or the section, and she writes both [[prose poetry]] and more traditional stanza-based poems. In a conversation with poet, novelist, and critic [[Ben Lerner]] for ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Armantrout said that she is more likely to write a prose poem "when [she] hear[s] the voice of a conventional narrator in [her] head."<ref>Lerner, Ben. [http://bombsite.com/issues/114/articles/4720 "Rae Armantrout"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Winter 2011. Retrieved July 26, 2011.</ref>

Armantrout's poems have appeared in many anthologies, including ''In The American Tree'' ([[National Poetry Foundation]]), ''Language Poetries'' ([[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]]), [[Postmodern American Poetry|Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology]], [[From the Other Side of the Century]] (Sun & Moon), ''Out of Everywhere'' (Reality Street), ''American Women Poets in the 21st Century: Where Language Meets the Lyric Tradition'', (Wesleyan, 2002), ''The Oxford Book of American Poetry'' (Oxford, UP, 2006) and ''The Best American Poetry'' of ''1988'', ''2001'', ''2002'', ''2004'' and ''2007''.

Armantrout has twice received a Fund For Poetry Grant and was a California Arts Council Fellowship recipient in 1989. In 2007 she was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. She is currently one of ten poets working on a project entitled ''The Grand Piano: An Experiment In Collective Autobiography.''  Writing on the volume began in 1998 and the first volume (of a proposed ten) was published in November 2006, and thereafter in three-month intervals.

''Wobble'', to be published in November 2018, is a finalist for the [[National Book Award for Poetry|2018 National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/10/17959504/2018-national-book-award-finalists|title=The 2018 National Book Award finalists are in.
