'''Manly Wade Wellman''' (May 21, 1903 – April 5, 1986) was an American writer.  While his [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories appeared in such [[Pulp magazine|pulps]] as ''[[Astounding Stories]]'', ''[[Startling Stories]]'', ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Strange Stories]]'', Wellman is best remembered as one of the most popular contributors to the legendary ''[[Weird Tales]]'', and for his fantasy and horror stories set in the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which draw on the native folklore of that region. [[Karl Edward Wagner]] referred to him as "the dean of fantasy writers."  Wellman also wrote in a wide variety of other genres, including [[historical fiction]], [[detective fiction]], [[western fiction]], [[children's literature|juvenile fiction]], and [[non-fiction]].

Wellman was a long-time resident of [[North Carolina]]. He received many awards, including the [[World Fantasy Award]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]]. In 2013, the North Carolina Speculative Fiction Foundation inaugurated an award named after him to honor other North Carolina authors of science fiction and fantasy.

Three of Wellman's most famous recurring protagonists are [[Silver John|John, a.k.a. John the Balladeer, a.k.a. "Silver John"]], a wandering backwoods minstrel with a silver-stringed guitar; the elderly "[[occult detective]]" [[Judge Pursuivant]]; and [[John Thunstone]], also an occult investigator.

Wellman write under a number of different pseudonyms, including '''Gabriel Barclay''', '''Levi Crow''', '''Gans T. Field''', '''Hampton Wells''', and '''Wade Wells'''.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Wellman was born in the village of Kamundongo in [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese West Africa]]<ref name="Hellboy" /> (now [[Angola]]), where his father, [[Frederick Creighton Wellman]], was stationed as a medical officer. He spoke the native dialect before he learned English, and became an adopted son of a powerful chief whose vision Dr Wellman restored. As a small child, Manly twice visited London, where the family stayed in Torrington Square (obliterated during the [[Battle of Britain]]).<ref>[[Karl Edward Wagner]], "Manly Wade Wellman: A Biography", ''The Horror Show'' (Spring 1987), 29–31.</ref> When he was still a young boy, his family moved to the United States, where he attended school in [[Washington, D.C.]], prep school in [[Salt Lake City]], and college at Wichita Municipal University (now [[Wichita State University]]) in [[Kansas]]. After graduating from Wichita State with his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English in 1926, he went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from [[Columbia Law School]]. A distinguished football player, he received little encouragement from either family or teachers with his plans to become a writer. An early story, "Back to the Beast", resulted in one teacher remarking "Your work is impossible!" Yet this same story became his first professional sale when editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] bought it and published it in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' (November 1927).<ref>Stephen Jones, "Better Things Waiting: An Interview with Manly wade Wellman", ''Fantasy Media'', 2, No 2 (May/June 1980), pp. 14–16</ref>

He was of partial [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry.<ref>See the interview with Wellman in ''Fantasy Voices: Interviews with American Fantasy Writers'' by [[Jeffrey M. Elliot]]. Borgo Press, 1982 .</ref> According to the author note by Gahan Wilson in [[Gahan Wilson]], ed. ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (NY: Doubleday, 1977, p.&nbsp;253),  Wellman's "ancestry reaches back through the Confederate South to colonial Virginia, with the potent infusion of Gascon French and American Indian."

Wellman's brother, [[Paul Wellman]], was also a well published author.

===The 1920s and '30s===
His first story published, "The Lion Roared" (''Thrilling Tales'', 1927), was based on the stories told to him in his African childhood upbringing. Wellman's first science fiction novel was published in 1929 (''The Invading Asteroid'') but he would not work at full length again until 1941.

Around that time he started a friendship with [[Vance Randolph]], an acclaimed folklorist and expert on Ozark mountain magic and traditions. Randolf took Wellman on trips through the Arkansas [[Ozarks]], learning folk traditions and meeting the secluded people of the American back country. It was through Randolph that Wellman met folk music legend [[Obray Ramsey]], whose music would have a profound effect on Wellman and his writing.

In the late 1920s, during the silent film era, Wellman wrote movie reviews for the ''Wichita Beacon'' and also worked for ''The Wichita Eagle'' as a court and crime reporter.<ref name="Hellboy">{{cite book |last1=Pelan |first1=John |title=Manly Made Wellman: American Mythmaker (Epilogue to Hellboy: The Crooken Man and Others) |publisher=Dark Horse Comics |location=Epilogue |isbn=978-1-59582-477-6}}</ref> He sold many stories in this period to ''Ozark Stories'' and ''Thrilling Tales''. He married Frances Obrist "Garfield" (her pen name), who was a horror writer in her own right; she sold her first story to ''Weird Tales'' in 1939. During the Depression, Wellman's newspaper work started to dwindle, so in 1934 he moved from Kansas to [[New York City]] where he became Assistant Director of the WPA's New York Folklore Project.

[[Alfred Bester]] described meeting Wellman in about 1939: "[[Mort Weisinger]] introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the late thirties... The vivacious ''compère'' of those luncheons was Manley [sic] Wade Wellman, a professional Southerner full of regional anecdotes. It's my recollection that one of his hands was slightly shriveled, which may have been why he came on so strong for the Confederate cause. We were all very patient with that; after all, our side won the [[American Civil War|war]]. Wellman was quite the man-of-the-world for the innocent thirties; he always ordered wine with his lunch."<ref>{{cite book |last= Bester |first= Alfred |author-link= Alfred Bester |chapter= My Affair with Science Fiction|title= Star Light, Star Bright: The Great Short Fiction of Alfred Bester, Volume II |location= New York |publisher= Berkley |year= 1976 |page= 225}}</ref>

Moving from New York to New Jersey in 1939, Wellman wrote countless stories for the new field of comic books as well as for the pulps. During the war he served in New Jersey as a first lieutenant.<ref>Author bio, rear jacket, Manly Wade Wellman, ''Lonely Vigils'', Carcosa, 1981.</ref>

===The 1940s: New York, Weird Tales, Occult Detectives and Comic Books===
[[File:Weird Tales July 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Wellman's novelette "Coven" was the cover story in the July 1942 ''Weird Tales'']]
[[File:Planet stories 1942sum.jpg|thumb|right|Wellman's novelette "Venus Enslaved" was the cover story in the Summer 1942 ''Planet Stories'']]
In the 1930s and 1940s, Wellman began selling to the bigger publications such as ''Weird Tales'', ''Wonder Stories'' and ''Astounding Stories''. At this time, when Wellman was living in New York, ''Weird Tales'' published numerous stories based on three of his most famous characters: [[Judge Pursuivant|Judge Keith Hilary Pursuivant]], [[John Thunstone]], and Professor Nathan Enderby.

[[Judge Pursuivant|Judge Keith Hilary Pursuivant]] (written under the pen name Gans T. Fields) is described as "a renowned scholar and retired judge, hero of World War I, and now hero of darker, more dangerous battles. Huge of frame, an epicure, an authority on the occult, Pursuivant strides forth from his reclusive home in West Virginia to confront evil wherever it appears".<ref name="auto">Jacket flap, Manly Wade Wellman, ''Lonely Vigils'', Carcosa, 1981</ref> 

[[John Thunstone]] is "a hulking Manhattanite playboy and dilettante, a serious student of the occult and a two-fisted brawler ready to take on any enemy. Armed with potent charms and a silver swordcane, Thunstone stalks supernatural perils in the posh night clubs and seedy hotels of New York, or in backwater towns lost in the countryside-- seeking out deadly sorcery as a hunter pursues a man-killer beast".<ref name="auto"/> Thunstone's arch-nemesis was the evil sorcerer, Rowley Thorne. Thorne was based on real-life occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], the self-proclaimed "wickedest man in the world".<ref name="Hellboy" /> 

The lesser-known character Professor Nathan Enderby is a "slender savant and unassuming authority on the supernatural, aided by his sharp wits and his Chinese servant, Quong. His cabin in rural Pennsylvania is a retreat from the frenetic social life of New York City – and a fortress against the powers of black magic".<ref name="auto"/>

While the [[Edmond Hamilton]]-led pulp [[Captain Future]] was a going concern, Wellman wrote one novel for it, ''The Solar Invasion''. When ''Captain Future'' was cancelled due to wartime paper shortages, the novel was instead published in [[Startling Stories]] (fall of 1946).
 
Following a similar path to such pulp writers as [[Frank Belknap Long]], Wellman also wrote for various comic books (what he called "squinkies") and wrote the first issue of ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' for Fawcett Publishers. Later he would be called into court to testify against Fawcett in a lawsuit by National (DC Comics) about plagiarism of [[Superman]] by the creators of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Wellman testified that his editors had encouraged their writers to use Superman as the model for Captain Marvel. Though it took three years, National won their case. He also contributed to the writing of the comic book ''[[The Spirit]]'' while the franchise's creator, [[Will Eisner]], was serving in the US military during World War II. Wellman also wrote for the comic ''Blackhawk''.

Wellman made a return to novel-writing in the 1940s, publishing two science fiction full-length works, ''Sojarr of Titan'' and ''The Devil's Asteroid''. In this decade he published several mystery novels, one a film tie-in.

Amongst Wellman's writer friends during the ''Weird Tales'' years were [[Malcolm Jameson]], [[Seabury Quinn]], [[Henry Kuttner]], and [[Otto Binder]]. Wellman used to meet with these writers in a German restaurant in Times Square on a regular basis. He described these friendships as being "like a brotherhood".<ref name="auto1">Stephen Jones, "Better Things Waiting: An Interview with Manly Wade Wellman", ''Fantasy Media'', 2, No 2 (May/June 1980), pp. 14–16</ref>

In 1946 Wellman won the [[Ellery Queen]] Mystery Magazine Award over [[William Faulkner]] for his Native American detective tale "A Star For A Warrior". Apparently Faulkner was quite upset to be placed as second fiddle to a science fiction and horror writer. Faulkner indignantly wrote to the editors of the magazine, proclaiming that he was the father of the French literary movement and the most important American writer in Europe. Wellman's 1956 nonfiction historical work ''Rebel Boast'' was nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name="auto1"/>

Throughout this period Wellman worked as a harvest hand, cowboy, roadhouse bouncer and newspaperman.<ref>[[Gahan Wilson]], ed. ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 253.</ref>

===The 1950s: North Carolina, Juveniles, Science Fiction and NonFiction===

After serving as a lieutenant in WW II, in 1951 Wellman moved his family to [[Pinebluff, North Carolina]], population 300, to be closer to the folksy backwoods people he was starting to write about. There he immersed himself in American southern mountain folklore and history, becoming an expert on the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the historic regions and peoples of the [[Old South]]. Later in 1951, he made his final move to the college town of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where he lived out his days writing and teaching fiction. Wellman built a vacation cabin on what he called Yandro Mountain in the 'Smokies' ([[Great Smoky Mountains]]), next to his friend Obray Ramsey's place, where they would invite friends for a taste of mountain music, food, fun and a good lick of blockade whiskey.

Wellman worked at many jobs to support himself while he wrote, though he sold many stories and books. His jobs included working on farms, in [[cotton gins]], and working as a bouncer in a dance hall.<ref name="auto1"/>

During this time, Wellman wrote a number of books that are considered regional classics today. Such books, drawn from his rich knowledge of Southern history, include the critically-acclaimed account of the great steamboat race between the ''Robert E. Lee'' and the ''Natchez''.<ref name="Hellboy" />

Wellman's best-known biographical work, ''Giant in Gray'' (1949), was based on his namesake, Confederate General [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]]. Wellman wrote and published significant nonfiction works about the [[Old South]], including county histories, throughout the 1950s and would continue to do so through to the 1970s.

Most of Wellman's work in the 1950s was devoted to young adult stories and science fiction novels. He produced no fewer than five sf novels in this decade, though one was a version of a long story previously published in the pulps. Two of his short stories were filmed in this decade for the television show ''[[Lights Out (1946 TV series)|Lights Out]]''. He also wrote a western novel, ''Fort Sun Dance'' (1955), apparently his only venture into that genre.

===The 1960s: Science Fiction and Silver John===

Wellman wrote two science fiction novels in the sixties – ''Island in the Sky'' and also ''Candle of the Wicked'' (1960); which novelized the events leading up to the discovery of the [[Bloody Benders|Bender killings]]. His [[Captain Future]] novel ''The Solar Invasion'' was reprinted in paperback. However his best-known series dates from this period and comprises stories featuring the Appalachian woodsman and minstrel hero known as "John". These were first published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''. The first stories of John were collected in ''[[Who Fears the Devil?]]'' (1963), based on the personal enthusiasm of [[August Derleth]]. Although Wellman only ever called the character "John" or "John the guitar picker", his later publishers Doubleday and Dell labelled the series [[Silver John]] as they felt the name was a better way of marketing the books.

===The 1970s and '80s: Resurgence and Twilight Years===
The 1970s and 1980s marked a resurgence in Wellman's output and an increased attention to his legacy.  Much of his best short general fantasy work over the years was collected by [[Karl Edward Wagner]] in ''[[Worse Things Waiting]]'' (1973), which won Wellman a [[World Fantasy Award]] and revived interest in his work. His 1975 novel ''[[Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds]]'' was collected from a series of [[Sherlock Holmes]] pastiches stories co-written with his son Wade Wellman and originally published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''

Between 1979 and 1984 Wellman wrote five new novels featuring [[Silver John]] and in roughly the same period produced two full length novels featuring his character John Thunstone, as well as seeing Thunstone's short adventures, and those of characters such as Judge Pursuivant, collected from the pulps in ''[[Lonely Vigils]]'' (1981). A movie based on the Silver John stories, ''The Legend of Hillbilly John'', was released in 1973.

In 1980 Wellman received the [[World Fantasy Award]] for Lifetime Achievement.

Wellman was Guest of Honour (with [[Gene Wolfe]] and [[Rowena Merrill]]) at the [[World Fantasy Convention]] 1983 in [[Chicago]].

At age 82, Wellman suffered a serious fall on June 15, 1985 and sustained severe fractures of his left elbow and shoulder which made him an invalid.<ref>''Locus'' No 295 (Aug 1985)</ref> A  benefit auction for the ailing author was held in London at the annual Christmas Party of the [[British Fantasy Society]] and the funds raised sent to Wellman and his wife in a Christmas card. Due to the onset of gangrene in his legs following double amputation, Wellman's health failed further and he died at his home in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], North Carolina on April 5, 1986.<ref>''Obituary, Manly Wade Wellman'' by [[Karl Edward Wagner]], ''Locus'', No 304 (May 1986), p. 54</ref> Before passing on he had been able to finish his historical novel ''Cahena'', about an African warrior princess (see [[Kahina]]) published in 1986, and the final John the Balladeer short story "Where Did She Wander".

The agent for his literary estate was his friend, the writer and editor [[Karl Edward Wagner]], who edited the posthumous collections ''Valley So Low: Southern Mountain  Stories'' and ''John the Balladeer''. A benefit auction was held for Wellman's widow Frances, arranged by Southern fans Beth Gwinn and Sheri Morton, which raised $28,300 in funds. [[Harlan Ellison]] was the auctioneer. Included in the auction were such items as a mug owned by both [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and [[Fritz Leiber]], a coin from [[Mel Brooks]] and the shirt which Ellison wore while writing his story "Maggie Money-Eyes".<ref>''Locus'', No 309 (Oct 1986) and No 310 (Nov 1986)</ref>

Frances Wellman died on May 7, 2000.  She was cremated and her ashes spread on the lawn of their home at Dogwood Acres in Chapel Hill, NC.

A son, Wade Wellman, died January 25, 2018, in Waukesha, Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://obittree.com/obituary/us/wisconsin/waukesha/cesarz-charapata--zinnecker/wade-wellman/3414546/tributes.php|title=Wade Wellman Obituary - WAUKESHA, WI - ObitTree™|website=obittree.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref>

==Adaptations==
The Silver John stories were the inspiration for "Who Fears the Devil?", a 1994 recording by [[Joe Bethancourt]] that featured both traditional Appalachian folk songs that Silver John would have known, and Wellman's original lyrics that were in many of the Silver John stories, set to the traditional melodies that Wellman used as models.
