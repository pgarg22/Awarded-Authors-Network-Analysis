== Early career ==
Charles began his career as a contemporary and urban performance poet on the British [[cabaret]] circuit. His performances were considered original, with Charles described as having a natural ironic wit which appealed to talent scouts. In 1981, Charles climbed on stage at a [[Teardrop Explodes]] concert and recited a humorous, but derogatory, poem about the band's singer, [[Julian Cope]]. He was invited to open subsequent gigs for the group and went on to perform as a support act in pubs and clubs for the following three years,<ref>''Q magazine'', April 1987, David Housham "Craig Charles: Compulsive Listening", pp. 25–26</ref> and at events such as the ''Larks in the Park'' music festival at [[Sefton Park]] (1982).

He was part of the ''[[Red Wedge]]'' comedy tour in 1986, which aimed to raise awareness of the social problems of the time, in support of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He also performed his first one-man show in 1986,<ref>[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=19588 ''Raising the Roof for the Gateway Exchange''], 29 August 1986, Edinburgh Festival Fringe</ref> which premiered in Edinburgh, and then toured internationally.<ref>''The Glasgow Herald'', 13 August 1987, Andrew Young [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19870813&id=yDpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2116,2850085 ''The Fringe: Craig Charles'']</ref> Charles was a guest on programmes including [[Janice Long]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mrsoulsbury.com/2011/04/april-podcast-with-craig-charles-and.html |title=Mr Soulsbury: April Podcast with Craig Charles and Ewan Hoozami! |last=Make Design Enjoy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723034413/http://www.mrsoulsbury.com/2011/04/april-podcast-with-craig-charles-and.html |archive-date=23 July 2011 |access-date=2 July 2012}}</ref> and was a regular panellist on [[Ned Sherrin]]'s chat show ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]'' (1987–88) on [[BBC Radio 4]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/champion-of-funk-soul-brothers-6151442.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218144235/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/champion-of-funk-soul-brothers-6151442.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 December 2013 |title=Champion of funk soul brothers |last=Burrell |first=Ian |date=7 March 2005 |publisher=The Independent, 7 March 2005 |location=London}}</ref>

=== ''Red Dwarf'' ===
[[File:Craig Charles (03).jpg|thumb|190px|Craig Charles in 2009]]
Charles' first television acting role was the Liverpudlian slob [[Dave Lister]] in science fiction comedy series ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. He was introduced to the show by ''Saturday Live'' and ''Red Dwarf'' producer [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]], who wanted his opinion on whether the black character [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]] was a racist stereotype.<ref name=how>{{cite news |last1=Pelley |first1=Rich |title=How we made Red Dwarf |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/05/how-we-made-red-dwarf-doug-naylor-craig-charles-bbc |access-date=15 October 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=5 March 2019}}</ref> Charles, who like all of the eventual main cast had no acting experience, was eventually offered an audition after begging Jackson.<ref name="how"/>

Charles has appeared in all twelve series. Charles' younger brother, Emile Charles, guest-starred in the Series III episode "[[Timeslides]]", and the songs "Bad News" and "Cash" in this episode were written by Charles and performed by his band.<ref>Andrew Ellard, ''Red Dwarf series III DVD boxset Collector's Booklet'', Grant Naylor Productions, 2003, pp. 8</ref> The role has involved Charles playing a variety of alternative characters, including a gangster, a cowboy and angelic and evil versions of Lister,<ref>''TV Zone'', November 1993, Carrie Cantor "Red Dwarf Interview: Lager Lout Lister", pp. 8–11</ref> and in him carrying out a wide range of stunts, and acting involving special effects.

During ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'', Lister visits the set of ''Coronation Street'', where he meets the actor Craig Charles.<ref>''Blokely'', 7 November 2012, James York & Richard Luck [http://blokely.com/entertainment/craig-charles-interview-red-dwarf-x " Craig Charles: Funk & Soul x Sci-fi"]</ref>

=== ''Robot Wars'' ===
Charles presented ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' on BBC2 (1998–2003) and Channel 5 (2003–04), from series 2 until series 7, which included two ''Extreme'' series and numerous 'specials'. Charles was the main host and presided over the arena in which teams of amateur engineers battled their home-made radio-controlled robots against each other, and against the house robots. Charles introduced the show, enthusiastically announced the results of the battles and spoke to the contestants after the main events. He ended each episode with a short ''Robot Wars''-themed poem. Charles' son, Jack, appeared on the show on several occasions, and was a contestant on "Team Nemesis" during series 4. Charles also hosted the ''Robot Wars Live'' UK tour, in 2001 and shows performed at the [[Wembley Arena]].

''Robot Wars'' returned to the BBC in 2016. Charles stated his interest in hosting it again, but the job went to [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Angela Scanlon]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fletcher |first1=Harry |title=Dara Ó Briain replaces Craig Charles as new Robot Wars presenter |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a782201/dara-o-briain-and-angela-scanlon-taking-over-from-craig-charles-as-robot-wars-presenters/ |access-date=15 October 2020 |publisher=Digital Spy |date=3 February 2016}}</ref>

=== ''Takeshi's Castle'' ===

In each episode, between 100 and 142 contestants attempted to pass a series of wacky and near-impossible physical challenges to reach the Show Down at the castle against Japanese actor [[Takeshi Kitano]] for a chance to win large cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the programme and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and also some special and "best of" episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers - and also coined the term "Keshi Heads" to describe fans of the show. A 2013 reboot narrated by [[Dick and Dom]] was not as well received.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warner |first1=Sam |title=Takeshi's Castle is returning to UK television, but Craig Charles will be replaced as commentator |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a839650/takeshis-castle-returning-without-craig-charles/ |access-date=20 October 2020 |publisher=Digital Spy |date=3 October 2017}}</ref>

In 2006, Charles starred in two British feature films: the fantasy film ''Fated'' and the gangster film ''Clubbing to Death''. Charles voiced Zipper the Cat in the animation ''Prince Cinders'' (1993) and Asterix in ''[[Asterix Conquers America]]'' (1994). Roles in short films include playing Keith Dennis in the comedy ''The Colour of Funny'' (1999) and Mark in the drama ''Ten Minutes'' (2004).

== Writing ==
In 1993, Charles worked with Russell Bell on the ''Craig Charles Almanac of Total Knowledge'', writing about his 'streetwise' sense of humour on a range of topics, from the world's most embarrassing stories to how to explain the mysteries of the universe. In 1997, Charles and Bell wrote Charles' ''Red Dwarf'' character's book ''The Log'', in which Lister decides to leave a log detailing mankind's greatest achievements. In 1998, Charles published ''No Other Blue'', a collection of his poetry, with illustrations by Philippa Drakeford, on diverse personal subjects including prison, his mother's final illness, love and politics at home and abroad. More recently he has written a series of nursery rhymes titled "Scary Fairy and the Tales of the Dark Wood".

In 2000, Charles wrote his first autobiography about his experiences growing up in Liverpool, titled ''No Irish, No Niggers''. In 2007, he announced he would release his autobiography, planned for March 2008, published by [[Hodder Headline]] and titled ''On the Rocks'', which would cover the recent incidents in his life and be based on much of his journal, which Charles said he kept while in rehab.<ref>{{Cite news
