==Playwriting==

===Plays===
In 1992, while living in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], Gomolvilas began writing plays. His plays include ''Big Hunk o' Burnin' Love'' (1998), ''The Theory of Everything'' (2000), winner of the Beverly Hills Theatre Guild/Julie Harris Playwright Award, the International Herald Tribune/SRT Playwriting Award, and the PEN Center USA West Literary Award for Drama, ''Bee'' (2001), and the [[theatre|stage]] adaptation of ''Mysterious Skin'' (2003), which is based on the [[novel]] by [[Scott Heim]].

In collaboration with musician [[Brandon Patton]], Gomolvilas wrote ''Jukebox Stories'', in which he also performs in. A self-described "storytelling/song-singing/bingo-playing theatrical extravaganza," the three, different full-length shows ran in 2006 as ''Jukebox Stories'', in 2008 as ''Jukebox Stories: The Case of The Creamy Foam'' and in 2013 as ''Jukebox Stories: The Secrets of Forking.'' The initial runs of the shows were at the Impact Theater in [[Berkeley, California]] but eventually expanded to a wide array of venues including other theaters, coffee shops, bars, colleges, comedy clubs, music venues and more in Boston, Los Angeles, Middletown (CT), Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Smithfield (RI), and Washington (DC), as well as the National Asian American Theater Festival. The show  received strong reviews in the [[East Bay Express]] and the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], was also an "Editor's Pick" in Theatre Bay Area magazine.

Gomolvilas' other plays include ''Seat Belts and Big Fat Buddhas'' (1999), ''Debunking Love''' (2000), ''Boyz of All Nationz: The Rise and Fall of a Multi-Ethnic Boy Band'' (2002), and ''The Fabulous Adventures of Captain Queer'' (2006). He frequently writes comedies with a supernatural twist.

Gomolvilas also developed at TheatreWorks in the San Francisco Bay Area the short plays ''Oskar: The Kid That Could'' (which encourages students to embrace reading and writing), ''Oskar and the Big Bully Battle'' (which confronts the issue of bullying), and ''Oskar and the Last Straw'' (which tackles issues of self-worth and resiliency). These three plays have been touring elementary schools throughout the Bay Area since 2006. The Alley Theatre in Houston began touring ''Oskar and the Big Bully Battle'' in 2014, and has commissioned Gomolvilas to write ''Oskar and the Curiously Colorful Clash,'' a play about diversity that will start touring in 2015.

To supplement the California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2000, the New Conservatory Theatre Center's YouthAware Educational Theatre in San Francisco commissioned Prince to research, develop, and write the play ''Outspoken'', which explores the many reasons teenagers feel ostracized and which has been touring to middle schools and high schools throughout Northern and Central California since 2005.

Recurring themes in his work include the contemporary Asian-American experience, the tension between immigrants and their offspring, queer identity, race relations in the United States, the trauma of displacement, and the complexities of loss and grief.

===Short plays===
His short plays include ''Cause and Effect on Clement Street'' (Actors' Theatre, Santa Cruz, 1997), ''Donut Holes in Orbit'' (Ensemble Studio Theatre, New York City, 1998), Cyclops (Theatre Rhinoceros, San Francisco, 2001), ''Bridges'' (City Lights Theatre Company, San Jose, 2002), ''The Last Gayorcism'' (Chalk Repertory Theatre, Los Angeles, 2010), ''Chunky Mary'' (Ferocious Lotus Theatre Company, San Francisco, 2010), ''ATM'' ([[East West Players]]' Studio Lab Project, Los Angeles, 2011), and ''Heteronesia'' (Impact Theatre, Berkeley, 2014).
