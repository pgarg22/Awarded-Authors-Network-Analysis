Her father, Paul T. Williams, was a surgeon, and her mother, Eloise Williams, was an educator and a psychiatric social worker. When she was aged eight, Shange's family moved to the racially segregated city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. As a result of the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' court decision, Shange was bused to a white school where she endured racism and racist attacks.

Shange's family had a strong interest in the arts and encouraged her artistic education. Among the guests at their home were [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name="Voices from the Gap">{{cite web|last=Kosseh-Kamada|first=Mafo|title=Ntozake Shange Biography|url=http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/shange_ntozake.php|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> From an early age, Shange took an interest in poetry.<ref name="Henry Blackwell">{{cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Henry|title=An Interview with Ntozake Shange|journal=Black American Literature Forum|date=1979|volume=13|issue=4|pages=134–138|doi=10.2307/3041478|jstor=3041478}}</ref> While growing up with her family in Trenton, Shange attended poetry readings with her younger sister Wanda (now known as the playwright [[Ifa Bayeza]]).<ref>[http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2013/03/27/author-ifa-bayeza-comes-home-at-library-reading-and-book-signing/ "Author Ifa Bayeza Comes 'Home' at Library Reading and Book Signing"], ''Town Topics'', March 27, 2013.</ref> These poetry readings fostered an early interest for Shange in the South in particular, and the loss it represented to young Black children who migrated to the North with their parents.<ref name="Henry Blackwell"/> In 1956, Shange's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where Shange was sent several miles away from home to a non-segregated school that allowed her to receive "gifted" education. While attending this non-segregated school, Shange faced overt racism and harassment. These experiences would later go on to heavily influence her work.<ref name="Voices from the Gap" />

==Career==
In 1975, Shange moved back to New York City, after earning her master's degree in American Studies in 1973<ref>{{cite web|last=Kosseh-Kamanda|first=Mafo|title=Ntozake Shange: Biography/Criticism|url=http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/shange_ntozake.php|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> from the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles, California.

First produced [[Off-Broadway]], the play soon moved on to Broadway at the [[Booth Theater]] and won several awards, including the [[Obie Award]], [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], and the [[AUDELCO]] Award. This play, her most famous work, was a 20-part [[choreopoem]] — a term Shange coined to describe her groundbreaking dramatic form, combining of poetry, dance, music, and song<ref>Carr, Jane (October 28, 2018), [https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/28/opinions/ntozake-shange-remembered-in-tweets/index.html "What 'For Colored Girls' meant to us"], CNN.</ref> — that chronicled the lives of women of color in the United States. The poem was eventually made into the stage play, was then published in book form in 1977. In 2010, the choreopoem was adapted into a film (''[[For Colored Girls]]'', directed by [[Tyler Perry]]). Shange subsequently wrote other successful plays, including ''[[Spell No. 7]]'', a 1979 choreopoem that explores the Black experience,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mahne|first=Theodore|title='Spell #7' offers a dated but passionate, poetic look at black experience|url=http://www.nola.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/04/spell_7_offers_a_dated_but_pas.html|work=The Times-Picayune|date=April 22, 2013|access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> and an adaptation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' (1980), which won an Obie Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/ntozake-shange-dead-for-colored-girls-playwright-obituary-1202490913/|title=Ntozake Shange Dies: The 'For Colored Girls' Playwright Was 70|first=Dino-Ray|last=Ramos|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 28, 2018}}</ref>

In 1978, Shange became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}} The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Shange taught in the Creative Writing Program at the [[University of Houston]] from 1984 to 1986. While there she wrote the [[ekphrastic]] poetry collection ''Ridin the Moon in Texas: Word Paintings'' and served as thesis advisor for poet and playwright [[Annie Finch]].

==Relationship to the Black Arts Movement==

The [[Black Arts Movement]]—also known as BAM—has been described as the "aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept."<ref name="english.illinois.edu">[[Kalamu ya Salaam|Ya Salaam, Kaluma]] [sic], [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/blackarts/historical.htm "Historical Overviews of the Black Arts Movement"]. Modern American Poetry. The University of Illinois, 1995.</ref> The Black Arts Movement is a subset of the [[Black Power Movement]]. [[Larry Neal]] described the Black Arts Movement as a "radical reordering of the western cultural aesthetic." Key concepts of BAM were focused on a "separate symbolism, mythology, critique, and iconology" as well as the African American's desire for "self-determination and nationhood."<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/> BAM consisted of actors, actresses, choreographers, musicians, novelists, poets, photographers, and artists. Though male artists such as [[Amiri Baraka]] heavily dominated the Black Arts Movement, some notable women writers of the movement were [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Rosa Guy]], [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[Lucille Clifton]], and [[Sonia Sanchez]], among others. Although Shange is described as a "post-Black artist," her work was decidedly feminist whereas BAM has been criticized as misogynistic and "sexism had been widely and hotly debated within movement publications and organizations."<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/> Corresponding with the idea that art from BAM was a "radical reordering of the western cultural aesthetic," Shange herself described her atypical writing style. In regards to her plays, she stated: "A play has a form that has to be finished. A performance piece has an organic form, but it can even flow. And there doesn't have to be some ultimate climax in it. And there does not have to be a denouement."<ref>Anderlini, Serena. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/viewFile/1820/1783 "Drama or Performance Art? An Interview with Ntozake Shange"], ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'' (1991): 85–98. University of Kansas.</ref>

Though Shange's work did have a "radical reordering of western cultural aesthetics" with its spelling, structure, and style, Baraka—one of the leading male figures of the movement denied her as a post-Black artist.<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/> In regards to Shange as a part of the black aesthetic and as a post-Black artist, he claimed "that several women writers, among them [[Michele Wallace|Michelle Wallace]] [sic] and Ntozake Shange, like [[Ishmael Reed|[Ishmael] Reed]], had their own 'Hollywood' aesthetic, one of 'capitulation' and 'garbage.'"<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/> In regards to a black aesthetic, Shange described different styles of writing for different parts of the country. She stated: "There's not a California style, but there are certain feelings and a certain freeness that set those writers off from those in the Chicago-St. Louis-Detroit tripod group...so that the chauvinism that you might find that's exclusionary, in that triangle, you don't find too much in California."<ref name="Henry Blackwell"/> Shange set her writing apart from the Black aesthetic of the Black arts movement by creating a "special aesthetic" for black women "to an extent." She claimed, "the same rhetoric that is used to establish the Black Aesthetic, we must use to establish a women's aesthetic, which is to say that those parts of reality that are ours, those things about our bodies, the cycles of our lives that have been ignored for centuries in all castes and classes of our people, are to be dealt with now."<ref name="Henry Blackwell"/>
