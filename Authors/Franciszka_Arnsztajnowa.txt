'''Franciszka Arnsztajnowa''' ({{IPAc-pl|f|r|a|ń|'|ć|i|sz|k|a|-|a|r|n|sz|t|a|j|'|n|o|w|a}}; in full: ''Franciszka Hanna Arnsztajnowa''; 19 February 1865 – August 1942) was a Polish poet, playwright, and translator of Jewish descent.<ref name="SBML">So ''Słownik biograficzny miasta Lublina'' (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).</ref> Much of her creative ''oeuvre'' falls within the [[Young Poland]] period, stylistically encompassing the twilight of [[neo-romanticism]].  She is called "the legend of [[Lublin]]".<ref name="JSP109">Aleksander B. Skotnicki, ''et al.'', ''Jewish Society in Poland: Customs and Participation in the Fight for Independence: Many Faces of Cracovian Jewry'', tr.

==Family==
Franciszka Arnsztajnowa was the daughter of the [[Lublin]]-based novelist [[Malwina Meyerson]] (real name, Małka Meyerson, ''née'' Horowicz (Horowitz); 1839{{ndash}}1921), a Lublin native, and Bernard (Berek, or Ber) Meyerson (b. 1837), a native of [[Tykocin]], an international trader and a major Lublin financier.<ref name="SBML" /> Her brother was the French philosopher, [[Émile Meyerson]], based in Paris.  She attended high school for girls in Lublin, and went to Germany for higher studies in biology, travelling extensively in Europe.  On 7 January 1885 she married [[Marek Arnsztein]] (alternative spellings: Arnsztejn, Arnsztajn, Arnstein; 1855{{ndash}}1930), a physician educated in [[Warsaw]], Vienna, Berlin, and Paris, and a political and social activist, a native of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] based in Lublin from 1884.<ref name="JAT26III2010" /> They had a daughter, Stefanja Arnsztajnówna (''c.''1890{{ndash}}1942; married name Mieczysławska), and a son, Jan Arnsztajn (1897{{ndash}}1934), much beloved of Arnsztajnowa and whose death from [[tuberculosis]] left her devastated.

==Life and work==
As a poet Arnsztajnowa debuted at the age of 23 with the poem "Na okręcie" (On Board a Ship) published in the newspaper ''[[Kuryer Codzienny]]'' of 1 October 1888.  She issued her first collection of poetry in book form in 1895 under the title ''Poezye'', a volume which she dedicated to her mother, the novelist Malwina Meyerson.<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Poezye'', [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1895. (88 pp.)</ref> The book is divided into six distinct sections under such headings as "Sonety" (Sonnets), "Melodye" (Melodies), "Historye" (Histories), and "Z gór Tyrolu" (From the Mountains of [[South Tyrol|Tyrol]]).  The opening poem, untitled but beginning with the words "O nie płacz..." (Weep thou not...; p.&nbsp;7), sets the tone for the entire collection as she tries, with uncommon tenderness and filial piety, to soothe her mother's pain at having her own songs dispersed by the winds of time to the farthermost recesses of the soul: the implication is that the poems in this collection will become her mother's own, which the daughter will now sing for her, the lute in hand, sitting at her feet.  (In the very last poem of the collection the poet again addresses her mother directly, "O mother, why give me a heart so | Tender...")<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, [untitled poem]; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Poezye'', [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1895, p. 88.</ref> The chief characteristic of the collection, thematically speaking, was however the preoccupation and love she evinced for the people living close to the land, their ordinary lives and [[Folklore|folkloric customs]].  At the same time she delicately touched upon the social questions of the day employing language in the balladic-melancholic key.<ref name="FA115">Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p.&nbsp;115.</ref> The volume will instantly establish Arnsztajnowa as a major voice in Polish poetry among those exploring the nation's [[Folk culture|folk themes]].<ref>Cf. [[Stanisław Zdziarski]], ''Pierwiastek ludowy w poezji polskiej XIX wieku: studja porównawczo-literackie'', [[Warsaw]], E. Wende, 1901.</ref>

Her next collection appeared in 1899 under the title ''Poezye: serya druga'' ("Verses: Second Series"; 2nd ed., 1911).<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Poezye: serya druga'', [[Kraków]], G. Gebethner i Spółka, 1899.</ref> The latter volume contains the poem "Z nocy bezsennych" (Out of the Sleepless Nights) dedicated to her husband, Marek Arnsztein, as well as the memorable "Wspomnienie Meranu" (A&nbsp;Remembrance of [[Merano]]) that evokes her travels in the [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] region of Italy, and which begins:
<blockquote><poem>
''Meran… pamiętam… nieraz dziś w zimy rozgwarze,''
''Mroźnem tchnieniem owiana, nagle zamknę oczy,''
''I o błogosławionej dolinie zamarzę.''<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, “Wspomnienie Meranu” (A&nbsp;Remembrance of [[Merano]]; lines 1{{ndash}}3); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Poezye: serya druga'', 2nd ed., [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1911, p. 90.</ref>
__________________________________

Meran… I recall… as nowadays oft by winter's clamorous decree
Frosty gusts me shroud, I soon close my eyes asudden
And slip down the blessed valley into reverie.
</poem></blockquote>

[[Wacław Gralewski]] (1900{{ndash}}1972), a poet and prominent Lublin ''[[littérateur]]'', cites a report (which he qualifies as uncorroborated) that Arnsztajnowa was supposed to undergo a (successful) therapy for [[tuberculosis]] at Merano, an option open only to the very rich.<ref>[[Wacław Gralewski]], ''Stalowa tęcza: wspomnienia o [[Józef Czechowicz|Józefie Czechowiczu]]'', [[Warsaw]], Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1968, p. 60.</ref>

Arnsztajnowa, "O Dniu Jutrzejszy" (O, Thou Day of the Morrow!); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Archanioł jutra'', [[Lublin]], Spółdzielnia Wydawawnicza Placówka Lubelska, 1924, p.&nbsp;13.

During the [[First World War]] Arnsztajnowa (''[[nom de guerre]]'' Ara) participated in armed struggle for the independence of Poland as a member of the secret [[Polish Military Organisation]] in Lublin (her town house in the Old Town of Lublin served as a secret archive of the [[Polish Military Organisation|POW]] and a hub for other organizations, such as the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] and the [[Scouting and Guiding in Poland|clandestine Polish boy scout movement]]; the expansive basement served as an arsenal).  Some of the patriotic feelings and motivations that actuated her participation in the freedom struggle will later find an echo in her collection of poetry entitled ''Archanioł jutra'' ("The Archangel of the Morrow"), comprising verses written during the war, which she will publish in 1924 dedicating it to the alumni of the Lublin schools who had fallen in that struggle.<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Archanioł jutra'', [[Lublin]], Spółdzielnia Wydawawnicza Placówka Lubelska, 1924. (31 pp.)</ref> With two compositions included in the volume Arnsztajnowa paid tribute to the luminaries of Polish literature, [[Maria Konopnicka|Marja Konopnicka]] and [[Bolesław Prus]], both recently deceased then.  However, it is to [[Stefan Żeromski]] (after ''his'' death in 1925) that Arnsztajnowa will in the latter part of her life acknowledge her indebtedness for the general character of her ''oeuvre'' and the direction she followed in creating it.<ref name="FA119">Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 119.</ref>

''Archanioł jutra'' contains verses of great strength and incisiveness, unparalleled in her prior work, the composition "O Dniu Jutrzejszy" (O, Thou Day of the Morrow!), written in 1914, belonging to the most beautiful among them in the opinion of the [[history of literature|historian]] of [[Polish literature|literature]], [[Feliks Araszkiewicz]].<ref name="FA117">So Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 117.</ref> The poem speaks of the brethren's (comrades-in-arms') blood shed in the struggle, whose rising vapours conceal the mystery of tomorrow (the day is [[personification|personified]] in the poem, addressed as "you", and conceived of as a day of reckoning, indeed, as a [[metonymy]] for [[retributive justice]] itself): the mystery of tomorrow will be revealed once we tear down your deadly veil to look you directly in the face, without the sort of fear that makes the victim bow his head before the executioner: for tomorrow we know full well will be the day of payback for today.  (The poem, heavily dependent on stylized linguistics and medieval vocabulary (e.g., ''gzło'', line 3, a medieval term for a kind of female garment, here used figuratively in the sense of "veil"), does not lend itself easily to verse translation but is reproduced in the original to the left.)  Thus the archangel of the title of the entire collection, ''Archanioł jutra'' (“The Archangel of the Morrow”), can easily be construed as the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|avenging angel]].

Another composition belonging to this period is the poem entitled "Powrót" (The Return) published in a literary journal in April 1916.  Comprising five ''[[ottava rima]]'' stanzas, the 40-line poem brought her the Silver Laurel of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]], a (now historical) body awarding the most prestigious literary honours of the land at the time.<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, "Powrót", ''Sprawa Polska'' ([[Lublin]]), No. 13, 18 April 1916, p. 11.</ref>

===The interwar period===
During the [[Interbellum]] Arnsztajnowa collaborated with the newspapers and [[literary magazine]]s ''[[Dziennik Lubelski]]'', ''[[Kamena (magazine)|Kamena]]'', and ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]''; she was the editor-in-chief of the literary supplement ''Dodatek Literacki'' to the newspaper ''[[Ziemia Lubelska]]''.  At the same time she was the moving spirit of the literary life of the city of Lublin, a fact recognized by outside observers,<ref>Cf. [[Jan Szczawiej]], "Życie literackie w Lubelszczyźnie", ''[[Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny|Ilustrowany Kuryer Codzienny]]'' ([[Kraków]]), vol.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;28, 28 January 1934, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> co-founding in 1932, together with the poet [[Józef Czechowicz]], the Lublin section of the writers' union, the Związek Literatów (see [[Polish Writers' Union]]), of which she served as the president.  To this period, in addition to the aforementioned collection ''Archanioł jutra'' (1924), belong also her volumes of poetry entitled ''Odloty'' ("Flying Away"; 1932),<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Odloty'', [[Lublin]], Związek Literatów w Lublinie, 1932.</ref> a compilation of verses published in [[literary magazine|literary journals]] between 1902 and 1926, and the collection produced jointly with Józef Czechowicz, ''Stare kamienie'' ("Old Stones"; 1934) which was at once a tribute to her beloved Lublin, a city in which she continued to reside until 1934, epitomized in the poem "Tobie śpiewam, Lublinie" (To You do I Sing, O Lublin!), and a form of a literary farewell.<ref>Franciszka Arnsztajnowa & [[Józef Czechowicz]], ''Stare kamienie: [poezye]'', [[Lublin]], [n.p.], 1934.</ref> Contemporary critics observed that the unspecified nature of the collaboration between the two famous poets gave the publication an anonymous tinge,<ref>K. W. Zawodziński, "Liryka" (Lyric Poetry); in ''Rocznik Literacki za rok 1934'', ed. Z. Szmydtowa, [[Warsaw]], Instytut Literacki, 1935, p. 53.</ref> and although subsequent scholarship clearly differentiated between the pieces written by Arnsztajnowa and those written by Czechowicz mistakes of attribution did occur in succeeding years and decades.<ref name="The Author 2001">[[Tadeusz Kłak]], ''Miasto poetów: poezja lubelska, 1918{{ndash}}1939'', [[Tarnów]], The Author; [[Lublin]], Wojewódzki Dom Kultury, 2001. {{ISBN|8391501825}}.</ref>

''Odloty'' represents a continuation of the [[Modernism|modernist]] esthetics that dominated the first phase of Arnsztajnowa's literary life, as evidenced in the imagery employed and in the method of shaping of the lyrical persona, as well as in the return of the [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]] [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] favoured by the [[Young Poland]] poets, such as lakes, mirrors, and shadows.  Although on occasion she adopts a new cadence closer to the spirit of the [[Skamander]] circle then gaining an ascendancy over [[Polish poetry|Polish poetics]], such diversions are rare.<ref name="The Author 2001"/> The title poem, "Odloty" (Flying Away), first printed in a literary magazine in 1905, is a mystical allegory on the inevitability of the departure, of parting despite the ties thereby shattered.<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, "Odloty", ''Ateneum'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 3, No. 9, September 1905, p. 165.</ref>

Arnsztajnowa was co-founder of the historically important [[Kraków]] periodical ''[[Życie]]'' famously associated with the artistic avant-garde and with the person of [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]], for which she wrote a programmatic poem,<ref name="FA115" /> and had close ties to the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Kamena (magazine)|Kamena]]'' (see [[:pl:Kamena (czasopismo)|''Kamena'']]), founded and edited by [[Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski|K. A. Jaworski]]: the journal began publication in 1933 with a poem by Arnsztajnowa, "Na Olejnej" (In Olejna Street), on the first page of the first issue.<ref>Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, "Na Olejnej (z cyklu ''Stare kamienie'')" (In Olejna Street {{mdash}} from the ''Stare kamienie'' Cycle), ''Kamena'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol. 1, No. 1, September 1933, p. 1. [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/dlibra/doccontent?id=24463 See online.]</ref>

Right-wing critics (such as [[Julian Babiński|Juljan Babiński]], 1900{{ndash}}1943) accused Arnsztajnowa of left-wing bias against the ''[[szlachta]]'', in favour of the common people.<ref>[[Julian Babiński|Juljan Babiński]], "Na marginesie", ''Tęcza: ilustrowany miesięcznik'' ([[Poznań]]), vol.&nbsp;11, No.&nbsp;5, May 1937, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>

====Prose====
Arnsztajnowa's innumerable writings in prose, strewn across innumerable journals and magazines, frequently published under pseudonyms that even Arnsztajnowa could not keep track of during her lifetime, present an impossible task for a compiler wishing to present a reasonably comprehensive picture of her bibliography {{mdash}} as observed by the historian of literature and her contemporary, [[#Bibliography|Feliks Araszkiewicz]] (1895{{ndash}}1966).<ref>Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 114.</ref> Among the pen-names she is known to have used are '''J.&nbsp;Górecka''', and '''Stefan Orlik'''.

====Dramatic works====
Arnsztajnowa's dramatic works remain largely confined to manuscript, including her award-winning play ''Na wyżynach (Krystyna)'' ("On the Heights: Christina") which was staged to great acclaim in [[Lviv|Lvov]] in 1899.  Her other plays which were seen on the stages of [[Kraków]] and [[Łódź]], in addition to those of Lublin and Lvov, but which remain unpublished, are (with dates of theatre production) ''Na kuracji'' ("A&nbsp;Stay at a Spa"; 1894), ''Perkun'' ("[[Perkūnas]]"; 1896), and ''W stojącej wodzie'' ("In the Stagnant Water"; 1901).  Only two one-act plays have been published (in [[literary magazine|literary journals]]), ''Widmo: Ballada w I&nbsp;akcie'' ("The Spectre: A&nbsp;[[Ballad]] in One Act"; published in ''[[Ateneum (magazine)|Ateneum]]'' in 1905, a dialogue between two characters identified only as male and female),<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, "Widmo: Ballada w I akcie", ''[[Ateneum (magazine)|Ateneum]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), Year&nbsp;III, vol.&nbsp;1, Nos.&nbsp;1{{ndash}}3, January{{ndash}}March 1905, pp.&nbsp;104{{ndash}}109.</ref> and ''Luxoniolo'' (published in the ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' in 1911).<ref>Julian Krzyżanowski, ''Neoromantyzm polski, 1890{{ndash}}1918'', 3rd ed., ed. T.&nbsp;Brzozowska-Komorowska & M.&nbsp;Bokszczanin, [[Wrocław]], Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1980, p.&nbsp;347.  {{ISBN|8304003902}}.</ref> The play ''Córka'' ("The Daughter") has never been staged or published.

====Translatorial work and other avocations====
Arnsztajnowa participated in the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]], supporting with readings from her poems the meetings and events of organizations involved in the movement, including the [[Związek Równouprawnienia Kobiet Polskich]] (Union for the Equal Rights of Polish Women) founded in 1907 by [[Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit]] (1859{{ndash}}1921).<ref>"Z życia prowincji" (From the Life of the Provinces), ''[[Głos Warszawski]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;92, 2 April 1909, p.&nbsp;2. (See also [[:pl:Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit|Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit]].)</ref> In 1912 Arnsztajnowa participated in a feminist exhibition mounted by Polish women writers in [[Prague]].<ref>''Památník výstavy práce ženy polské v Praze 1912'', comp., ed. & tr. Pavla Maternová, [[Prague]], Ústřední spolek českých žen, 1912.  Cf. Helena Rzepecka, "Zbiorowy głos doraźny" (The Collective Voice of the Moment), ''Literatura i Sztuka'' ([[Poznań]]), vol.&nbsp;4, No.&nbsp;36, 8 September 1912, pp.&nbsp;563{{ndash}}567.</ref>

Apart from her own extensive poetic ''oeuvre'', Arnsztajnowa produced several translations from English literature. Her translation of [[Douglas Jerrold]]'s famous ''[[:s:Mrs. Caudle's curtain lectures|Mrs Caudle's Curtain Lectures]]'', published in 1923 as ''Nauki małżeńskie pani Caudle'', was issued with the name of the translator concealed under a pseudonym (Stefan Orlik) as she did not wish to lend the [[Reputation|prestige]] that her name enjoyed in the domain of poetry to what she considered to be her [[avocation]]. Her translations of [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Sea Lady|The Sea Lady: A Tissue of Moonshine]]'' (published as ''Syrena: księżycowa opowieść'' in 1927), and of [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s novel ''The Painted Veil'' (published as ''Malowana zasłona'' in 1935, 2 vols.), were issued with the name of the translator fully identified. She also collaborated with [[Helena Niemirowska]] in the translation of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' (published as ''Puk'' in 1924) for which she provided verse translations.  Despite their being overshadowed by the larger translations of whole novels, [[#Bibliography|Professor Araszkiewicz]] considered Arnsztajnowa's translations of those relatively small poetic fragments {{mdash}} and not the large bodies of prose translation {{mdash}} to be among her most notable achievements in the field.<ref>Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 118.</ref> Her versions of Kipling's "Cities and Thrones and Powers" and "Harp Song of the Dane Women" (poems from ''Puck of Pook's Hill'') were published separately in [[literary magazine]]s.<ref>[[Rudyard Kipling]], "Grody i Trony w obliczu czasu..." (Cities and Thrones and Powers), tr. Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, ''Kamena'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol. 1, No. 4, December 1933, p. 68.  Rudyard Kipling, "Pieśń harfiarska duńskich niewiast" (Harp Song of the Dane Women), tr. Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, ''Kamena'', vol. 2, No. 7 (17), March 1935, p.&nbsp;134.</ref> Similarly, her 1932 translation of a 12-verse excerpt from the French of ''[[Les Stances]]'' by [[Jean Moréas|Jean&nbsp;Moréas]] (Book&nbsp;3; XII), beginning
<blockquote><poem>
''O toi qui sur mes jours de tristesse et d'épreuve''
                        ''Seule reluis encor...''
</poem></blockquote>
reads better than the original:

Includes two poems from ''Les Stances'' by Moréas in Arnsztajnowa's translation: Book 2, VII; and Book 3, XII.  The latter poem reprinted in Jean Moréas, "Ze ''Stanc'' * * *" (From ''Les Stances'' * * *), tr. Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, ''Kamena'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol. 3, No. 4 (24), December 1935, p. 73.</ref>
</poem></blockquote>

Always respectful of and ready to honour others for their achievement in their field, in 1899 Arnsztajnowa contributed to the ''[[Festschrift|liber amicorum]]'' for [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his editorial work, a sumptuously produced volume that opens with her poem "Grajek" (The Fiddler; from the ''Poezye'' of 1895).<ref>Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, "Grajek" (The Fiddler); in: ''"Prawda": książka zbiorowa dla uczczenia dwudziestopięcioletniej działalności Aleksandra Świętochowskiego, 1870{{ndash}}1895'', [[Lviv|Lvov]], Księgarnia H. Altenberga [etc.], 1899, pp. 1{{ndash}}8.</ref> Some of her tributes in verse, even when marked by a high level of artistic accomplishment, were entirely private, meant solely for the honouree.

Arnsztajnowa's patriotic fervour carried her so far as to contribute three technically accomplished, genuinely high-calibre poems {{mdash}} "Jego Imię" (His Name), "O, Wodzu!" (O Leader!), and "Wodzowi-twórcy" (To the Leader-Creator) {{mdash}} to the collection of panegyrics in honour of [[Józef Piłsudski]] published in 1924, two years before his [[May Coup (Poland)|''coup d'état'' of May 1926]].<ref>Franciszka Arnsztejnowa [''[[sic]]'', not "Arnsztajnowa"], "Jego Imię" (His Name); in ''Józef Piłsudski w poezji: antologja'', [[Lublin]], Dom Wydawniczy Franciszek Głowiński i S-ka, 1924, pp.&nbsp;3{{ndash}}4.

After the ''coup d'état'' of May 1926, during a visit to Lublin in June 1931 of Piłsudski's [[List of heads of state of Poland|figurehead president]], [[Ignacy Mościcki]], she wrote in poetic prose a fulsome welcome for him in a local newspaper ("whole streets are running out to Him with open arms while ancient city walls silvered by age reverberate with the Good News: hail Thou the visible manifestation of the Independence!", etc.).<ref>F.

====Antisemitic attacks on Arnsztajnowa====
In 1910 and 1911 Arnsztajnowa was the object of a book boycott motivated by antisemitic sentiment and spearheaded by the [[Endecja]] circles.<ref name="HMO">[[Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]] (see [[:pl:Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa|Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]]), "Na pięterku" (Up the Little Flight of Stairs), ''[[Kamena (magazine)|Kamena]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol. 27, No. 18 (208), 30 September 1960, pp.&nbsp;1&nbsp;&&nbsp;4.  As a first-hand testimonial, this is one of the major primary sources for the biography of Arnsztajnowa.</ref>

In the summer of 1937 Arnsztajnowa, then a 72-year-old ''[[grande dame]]'' of [[Polish literature]] (a recipient of the Silver Laurel of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] and a decorated veteran of the Polish war of independence), was the victim of [[antisemitic]] attacks from the Endecja literary circles connected with the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Prosto z mostu]]'' of [[Warsaw]], a publication billing itself in the masthead as an artistic-literary weekly, edited and published by [[Stanisław Piasecki]] (1900{{ndash}}1941).  In its edition of 25 July 1937 the magazine in question carried a quasi-anonymous racist and in parts [[Vulgarism|scurrilously]] [[Poetaster|versified]] polemic signed only "(st. p.)" (which would have been universally understood by readers to refer to Piasecki) in which Arnsztajnowa was called, sarcastically, the "erector of the edifice of the [[Polish language]]" (''[[sc.]]'', one of the primary forces shaping the mother tongue) without being Polish.  Although other Polish writers of Jewish descent were held up to ridicule by name as well, Arnsztajnowa was selected for special treatment. "Consider this efflorescence of Polish speech from under the ''aegis'' of Arnsztajnowa", jeered the writer of the article, presenting his readers with a sentence taken out of context from one of Arnsztajnowa's articles (on the complex subject of the phenomenology of contemporary French culture), which was supposed to offend against linguistic norm (it had, in fact, a [[typographical error]] involving the omission of a single letter).  The attack on Arnsztajnowa continued under the guise of an attack on [[Ludwik Fryde]] (1912{{ndash}}1942), despite his young age already a distinguished literary critic of Jewish descent, whose surname was altered to "frydek" so that it might rhyme with ''żydek'' ("the little jew", the lower-case initials employed for their added insulting value) while the author went on: "so it is among us that every common-or-garden pederast, if he has talent, he bandies it about", etc.<ref>(st. p.) [''[[sic]]'': lower-case initials in parentheses], "Wycinanki" (Newspaper Cuttings), ''[[Prosto z mostu]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Prosto z Mostu|Prosto z mostu]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 3, No. 34 (142), 25 July 1937, p.&nbsp;5.  The title of the periodical, ''Prosto z mostu'', is a Polish [[idiomatic]] expression meaning "without beating about the bush", "straightforwardly", "point-blank".</ref> The incident generated a groundswell of support for her from the Polish [[reading public]], including an open letter signed by many writers and poets,<ref name="HMO" /> some of whom also published individual expressions of support {{mdash}} as did, for example, [[Józef Łobodowski]], calling the attack "outrageous and revolting".<ref>[[Józef Łobodowski]], "W obronie zasługi" (In Defence of Merit), letter to the editor, ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 14, No. 32 (718), 1 August 1937, p.&nbsp;8.</ref>

After Łobodowski's protest published in the most prestigious literary journal of the [[Interbellum|interbellum epoch]], the ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'', Piasecki remained unrepentant, and a fresh antisemitic attack on Arnsztajnowa was printed with additional vitriol in the ''Prosto z mostu'' edition of 8 August 1937.<ref>st. p.) [''[[sic]]'': lower-case initials in parentheses, with the left parenthesis missing], "Wycinanki" (Newspaper Cuttings), ''[[Prosto z mostu]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Prosto z Mostu|Prosto z mostu]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;3, No.&nbsp;37 (145), 8 August 1937, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> The [[antisemitic]] and [[homophobic]] attack on Arnsztajnowa and others was originally authored by [[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]] and published in the ultra-nationalist and antisemitic periodical ''[[Myśl Narodowa]]'' ("National Thought"), but ''Prosto z mostu'' went beyond the text of the original racist [[pasquinade]] in its attempt to disseminate, defend and justify it.<ref>[[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]], "W rozmównicy" (In the Chat Room), ''[[Myśl Narodowa]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 17, No.&nbsp;29, 18 July 1937, p.&nbsp;458. [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/publication?id=144548 (See online.)]</ref> For its part ''Myśl Narodowa'' will continue its attack on Arnsztajnowa on other fronts, bemoaning (in its issue of 29 August 1937) "the pernicious Jewish dispensation (''gospodarka żydów'') in the field of literature" for which the evidence was to be the supposed falsification by Niemirowska and Arnsztajnowa of Kipling (through their alleged toning down or expurgation of antisemitic passages in the works of this author).<ref>T. R. [''[[sic]]'': anonymous article], "Nauka i literatura: ''Rocznik Literacki''" (Sciences and Literature: ''The Literary Annual''), ''[[Myśl Narodowa]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;17, No.&nbsp;35, 29 August 1937, p.&nbsp;552.

===Death===
Published sources differ on the circumstances of her death, but there is a consensus that she did not die in Lublin, all the sources citing the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] {{mdash}} a place where she had gone proudly ''and of her own accord'', "to be with everybody"<ref name="JSP109" /> {{mdash}} as either the place of her death or the place of her [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportation]] immediately before her death. In some accounts she would have died in the Warsaw Ghetto of an infectious disease ([[typhus]]);<ref>So, for example, [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]], ''Marginalia'', ed. M. Iwaszkiewicz, ''et al. '', [[Warsaw]], Interim, 1993, p. 11.  {{ISBN|8385083286}}.</ref> according to other accounts she would have been violently murdered there by the [[Nazis]], or have taken poison out of despair after seeing her daughter, Stefanja (who in all accounts accompanied her in the Warsaw Ghetto), shot dead by the Nazis. In some sources she would have been murdered after having been deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] (the most common narrative, but not invested with greater evidentiary credibility than the other versions).<ref>So, for example, [[Julian Krzyżanowski]], ''Neoromantyzm polski: 1890{{ndash}}1918'', [[Wrocław]], Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1963, p. 343.  Cf.

(Mortkowicz-Olczakowa does not cite the date of Arnsztajnowa's death; she does state that Arnsztajnowa's daughter, Stefanja Mieczysławska, unlike her mother, died in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] of disease.)

Arnsztajnowa's first book, ''Poezye'' (1895), published when she was 30, contains this reference to [[Dante Alighieri]]:
<blockquote><poem>
''I ja byłem w piekle… we śnie, czy na jawie''
''Niewiem… lecz, zaprawdę, Danta piekieł kręgi''
''Mąk takich nie mieszczą, nie szarpią tak krwawie…''<ref>F. Arnsztajnowa, [untitled poem] (lines 1{{ndash}}3); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Poezye'', [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1895, p. 85.  Arnsztajnowa employs the [[I (pronoun)|authorial "I"]] in the masculine form ("ja byłem", not "ja byłam").</ref>
___________________________

To hell I've also been… in dream or waking hours
Can't say… but, forsooth, Dante's [[Inferno (Dante)#Nine circles of Hell|infernal circles]]
Contain not such torment as bloodily overpowers…
