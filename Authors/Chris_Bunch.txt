Dragonmaster is an action trilogy following the life and exploits of Hal Kailas, a peasant who left home at an early age. During his early years Hal must work as a casual laborer. His dream is to fly dragons, so he joins a traveling troupe who give rides on dragons as entertainment from town to town. Hal is away from his home country and his king, Asir. When war breaks out, he is drafted into the army as an unwilling soldier. However, he does his best and works his way through the ranks of the army and society with his heroic exploits. Dragons are mainly wild and untamed creatures that are brought into the war, while Hal and others devise new and more damaging ways to use the dragons against their enemies.

===Novels and series co-authored with Allan Cole===

====Sten====
Known as [[The Sten Chronicles]] (or sometimes the ''Sten Adventures''), this series of books is set in the far future of mankind. While the main attraction of the series was the action and understated humor, the series was actually a political critique. It had seemed to Bunch and Cole that entirely too many science fiction authors were enamored with monarchies and their consequent fascist (although benevolent) ideals. They wanted to write a series to show the realities of politics and power and to place a working-class man into this series, letting the reader see through his eyes and watch as he grows to be a real and realistic hero.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Bunch| first1 = Chris| last2 = Cole| first2 = Allan| title = Empire's End| series = The Sten Chronicles no. 8| year = 1993| publisher = Little, Brown, and Company| isbn = 978-1-84149-083-0| pages = 221–222 }}</ref>
