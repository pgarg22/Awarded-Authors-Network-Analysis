Lucille Fletcher of Bay Ridge High School Defeats Seven Boys at Town Hall." ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 18, 1929</ref> Fletcher placed third in the national competition May 25, 1929, judged by five justices of the [[United States Supreme Court]], with an address titled, "The Constitution: A Guarantee of the Personal Liberty of the Individual."<ref>"National Oratory Won By Kansas City Boy." ''[[The Joplin Globe]]'', May 26, 1929</ref><ref>"Missouri Boy First in Oratory Contest." ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 26, 1929</ref>

Fletcher attended [[Vassar College]], where she earned a bachelor of arts degree with honors in 1933.<ref name="Contemporary Authors"/><ref name="Sun Obit"/>

===Career===
From 1934 to 1939, Lucille Fletcher worked as a music librarian, copyright clerk and publicity writer at [[CBS]].<ref name="Contemporary Authors"/> There she met her future husband, composer [[Bernard Herrmann]], who conducted the CBS orchestra.  The couple dated for five years, but delayed marriage due to her parents' objections. They finally married on October 2, 1939.

Fletcher's first success came when one of her magazine stories, "My Client Curley", was adapted for radio by [[Norman Corwin]]. Broadcast on the ''[[Columbia Workshop]]'' March 7, 1940,<ref name="Goldin Columbia"/> it was later adapted for the 1944 [[Cary Grant]] film, ''[[Once Upon a Time (1944 film)|Once Upon a Time]]''.<ref name="Post obit">Bernstein, Adam, "Lucille Fletcher Dies; Radio Suspense Writer"; ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 4, 2000</ref>

Herrmann wrote the score for the November 17, 1941, radio debut of Fletcher's famous story, ''[[The Hitch-Hiker (radio play)|The Hitch-Hiker]]'' on ''[[The Orson Welles Show (radio series)|The Orson Welles Show]]''.

Fletcher's greatest success, ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', premiered on May 25, 1943, as an episode of the radio series ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]''.<ref name="Goldin Suspense"/> [[Agnes Moorehead]] created the role in the first performance and again in several later radio productions. It was broadcast nationwide seven times between 1943 and 1948.<ref name="NYT Obit"/> Fletcher's daughter Dorothy Herrmann told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Fletcher got the idea for ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' when she was buying food for her sick child at a local grocery on Manhattan's East Side, and a well-dressed woman with an obnoxious manner refused to allow Fletcher to go ahead of her in line. Herrmann described the drama as an "act of revenge".<ref name="NYT Obit">{{cite news |title=Lucille Fletcher, 88, Author Of 'Sorry, Wrong Number' |first=Lawrence |last=Van Gelder |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/06/arts/lucille-fletcher-88-author-of-sorry-wrong-number.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 6, 2000 |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}</ref>

[[Barbara Stanwyck]] starred in the 1948 film version of ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' and, in 1952, performed the original radio play over the airwaves. A 1959 version produced for the [[CBS]] radio series ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' received a 1960 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Radio Drama. Two operas were based on the play,<ref name="NYT Obit"/> which Orson Welles called "the greatest single radio script ever written".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OrsonWelles-MercuryTheater-1938Recordings |title=The Hitch-Hiker  |publisher=[[The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air]], June 21, 1943 (at 1:00), at the [[Internet Archive]]  |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>

Fletcher adapted the first part of the [[Emily Brontë]] novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' into a libretto for Bernard Herrmann's [[Wuthering Heights (Herrmann)|opera of the same name]], conceived in 1943. He completed the opera in June 1951, by which time they had divorced. Fletcher said the opera was "perhaps the closest to his talent and heart." The work was never produced on stage during Herrmann's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnopera.org/wp-content/uploads/transfer/1982_original_program_-_wuthering_heights.pdf |title=Wuthering Heights  |publisher=Kinkaid, Frank, [[Portland Opera]] Association, 1982 original program archived by [[Minnesota Opera]]  |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>
