'''William Browne''' (''c.'' 1590 &ndash; ''c.'' 1645) was an English [[Pastoral poetry#Pastoral poetry|pastoral]] [[poet]], born at [[Tavistock, Devon]], and educated at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]; subsequently he entered the [[Inner Temple]].

His chief works were the long poem ''Britannia's Pastorals'' (1613), and a contribution to ''[[The Shepheard's Pipe]]'' (1614). ''Britannia's Pastorals'' was never finished: in his lifetime Books I & II were published successively in 1613 and 1616. The manuscript of Book III (unfinished) was not published until 1852. The poem is concerned with the loves and woes of Celia, Marina, etc.

To him is due the epitaph for the dowager Countess of Pembroke ("Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother").<ref>Drabble, M. (1998) ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''; 5th ed., 2nd revision. Oxford U. P.; p. 138</ref>
