===Anita Blake===
Reader reaction to the series's shift in tone from [[crime noir]] thriller to focus more predominantly on the sexual themes in the series has been mixed, starting with ''[[Narcissus in Chains]]'' when the main character of [[Anita Blake]] becomes infected with the ''ardeur''. The ''ardeur'' is a supernatural power inadvertently given to Anita by her vampire Master [[Jean-Claude]] that gives her massive amounts of power but also demands that she have sexual intercourse with several different people through the course of a day, sometimes in large groups. Reception to these dynamics and to the usage of [[sexual abuse]] in later books has been mixed,<ref name="CBB">{{cite book|last=Benefiel|first=Candace|title=Reading Laurell K. Hamilton|year=2006|publisher=[[Libraries Unlimited]]|isbn=978-0-313-37835-5|pages=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ew5Ln4Qy9UYC&q=internet}}</ref> with some reviewers commenting that the character of Anita spent too much time "obsessing about whether or not she’s a slut" while others remarked that the erotic themes enhanced the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Amazeen |first=Sandy |title=Book Review: Danse Macabre by Laurell K.

Critical reviewers have also commented on the amount of sex in later books, as in a 2006 review in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' of ''[[Micah (novel)|Micah]]''. The review was largely negative, stating "we were not impressed. Hamilton no doubt appeals to romance and erotica lovers, but it does not take long for the clichés and the constant droning about sex to become tiresome."<ref name="BostonGlobe">{{cite news | first = Rochelle  | last = O'Gorman  | title = Beware the Ringing Cell  | work = [[The Boston Globe]]  | issn = 0743-1791   | page = C7  | date = 2006-03-26}}</ref> Other reviewers for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' also commented on the rise in sexual themes in the series.<ref name="KansasStar">{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Folsom | title='Danse Macabre' by Laurell K. Hamilton; 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch | work=[[The Kansas City Star]] | date=2006-07-17}}</ref> The reviewer for the ''Kansas City Star'' stated that "After 13 erotically charged books, boredom has reared its ugly head for the 14th novel in Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, as eroticism becomes mere description..." and ''Publishers Weekly'' commented that ''[[Blood Noir (novel)|Blood Noir]]'' had a "growing air of ennui, which longtime readers can't help sharing as sex increasingly takes the place of plot and character development".<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6552500.html "''Publishers Weekly'' Fiction Reviews: Week of 2008-04-21"] 2008 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. Accessed August 26, 2008</ref>

In contrast, a ''[[Denver Post]]'' review of ''Danse Macabre'' took a more positive view of the eroticism in Hamilton's work.  Although it noted that "[t]hose looking for mystery and mayhem on this Anita adventure are out of luck" it also stated that "the main attraction of the Anita Blake novels in the past five years has been their erotic novelty", and "[f]ew, if any, mainstream novels delve so deeply into pure, unadulterated erotica".<ref name="DenverPost">{{cite news|first= Dorman T|last=Shindler|title=7th Anita Blake novel builds on erotic aura|work=[[The Denver Post]]|issn=1930-2193|page=F13|date=2006-08-20}}</ref>
