'''Nicholas Stuart Gray''' (23 October 1922, Scotland – 17 March 1981) was a [[Great Britain|British]] actor and playwright, perhaps best known for his work in children's theatre in [[England]].  He was also an author of children's [[fantasy]]; he wrote a number of novels, a dozen plays, and many short stories. [[Neil Gaiman]] has written that Gray "is one of those authors I loved as a boy who holds up even better on rereading as an adult".<ref>[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2005/11/includes-special-guest-review.html Includes special guest review], Neil Gaiman, 26 November 2005, NeilGaiman.com</ref> Many other modern fantasy authors, such as [[Hilari Bell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/cr-102062/hilari-bell|title=Hilari Bell|first=World|last=Archipelago|website=Harpercollins.com|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> [[Cecilia Dart-Thornton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurefiction.com/author_spotlight.htm|title=Author Spotlight|website=Futurefiction.com|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> [[Kate Forsyth]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kateforsyth.com.au/_blog/Kate's_Blog/post/Books_I've_been_reading_in_2011_/|title=Books I've been reading in 2011|website=Kateforsyth.com.au|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> [[Cassandra Golds]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wheelercentre.com/projects/victorian-premier-s-literary-awards-2011/book/the-three-loves-of-persimmon/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006080912/http://wheelercentre.com/projects/victorian-premier-s-literary-awards-2011/book/the-three-loves-of-persimmon/ |archivedate=6 October 2012 }}</ref>  [[Sophie Masson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.boomerangbooks.com.au/five-very-bookish-questions-with-author-sophie-masson/2012/08|title=Five Very Bookish Questions with author Sophie Masson - Boomerang Books Blog - Boomerang Books Blog|first=Boomerang|last=Books|website=Blog.boomerangbook.com.au|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> and [[Garth Nix]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garthnix.co.uk/index.tao?PageId=sabriel|title=Garthnix - Interview 1: Sabriel|website=Garthnix.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> cite Gray's work as something they enjoyed as children.

Perhaps his best-known books are ''The Seventh Swan'' and ''Grimbold's Other World.'' Gray often produced adaptations or continuations of traditional [[fairy tale]]s and fantasy works, as in his ''Further Adventures of Puss in Boots.'' His ''The Stone Cage'' is a re-telling of ''[[Rapunzel]]'' from a cat's point of view.   ''Over the Hills to Fabylon'' is about a city whose king has the ability to make it fly off across the mountains if he feels it is in danger.

Gray maintained a long-term collaborative relationship with set designer and illustrator [[Joan Jefferson Farjeon]] (niece <ref>Joan Jefferson Farjeon papers, 1860-1992: Houghton Library, Harvard College Library</ref> of [[Eleanor Farjeon]] and [[Harry Farjeon]]); she supplied the costume and scenic designs for many of the theatrical productions of his plays, as well as the illustrations for most of his printed plays and for the novel version of ''The Seventh Swan''.
