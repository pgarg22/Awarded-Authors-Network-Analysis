'''Faik bey Konica''' (later named ''Faïk Dominik Konitza'', 15 March 1875 – 15 December 1942) was an important figure in Albanian language and culture in the early decades of the twentieth century. Prewar Albanian minister to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], his literary review ''[[Albania (periodical)|Albania]]'' became the focal publication of Albanian writers living abroad. Faik Konica wrote little in the way of literature, but as a [[Literary stylist|stylist]], critic, publicist and [[political figure]] he had a tremendous impact on Albanian writing and on [[Albanian culture]] at the time.<ref name="Skendi125126347"/>

== Biography ==
Faik was born on 15 March 1875 as a son of Shahin and Lalia Zenelbej in the town of [[Konitsa|Koniçe]] (modern Konitsa),<ref name="Mann99">{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Stuard Edward|title=Albanian literature: an outline of prose, poetry, and drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY-AAAAAIAAJ&q=FAIK+KONITSA+%28%22+TRANK+SPIRO+BEG+%22%29+%281875-1943%29+was+born+at+Konitsa,+an+Albanian-speaking+town+in+Epirus.|year=1955|page=99}}</ref> [[Janina Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]], now in northern [[Greece]], not far from the present Albanian border. He had three brothers: [[Mehmed Konica|Mehmed]], Rustem and Hilmi. After elementary schooling in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in his native town, he studied at the [[Xaverian Brothers|Xavierian]] [[Shkodër Jesuit College]] in [[Shkodra]] which offered him not only some instruction in Albania but also an initial contact with central [[European culture]] and [[Western culture|Western]] ideas. From there, he continued his schooling at the eminent French-language Imperial [[Galatasaray High School]] in [[Istanbul]]. During his youth, Konica cultivated his skills in Albanian and amassed a small library of books by foreign [[Albanology|Albanologists]].<ref name="Skendi125126347"/>

In 1890, at the age of fifteen, he was sent to study in France where he spent the next seven years. After initial education at secondary schools in [[Lisieux]] (1890) and [[Carcassonne]] (1892), he registered at the [[University of Dijon]], from which he graduated in 1895 in [[Romance languages]] and [[philology]]. After graduation, he moved to Paris for two years where he studied [[Medieval French literature]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] at the famous [[Collège de France]]. He finished his studies at the prestigious [[Harvard University]] in the United States, although little is known of this period of his life. As a result of his highly varied educational background, he was able to speak and write [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Italian, French, German, English and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] fluently. In 1895, Konica [[Religious conversion|converted]] from [[Islam]] to [[Roman Catholicism]], and changed his name from Faik to Dominik, signing for many years as Faik Dominik Konica.<ref>[http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/news/id_14303/Thanas-L-Gjika:-Faik-Konica-hapi-epok%C3%ABn-e-rikrishterizimit-t%C3%AB-shqiptar%C3%ABve.html Thanas L.

Konica strove for a more refined [[Western culture]] in Albania, but he also valued his country's traditions. He was, for instance, one of the first to propagate the idea of editing the texts of older [[Albanian literature]]. In an article entitled "''Për themelimin e një gjuhës letrarishte shqip''", (On the foundation of an Albanian literary language), published in the first issue of ''[[Albania (periodical)|Albania]]'', Konica also pointed to the necessity of creating a unified [[literary language]]. He suggested the most obvious solution, that the two main [[dialects]], [[Tosk]] and [[Gheg]], should be fused and blended gradually. His own fluid style was highly influential in the [[Refinement (culture)|refinement]] of southern Albanian Tosk [[prose]] writing, which decades later was to form the basis of the modern Albanian literary language ([[standard language]]).

{{Further|Albania (periodical)}}

While in Brussels, in 1896–7 Konica started the publication of the periodical [[Albania (periodical)|Albania]], with publication ending in 1909, after he departed for the USA.<ref name="Skendi125126347"/> It was printed both in [[Brussels]] and Paris. The magazine was one of the most important [[rilindas]] magazines of that time.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Albanian publications were published abroad as the Ottoman Empire forbid the writing of Albanian and like other Albanian writers of the time Konica used a pseudonym Trank Spiro Bey, named after a Catholic Ottoman figure Trank Spiro, to bypass those conditions for his works.<ref name="Skendi128">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=128.}}</ref> In 1903–1904, Faik Konica was a resident at Oakley Crescent in [[Islington]], London.  There he continued to edit and publish, under the pseudonym Trank Spiro Beg, the dual language (French/Albanian) periodical ''Albania'' that he had founded in [[Brussels]] in 1897. He contributed bitingly sarcastic articles on what he saw as the cultural backwardness and naivety of his compatriots, stressed the need for economic development and national unity among Muslim and Christian Albanians and opposed armed struggle.<ref name="Skendi180182397">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=180–182, 397.}}</ref><ref name="Gawrych146"/> Support for a better Ottoman administration was advocated for by Konica through reforms in Albania.<ref name="Gawrych146">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=146.}}</ref> Konica's mastery of complexity and fine details of Albanian and its dialects was reflected in his writing style being refined and rich in expression.<ref name="Skendi125126347"/> He also endeavored to enrich Albanian vocabulary through words of the people and folklore raising the ability of Albanian to treat complex and difficult topics, unparalleled among other Albanian-language publications of the time.<ref name="Skendi125126347"/> ''Albania'' contributed to the development of national sentiment among Albanians through focusing on topics such as folklore, poetry, Albanian history and the medieval figure of [[Skanderbeg]].<ref name="Skendi125126347"/>

''Albania'' helped to spread [[awareness]] of Albanian culture and the Albanian [[cause]] across Europe, and was highly influential in the development and refinement of Southern Albanian prose writing. In the words of the famous French poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], "Konica turned a rough idiom of sailors inns into a beautiful, rich and supple language". Konica also published the works of Albanian writers of the time like [[Aleksandër Stavre Drenova]], [[Andon Zako Çajupi]], [[Filip Shiroka]], [[Gjergj Fishta]], [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], [[Thimi Mitko]] and so on.<ref name="Skendi125126347"/> [[Theodor Anton Ippen]], a diplomat of [[Austria-Hungary]], was one of the authors whose texts were published in the Konica's periodical.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.konitza.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8&Itemid=11 | title=Qui était Faik Konica? | work=konitza.eu | access-date=1 January 2013 | year=2009 | quote=Les collaborateurs et le contenu de la revue "Albania".

Whilst in Brussels, Konica had a [[communication|correspondence]] with Apollinaire regarding an article published by the poet in ''L'Europen''. When Apollinaire came to London seeking to regain the affections of Annie Playden, an English [[governess]] he had met and fallen in love with in Germany, he stayed with Konica at Oakley Crescent.

Apollinaire published a memoir of Konica in the ''Mercure de France'' on 1 May 1912, which begins: "Of the people I have met and whom I remember with the greatest pleasure, Faik Bey Konica is one of the most unusual". He recalls: {{quote|We would have lunch the Albanian way, which is to say, endlessly. The lunches were so long that I could not visit a single museum in London, as we would always arrive when the doors closed, and the attention and care with which Konica edited his articles meant that the journal always came out very late. In 1904, only the issues for 1902 appeared; in 1907, the issues for 1904 came out at regular intervals. The French journal ''L'Occident'' is the only one that could compete with ''Albania'' in that respect.}}

== Political activities and death ==
Konica organized the [[Albanian Congress of Trieste]], held 27 February – 6 March 1913.<ref>{{cite web| url        =http://www.albanianlanguage.net/en/noli.html| title        =Albanian Voices, 1962 – Fan Noli| first        =Robert| last        =Elsie| author-link        =Robert Elsie| publisher        =Robert Elsie's personal website| archive-url        =https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albanianlanguage.net%2Fen%2Fnoli.html&date=2011-01-21| archive-date        =21 January 2011| access-date        =21 January 2011| quote        =Congress of Trieste which was organized by his friend and rival Faik bey Konitza| url-status        =dead| df        =mdy-all}}</ref> 
[[File:Faik Konica 1997 Albania stamp.jpg|thumb|160px|Konica depicted on an Albanian postal stamp]]
Konica went to [[Boston, US]] in autumn of 1909 where he took over as chief-editor of ''[[Dielli]]'' newspaper,<ref name="Skendi125126347">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=125–126, 347.}}</ref> published by [[Besa-Besën]] society, a political-cultural organization of Albanian-American diaspora. With the creation of [[Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America]], his role inside the Albanian community of US grew and he became general-secretary of Vatra.<ref name="Skendi453">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=453.}}</ref> Konica was a close collaborator of [[Fan Noli]] and one of the main figures in Vatra's and ''Dielli'''s history. In 1911, he published ''Trumbeta e Krujes'' (Kruja's trumpet), a very short lived newspaper in [[St. Louis, MO]]. On 17 November 1912, Vatra held a mass gathering in Boston and Konica was the main speaker rallying the Albanian diaspora in the US to oppose any partition of Albania, due to the [[Balkan Wars]].<ref name="Skendi458">{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&q=Faik+Konitza&pg=PR15|isbn=9781400847761|pages=458}}</ref>

He got disappointed with the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian authorities]] and [[Ismail Qemali]] personally, after Qemali's approval for the creation of an Austro-Italian bank (though named Bank of Albania - {{lang-sq|Banka e Shqiperise}}), which was feared amongst Albanians as having been created for massive purchasing of land properties and controlling the future economy of Albania.<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9QqAAAAYAAJ&q=konica&pg=PA59|title=Kalendari i Vatrës i motit 1918|author=Fan Noli, Kostandin Chekrezi|year=1918|location=Boston|publisher=Vatra Press|page=29}}</ref> Konica was one of the main organizers of the [[Albanian Congress of Trieste]] in 1913.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.albanianlanguage.net/en/noli.html| title = Albanian Voices, 1962 – Fan Noli| first = Robert| last = Elsie| author-link = Robert Elsie| publisher = Robert Elsie's personal website| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albanianlanguage.net%2Fen%2Fnoli.html&date=2011-01-21| archive-date = 21 January 2011| access-date = 21 January 2011| quote = Congress of Trieste which was organized by his friend and rival Faik bey Konitza| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> On 20 November 1913 he went in conflict with Essad Pasha and left [[Durres]] together with his collaborator Fazil Pasha Toptani.<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9QqAAAAYAAJ&q=konica&pg=PA59|title=Kalendari i Vatrës i motit 1918|author=Fan Noli, Kostandin Chekrezi|year=1918|location=Boston|publisher=Vatra Press|page=30}}</ref>

In 1921, he went back to the US where he became president of Vatra, and a columnist in ''Dielli''. In 1929, [[Ahmet Zogu]] – newly proclaimed King Zog I of Albania would appoint him as Albanian Ambassador to the United States despite his very low opinion on Zogu.<ref>{{citation|title=Faik Konica – Vepra|editor=Nasho Jorgaqi, Xhevat Lloshi|location = Tirana|year=1993|publisher=Shtepia Botuese "Naim Frasheri"|page=506|edition=1|oclc= 	49987449|quote=...tell your King that as right as my critics are towards his regime, I will restrict them inside the Albanian circles, meanwhile outside of them I will defend the regime with all I can.

He died in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on 15 December 1942 and was buried in [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in [[Boston]].
