'''Adam de la Halle''' (1245–50 – 1285–8/after 1306), also known as '''Adam le Bossu''' ('''Adam the Hunchback'''),<ref name=Falck/> was a French [[trouvère]], poet and musician. Adam's literary and musical works include [[chanson]]s and [[jeux-partis]] (poetic debates) in the style of the trouvères; [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[rondel (poem)|rondel]] and [[motet]]s in the style of early liturgical polyphony; and a musical play, ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion]]'' ({{circa|1282–83}}), which is considered the earliest surviving [[secular]] French play with music. He was a member of the [[Confrérie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras]].

==Biography==
A, "le Bossu d'Arras" and "Adam d'Arras", suggest that he came from [[Arras|Arras, France]]. The sobriquet "the [[Kyphosis|Hunchback]]" was probably a family name; Adam himself points out that he was not one.<ref name=Falck>Robert Falck, "Adam de la Halle", s.v., ''Grove Music Online'' [http://www.grovemusic.com] (subscription access), visited 25 March 2007.</ref> His father, Henri de la Halle, was a well-known Citizen of Arras, and Adam studied [[grammar]], [[theology]], and music at the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[abbey]] of Vaucelles, near [[Cambrai]]. Father and son had their share in the civil discords in Arras, and for a short
time had been destined for the church, but renounced this intention, and married a certain Marie, who features in many of his songs, ''[[Rondeau (poetry)|rondeaux]]'', [[motet]]s and ''[[Jeu parti|jeux-partis]]''. Afterwards he joined the household of [[Robert II of Artois|Robert II, Count of Artois]]; and then was attached to [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]], brother of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whose fortunes he followed in Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Italy.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Adam (or Adan) de le Hale|volume=1|page=171}}</ref>

At the court of Charles, after Charles became king of [[Naples]], Adam wrote his ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion]]'', the most famous of his works. Adam's shorter pieces are accompanied by music, of which a transcript in modern notation, with the original score, is given in [[Edmond de Coussemaker|Coussemaker's]] edition. His ''Jeu de Robin et Marion'' is cited as the earliest French play with music on a secular subject. The [[pastoral]], which tells how Marion resisted the knight, and remained faithful to Robert the shepherd, is based on an old chanson, ''Robin m'aime, Robin m'a''. It consists of dialogue varied by refrains already current in popular song. The melodies to which these are set have the character of [[folk music]], and are more spontaneous and melodious than the more elaborate music of his songs and motets. [[François-Joseph Fétis|Fétis]] considered ''Le Jeu de Robin et Marion'' and ''Le Jeu de la feuillée'' forerunners of the [[comic opera]].<ref>François-Joseph Fétis, ''Revue Musicale'' 1.1, 1827.<!--More complete cite needed--></ref> An adaptation of ''Le Jeu Robin et Marion'', by [[Julien Tiersot]], was played at Arras by a company from the Paris [[Opéra-Comique]] on the occasion of a festival in 1896 in honour of Adam de le Hale.<ref name="EB1911"/>

His other play, ''Le jeu Adan'' or ''Le jeu de la Feuillee'' (ca. 1262), is a [[satire|satirical]] drama in which he introduces himself, his father and the citizens of Arras with their peculiarities. His works include a ''congé'', or satirical farewell to the city of Arras, and an unfinished ''[[chanson de geste]]'' in honour of Charles of Anjou, ''Le roi de Secile'', begun in 1282; another short piece, ''Le jeu du pelerin'', is sometimes attributed to him.<ref name="EB1911"/>

His known works include thirty-six chansons (literally, "songs"), forty-six ''rondets de carole'', eighteen ''jeux-partis'', fourteen ''[[Rondeau (poetry)|rondeaux]]'', five [[motet]]s, one ''[[Virelai|rondeau-virelai]]'', one ''ballette'', one ''dit d'amour'', and one ''congé''.
