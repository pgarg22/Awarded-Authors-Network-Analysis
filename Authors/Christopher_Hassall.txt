'''Christopher Vernon Hassall''' (24 March 1912&nbsp;– 25 April 1963) was an English [[actor]], [[dramatist]], [[librettist]], [[lyricist]] and [[poet]], who found his greatest fame in a memorable musical partnership with the actor and composer [[Ivor Novello]] after working together in the same touring company. He was also a noted biographer of [[Rupert Brooke]] (1964, [[Faber and Faber]]) and [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] (1958, [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] 1959).

==Biography==
Hassall was born in [[London]] and educated at [[St. Michael's College, Tenbury|St Michael's College, Tenbury]], [[Brighton College]] and [[Wadham College, Oxford]].  He was the son of the illustrator [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]] and brother of [[Joan Hassall]], who engraved the title page of his book of poetry, ''Devil's Dyke'', published in 1936. Hassall married the actress Eve Lynett, with whom he had a son and a daughter, the actress [[Imogen Hassall]].

Hassall was an experienced actor serving as [[Ivor Novello]]'s understudy in a minor London drama when Novello invited him to provide the lyrics for a new musical. Their successful collaboration for ''[[Glamorous Night]]'' (1935) ("Shine Through My Dreams", "Fold Your Wings") began a fifteen-year partnership that included six long-running hits. ('Perchance to Dream' the other hit which Novello wrote during this period, had lyrics by Novello himself).  While their musicals delighted West End audiences, they were judged "too British" for America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/artists/ivor-novello|title=Ivor Novello Archives |website=NME|accessdate=16 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicals101.com/who22.htm|title=Who's Who in Musicals: Additional Bios XII|website=Musicals101.com|accessdate=16 July 2020}}</ref> [[Jeremy Northam]], who played a character based on Ivor Novello in the 2001 [[Robert Altman]] movie, ''[[Gosford Park]]'', sang "I Can Give You the Starlight" from ''The Dancing Years'', Hassall's and Novello's 1939 musical.

During World War II in 1940, Hassall served in an anti-aircraft gun emplacement with editor John Guest, architect [[Denys Lasdun]], and socialite Angus Menzies.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970827/ai_n14119601/] {{dead link|date=July 2020}}</ref> A man of many talents, he recorded a record album entitled ''Great Voices Read Poetry'' (1954-1955) along with [[Richard Burton]], Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Robert Hardy]], and [[Anthony Quayle]]. Hassall's contributions included: Upon Westminster Bridge, Daffodils, and Ode: Intimations of Immortality by [[William Wordsworth]]; and Death Be Not Proud by [[John Donne]].

Hassall lived at Tonford Manor, a house with a mediaeval stone tower situated by the River Stour on the outskirts of [[Canterbury]]. He delighted in its fine prospect<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thanington-pc.gov.uk/history/history1.html|title=Thanington Without (Civil) Parish Council - Working for Thanington|website=Thanington-pc.gov.uk|accessdate=16 July 2020}}</ref> and had a road named after him in the community. At St Nicholas's Church in nearby [[Thanington Without|Thanington]] is a small pane of glass engraved in his memory. Shortly before his death in 1963, Hassall spoke about the first Stour Music Festival, saying:
<blockquote>The shared experience … a communion between listener and performer … impossible in a great assembly … (which) means the restoration of a large body of music to the private salon or to the church where it originally belonged. With the appropriate setting and a perceptive audience of proportionate size, the work will not only sound, but feel right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stourmusic.org.uk/history.html|title=History – Stour Music|website=Stourmusic.org.uk|accessdate=16 July 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

Hassall died on a train at [[Rochester, Kent]], on 25 April<ref>[[John Wakeman]], [[Stanley Kunitz]], ''World Authors, 1950-1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth Century Authors'' Wilson (publisher), 1975, page 619</ref> 1963 after suffering a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] whilst running for the train to see his daughter [[Imogen Hassall|Imogen]] appear in a [[Royal Ballet School]] performance at [[Covent Garden Theatre|Covent Garden]].
