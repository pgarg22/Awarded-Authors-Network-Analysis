'''Henry Meyer''' (1840–1925) was a poet originally from
[[Penns Valley#Mountains|Brush Valley]], ([[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]]), [[Pennsylvania]].  His native language was [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania Dutch]], and although he learned English in school, he wrote his poetry in "Dutch".

His original career was as a [[wheelwright]], but he lost an arm near [[Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia|Spottsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]].  (He was a corporal in the Centre County Regiment, the [[148th Pennsylvania Infantry]].)  In the war he began the diary he would keep the rest of his life, and after the war spent time as a teacher, county superintendent, state representative and justice of the peace during the 58 years he spent in [[Rebersburg, Pennsylvania|Rebersburg]].  He was a teacher of the poet [[Calvin Ziegler]] and was active in community organizations.  While his collected poems have apparently yet to be published, at least one ("''For Was Er So Freundlich Is''") was published in ''[[The Millheim Journal]]'' of 14 August 1907.
