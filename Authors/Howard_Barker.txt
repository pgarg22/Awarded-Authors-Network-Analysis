==The Theatre of Catastrophe==
Barker has coined the term "Theatre of Catastrophe" to describe his work.<ref>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Howard | author-link = Howard Barker | title = Arguments for a Theatre | publisher = Manchester University Press | date = 15 November 1997 | location = Manchester, UK | isbn = 978-0-7190-5249-1 }}</ref> His plays often explore [[violence]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the desire for [[Power (philosophy)|power]], and human [[motivation]].

Rejecting the widespread notion that an audience should share a single response to the events onstage, Barker works to fragment response, forcing each viewer to wrestle with the play alone{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. "We must overcome the urge to do things in unison" he writes. "To chant together, to hum banal tunes together, is not collectivity."<ref>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Howard | author-link = Howard Barker | title = Arguments for a Theatre | publisher = Manchester University Press | date = 15 November 1997 | location = Manchester, UK | isbn = 978-0-7190-5249-1 }}</ref> Where other playwrights might clarify a scene, Barker seeks to render it more complex, ambiguous, and unstable{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

Only through a tragic renaissance, Barker argues, will beauty and poetry return to the stage. "Tragedy liberates language from banality" he asserts. "It returns poetry to speech."{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Themes==
Barker frequently turns to historical events for inspiration. His play ''[[Scenes from an Execution]]'', for example, centers on the aftermath of the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] and a fictional female artist commissioned to create a commemorative painting of the [[Venice|Venetian]] victory over the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet. ''Scenes from an Execution'', originally written for [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and starring [[Glenda Jackson]] in 1984, was later adapted for the stage. The short play ''Judith'' revolves around the Biblical story of [[Book of Judith|Judith]], the legendary heroine who [[decapitate]]d the invading general [[Holofernes]].

In other plays, Barker has fashioned responses to famous literary works. ''Brutopia'' is a challenge to [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''. ''Minna'' is a sardonic work inspired by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] comedy, ''Minna von Barnhelm''. In ''Uncle Vanya'', he poses an alternative vision to [[Anton Chekhov]]'s [[Uncle Vanya|drama of the same name]]. For Barker, Chekhov is a playwright of [[bad faith]], a writer who encourages us to sentimentalize our own weaknesses and glamorize inertia. Beneath Chekhov's celebrated compassion, Barker argues, lies contempt. In his play, Barker has Chekhov walk into Vanya's world and express his disdain for him. "Vanya, I have such a withering knowledge of your soul," says the Russian playwright. "Its pitiful dimensions. It is smaller than an aspirin that fizzles in a glass. . ."<ref>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Howard | author-link = Howard Barker | title = Collected Plays Vol. 2 : Includes Love of a Good Man, the Possibilities, Brutopia, Rome, Uncle Vanga, and Ten Dilemmas | publisher = Calder | year = 2004 | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-0-7145-4182-2 }}</ref>  But Chekhov dies, and Vanya finds the resoluteness to stride out of the confines of his creator's world.

Barker's [[protagonist]]s are conflicted, often perverse, and their motivations appear enigmatic. In ''A Hard Heart'', Riddler, described by the playwright as "A Woman of Originality"<ref>{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Howard | author-link = Howard Barker | title = A Hard Heart ; The Early Hours of a Reviled Man | publisher = Riverrun Press | year = 1992 | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-0-7145-4228-7 }}</ref>  is called upon to use her considerable brilliance in fortifications and tactics to save her besieged city. But each choice she makes seems to render the city more vulnerable to attack, but that outcome seems to exhilarate rather than upset her. "My mind was engine-like in its perfection," she exults in the midst of destruction.<{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Barker's heroes are drawn into the heart of the [[paradox]]ical, fascinated by contradiction.

The 1995 edition of the encyclopaedic ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'' describes Barker as a playwright "adept at choosing telling dramatic situations in which many different incidents can take place, but he reverses what might be regarded as the moral expectations [as well as] the expected moral order of capitalist societies. [â€¦] Barker deliberately attempts to upset expectations, denying the value of reason, continuity and naturalism, but there is a certain predictability about his wildness. His characters seem to be at emotional extremes, to speak in the same overwrought, rhetorical language."<ref name=CambridgeGuide>{{cite book |last1=Banham |first1=Martin |title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-521-43437-8 |page=78 |edition=Corrected |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Cambridge_Guide_to_Theatre/8qMTPAPFGXUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=cambridge%20guide%20to%20theatre&pg=PA78&printsec=frontcover |access-date=15 February 2021}}</ref>

==Productions==
Barker has acknowledged he has had greater success as playwright internationally than in his home country of Britain and many of his plays have been translated into other languages. He has noted that his plays have been more successful when performed abroad in [[America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]],<ref>[http://www.thewrestlingschool.co.uk/twspages/barker.html interview with Howard Barker by Nick Hobbes on ''The Wrestling School'' Website]</ref> especially [[mainland Europe]] where Barker has been celebrated as "one of the major writers of modern European theatre".

In Britain, Barker is "largely unknown" and he has been described as "cut[ing] a [[Byronic]] dash in British Theatre - sardonic, dethatched, the insider's outsider."<ref name=CambridgeGuide/> Barker's work has influenced and inspired a number of notable British playwrights, including [[Sarah Kane]], [[David Greig (dramatist)|David Grieg]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hattenstone |first1=Simon |title=A sad hurrah |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/01/stage |work=The Guardian |date=1 July 2000}}</ref> [[Lucy Kirkwood]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hemming |first1=Sarah |title=Lucy Kirkwood on going from kitchen to courthouse with 'The Welkin' |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2cccd7de-3228-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2 |access-date=11 October 2020 |work=Financial Times |date=10 January 2020}}</ref> and [[Dennis Kelly]].<ref>{{cite interview |last1=Kelly |first1=Dennis |last2=Aberg |first2=Maria |interviewer=Aleks Sierz |title=DENNIS KELLY AND MARIA ABERG: THE GODS WEEP |url=http://www.theatrevoice.com/audio/dennis-kelly-and-maria-aberg-the-gods-weep/ |work=TheatreVoice |type=Interview: Audio |date=4 March 2005 |access-date=19 March 2010}}</ref> Noted actors [[Ian McDiarmid]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewrestlingschool.co.uk/past.html|title=Past Productions}}</ref> and [[Fiona Shaw]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9590236/Scenes-from-an-Execution-National-Theatre-review.html|title = Scenes from an Execution, National Theatre, review}}</ref> have received acclaim for their performances in Barker's plays.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2006/dec/06/podcasthowardbarkertalks |title=Podcast: Howard Barker talks &#124; Stage &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 6 December 2006|access-date=21 December 2008 | location=London | first=Lindesay | last=Irvine}}</ref> 

In Britain, Howard Barker formed "The Wrestling School" Company in 1988 to produce his own work in his native country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrestlingschool.co.uk/tws.html |title=The Wrestling School |publisher=Thewrestlingschool.co.uk |access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref>

There has been a small flurry of productions of Barker's plays on the London Fringe since 2007, including some non-Wrestling school productions which seem to fare better critically. Notable among these have been Victory<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/10/victory-arcola-london-review | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Theatre,Stage,Culture section | first=Lyn | last=Gardner | date=10 March 2009 | access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref> and Scenes from An Execution<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jan/17/theatre1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Scenes from an Execution | first=Lyn | last=Gardner | date=17 January 2007 | access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref> received acclaimed productions at the Arcola and the Hackney Empire respectively. In 2012 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] staged a production of ''Scenes from an Execution'', starring [[Fiona Shaw]] and [[Tim McInnerny]].
