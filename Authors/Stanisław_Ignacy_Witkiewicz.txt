'''Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz''' ({{IPA-pl|staˈɲiswaf iɡˈnatsɨ vʲitˈkʲɛvʲitʂ|lang}}; 24 February 1885{{spaced ndash}}18 September 1939), commonly known as '''Witkacy''', was a [[Poles|Polish]] writer, painter, [[History of philosophy in Poland#Twentieth century|philosopher]], theorist, playwright, novelist, and photographer active before [[World War I]] and during the [[Polish Second Republic|interwar period]].

==Life==
Born in [[Warsaw]], Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz was a son of the painter, architect and an art critic [[Stanisław Witkiewicz]]. His mother was Maria Pietrzkiewicz Witkiewiczowa. Both of his parents were born in the [[Samogitia]]n region of [[Lithuania]]. His godmother was the internationally famous actress [[Helena Modrzejewska]].
[[File:Witkiewicz 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Little ''Witkacy'' with his father, ca. 1893]]
Witkiewicz was reared at the family home in [[Zakopane]]. In accordance with his father's [[antipathy]] to the "servitude of the school," he was [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] and encouraged to develop his talents across a range of creative fields. Against his fathers wishes he studied at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]] with [[Józef Mehoffer]] and [[Jan Stanisławski (painter)|Jan Stanisławski]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/stanislaw-ignacy-witkiewicz-witkacy|title=Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy)|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}</ref>

Witkiewicz was close friends with composer [[Karol Szymanowski]] and, from childhood, with  [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Zofia Romer]].  Romer was romantically linked to both Bronisław Malinowski and Witkiewicz.  He had a tumultuous affair with prominent actress Irena Solska<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/stanislaw-ignacy-witkiewicz-witkacy|title=Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy)|website=Culture.pl|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref> who according to Anna Micińska is represented as the heroine Akne Montecalfi in his first novel, ''The 622 Downfalls of Bungo or The Demonic Woman'', 1911. According to Micińska he also represented himself as the character Bungo and Malinowski as the Duke of Nevermore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/stanislaw-ignacy-witkiewicz-witkacy|title=Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy)|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}</ref> The unfinished novel, which was not published until 1972, also describes erotic encounters between Bungo and the Duke of Nevermore.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Witkiewicz reader|last=1885-1939.|first=Witkiewicz, Stanisław Ignacy|date=1992|publisher=Northwestern University Press|others=Gerould, Daniel C.

In 1914 following a crisis in Witkiewicz's personal life due to the suicide of his fiancée [[:pl:Jadwiga Janczewska|Jadwiga Janczewska]], for which he blamed himself, he was invited by Malinowski to act as draftsman and photographer on his anthropological expedition to the then  [[Territory of Papua]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Witkacy-Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz : life and work|last=Anna.|first=Micińska|date=1990|publisher=Interpress|isbn=832232359X|location=Warsaw|oclc=26361556}}</ref> by way of [[Ceylon]] and Australia. The venture was interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]]. After quarrelling with Malinowski in Australia, Witkiewicz who was by birth a subject of the [[Russian Empire]], travelled to [[St Petersburg]] (then Petrograd) from Sydney and was commissioned as an officer in the [[Pavlovsky Regiment]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Witkiewicz reader|last=1885-1939.|first=Witkiewicz, Stanisław Ignacy|date=1992|publisher=Northwestern University Press|others=Gerould, Daniel C. (Daniel Charles), 1928-2012.|isbn=0810109808|location=Evanston, Ill.|oclc=26014071}}</ref> His ailing father, a Polish patriot, was deeply grieved by his son's decision and died in 1915 without seeing him again.

In July 1916 he was seriously wounded in the battle on [[Stokhid River]] in what is now Ukraine and was evacuated to St Petersburg <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info-poland.icm.edu.pl/classroom/witkacy/mark.html|title=Witkacy's Theater of Life/The Search for Self|website=info-poland.icm.edu.pl|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> where he witnessed the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. He claimed that he worked out his philosophical principles during an artillery barrage, and that when the Revolution broke out he was elected [[political commissar]] of his regiment. His later works would show his fear of social revolution and foreign invasion, often couched in [[absurdism|absurdist]] language.

[[File:Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz - Portret wielokrotny - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, ''Multiple self-portrait in mirrors'', 1915–1917<ref>{{cite book | last1=Frantczak |first1=Ewa |last2=Okołowicz |first2=Stefan | title=Przeciw nicości : fotografie Stanisława Ignacego Witkiewicza |year=1986 |publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie | location=Kraków |page=63 | isbn=83-08-01398-8}}</ref>]]
He had begun to support himself through portrait painting and continued to do so on his return to Zakopane in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. He soon entered into a major creative phase, setting out his principles in ''New Forms in Painting'' and ''Introduction to the Theory of Pure Form in the Theatre''. He associated with a group of "formist" artists in the early 1920s and wrote most of his plays during this period. Of about forty plays written by Witkiewicz between 1918 and 1925, twenty-one survive, and only ''Jan Maciej Karol Hellcat'' met with any public success during the author's lifetime. The original Polish manuscript of ''The Crazy Locomotive'' was also lost; the play, [[Translation#Back-translation|back-translated]] from two French versions, was not published until 1962.
[[File:Witkacy Autoportret 1924.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Self-portrait, 1924]]

After 1925, and taking the name 'Witkacy', the artist ironically re-branded his portrait painting which provided his economic sustenance as ''The S.I. Witkiewicz Portrait Painting Company'', with the tongue in cheek motto: "The customer must always be satisfied". Several of the so-called grades of portraits were offered, from the merely representational to the more [[Expressionism|expressionistic]] and the narcotics-assisted. Many of his paintings were annotated with mnemonics listing the drugs taken while painting a particular painting, even if this happened to be only a cup of coffee. He also varied the spelling of his name, signing himself ''Witkac, Witkatze, Witkacjusz, Vitkacius'' and ''Vitecasse''&nbsp;— the last being French for "breaks quickly".

In the late 1920s he turned to novel-writing, writing two works, ''Farewell to Autumn'' and ''[[Insatiability]]''. The latter, his major work, encompasses geopolitics, psychoactive drugs, and philosophy. In 1935 he was awarded the Golden Laurel of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] for his novels.<ref name="literat">{{cite web | url=http://literat.ug.edu.pl/autors/witkacy.htm | title=Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz | publisher=Virtual Library of Polish Literature | access-date=13 December 2011 | author=Prof. dr hab. Miłosława Bulowska Schielman}}</ref>

During the 1930s, Witkiewicz published a text on his experiences of narcotics, including [[peyote]], and pursued his interests in philosophy writing, ''Concepts and Principles Implied by the Concept of Existence'' 1935.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info-poland.icm.edu.pl/classroom/witkacy/mark.html|title=Witkacy's Theater of Life/The Search for Self|website=info-poland.icm.edu.pl|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref> He also promoted emerging writers such as [[Bruno Schulz]].

==Death==
Shortly after [[Poland]] was [[Defence War of 1939|invaded]] by Germany in September 1939, Witkiewicz escaped with his young lover Czesława to the rural [[Kresy|frontier]] town of [[Jeziory (Ukraine)|Jeziory]], in what was then [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|eastern Poland]]. After hearing the news of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, Witkacy committed suicide on 18 September by taking a drug overdose and trying to slit his wrists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Witkiew.htm|title=Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz|author1=Donald Pirie|author2=John Bates|author3=Elwira Grossman|access-date=16 April 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208023114/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Witkiew.htm|archive-date=8 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He convinced Czesława to attempt suicide with him by consuming [[Phenobarbital|Luminal]], but she survived.<ref>Journal of Czesława Oknińska, quoted in: {{cite book|last1=Gerould|first1=Daniel Charles|last2=Witkiewicz|first2=Stanisław Ignacy|title=The Witkiewicz Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-0qcaoHr8IC|access-date=22 November 2009|year=1992|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-0994-0|page=275|chapter=Part 5: Philosophy and Suicide, 1931–1939|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-0qcaoHr8IC&pg=RA1-PA271}}</ref> The film ''Mystification'' (2010), written and directed by Jacek Koprowicz proposed that Witkiewicz faked his own death and lived secretly in Poland until 1968.<ref>{{Citation|title=Mystification|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630645/|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/138626/|title = Mystification}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Witkiewicz had died in some obscurity but his reputation began to rise soon after the war, which had destroyed his life and devastated Poland. Outside of Poland his work was discussed as a precursor to post-ww2 European drama in [[Martin Esslin]]'s influential "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]" 1961,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The theatre of the absurd|last=1918-2002.|first=Esslin, Martin|date=2004|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=1400075238|edition= 3rd, 1st vintage books |location=New York|oclc=54075141}}</ref> and later in Hans-Theis Lehmann's "Postdramatic Theatre" 2006.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Postdramatic theatre|last=Hans-Thies|first=Lehmann|others=Jürs-Munby, Karen|isbn=9780415268127|location=London|oclc=61229777|year = 2006}}</ref>  [[:pl:Konstanty Puzyna|Konstanty Puzyna]] collected his surviving dramatic writings in two volumes in "Dramaty" (Dramas) 1962 which revived interest in his plays in Poland. Through his translations and scholarship, [[Daniel Gerould]] introduced English-language audiences to the writings of Witkiewicz.

[[Czesław Miłosz]] framed his argument in ''[[The Captive Mind]]'' around a discussion of Witkiewicz's novel, ''Insatiability''. The artist and theater director [[Tadeusz Kantor]] was inspired by the ''Cricot'' group, through which Witkiewicz had presented his final plays in [[Kraków]]. Kantor brought many of the plays back into currency, first in Poland and then internationally, including ''The Cuttlefish'' (1956) and ''The Water Hen'' (1969). Visual artist [[Paulina Olowska]] produced Witkiewicz's ''The Mother: An Unsavoury Play in Two Acts and an Epilogue'' at the [[Tate Modern]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/performance/bmw-tate-live-2015/bmw-tate-live-paulina-olowska|title=BMW Tate Live: Paulina Olowska: 'The Mother An Unsavoury Play in Two Acts and an Epilogue' – Performance at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-23}}</ref>

In the postwar period, [[Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa|People's Republic of Poland]]'s Ministry of Culture decided to exhume Witkiewicz's body, move it to [[Zakopane]], and give it a solemn funeral. This was carried out according to plan, though no one was allowed to open the coffin that had been delivered by the Soviet authorities.

On 26 November 1994, the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Culture and Art]] ordered the exhumation of the presumed grave of Witkiewicz in Zakopane. Genetic tests on the remaining bones proved that the body had belonged to an unknown woman&nbsp;— a final [[absurdism|absurdist]] joke, fifty years after the publication of Witkacy's last novel.<ref>"...Przeprowadzone badania wykazują, że szczątki kostne, przywiezione w 1988 roku ze wsi Jeziory na Ukrainie należą do kobiety w wieku 25–30 lat, o wzroście około 164 cm. ..."''
