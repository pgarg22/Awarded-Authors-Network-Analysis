'''Bret Harte''' ({{respell|HART}}; born '''Francis Brett Hart'''; August 25, 1836 – May 5, 1902) was an [[United States|American]] [[short story]] writer and [[poet]], best remembered for short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the [[California Gold Rush]]. In a career spanning more than four decades, he also wrote poetry, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials and magazine sketches. As he moved from California to the eastern U.S. and later to [[Europe]], he incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been those most often reprinted, adapted and admired. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Harte was born in 1836<ref>Some sources say he was born in 1837 or 1839. Even his gravestone has the wrong year, 1837. See also [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1970&dat=19360815&id=MZcoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IgYGAAAAIBAJ&pg=2850,4089357 Bret Harte Birth Year Set as 1836], ''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', August 15, 1936</ref> in New York's capital city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]].<ref>Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 3. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}</ref> He was named after his great-grandfather, Francis Brett. When he was young, his father, Henry, changed the spelling of the family name from Hart to Harte. Henry's father was Bernard Hart, an [[Orthodox Jewish]] immigrant who flourished as a merchant, becoming one of the founders of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name=Kanfer>{{cite book|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan|title=A Summer World|year=1989|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0374271800|pages=40}}</ref> Later, Francis preferred to be known by his middle name, but he spelled it with only one "t", becoming Bret Harte.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/bret-harte|title=Bret Harte Biography |website=eNotes|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> Harte was of French Huguenot and Dutch ancestry and descends from prominent New York landowner [[Francis Rombouts]].<ref>Merwin, Henry Childs. The Life of Bret Harte, page 8</ref>

An avid reader as a boy, Harte published his first work at age 11, a satirical poem titled "Autumn Musings", now lost. Rather than attracting praise, the poem garnered ridicule from his family. As an adult, he recalled to a friend, "Such a shock was their ridicule to me that I wonder that I ever wrote another line of verse".<ref>"Autumn Musings" is reported to have been published in the ''New York Sunday Atlas'', according to Theodore Bryant Kingsbury, "Vanity of Earthly Things," ''Charlotte Observer'' (North Carolina), December 13, 1903, p. 14. The ''Atlas'' may have been one of the Albany newspapers using that title from 1843–55.</ref> His formal schooling ended when he was 13, in 1849.<ref name=Scharnhorst4>Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 4. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}</ref>

===Career in California===
Harte moved to California in 1853, later working there in a number of capacities, including miner, teacher, messenger, and journalist. He spent part of his life in the northern California coastal   town of Union (now [[Arcata]]), a settlement on [[Humboldt Bay (United States)|Humboldt Bay]] that was established as a provisioning center for mining camps in the interior.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}}

The ''Wells Fargo Messenger'' of July 1916, relates that, after an unsuccessful attempt to make a living in the gold camps, Harte signed on as a messenger with [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo & Co. Express]]. He guarded treasure boxes on [[stagecoach]]es for a few months, then gave it up to become the [[schoolmaster]] at a school near the town of [[Sonora, California|Sonora]], in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra foothills]]. He created his character Yuba Bill from his memory of an old stagecoach driver.

Among Harte's first literary efforts, a poem was published in ''[[The Golden Era]]'' in 1857,<ref>Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 6. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}</ref> and, in October of that same year, his first prose piece on "A Trip Up the Coast".<ref>Nissen, Axel. ''Bret Harte: Prince and Pauper''. Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2000: 48–49. {{ISBN|1-57806-253-5}}</ref> He was hired as editor of ''The Golden Era'' in the spring of 1860, which he attempted to make into a more literary publication.<ref name=":0">Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 26–27. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}</ref> [[Mark Twain]] later recalled that, as an editor, Harte struck "a new and fresh and spirited note" which "rose above that orchestra's mumbling confusion and was recognizable as music".<ref>Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 28. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}</ref> Among his writings were parodies and satires of other writers, including ''[http://historicaltexts.org/Mystery/Harte%20(1900)%20The%20Stolen%20Cigar%20Case.pdf The Stolen Cigar-Case]'' featuring ace detective "Hemlock Jones", which [[Ellery Queen]] praised as "probably the best parody of [[Sherlock Holmes]] ever written".<ref>Davies, David Stuart (1998). ''Shadows of Sherlock Holmes'', p. xvii. Hertfordshire: Wordsworth Editions. {{ISBN|1-85326-744-9}}.</ref>

The [[1860 Wiyot Massacre|1860 massacre]] of between 80 and 200 [[Wiyot people|Wiyot Indians]] at the village of Tuluwat (near [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] in [[Humboldt County, California]]) was reported by Harte in San Francisco and New York. While serving as assistant editor of the ''Northern Californian'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bret-Harte|title=Bret Harte {{!}} American writer|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref> Harte was left in charge of the paper during the temporary absence of his boss, [[Stephen G. Whipple]]. Harte published a detailed account condemning the slayings, writing: "a more shocking and revolting spectacle never was exhibited to the eyes of a Christian and civilized people. Old women wrinkled and decrepit lay weltering in blood, their brains dashed out and dabbled with their long grey hair. Infants scarcely a span long, with their faces cloven with hatchets and their bodies ghastly with wounds."<ref name=":0" /> 

After he published the editorial, Harte's life was threatened, and he was forced to flee one month later. Harte quit his job and moved to San Francisco, where an anonymous letter published in a city paper is attributed to him, describing widespread community approval of the massacre. In addition, no one was ever brought to trial, despite the evidence of a planned attack and of references to specific individuals, including a rancher named Larabee and other members of the unofficial militia called the [[Humboldt Volunteers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dscholar.humboldt.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/2148/30/1/Crandell.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807072025/http://dscholar.humboldt.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/2148/30/1/Crandell.pdf |archive-date=August 7, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Harte married Anna Griswold on August 11, 1862, in [[San Rafael, California]].<ref>Nissen, Axel. ''Bret Harte: Prince and Pauper''. University Press of Mississippi, 2000: 64. {{ISBN|1-57806-253-5}}</ref> From the start, the marriage was rocky. Some suggested that she was handicapped by extreme jealousy, while early Harte biographer Henry C. Merwin privately concluded that she was "almost impossible to live with".<ref name=Scharnhorst4/>

The well-known minister [[Thomas Starr King]] recommended Harte to [[James T. Fields]], editor of the prestigious magazine, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', which published Harte's first short story in October 1863.<ref>Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 59. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}</ref> In  1864, Harte joined with [[Charles Henry Webb]] in starting a new [[literary magazine|literary journal]] called [[The Californian (1860s newspaper)|''The Californian'']]. He became friends with and mentored poet [[Ina Coolbrith]].<ref name=":0" /> 

In 1865, Harte was asked by bookseller Anton Roman to edit a book of California poetry; it was to be a showcase of the finest California writers.<ref name=":0" /> When the book, called ''Outcroppings'', was published, it contained only 19 poets, many of them Harte's friends (including [[Ina Coolbrith]] and [[Charles Warren Stoddard]]). The book caused some controversy, as Harte used the preface as a vehicle to attack California's literature, blaming the state's "monotonous climate" for its bad poetry.<ref name=":0" /> While the book was widely praised in the East, many newspapers and poets in the West took umbrage at his remarks.<ref name=":0" />

In 1868, Harte became editor of ''The [[Overland Monthly]]'', another new literary magazine, published by Roman Anton with the intention of highlighting local writings.<ref>Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 149. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}</ref> The ''Overland Monthly'' was more in tune with the pioneering spirit of excitement in California. Harte's short story "[[The Luck of Roaring Camp]]" appeared in the magazine's second issue, propelling him to nationwide fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bret-Harte|title=Bret Harte {{!}} American writer|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

When word of [[Charles Dickens]]'s death reached Harte in July 1870, he immediately sent a dispatch across the bay to San Francisco to hold back the forthcoming issue of the ''Overland Monthly'' for 24 hours so that he could compose the poetic tribute, "Dickens in Camp".

Harte's fame increased with the publication of his satirical poem "Plain Language from Truthful James" in the September 1870 issue of the ''Overland Monthly''.<ref>Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 188. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}</ref> The poem became better known by its alternate title, "[[The Heathen Chinee]]", after being republished in a Boston newspaper in 1871.<ref>Scott, David. ''China and the International System, 1840–1949: Power, Presence, and Perceptions in a Century of Humiliation''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2008: 60–61. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7627-7}}</ref> It was also quickly republished in a number of other newspapers and journals, including the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'', the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', the ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', ''[[Prairie Farmer]]'', and the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref>Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 146. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}</ref> Harte was chagrined, however, to find that the popularity of the poem, which he had written to criticize the prevalence of [[Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|anti-Chinese sentiment]] among the white population of California, was largely the result of its being taken literally by the very people he had lampooned, who completely misconstrued the ironic intent of Harte's words.

===Leaving the West===
He was determined to pursue his literary career and traveled back east with his family in 1871 to New York and eventually to Boston, where he contracted with the publisher of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' for an annual salary of $10,000, "an unprecedented sum at the time".<ref>Scharnhorst, Gary (2001). "Introduction". In Bret Harte, ''The Luck of Roaring Camp and Other Writings'', p. xvi. New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-043917-X}}.</ref> His popularity waned, however, and by the end of 1872, he was without a publishing contract and increasingly desperate. He spent the next few years struggling to publish new work or republish old, and delivering lectures about the gold rush. The winter of 1877–1878 was particularly hard for Harte and his family. He later recalled it as a "hand-to-mouth life" and wrote to his wife Anna, "I don't know—looking back—what ever kept me from going down, in ''every way'', during that awful December and January".<ref>Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 133. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}</ref>

After months of soliciting for such a role, Harte accepted the position of United States Consul in the town of [[Krefeld]], Germany, in May 1878. [[Mark Twain]] had been a friend and supporter of Harte's until a substantial falling out, and he had previously tried to block any appointment for Harte. In a letter to [[William Dean Howells]], he complained that Harte would be an embarrassment to the United States because, as he wrote, "Harte is a liar, a thief, a swindler, a snob, a sot, a sponge, a coward, a [[Jeremy Diddler]], he is brim full of treachery... To send this nasty creature to puke upon the American name in a foreign land is too much".<ref>Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 139. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}</ref> Eventually, Harte was given a similar role in [[Glasgow]] in 1880. In 1885, he settled in London. Throughout his time in Europe, he regularly wrote to his wife and children and sent monthly financial contributions. He declined, however, to invite them to join him, nor did he return to the United States to visit them. His excuses were usually related to money. During the 24 years that he spent in Europe, he never abandoned writing, and maintained a prodigious output of stories that retained the freshness of his earlier work.

He died in [[Camberley]], England, in 1902 of [[throat cancer]], and is buried at [[Frimley]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=vfT5ieZw1WcC&dat=19020506&printsec=frontpage&hl=en ''Newburgh Daily Journal''], May 6, 1902.</ref> His wife Anna (née Griswold) Harte died on August 2, 1920. The couple lived together only 16 of the 40 years that they were married.<ref>Nissen, Axel. ''Bret Harte: Prince and Pauper''. University Press of Mississippi, 2000: 243–244. {{ISBN|1-57806-253-5}}</ref>

==Reception==
In ''Round the World'', [[Andrew Carnegie]] praised Harte as uniquely American:{{quote|text="A whispering pine of the Sierras transplanted to Fifth Avenue! How could it grow? Although it shows some faint signs of life, how sickly are the leaves! As for fruit, there is none. America had in Bret Harte its most distinctively national poet."<ref>[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext04/7rwrl10.htm Andrew Carnegie, ''Round the World'', The Project Gutenberg EBook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209001311/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext04/7rwrl10.htm |date=February 9, 2009 }}</ref>}}

[[Rudyard Kipling]] also showed himself to be an admirer of Harte's writing.  In ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]'',<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32977 From Sea to Sea; Letters of Travel by Rudyard Kipling - ''FROM SEA TO SEA No. XXIII How I got to San Francisco and took Tea with the Natives there'' : Project Gutenberg]</ref> while in [[San Francisco]] Kipling wrote:{{quote|text="A reporter asked me what I thought of the city, and I made answer suavely that it was hallowed ground to me because of Bret Harte. That was true: 'Well,' said the reporter, 'Bret Harte claims California, but California don't claim Bret Harte.{{nbsp}}...' He could not understand that to the outside world the city was worth a great deal less than the man."}}

Mark Twain, however, characterized him and his writing as insincere. Writing in his autobiography four years after Harte's death, Twain criticized the miners' dialect used by Harte, claiming that it never existed outside of his imagination. Additionally, Twain accused Harte of "borrowing" money from his friends with no intention of repaying it and of financially abandoning his wife and children. He referred repeatedly to Harte as "The Immortal Bilk".<ref>Krauth, Leland. ''Mark Twain & Company: Six Literary Relations''. University of Georgia Press, 2003: 23. {{ISBN|978-0820325408}}</ref>
