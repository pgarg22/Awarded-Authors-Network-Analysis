'''Carl Joachim Friedrich Ludwig von Arnim''' (26 January 1781 – 21 January 1831), better known as '''Achim von Arnim''', was a German [[poet]], novelist, and together with [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], a leading figure of [[German Romanticism]].

==Life==
Arnim was born in [[Berlin]], descending from a [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburgian]] ''[[Uradel]]'' noble family first mentioned in 1204. His father was the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] chamberlain (''[[Chamberlain (office)|Kammerherr]]'') Joachim Erdmann von Arnim (1741–1804), royal envoy in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Dresden]], later active as the director of the Berlin [[Berlin State Opera|Court Opera]]. His mother, Amalia Caroline von Labes (1761–1781), died three weeks after Arnim's birth.

Arnim and his elder brother Carl Otto spent their childhood with their maternal grandmother Marie Elisabeth von Labes, the widow of [[Michael Gabriel Fredersdorf]] from her first marriage, in [[Großwoltersdorf|Zernikow]] and in Berlin, where he attended the [[Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium|Joachimsthal Gymnasium]]. In 1798 he went on to study law, natural science and mathematics at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. His early writings included numerous articles for scientific magazines. His first major work, ''Theorie der elektrischen Erscheinungen'' (Theory of electrical phenomena) showed a leaning to the supernatural, common among the [[German romanticism|German romanticists]]. In [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] he associated with the composer [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]], in whose house he became acquainted with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Ludwig Tieck]]. From 1800 he continued his studies at the [[University of Göttingen]], though, having met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Clemens Brentano]], he inclined from natural sciences towards literature. Arnim received the degree of a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1801, but never practiced.

He went on to travel through Europe with his brother from 1801 to 1804. He met his later wife [[Bettina von Arnim|Bettina]] in [[Frankfurt]], travelled down the [[Middle Rhine|Rhine Valley]] together with Clemens Brentano, visited [[Germaine de Staël]] in [[Coppet]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and his wife [[Dorothea von Schlegel|Dorothea]] in [[Paris]], and continued his journey to [[London]] and Scotland.

Arnim was influenced by the earlier writings of Goethe and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], from which he learned to appreciate the beauties of German traditional legends and [[folk song]]s. Back in Germany, he began forming a collection of these and in 1805 first published the result, in collaboration with Clemens Brentano, under the title ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]''. He went to see Goethe in [[Weimar]], in order to edit the collection. In Frankfurt he met with the jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], the beginning of an enduring friendship.

Arnims's editorial work was increasingly affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Upon the Prussian defeat in the 1806 [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]], he followed the royal court to [[Königsberg]], where he joined the circle of Prussian reformers around [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Baron vom Stein]]. In 1807 he moved back to Weimar and [[Kassel]], where he visited the [[Brothers Grimm]], and finally to [[Heidelberg]]. He and Brentano completed the second and third volume of their folk song collection and from 1808 together with [[Joseph Görres]] published the important romantic ''Zeitung für Einsiedler'' (Newspaper for Hermits) in [[Heidelberg]] in 1808. The Heidelberg Romanticist circle also included Tieck, Friedrich Schlegel, [[Jean Paul]], [[Justinus Kerner]], and [[Ludwig Uhland]].

From 1809 Arnim again lived in Berlin, however, his plans to enter the Prussian civil service failed. In 1810 he affianced Brentano's sister Bettina, who won wide recognition as a writer in her own right. They married on 11 March 1811; their daughter [[Gisela von Arnim|Gisela]] (one of seven children) became a writer as well. Shortly after their marriage the couple went on to visit Goethe in to Weimar, however, the reunion was overshadowed by a heated quarrel between Bettina and Goethe's wife [[Christiane Vulpius|Christiane]].

In Berlin, Achim worked on [[Heinrich von Kleist]]'s legacy and founded the patriotic ''Deutsche Tischgesellschaft'' association of Christian men.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/leobaeck/article-abstract/64/1/181/5572253|doi = 10.1093/leobaeck/ybz010|title = The Troubled Friendship of Clemens Brentano and Rahel Levin in the Shadow of the Christlich-deutsche Tischgesellschaft|year = 2019|last1 = Hertz|first1 = Deborah|journal = The Leo Baeck Institute Year Book|volume = 64|pages = 181–196}}</ref> He remained connected with the Prussian patriots such as [[Adam Heinrich Müller]] and [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué]] and even commanded a ''[[Landsturm]]'' battalion during the [[German Campaign of 1813]]. From October 1813 he acted as publisher of the Berlin newspaper "The Prussian Correspondent", until he fell out with his predecessor [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] in February 1814.

While his wife stayed in Berlin, Arnim in 1814 retired to [[Künstlerhaus Schloss Wiepersdorf]], his family home, where he lived until his death from a [[stroke]] in 1831. His output, published in newspapers, magazines and almanacs as well as self-contained books, included novels, dramas, stories, poems and journalistic works. Following his death, his library was taken over by the Weimar court library.

==Works==
Arnim is considered one of the most important representatives of German [[Romanticism]]. His works were collected, with an introduction by [[Wilhelm Grimm]], in twenty volumes (1839–48). [[Heinrich Heine]] wrote a eulogy of Arnim in his ''Deutschland''. His works include:
