'''Igo Gruden''' (18 April 1893 – 29 November 1948) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[poet]] and [[translator]].

He was born as '''Ignacij Gruden''' in the small fishing village of [[Aurisina]] near [[Trieste]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[Gorizia and Gradisca|County of Gorizia and Gradisca]] (now in [[Italy]]) as first of ten children of Franc Gruden and Justina Košuta. He attended high schools in Trieste and [[Gorizia]], and then studied law in [[Vienna]] and [[Graz]]. During [[World War I]], he served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and fought in the [[Battles of the Isonzo]], where he was seriously injured. After the war, he continued his studies in [[Prague]], graduating in 1921. The same year, he moved to [[Ljubljana]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], where he practiced law.

In the 1920s and 1930s, he was active in spreading the [[anti-Fascist]] sentiment among Slovene intellectuals. In 1922, he was arrested by the [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italian]] authorities while visiting his native village, which was then under Italian jurisdiction. He was released after the intervention of the Yugoslav authorities. In Ljubljana, Gruden soon became part of the local [[left liberal]] intellectual circles. He collaborated with renowned journals such as ''[[Ljubljanski zvon]]'' and ''[[Sodobnost]]'', and frequented authors such as [[Josip Vidmar]], [[Juš Kozak]], [[Ferdo Kozak]], [[Fran Albreht]], [[Stanko Leben]], [[Lojze Ude]] and [[Anton Vodnik]].

During [[World War II]], he collaborated with the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]], and was interned by the Italian occupation forces to the [[Rab concentration camp]]. After the [[Italian armistice]], he joined the [[Slovene Partisans|Partisan resistance]]. After the war, he worked at the Slovenian section of the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Radio in [[Belgrade]], together with [[Matej Bor]] and [[Anton Ingolič]]. He died in Ljubljana and was buried in the [[Žale]] cemetery.

Gruden's poetry was influenced mostly by the [[Slovene Modern]] ({{lang-sl|slovenska moderna}}), particularly [[Oton Župančič]] and [[Dragotin Kette]]. He was also heavily influenced by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] and [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]]. Initially, he followed the [[vitalist]] trend, but later moved to more reflexive poetry. During World War II, he published many poems describing the daily life in concentration camps.
