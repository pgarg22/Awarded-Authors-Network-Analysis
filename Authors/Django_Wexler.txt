==Work==
===''The Shadow Campaigns''===
Wexler's principal [[epic fantasy]] series, ''The Shadow Campaigns'', is set in a world resembling Europe and North Africa of the [[Napoleonic era]]. It mainly follows three soldiers of the kingdom of Vordan – Count Janus bet Vhalnich, a character patterned on [[Napoleon]],<ref>{{cite news|title=An Interview with Django Wexler - SFWA |url=http://www.sfwa.org/2013/09/interview-django-wexler/ |accessdate=11 January 2018 |publisher=SFWA|date=12 September 2013}}</ref> Marcus d'Ivoire, a seasoned infantry commander posted to a backwards colony, and Winter Ihernglass, a young woman who disguised herself as a man in order to be able to enlist. As they struggle through Vordan's equivalents of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars|attendant wars]], they also face a supernatural threat in the form of conspiracies fighting for control of the rare remnants of magic still existing in the world.

Reviewing the series for [[Tor.com]], Stefan Raets described the first novel, ''The Thousand Names'', as a "military fantasy full of spectacular battles" with a large and diverse cast, but criticized Winter's lack of agency.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Raets|first1=Stefan|title=Chaos in Khandar: The Thousand Names by Django Wexler |url=https://www.tor.com/2013/07/03/book-review-the-thousand-names-by-django-wexler/ |accessdate=11 January 2018 |publisher=Tor.com |date=3 July 2013}}</ref> ''The Shadow Throne'' was appreciated by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as an "audacious and subversive sequel"<ref>{{cite news|title=Fiction Book Review: The Shadow Throne by Django Wexler |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-451-41806-7 |accessdate=11 January 2018 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |language=en}}</ref> and by Liz Bourke at Tor.com as an "immensely entertaining" novel that unlike other male-written fantasy avoided the [[grimdark]] trend and featured a "central, significant, [[queer]] relationship between two women", but noted that Wexler relied much on coincidences to advance the plot.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bourke|first1=Liz|title=Fantasy French Revolution with Lesbians: The Shadow Throne by Django Wexler|url=https://www.tor.com/2014/07/01/book-review-the-shadow-throne-django-wexler/|accessdate=11 January 2018|publisher=Tor.com |date=1 July 2014}}</ref> She also praised the third novel, ''The Price of Valour'', for surpassing its predecessors as an "explosive, action-packed" epic fantasy novel with complex characterization and, again, a wide variety of female characters.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bourke|first1=Liz|title=Shut Up And Take My Money: The Price of Valor by Django Wexler|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/07/06/book-review-the-price-of-valor-by-django-wexler/ |accessdate=11 January 2018 |publisher=Tor.com |date=6 July 2015}}</ref>
