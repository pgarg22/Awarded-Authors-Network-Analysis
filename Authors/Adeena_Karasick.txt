== Teaching career ==

Karasick is a visiting assistant professor at [[Pratt Institute]] teaching literature and critical theory and performance and professor of global literature at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]].

== Projects and collaborations ==
Both her poetic and scholarly work focuses on issues of contemporary writing strategies, media, culture and aesthetics and has been described as "electricity in language." Nicole Brossard, "a twined virtuosity of mind and ear which leaves the reader deliciously lost in Karasick's signature 'syllabic labyrinth.'" [[Craig Dworkin]], "a delirious interplay of tongue twisting cacophony and serious exploration of language and meaning." Herizons, "plural, cascading, exuberant, in their cross fertilization of punning and knowing, theory and theatre", Charles Bernstein.

Her ongoing collaboration with Maria Damon, ''Intertextile: Text in Exile: Shmata Mash-Up'',  explores the interwoven relationship between gender and textuality and debuted at [[The Banff Centre]] for the Arts and The Poets House in New York.

Her study of the Kabbalistic traces in [[Charles Bernstein]]'s opera, ''Shadowtime'' and her ongoing work tracing the patterns and intersections between Kabbalah and Contemporary poetics ("Hijacking Language") were published in ''Radical Poetics and Secular Jewish Culture'' (University of Alabama Press, 2012).<ref>Miller, Stephen and Morris, Daniel (2012).

University of Alabama Press. {{ISBN|0817355634}}</ref> An analysis by Maria Damon of Karasick's own poetry also appears in the book.<ref>See Damon, Maria "Adeena Karasicks Wall of Sound" in Miller and Morris (2012), pp. 379-396.</ref> According to Jake Marmer, "Karasick is after the "meaning that is not fixed but in flux, fluid; a logic that is often illogical; a rationality that is not irrational but relational and affirms that like the text itself we must embrace contradiction, conflict, discordance."<ref name = "MM" />

A study of [[Kenneth Goldsmith|Kenny Goldsmith]] and conceptual poetry and its relation to 13th-century textual practices was presented at The Kelly Writer's House, University of Pennsylvania, as part of North of Invention: Festival of Canadian Poetry.

An investigation of the relationship between conceptual writing, media and pop culture, "Glammed Out, Googley-Eyed and Gangsta: Parody, Satire and Cultural Sampling in the Age of Media Obsession" was presented at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]], 2011.

Her work on the language and locus of [[Marshall McLuhan]] includes "In My Blogal Village, Print is Hot" for the "Cityscapes" session of the Marshall McLuhan Centennial (Signals from the DEW Line: Art and Poetry in the Global Village), [[University of Toronto]], and  "We'll Cross that Road When We Come to It: On Media, Writing, and Creativity" at the 13th Annual Convention of the Media Ecology Association, [[Manhattan College]].

"Exile & Nomadicism: A Community Manifesto" was presented at the Poetry Communities and the Individual Talent Conference, [[University of Pennsylvania]] and printed in Jacket2, 2012.

Since 1989, Karasick has collaborated in both print and performance with fellow poet [[bill bissett]] and in June 2011, they embarked on a 20th Anniversary World Performance Tour (The Bouchetime Tour) through London, Manchester, Paris, Geneva, Barcelona, Ghent and St. Petersburg promoting sound collage and asemic performance.

<blockquote>Today's politics have reached such a completely absurd level, I felt compelled to comment," said Adeena Karasick of her new video I Got a Crush on Osama released today on YouTube to help promote her new book from Talonbooks, Amuse Bouche: Tasty Treats for the Mouth. The book is a delectable feast of her trademark poetry combining the obsessions of popular culture, politics and linguistic theory into a multi-layered banquet of language often humorous and wry, surprising and sometimes shocking in its juxtapositions, reflecting the often ludicrousness of the techno-saturated world we live in.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poet Adeena Karasick Releases 'I GOT A CRUSH ON OSAMA' Video as Comment on Absurdity of Politics|url=http://www.prlog.org/10217756-poet-adeena-karasick-releases-got-crush-on-osama-video-as-comment-on-absurdity-of-politics.html|publisher=PRLog|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>
