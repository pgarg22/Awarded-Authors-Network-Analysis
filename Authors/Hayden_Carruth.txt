==Early life==
Hayden Carruth was the son of [[Gorton Veeder Carruth]] a journalist and newspaper editor, and Margery Carruth.
His interest in poetry started early due to his father.

==Works==
Carruth wrote more than 30 books of poetry, four books of [[literary criticism]], [[essays]], a [[novel]] and two poetry anthologies. Prior to his affiliation with ''Harper's'', he served as editor-in-chief of ''[[Poetry magazine|Poetry]]'' (1949-1950) and as advisory editor of ''[[The Hudson Review]]'' for twenty years. He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] fellowships.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In 1992 he was awarded the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for his ''Collected Shorter Poems'' and in 1996 the [[National Book Award]] in poetry for his ''Scrambled Eggs and Whiskey''.<ref name=nba1996/> Shortly after the debut of ''Scrambled Eggs and Whiskey'', he also won the $50,000 [[Lannan Literary Award]]. His later titles include the 2001 collection of poems ''Doctor Jazz'' and a 70-minute audio CD of him reading selections from ''Scrambled Eggs and Whiskey'' and ''Collected Shorter Poems.'' His ''Last Poems'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2012) combines poems written toward the end of his life with the concluding poems from twenty-six of his previous volumes.

Noted for the breadth of his linguistic and formal resources, influenced by jazz and the blues, Carruth's poems are informed by his political radicalism and sense of cultural responsibility. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Among his influences, Carruth particularly admired 18th century poet [[Alexander Pope]], lauding "Pope's [[rationalism]] and [[pandeism]] with which he wrote the greatest [[mock-epic]] in English literature"<ref>{{Cite book |title = Suicides and Jazzers |author = Hayden Carruth |year = 1992 |isbn = 047209419X |page = 161 }}</ref>

Many of Carruth's best-known poems are about the people and places of northern [[Vermont]], as well as rural poverty and hardship, addressing loneliness, insanity, and death.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> One of his most celebrated poems is "Emergency Haying". {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
