'''Umberto Saba''' (9 March 1883 – 26 August 1957) was an Italian poet and novelist, born '''Umberto Poli''' in the cosmopolitan Mediterranean port of [[Trieste]] when it was the fourth largest city of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Poli assumed the ''[[nom de plume]]'' "Saba" in 1910, and his name was officially changed to Umberto Saba in 1928. From 1919 he was the proprietor of an antiquarian bookshop in Trieste. He suffered from depression for all of his adult life.

==Life and career==
Saba's Christian father, 29-year-old Ugo Edoardo Poli, [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in order to marry 37-year-old Felicita Rachele Cohen in July 1882. Felicita was one month pregnant with Umberto at the time of the wedding. Ugo abandoned his new wife and faith before Umberto was born and the child was raised first by a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] Catholic [[wet-nurse]], Gioseffa Gabrovich Schobar ("Peppa"), and her husband, who had just lost a child, and from 1887 onwards by his mother, in her sister Regina's home, though Umberto maintained a close lifelong attachment to Peppa.<ref name=Moleta>Moleta, Vincent (2004) ''Umberto Saba – Poetry and Prose''. Bridgetown, Western Australia: Æolian Press</ref> <sup>(p.&nbsp;528)</sup>  
[[File:Saba 1883.jpg|thumb|right|Saba as a child]]
Saba was a keen reader who kept pet birds and studied the violin.<ref name=Moleta/> <sup>(pp. xix, 528)</sup> In 1897 he transferred from the Gymnasium to a commercial college, the Imperial Academy of Commerce and Navigation, and then went to work in the office of a customs agent.

As a boy and a young man he was of a shy and solitary character, with just a few friends, among whom his cousin [[Giorgio Fano]] and the other great Triestine poet [[Virgilio Giotti]].<ref name="treccani enciclopedia-Saba">{{cite web|title=POLI, Umberto

In 1900 he began composing poetry, signing his work "Umberto Chopin Poli." In January 1903 Saba travelled to [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] to study [[archaeology]], [[German language|German]] and [[Latin]], but began to complain of a nervous disorder and, in June, returned to Trieste. After a holiday in Slovenia, he spent some time later that year in Switzerland, writing a play. In July 1904, the socialist newspaper, ''[[Il Lavoratore]]'', edited by his friend Amadeo Tedeschi, published Saba's account of a visit to Montenegro earlier in the year, and in May 1905, ''Il Lavoratore'' printed his first published poem. In 1905 he travelled to Florence with friends and – upon meeting his father for the first time – changed his ''nom de plume'' to "Umberto da Montereale," after the town of his father's birth. That summer he met Carolina (Lina) Wölfler, and began corresponding with her the following December. Between 1907 and 1908 he completed an obligatory year of Italian military service in an infantry unit based in Salerno. He married Lina in a Jewish ceremony in 1909, and they had a daughter, Linuccia, the following year.<ref name=Moleta/> <sup>(p. xix)</sup>

In November 1910 his first collection of poems, ''Poesie'', was published under the name Saba, and the name was legally recognised as his surname in 1928.<ref name=Moleta/> <sup>(p. xix)</sup>. This choice of name (which may be based on one of two [[Hebrew]] words – "sova" (שובע) meaning "being well-fed" or "saba" (סבא) meaning "grandfather") is thought by some scholars to be an homage to his Jewish mother,<ref name=Cary>Joseph Cary, Three Modern Italian Poets:  Saba, Ungaretti, Montale (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1992) p. 35.</ref> while others point to the similarity with his wet-nurse's surname, Schobar.<ref>Sartarelli, Stephen (1998) ''Songbook: Selected Poems from the Canzionere of Umberto Saba''. Riverdale-on-Hudson: Sheep Meadow Press. p, xv</ref>

In the spring of 1911, while Saba was away in Florence meeting people associated with the influential magazine ''La Voce'', and initiating a collaboration with Mario Novaro, Lina had an affair with a painter. The couple separated, but were together again by May 1912 when the family moved to Bologna, where public readings of his poetry were poorly received and Saba was beset by depressed lows and creative highs. Destitute, in 1914 the family moved to Milan, where Saba found work first as a secretary, then as a nightclub manager. In early 1915 he began writing for [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' newspaper, but in June was drafted into the army, where he saw no active service and was hospitalised due to depression.<ref name=Moleta/> <sup>(pp.&nbsp;544–5)</sup>

In 1919, he returned to Trieste and purchased the ''Mailänder'' second-hand bookshop, which he renamed ''La Libreria Antica e Moderna.'' The business produced enough income to support the family, and Saba soon became enthusiastic about buying and selling rare old books and enjoyed the extensive travel involved. After both returned to Trieste in 1919, Saba started meeting on a daily basis and collaborating artistically with Giotti, who designed for him the logo of the ''Libreria Antica e Moderna'', cured and illustrated the ''[[Brochure|plaquette]]'' for Saba's ''Cose leggere e vaganti'' and of ten small books. Saba on the other hand published ''Il mio cuore e la mia casa'' at his library.<ref name="treccani enciclopedia3">{{cite web|title=Schönbeck, Virgilio

He self-published the first edition of his ''Songbook'' in 1921 (successive, enlarged editions followed, and eventually it grew to contain over four hundred poems, spanning fifty years).<ref name=Moleta/> <sup>(p.&nbsp;544–5)</sup> In 1929 he began psychoanalysis under the influential Trieste psychoanalyst [[Edoardo Weiss]], a student of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref name=Moleta/> <sup>(p. xxi)</sup>
[[File:Saba receiving doctorate.jpg|thumb|right|Saba (left) receiving his honorary doctorate from the University of Rome in 1953]]
In 1939 Saba sought exemption from the newly proclaimed anti-Jewish laws, but was unwilling to be baptised into the Catholic faith, so the following year he sold the bookshop to his long-time assistant and friend, Carlo Cerne. Upon the announcement of the [[armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]] in 1943, Saba fled Trieste with his family to Florence, where they moved to eleven different hiding places over the following 12 months, to avoid deportation; after which Lina returned to Trieste and Saba moved to Rome, where he oversaw the publication of ''Scorciatoie e raccontini,'' a collection of his aphorisms. In 1946 Saba was awarded the Viareggio Prize and returned to Trieste where, in the following year, he sparked a vitriolic debate over the future of the city with his article ''If I were named governor of Trieste''.<ref name=Moleta/>

After being prescribed injectable opium for his depression, from 1950 onwards Saba was frequently admitted to a Rome nursing home for treatment of addiction. At the age of 70, in 1953, the University of Rome bestowed upon him an honorary doctorate,<ref name=Moleta/> and he received an award from the [[Lincean Academy]]. He died at the age of 74 in [[Gorizia]], nine months after a heart attack, and a year after the death of his wife.

==Influence of Jewish background==

The 1948 prose essay "Storia e cronistoria del Canzoniere" ("History and chronology of song-writing") shows autobiographical elements. "Gli Ebrei" (The Jews) which is part of his 1956 "Ricordi-Racconti 1910–1947" ("Records and Stories 1910–1947") describes the life of the Trieste Jewish Community of his childhood. The 1952 "Vignette di vita giudaica" ("Vignettes of Jewish life") includes a description of [[Samuel David Luzzatto]], his mother's uncle on her own mother's side . His works indicate his knowledge of both Hebrew and the Trieste Jewish dialect.<ref>Hebrew Encyclopedia, Jerusalem, 1974, Vol. 25 p. 419 (in Hebrew)</ref>
