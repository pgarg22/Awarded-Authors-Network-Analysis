'''László Ladányi''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈlaːsloː ˈlɒdaːɲi}}; October 24, 1907 in [[Budapest]] – January 8, 1992 in [[Tel Aviv]]) was a poet, author, dramatist and reporter.

==Biography==
As a young man, László Ladányi was already a recognized author in [[Hungary]]. After emigrating to Israel at the age of 50, he continued writing in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. His writings appeared in the press, both in Israel and abroad. While living in Hungary, he wrote mostly poetry and drama but after moving to Israel, he discovered a new writing genre and started creating prose: short stories and short novels.<br>
His critics attest to his short stories, diverse style, a realistic vision combined with poetic symbolism, dealing with lyrical and philosophical themes. A recurring motif in many of his stories is the eternal longing of man for joy and beauty, while helplessly swept in the torrent of blind fate, in the terrifying shadow of war. At the same time, his satirical writings, interspersed with fine humor, bear testimony to Ladányi’s zest for life and to his faith in the victory of humanism and common sense.<ref>[http://hgyvk.hu/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=453&Itemid=73&lang=en Article about Ladányi's works, his literary style, themes and his book "Tűzözön" (Fireflood) – Tamás Aczél, "Irodalmi Újság" (Paris) September 15, 1968. page 5.]</ref><ref>Literary Criticism about Ladányi's book – "A lángoló özvegy" (Hot Widow).

===His life and work in Hungary===
In 1925, Ladányi graduated from the high school of the Budapest Academy of Commerce. His writing talent became evident in his early youth. He published his first poem in 1923 in the literary paper "Új Századok" (New Centuries), after which his poems were frequently printed in the Budapest periodicals. Between 1936 and 1949 he became a regularly published poet in the literary weekly<ref group=note>Hungarian art and literature weekly, first published in 1894. Became the most widely distributed literary periodical in Hungary. It printed the works of some of the best Hungarian authors and poets. It closed down in 1949.</ref> "Új Idők (1894-1949)" (New Times)<ref>[http://adtplus.arcanum.hu/en/search/results/?fCOL=UjIdok&simple=1&query=SZO%3D%28Lad%C3%A1nyi+L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%29 List of poems published in "Új Idők]"</ref> and was included in several anthologies.<br>
Ladányi’s first volume of poems, "Az éjszaka csodája" (Mystery of the Night) came out in 1940. In the same year, he was forced to join the [[Labour service (Hungary)|Hungarian labour service]], where he languished almost continuously until 1944. In February 1943 he received a one-day leave to marry Edit Utassy, with whom he lived until his death. He described these hard times in his autobiographical novel "My Life’s Carousel", as well as in numerous poems.  While yearning for home and his wife - the love of his life - he was subjected to years of humiliation by his commanders, to hard labour, hunger and devastating cold.  At the end of 1944, after the Nazis had occupied Hungary and his company was stationed in Romania, he managed to escape and hide in Romanian villages, thereby saving his life. Upon returning home in 1945 after the war, he found out that his parents and many of his relatives had been murdered.  Only his sister and wife survived.<br> 
In 1945 Ladányi became a member of the newly established Hungarian Writers’ Association. He published poetry, articles, plays and children’s stories. His three-act rhymed play was successfully produced in a Budapest theatre in 1953. The radio broadcast many of his works, including a three-act musical play, a rhymed satirical drama, several short plays, poems and dramatized stories.<ref>[http://radiojatek.elte.hu/index.php?title=A_v%C3%A1ndormozis#column-one Hungarian Radio Lexicon]</ref><ref>[http://radiojatek.elte.hu/index.php?title=%C3%89jjel-nappal Hungarian Radio Lexicon]</ref><br>
In May 1957, in the wake of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], he emigrated to Israel with his wife and daughter and lived there until his death.

===The Israeli period===

At the same time, he continued writing in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. His short stories and serial novels were regularly published in the Israeli Hungarian press: the daily "[[Új Kelet|Új kelet]]" (New East), the weekly "A hét" (The week) and the literary quarterly "Kútfő" (Source).<ref group=note>[http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/bib75603 Periodical review of literature, art and society]</ref> He also translated short stories from Hebrew and English for the Hungarian press.<br>
