== Early life ==
Dejan Stojanović was born on 11 March 1959 in [[Peć]], [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Autonomous District of Kosovo and Metohija]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|PR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. In 1972, he moved with his family to [[Sutomore]], near [[Bar, Montenegro]], where he completed his secondary education. He attended the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] at [[Kosovo]]. While he was predominantly interested in philosophy and the arts during his youth, he earned a degree in law.<ref>Stojanović, Dejan (2000). ''Krugovanje,'' English translation: ''Circling,'' Beleška o autoru (English translation: About the author), Pub: Narodna knjiga, Alpha, Belgrade, page 83..</ref>

== Writing background ==

===Poetry===
He began to write poetry in the late seventies<ref>Stojanović, Dejan (1993). Poems written between 1978 and 1987; ''Krugovanje: 1978–1987''; English translation: ''Circling: 1978–1987,'' Pub: Narodna knjiga, Alpha, Belgrade; Series: Contemporary Yugoslavian writers.</ref> and kept his work private for three to four years, after which he published his poems in literary magazines in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Serbian magazines in which his work was published include ''[[Stremljenja]]'' (English translation: ''Trends'') and ''[[Jedinstvo]]'' (English translation: ''Unity'') <ref name=worldcat>{{cite book|author= Stojanović, Dejan. "Svetionik." Edition/Format: Poetry: Serbian. Publication: ''Jedinstvo,'' 5, 332, str. 11. Notes: Ćirilicom.

By 1983, he became a member of a literary club (Karagač) in his hometown of Peć. During this time, he was named as the secretary and later promoted to president of the club.<ref>One of the founding members of the club, participating in all activities, was poet Alija Dzogović and among other members was poet Radenko Bjelanović.</ref> In this role, he conducted interviews with some local artists from Kosovo.

In his early adulthood, Stojanović developed a philosophical system of ideas that dealt primarily with metaphysical questions and the structure of the Universe. He wrote several hundred pages in his notebooks exploring these ideas, along with essays on language and literature. In 1999, these manuscripts, along with his library of more than a thousand books (carefully chosen for years), were lost due to fire shortly after the war in Kosovo ended.<ref name=libraries>{{cite web|author=Stojanović, Dejan (2007). ''Ples vremena,'' Napomene u vezi s knjigom prvom, str. 113, Konras, Series: Biblioteka Beli vuk -- knj. 7, Beograd (English translation: ''Dance of Time,'' Notes, p. 113, Konras, Belgrade, 2007) |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389735W/Ples_vremena |title=Ples vremena |publisher=Open Library |access-date=2013-04-11}}</ref> His books, along with his manuscripts, were held temporarily in his brother's office in the center of downtown Peć.

=== Publishing ===
In 1990, Stojanović established a private publishing firm known as Metoh (English translation: the church's land).<ref name=Kosovo>{{cite web|author1=What means Kosovo |author2=what Metohia? |url=http://www.kosovo.net/hist.html |title=Metoh |publisher=Kosovo.net |access-date=2013-04-11}}</ref> While the organization was located in Peć, the firm planned to publish a literary magazine in Kosovo. The firm's staff included writers from Belgrade, one of whom was Alek Vukadinović, a Serbian poet who supported Stojanović's plan to publish a magazine. While Stojanović's first book of poetry, ''Krugovanje'' (English translation: ''Circling'') was ready for publication in 1983, it was not published until 1993. During those ten years, several poems that were initially planned for inclusion in the book had been replaced by newer poems, which had been written between 1983 and 1986. The last poem in the book had actually been written in Chicago, in 1991.<ref>"Melodija najstarijeg zavicaja," Ciklus: "Mrak čeka," p. 67, ''Krugovanje: 1978-1987'' (1993); English translation: "A Melody of the Premival Homeland," Sequence: "Darkness Is Waiting," ''Circling: 1978-1987''</ref>

=== Journalism ===

In early 1990, Stojanović joined the writing staff of Serbian magazine, ''[[Pogledi]]'' (English translation: ''Viewpoints''). At this time, he began a series of interviews with several Serbian writers in Belgrade, including [[Momo Kapor]], Alek Vukadinović, and [[Nikola Milošević (politician)|Nikola Milošević]].<ref>Petrov, Aleksandar (December 2000), "A Poet before the Open Door," ''American Srbobran,'' Literary Supplement ("Pesnik pred otvorenim vratima," ''Amerikanski Srbobran,'' Književni dodatak)</ref> During his second visit to Paris in May and June 1990, he interviewed<ref>Popović, Aleksandar I.

In the nineties, as a foreign correspondent, he published all his interviews in a Serbian weekly magazine, ''Views (Pogledi).'' At its peak in 1990, the magazine was selling up to 200,000 copies.</ref> During this time, he conducted interviews with prominent American writers, including [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Saul Bellow]], [[Charles Simic]], and [[Steve Tesich]]. He did not return to his homeland in summer 1991, when the [[Yugoslav Wars]] started in the former [[Yugoslavia]], and has been living in Chicago since 1990.<ref name=openlibraz/> In honor of his series of interviews published in ''Conversations'', published in 1999 by [[Književna reč]] of Belgrade, Stojanović received the Rastko Petrović Award, presented by the [[Association of Writers of Serbia]].<ref>Vidaković, Dušan (November–December 2000).

=== Style ===
[[File:Dejan Stojanovic, Chicago, 1991-1.jpg|thumb|Dejan Stojanović, Chicago, 1991]]

Stojanović’s poetry collections are characterized by sequences of compact, dense poems, simple yet complex in carefully organized overall structure, and that is why some more visibly than others appear as long poems. This is especially characteristic of the books, ''The Sign and its Children,''<ref>Mirković, Miroslav Buca (10, 7, 2000). "Prkos tamnim silama," ''Ilustrovana politika,'' rubrika ''Čitati ili ne čitati,'' broj 2177, 7. X 2000.</ref> ''The Shape'',<ref>Urošević, Draginja (2001). [[Borba (newspaper)|''Borba'']], Beograd</ref> and ''The Creator''<ref>Janković, Oliver (28, 29, 30. 11. 2000). "Belina sveta i papira," [[Borba (newspaper)|''Borba'']], Beograd</ref> (''Znak I njegova deca'',<ref>Vitošević, Nevena (February 2001).  "Simfonija znakova ili skladna porodica," ''Knjizevna reč,'' broj 513, februar 2001, Beograd</ref><ref name=open>{{cite web|author=Dejan Stojanović |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389739W/Znak_i_njegova_deca |title=Znak i njegova deca |publisher=Open Library |access-date=2013-04-11}}</ref> ''Oblik,''<ref name=openlibra>{{cite web|author=Dejan Stojanović |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389734W/Oblik |title=Oblik |publisher=Open Library |access-date=2013-04-11}}</ref>  ''Tvoritelj''<ref name=openlibrary>{{cite web|author=Dejan Stojanović |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389738W/Tvoritelj |title=Tvoritelj |publisher=Open Library |access-date=2013-04-11}}</ref> ), in which, with a relatively small number of words repeated in different contexts, Stojanović built his own poetic [[cosmogony]]. For that reason, writer and critic, David Kecman, described him as a ''cosmosophist.''<ref>Kecman, David Dako (March 15, 2001). "Znakovi smisla," [[Borba (newspaper)|''Borba'']], Beograd</ref>

In his poems, he covers the smallest and the largest topics with equal attention, often juxtaposing them to the level of paradox and absurdity, gradually building new perspectives and meanings that are not only poetic either in origin or in purpose. Some themes and preoccupations, be they stones or galaxies, are present in all of his books and it can be said that his poetry books are, in themselves, long poems and that all of them serve as ingredients of a hyper-poetry book that is still in the making.

He used many poetic forms never used before in Serbian poetry and also created some new forms. "If elegance is represented by simplicity, then these are some of the most elegant verses imaginable,"<ref>Mikasinovich, Branko ( Spring 2000). ''[[World Literature Today]],'' (Abb: WLT), A Literary Quarterly of the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Oklahoma]], Volume 74, Number 2, Page 442</ref> [[Branko Mikasinovich]] stated.

== Published works ==
The majority of Stojanović's poems, initially written in Serbian and compiled into six volumes of poetry, have been translated into English <ref>''Circling: 1978-1987,'' 56 poems, six sequences: "Recircling," "Light Bugs," "A Conversation with Atoms," "A Grain," "A Warden with No Keys," "Darkness is Waiting."</ref><ref>''The Sun Watches the Sun,'' 118 poems, eleven sequences: "Sky-Motion," "God and Circles," "Skywalking," "Forgotten Place," "A Stone and a Word," "What After," "A Game," "Is It Possible to Write a Poem," "Hopelessness," "Sound of the Silence," "Beethoven and Death."</ref><ref>''The Sign and Its Children,'' 43 poems, five sequences: "The Supreme Sign," "The Sign and Nothing," Sign Face," "A Word and a Sign," "The Sign and the Dream."</ref><ref>''The Shape,'' 46 poems, six sequences: "Home of the Shape," "Happiness of Atoms," "Bells," "Pit of the Stone," "Wonders," "Big Chamber."</ref><ref>''The Creator,'' 63 poems, nine sequences: "The Light-Bearer," "Forest of the Universe," "A Talk of Fire," "The Whisper of Eternity," "A Smiling Sky," "Thought and Flight," "Same and Change," "The Dream Chamber," "Nostalgic Elements."</ref> and a selection of his poems has been translated into French.<ref name=archive>{{cite web|author=Stojanović, Dejan.
