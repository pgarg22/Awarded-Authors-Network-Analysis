'''Sir Terence Mervyn Rattigan''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=small|CBE}} (10 June 1911{{spaced ndash}}30 November 1977) was a British [[dramatist]] and screenwriter. His plays are typically set in an upper-middle-class background.<ref name=wansell>Geoffrey Wansell. ''Terence Rattigan'' (London: Fourth Estate, 1995). {{ISBN|978-1-85702-201-8}}</ref> He wrote ''[[The Winslow Boy]]'' (1946), ''[[The Browning Version (play)|The Browning Version]]'' (1948), ''[[The Deep Blue Sea (play)|The Deep Blue Sea]]'' (1952) and ''[[Separate Tables]]'' (1954), among many others.

A troubled homosexual who saw himself as an outsider, Rattigan wrote a number of plays which centred on issues of sexual frustration, failed relationships, or a world of repression and reticence.<ref>The Rattigan Enigma, by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], BBC TV [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEzTlqZn4A8] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012tnt0 the Rattigan enigma]</ref>

==Early life==
Terence Rattigan was born in 1911 in [[South Kensington]],<ref name=wansell13>Wansell, p. 13.</ref> London, of [[Irish Protestant]] extraction.<ref>[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=3715 ''Sir Terence Rattigan'' profile] Pollard, Wendy. ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. 24 May 2005. Retrieved 11 March 2009.</ref> He had an elder brother, Brian. They were the grandsons of Sir [[William Henry Rattigan]], an India-based jurist, and later a Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament for [[North-East Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North-East Lanarkshire]]. His father was Frank Rattigan [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], a diplomat whose exploits included an affair with Princess [[Elisabeth of Romania]] (future consort of King [[George II of Greece]]) which resulted in her having an abortion.<ref name=wansell/> The Royal House of Romania is considered to be the inspiration of Rattigan's play ''[[The Sleeping Prince (play)|The Sleeping Prince]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natura2000oltenita-chiciu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vladimir-Toncea-Carpathia-from-fictional-country-to-nature-conservation.pdf |title=Carpathia-from Fictional Country to Nature Conservation |publisher=www.natura2000oltenita-chiciu.ro |date= |accessdate=2021-06-30}}</ref>

Rattigan's birth certificate and his birth announcement in ''[[The Times]]'' indicate he was born on 9 June 1911. However, most reference books state that he was born the following day; Rattigan himself never publicly disputed this date. There is evidence suggesting that the date on the birth certificate is incorrect.<ref name=wansell13/> He was given no middle name, but he adopted the middle name "Mervyn" in early adulthood.

==Education==
Rattigan was educated at [[Sandroyd School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandroyd.org/content/view/186/79/|title=Sandroyd School's list of Distinguished Alumni|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028031532/http://www.sandroyd.org/content/view/186/79/|archive-date=28 October 2010}}</ref> from 1920 to 1925, at the time based in [[Cobham, Surrey]] (and now the home of [[Reed's School]]), and [[Harrow School]]. Rattigan played cricket for the Harrow First XI and scored 29 in the [[Eton v Harrow|Eton–Harrow match]] in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/431/431466/431466.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|website=cricketarchive.com}}</ref> He was a member of the Harrow School [[Officer Training Corps]] and organised a mutiny, informing the ''[[Daily Express]]''. Even more annoying to his headmaster, [[Cyril Norwood]], was the telegram from the Eton OTC, "offering to march to his assistance".<ref name="Footprintsin">John Colville, ''Footprints in Time'', 1976. Chapter 8, Two Faces.</ref> He then went to [[Trinity College, Oxford]].

==Life and career==
Success as a playwright came early, with the comedy ''[[French Without Tears (play)|French Without Tears]]'' in 1936, set in a [[Cram school|crammer]]. This was inspired by a 1933 visit to a village called [[Marxzell]] in the [[Black Forest]], where young English gentlemen went to learn German; his time briefly overlapped with his Harrow classmate [[Jock Colville]].<ref name="Footprintsin"/>

Rattigan's determination to write a more serious play produced ''[[After the Dance (play)|After the Dance]]'' (1939), a satirical social drama about the "[[bright young things]]" and their failure to politically engage. The outbreak of the Second World War scuppered any chances of a long run. Shortly before the war, Rattigan had written (together with Anthony Goldsmith) a satire about Nazi Germany, ''Follow My Leader''; the [[Lord Chamberlain]] refused to license it on grounds of offence to a foreign country, but it was performed from January 1940.<ref>"A Topical Comedy", ''The Times'', 15 January 1940, p. 4.</ref>

During the war, Rattigan served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a tail gunner; his experiences helped inspire ''[[Flare Path]]''. In 1943 Rattigan, then an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Flight Lieutenant, was posted to the [[RAF Film Production Unit]] to work on ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'' (a substantial reworking and adaption for film of ''[[Flare Path]]'') and ''[[Journey Together]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theterencerattigansociety.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rattigan-Service-Record.pdf|title=Looking for Flying Officer Rattigan, Group Captain Clive Montellier RAF, 2013|website=The Terence Rattigan Society|access-date=3 November 2021}}</ref>

After the war, Rattigan alternated between comedies and dramas, establishing himself as a major playwright: the most successful of which were ''[[The Winslow Boy]]'' (1946), ''[[The Browning Version (play)|The Browning Version]]'' (1948), ''[[The Deep Blue Sea (play)|The Deep Blue Sea]]'' (1952), and ''[[Separate Tables]]'' (1954).

Rattigan's belief in understated emotions and craftsmanship was deemed old fashioned after the overnight success in 1956 of [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' began the era of [[kitchen sink drama]]s by the writers known as the [[Angry Young Men]]. Rattigan responded to this critical disfavour with some bitterness. His plays ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'', ''[[Man and Boy (play)|Man and Boy]]'', ''[[In Praise of Love (play)|In Praise of Love]]'', and ''[[Cause Célèbre (play)|Cause Célèbre]]'', however show no sign of any decline in his talent. Rattigan explained that he wrote his plays to please a symbolic playgoer, "Aunt Edna", someone from the well-off middle-class who had conventional tastes; his critics frequently used this character as the basis for belittling him.<ref>"Sir Terence Rattigan", ''The Times'', 1 December 1977, p. 16.</ref> "Aunt Edna" inspired [[Joe Orton]] to create "Edna Welthorpe", a mischievous [[alter ego]] stirring up controversy about his own plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ednawelthorpe.le.ac.uk/|title=Edna Welthorpe (Mrs) - A Tribute to Joe Orton|website=Edna Welthorpe (Mrs)}}</ref>

Rattigan was gay,<ref name=onstage>{{Cite book|title=Out on Stage: Lesbian and Gay Theatre in the Twentieth Century|first=Alan|last=Sinfield|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-300-08102-2|page=159}}</ref> with numerous lovers but no long-term partners, a possible exception being his "congenial companion ... and occasional friend" Michael Franklin.<ref>Darlow, Michael: ''Terence Rattigan—The Man and His Work'', London: Quartet Books, 2010, p. 440.</ref>

It has been claimed his work is essentially autobiographical, containing coded references to his sexuality, which he kept secret from all but his closest friends. There is some truth in this, but it risks being crudely reductive; for example, the repeated claim that Rattigan originally wrote ''The Deep Blue Sea'' as a play about male lovers, turned at the last minute into a heterosexual play, is unfounded,<ref>B.A. Young mentions a "Kenneth Morgan version" of the play that was supposedly shown to Rattigan collaborator Alvin Rakoff in 1962 and that has since disappeared (Young, B.A.: ''The Rattigan Version'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1986, p. 110). Darlow also speculates on the possible existence of such a draft (Darlow, Michael:'' Terence Rattigan – The Man and His Work'', London: Quartet Books, 2010, p. 440).<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> though Rattigan said otherwise.<ref>Rattigan's letter to John Osborne, 1968 cited in John Osborne ''Looking Back'', London: Faber, 1999, p. 286 (originally published in ''Almost a Gentleman'', Faber, 1991).</ref> On the other hand, for the Broadway staging of ''Separate Tables'', he wrote an alternative version of the newspaper article in which Major Pollock's indiscretions are revealed to his fellow hotel guests; in this version, those whom the Major approached for sex were men rather than young women. However, Rattigan changed his mind about staging it, and the original version proceeded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3651526/On-the-road-Separate-Tables-Loves-Labours-Lost-The-School-for-Scandal.html|title=On the road: Separate Tables, Love's Labour's Lost, The School for Scandal|first=Dominic|last=Cavendish|date=9 April 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/london-premiere-for-gay-version-of-rattigans-separate-tables-com-74210|title=London Premiere for Gay Version of Rattigan's Separate Tables - Playbill|website=Playbill|date=23 March 1998}}</ref>

Rattigan was fascinated with the life and character of [[T. E. Lawrence]]. In 1960 he wrote a play called ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'', based on Lawrence's exploits. Preparations were made to film it, and [[Dirk Bogarde]] accepted the role. However, it did not proceed because the [[Rank Organisation]] withdrew its support, not wishing to offend [[David Lean]] and [[Sam Spiegel]], who had started to film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. Bogarde called Rank's decision "my bitterest disappointment". Also in 1960, a musical version of ''French Without Tears'' was staged as ''Joie de Vivre'', with music by [[Robert Stolz]] of ''[[The White Horse Inn|White Horse Inn]]'' fame. It starred [[Donald Sinden]], lasted only four performances, and has never been revived. Rattigan was diagnosed as having [[leukaemia]] in 1962 and recovered two years later, but fell ill again in 1968. He disliked the so-called [[Swinging London]] of the 1960s and moved abroad, living in [[Bermuda]], where he lived off the proceeds from lucrative screenplays including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' and ''[[The Yellow Rolls-Royce]]''. For a time he was the highest-paid screenwriter in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/21/deep-blue-sea-terence-rattigan|title=Film of The Deep Blue Sea returns playwright Terence Rattigan to the spotlight|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|date=20 August 2011|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In 1964, Rattigan wrote to the playwright [[Joe Orton]] congratulating him on the outrageous comedy ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]'', to which Rattigan had escorted [[Vivien Leigh]] in its first week. He invested £3,000 in getting the play transferred to the West End. Although an unlikely champion of the ''risqué'' Orton, Rattigan recognised the younger man's talent and approved of what he considered a very well written piece of theatre. He also acknowledged in retrospect that, "in a way, I was not Orton's best sponsor. I'm a very unfashionable figure still, and I was then wildly unfashionable critically. My sponsorship rather put critics off, I think."<ref>Lahr, John (1978)''Prick Up Your Ears; The Biography of Joe Orton''. New York: Knopf.<!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>

Rattigan was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 for services to the theatre, being only the fourth playwright to be knighted in the 20th century (after Sir [[W. S. Gilbert]] in 1907, Sir [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] in 1909 and Sir [[Noël Coward]] in 1970).<ref>Wansell, p. 364.</ref> He had previously been appointed Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE), in June 1958. He moved back to Britain, where he experienced a minor revival in his reputation before his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/477156/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Rattigan, Terence (1911-1977) Biography|website=screenonline.org.uk}}</ref>

==Death==
Rattigan died in [[Hamilton, Bermuda]], from [[bone cancer]] in 1977, aged 66. His cremated remains were deposited in the family vault at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

==Legacy==
In 1990, the [[British Library]] acquired Rattigan's papers consisting of 300 volumes of correspondence and papers relating to his prose and dramatic works.<ref>[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-001968471 Rattigan Papers], archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library.

There was a revival of ''The Deep Blue Sea'' in 1993, at the [[Almeida Theatre]], London, directed by [[Karel Reisz]] and starring [[Penelope Wilton]]. A string of successful revivals followed, including ''The Winslow Boy'' at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] in 2001 (with [[David Rintoul]], and subsequently on tour in 2002 with [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]]), ''Man and Boy'' at the [[Duchess Theatre]], London, in 2005, with [[David Suchet]] as [[Gregor Antonescu]], and ''In Praise of Love'' at Chichester, and ''Separate Tables'' at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester]], in 2006. His play on the last days of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], ''[[A Bequest to the Nation]]'', was revived on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] for [[Trafalgar 200]], starring [[Janet McTeer]] as Lady Hamilton, [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Nelson, and [[Amanda Root]] as Lady Nelson.

[[Thea Sharrock]] directed his rarely seen ''After the Dance'' in the summer of 2010 at London's [[Royal National Theatre]]. She directed a major new production of Rattigan's final and also rarely seen play ''Cause Célèbre'' at [[The Old Vic]] in March 2011 as part of The Terence Rattigan Centenary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terencerattigan.co.uk|title=terencerattigan|website=terencerattigan}}</ref> year celebrations. As well as this, [[Trevor Nunn]] marked the occasion with a West End revival of ''[[Flare Path]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Haymarket]], between March and June 2011, starring [[Sienna Miller]], [[James Purefoy]] and [[Sheridan Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trh.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/trevor-nunn-season/|title=Trevor Nunn Season 2011 – 2012|website=Theatre Royal Haymarket}}</ref>

A new screen version of ''[[The Deep Blue Sea (2011 film)|The Deep Blue Sea]]'', directed by [[Terence Davies]], was released in 2011, starring [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Tom Hiddleston]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Deep Blue Sea: In Cinemas Now|url=http://www.film4.com/minisite/the-deep-blue-sea|publisher=[[Film4]]|access-date=27 November 2011}}</ref>
