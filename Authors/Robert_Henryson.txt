'''Robert Henryson''' ([[Middle Scots]]: '''Robert Henrysoun''') was a poet who flourished in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] in the period c. 1460–1500. Counted among the [[Scots language|Scots]] ''[[makar]]s'', he lived in the [[royal burgh]] of [[Dunfermline]] and is a distinctive voice in the [[Northern Renaissance]] at a time when the culture was on a cusp between [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and renaissance sensibilities. Little is known of his life, but evidence suggests that he was a teacher who had training in law and the [[Liberal arts|humanities]], that he had a connection with [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and that he may also have been associated for a period with [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]]. His poetry was composed in [[Middle Scots]] at a time when this was the [[state language]]. His writing consists mainly of [[narrative poetry|narrative works]]. His surviving body of work amounts to almost 5000 lines.

==Works==

Henryson's surviving canon consists of three [[long poem]]s and around twelve miscellaneous short works in various genres. The longest poem is his ''[[The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian|Morall Fabillis]],'' a tight, intricately structured set of thirteen fable stories in a [[Sequence (poetry)|cycle]] that runs just short of 3000 lines. Two other long works survive, both a little over 600 lines each. One is ''[[The Tale of Orpheus and Erudices his Quene]],'' his dynamic and inventive version of the [[Orpheus]] story. The other is his ''[[Testament of Cresseid]]'', is a tale of moral and psychological subtlety in a tragic mode founded upon the literary [[conceit]] of "completing" Criseyde's story-arc from [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s Troilus and Criseyde. Emily Wingfield has explored its significance in relation to the deployment of the Trojan Legend in political discourse between England and Scotland.<ref>Wingfield, Emily (2014), ''The Trojan Legend in Medieval Scottish Literature'', D.S. Brewer, Cambridge, {{isbn|978-1-84384-364-1}}, pp. 121 - 149.</ref>

The range of Henryson's shorter works includes ''[[Robene and Makyne]],'' a [[pastourelle]] on a theme of love, as well as a bawdy passage of comic [[flyting]] which targets the medical practises of his day, a highly crafted and compressed poem of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]] devotion, some allegorical works, some philosophical meditations, and a prayer against the [[Bubonic plague|pest]]. As with his longer works, his outward themes often carry important [[subtext]]s.{{fact|date=December 2020}} 

Constructing a sure chronology for Henryson's writings is not possible, but his Orpheus story may have been written earlier in his career, during his time in [[History of Glasgow|Glasgow]], since one of its principal sources was contained in the university library. Internal evidence has been used to suggest that the ''Morall Fabillis'' were composed during the 1480s.{{fact|date=December 2020}}

==Biographical inferences==

[[Image:Louvain Library WWI.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Leuven's University Library in 1915, illustrating just one of the ways in which historical records can be lost.]]

There is no record of when or where Henryson was born or educated. The earliest found unconfirmed reference to him occurs on 10 September 1462, when a man of his name with license to teach is on record as having taken a post in the recently founded [[Glasgow University|University of Glasgow]]. If this was the poet, as is usually assumed, then the citation indicates that he had completed studies in both [[arts]] and [[canon law]].<ref>The University of Glasgow, ''Munimenta,'' II, 69, dated 10 September 1462, admits a Robert Henryson, [[licenciate]] in Arts and [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] of Decreits (Canon Law), as a member of the University. It is considered strongly likely, from secondary evidence, that this was the poet.</ref>

Almost all early references to Henryson firmly associate his name with Dunfermline.<ref>These are all posthumous references, such as on the title pages of the early printed editions of his work that started to appear after his lifetime.</ref> He probably had some attachment to the city's [[Benedictine]] abbey,{{fact|date=December 2020}} the burial place for many of the kingdom's [[List of Scottish monarchs|monarchs]] and an important centre for [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] close to a major ferry-crossing ''en route'' to [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrews]]. Direct unconfirmed evidence for this connection occurs in 1478 when his name appears as a witness on abbey charters.<ref>The dates are 18 and 19 March and 6 July 1478 and the signature is ''Magistro Roberto Henrison publico notario.'' See [[Matthew McDiarmid|McDiarmid, M.P.]] 1981: ''Robert Henryson,'' Scottish Academic Press, p.3.</ref> If this was the poet, then it would establish that one of his functions was as [[Notary Public#Scotland|notary]] for the abbey, an institution which possessed and managed a vast portfolio of territory across Scotland.<ref>The scholar John MacQueen contextualises this record of the poet as a notary in Scotland against the Act of 1469 which gave James III power to appoint [[notaries public]] over and above the rights of the Pope and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the consequent expulsion of notaries appointed by the Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] of Germany. [[John MacQueen|MacQueen, J.]] 2006: ''Complete and Full with Numbers: the Narrative Poetry of Robert Henryson,'' Rodopi, Amsterdam, pp.10 and 12.</ref> 

The almost universal references to Henryson as schoolmaster are usually taken to mean that he taught in and had some duty to run the [[History of education in Scotland|grammar school]] for Dunfermline's [[Territorial abbacy|abbatial burgh]].<ref>The title page of the 1570 edition of Henryson's Fables, for instance, refers to the poet as "scholemaister of Dunfermeling".</ref> A partial picture of what this meant in practice may be derived from a ''confirmatio'' of 1468 which granted provision to build a "suitable" house for the habitation of a "[[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]" (as master of grammar) and "scholars" in Dunfermline, including "poor scholars being taught free of charge".<ref>''Confirmatio,'' dated 26 November 1468. Published in Kirk, J. ed. 1997: ''Calendar of Scottish Supplications to Rome: 1447–1471,'' Scottish Academic Press. p.396.</ref> 

[[File:Abbot House Window, Dunfermline, depicting Robert Henryson Poem.JPG|100px|right|thumb|Abbot House Window, Dunfermline, depicting Henryson's ''Lion and the Mouse''.]]

Dunfermline, as a [[royal burgh]] with capital status, was routinely visited by the court with [[Dunfermline Palace|residences]] directly linked to the abbey complex. There is no record of Henryson as a court poet, but the close proximity makes acquaintance with the royal household likely.{{fact|date=December 2020}} He was active during the reigns of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], both of whom had strong interests in literature. 

According to the poet [[William Dunbar]], Henryson died in Dunfermline. An [[apocryphal]] story by the English poet [[Francis Kynaston]] in the early 17th century refers to the [[dysentery|flux]] as the cause of death, but this has not been established.<ref>See [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/henryint.htm Robert L Kindrick, Introduction] which quotes Kynaston's general thoughts on Henryson and the "merry, though somewhat unsauory tale".</ref> The year of death also is unknown, although c.1498-9, a time of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in the burgh, has been tentatively suggested.<ref>See McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: ''Robert Henryson,'' Scottish Academic Press, p.12</ref> However, Dunbar gives the [[terminus ad quem]] in a couplet (usually considered to have been composed [[Wiktionary:circa|c.]]1505) which simply states that Death ''in Dunfermelyne 

:''...hes done roune'' (has whispered in private)
:''with [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Maister]] Robert Henrysoun''.
(William Dunbar, ''[[Lament for the Makaris]]'', lines 81–2)<ref>The title ''maister'' is a further indication that the poet was indeed the university-educated Henryson associated with Glasgow University.</ref>

Almost nothing else is known of Henryson outside of his surviving writing. It is not known if he originated from Dunfermline and a suggestion that he may have been linked to the [[Fife]] branch of the [[Clan Henderson]] is not possible to verify,<ref>Laing, David (1865) ''[[iarchive:poemsfablesofrob00henr|The Poems and Fables of Robert Henryson]]''  pp. x-xii.</ref> although his name is certainly [[of that ilk]].

==General style==

Henryson generally wrote in a [[First-person narrative|first-person]] voice using a familiar tone that quickly brings the reader into his confidence and gives a notable impression of authentic [[personality psychology#Philosophical assumptions|personality]] and [[beliefs]].{{fact|date=December 2020}} The writing stays rooted in daily life and continues to feel grounded even when the themes are [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] or elements are fantastic. His language is a supple, flowing and concise [[Middle Scots|Scots]] that clearly shows he knew [[Latin]],{{fact|date=December 2020}} while scenes are usually given a deftly evocative Scottish setting which can only have come from close connection and observation.<ref>See [[Kurt Wittig|Wittig, K.]] 1958: ''The Scottish Tradition in Literature,'' Oliver and Boyd, chapter 2, for appraisals of Henryson's descriptive technique.</ref> This detailed, intimate and realistic approach, at times, strongly suggests matters of personal experience and attitudes to actual contemporary events, yet the specifics remain elusive in ways that tantalise readers and critics. Some of this sense of intrigue may be in part accidental, but it is also heightened by his cannily controlled application of a philosophy of fiction, a frequently self-proclaimed feature of the work.<ref>"Certainly the present writer would like to know more about Robert Henryson as he lived outside his verse than about any other Scots poet."  (McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: ''Robert Henryson,'' Scottish Academic Press, p.1.) McDiarmid's first chapter goes on to develop a surprisingly full speculative picture of the poet's life gleaned from evidence in his poetry, secondary historical evidence for the period and the surviving citations of his name in an extremely broken record.</ref> 

No concrete details of his life can be directly inferred from his works, but there are some passages of [[Human self-reflection|self-reflection]] that appear to contain autobiographical implications, particularly in the opening stanzas of his ''Testament of Cresseid''.{{fact|date=December 2020}}

==Henryson's Scots==

Henryson wrote using the [[Middle Scots|Scots language]] of the 15th century. This was in an age when the use of [[vernacular]] languages for literature in many parts of Europe was increasingly taking the place of [[Latin]], the long-established [[lingua franca]] across the continent.{{fact|date=December 2020}}

==Extant poems==

All known and extant writings attributed to Robert Henryson are listed here. In addition, the scholar [[Matthew McDiarmid|Matthew P McDiarmid]] identified from an index a lost poem by Henryson which began: ''On fut by Forth as I couth found'' (not listed below).<ref>McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: ''Robert Henryson,'' Scottish Academic Press, p.4</ref>
