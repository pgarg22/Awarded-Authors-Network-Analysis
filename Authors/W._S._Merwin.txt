'''William Stanley Merwin''' (September 30, 1927 – March 15, 2019) was an American poet who wrote more than fifty books of poetry and [[prose]], and produced many works in [[translation]].<ref name=Authorship>{{cite web |title=Amazon.com Official Profile |url=https://www.amazon.com/W.-S.-Merwin/e/B000APD3S6/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0 |access-date=October 7, 2012}}</ref> During the 1960s [[Peace movement#The anti-Vietnam War movement: 1962.E2.80.931975|anti-war movement]], Merwin's unique craft was thematically characterized by indirect, unpunctuated narration. In the 1980s and 1990s, his writing influence derived from an interest in [[Buddhist]] philosophy and [[deep ecology]]. Residing in a rural part of [[Maui]], Hawaii, he wrote prolifically and was dedicated to the restoration of the island's [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests|rainforests]].

Merwin received many honors, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1971 and 2009;<ref name=pulitzer/> the [[National Book Award for Poetry]] in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-2005|title=2005 National Book Awards Winners and Finalists, The National Book Foundation|website=Nationalbook.org|access-date=January 21, 2018}}</ref> and the Tanning Prize—one of the highest honors bestowed by the [[Academy of American Poets]]—as well as the Golden Wreath of the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]]. In 2010, the [[Library of Congress]] named him the 17th [[United States Poet Laureate]].<ref name=Laureate1>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/30/AR2010063005450.html |last=Kennicott |first=Philip |title=W.

==Early life==
[[File:2.9.11WSMerwinWayByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|Merwin grew up on this street in [[Union City, New Jersey]], which was renamed for him in 2006.]]
W. S. Merwin was born in New York City on September 30, 1927. He grew up on the corner of Fourth Street and New York Avenue in [[Union City, New Jersey]], and lived there until 1936, when his family moved to [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. As a child, Merwin was enamored of the natural world, sometimes finding himself talking to the large tree in his back yard. He was also fascinated with things that he saw as links to the past, such as the building behind his home that had once been a barn which housed<!-- "had (once) housed"? --> a horse and carriage.<ref name=UCReporter>Diaz, Lana Rose. "Merwin Speaks"; ''[[The Union City Reporter]]'', July 11, 2010, pages 1 & 9.</ref> At the age of five he started writing hymns for his father,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/merwin/life.htm|title=About W.

==Career==
===Early career: 1952–1976===
After attending [[Princeton University]] in 1952, Merwin married Dorothy Jeanne Ferry, and moved to Spain. During his stay there, while visiting the renowned poet [[Robert Graves]] at his homestead on the island of [[Majorca]], he served as tutor to Graves's son. There, he met Dido Milroy, fifteen years his senior, with whom he collaborated on a play and whom he later married and lived with in London. In 1956, Merwin moved to [[Boston]] for a fellowship at the Poets' Theater. He returned to London, where he befriended [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[Ted Hughes]]. In 1968, Merwin moved to New York City, separating from his wife Dido Milroy, who stayed at their home in France. In the late 1970s, Merwin moved to Hawaii and eventually was divorced from Dido Milroy. He married Paula Dunaway in 1983.<ref name=Laureate4>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/04/specials/merwin-own.html |last=Smith |first=Dinitia |title=A Poet of Their Own |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 19, 1995 |access-date=March 30, 2010}}</ref>
<!-- COMMENT OUT TILL SOURCE ADDED --
In 1952 Merwin's first book of poetry, ''A Mask for Janus'', was published in the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition|Yale Younger Poets Series]]. [[W. H. Auden]] selected the work for that distinction. Later, in 1971 Auden and Merwin would exchange harsh words in the pages of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Merwin had published "On Being Awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]]" in the June 3, 1971 issue of ''The New York Review of Books'', outlining his objections to the [[Vietnam War]] and stating that he was donating his prize money to the [[draft resistance]] movement.-->

From 1956 to 1957, Merwin was also playwright-in-residence at the [[Poet's Theatre]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; he became poetry editor at ''[[The Nation]]'' in 1962. Besides being a prolific poet, he was a respected translator of Spanish, French, Latin and Italian literature and poetry (including [[Lazarillo de Tormes]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Purgatorio]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/merwin/interview.htm|title=An Online Interview with W.

He served as selector of poems of the American poet [[Craig Arnold]] (1967–2009).<ref>{{cite web|title=Today's poem is "asunder"|url=http://www.versedaily.org/2009/aboutcraigarnoldc.shtml|website=Verse Daily|access-date=February 17, 2017}}</ref>

Merwin is known for his poetry about the [[Vietnam War]], and can be included among the canon of Vietnam War-era poets which includes writers [[Robert Bly]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Yusef Komunyakaa]].<ref name="mosson">{{cite web|last1=Mosson|first1=Gregg|title=American Poetry: Vietnam and Today|url=http://thepotomacjournal.com/np-GregMosson.htm|website=The Potomac|access-date=February 17, 2017}}</ref>

Merwin's early subjects were frequently tied to mythological or legendary themes, while many of his poems featured animals. A volume called ''The Drunk in the Furnace'' (1960) marked a change for Merwin, in that he began to write in a more autobiographical way.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Michael Wutz, Hal Crimmel|first1=Michael and Hal Crimmel|title=Conversations with W. S. Merwin|date=2015|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1628462227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iz31CQAAQBAJ&q=w.s.+merwin+drunk+furnace+autobiographical&pg=PT95|access-date=February 17, 2017}}</ref><!-- COMMENT OUT TILL SOURCE ADDED -- The title-poem is about [[Orpheus]], seen as an old drunk. "Where he gets his spirits / it's a mystery", Merwin writes; "But the stuff keeps him musical". Another poem of this period—"Odysseus"—reworks the traditional theme in a way that plays off poems by [[Wallace Stevens]] and Graves on the same topic.-->

In the 1960s, Merwin lived in a small apartment in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name=UCReporter/><!-- COMMENT OUT TILL SOURCE ADDED --, and began to experiment boldly with metrical irregularity. His poems became much less tidy and controlled. He played with the forms of indirect narration typical of this period, a self-conscious experimentation explained in an essay called 'On Open Form' (1969). ''The Lice'' (1967) and ''The Carrier of Ladders'' (1970) remain his most influential volumes. These poems often used legendary subjects (as in 'The Hydra' or 'The Judgment of Paris') to explore highly personal themes.-->

===Later career: 1977–2019===

<!-- COMMENT OUT TILL SOURCE ADDED --In Merwin's later volumes—such as ''The Compass Flower'' (1977), ''Opening the Hand'' (1983), and ''The Rain in the Trees'' (1988)—one sees him transforming earlier themes in fresh ways, developing an almost Zen-like indirection. His later poems are densely imagistic, dream-like, and full of praise for the natural world. He has lived in Hawaii since the 1970s. -->Merwin's volume ''Migration: New and Selected Poems'' won the 2005 National Book Award for poetry.<ref name=nba2005/><!-- COMMENT OUT TILL SOURCE ADDED -- A lifelong friend of [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], Merwin wrote an elegy to him that appears in the 2008 volume ''From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright''.-->

In 1998, Merwin wrote ''Folding Cliffs:  A Narrative'', an ambitious novel-in-verse about [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] in history and legend.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Michael|title=Hawaii's History, By Chapter and Verse|url=http://www.michaeljkramer.net/pdfs/NewsdayMerwinRev.pdf|access-date=February 17, 2017|work=Newsday|date=October 8, 1998}}</ref>

''[[The Shadow of Sirius]]'', published in 2008 by [[Copper Canyon Press]], was awarded the 2009 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry.<ref name=pulitzer/>

In June 2010, the [[Library of Congress]] named Merwin the seventeenth [[United States Poet Laureate]] to replace the outgoing [[Kay Ryan]].<ref name=Laureate1/><ref name=Laureate2/> He is the subject of the 2014 documentary film ''[[Even Though the Whole World Is Burning]]''. Merwin appeared in the PBS documentary ''[[The Buddha (2010 film)|The Buddha]]'', released in 2010. He had moved to Hawaii to study with the Zen Buddhist master [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thebuddha/featured-scholars-and-poets/|title=Featured Scholars and Poets – The Buddha |website=Pbs.org|access-date=January 21, 2018}}</ref>

In 2010, with his wife Paula, he co-founded The Merwin Conservancy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving his hand-built, off-the-grid poet's home and 18-acre restored property in Haiku, [[Maui]], which has been transformed from an "agricultural wasteland" to a "Noah's Ark" for rare palm trees, one of the largest and most biodiverse collections of palms in the world.<ref name="The Merwin Conservancy">{{cite web |title=The Merwin Conservancy |url=http://www.merwinconservancy.org |website=The Merwin Conservancy |access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref>

Merwin's last book of poetry, ''Garden Time'' (Copper Canyon Press, 2016), was composed during the difficult process of losing his eyesight. When he could no longer see well enough to write, he dictated poems to his wife, Paula. It is a book about aging and the practice of living one's life in the present. Writing about ''Garden Time'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Jeff Gordinier suggests that "Merwin's work feels like part of some timeless continuum, a river that stretches all the way back to [[Hanshan (poet)|Han Shan]] and [[Li Po]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/books/w-s-merwin-garden-time-adam-fitzgerald-george-washington.html|title=Memories Distilled by 2 Radically Different Poets|first=Jeff|last=Gordinier|date=September 19, 2016|access-date=January 21, 2018|website=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Copper Canyon Press]] published ''The Essential W. S. Merwin'', a book which traces the seven decade legacy of Merwin's poetry, with selections ranging from his 1952 debut, ''A Mask for Janus'', to 2016's ''Garden Time'', as well as a selection of translations and lesser known prose narratives. Merwin's literary papers are held at the [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign)|Rare Book & Manuscript Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. The collection consists of some 5,500 archival items, and 450 printed books.<ref>{{cite document|title=Finding Aid for the W. S.
