'''Antoni Lange''' (1863 – 17 March 1929) was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, philosopher, [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] (15 languages), writer, novelist, science-writer, [[reporter]] and [[translation|translator]]. A representative of Polish [[Parnassianism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], he is also regarded as belonging to the [[Decadent movement]]. He was an expert on [[Romanticism]], [[French literature]] and a popularizer of Eastern cultures.
His most popular novel is ''[[Miranda (novel)|Miranda]]''.

He translated English, French, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, Spanish, Indian, [[American English|American]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Egyptian and Oriental writers into [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Polish literature|Polish poets]] into French and English. He was also one of the most original poets of the [[Young Poland]] movement. His work is often compared to [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]<ref>A. Hutnikiewicz, Młoda Polska, Warszawa 2004, p. 316</ref> and [[Charles Marie René Leconte de Lisle]].

Lange was an uncle of the poet [[Bolesław Leśmian]].

==Life==
Lange was born in Warsaw into the patriotic Jewish family of Henryk Lange (1815–1884) and Zofia ''[[née]]'' Eisenbaum (1832–1897).<ref name="mieszczak"/> His father took part in the [[November Uprising]] against the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland. He was an admirerer of [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic literature]] and its ideals.<ref name="mieszczak"/> Antoni Lange enrolled at [[Warsaw University]] but around 1880 he was expelled for his patriotic activity by the Tsarist [[namiestnik]] Apuchtin who ruled the university at that time.<ref name="mieszczak"/> He supported himself financially as a tutor but also published poetry under the pen-names Napierski and Antoni Wrzesień.<ref name="mieszczak"/> He decided to study in Paris where he encountered new trends in literature, philosophy and art. In France he became familiar with the theories of [[Jean Martin Charcot]], as well as [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], [[parapsychology]], the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], oriental religions, European and Eastern literature and modern [[literary criticism]]. He took part in the literary meetings of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].<ref name="mieszczak"/>

Lange returned to his homeland upon [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's return to independence]],<ref name="mieszczak"/> and became one of the better known members of the Warsaw Society of Writers and Journalists ({{Lang|pl|Warszawskie Towarzystwo Literatów i Dziennikarzy}}), the precursor of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] founded in 1933.<ref name="mieszczak"/> [[Bolesław Prus]], [[Julian Ochorowicz]] and Lange were the first Polish [[spiritist]]s. He rented an [[apartment]] at [[Nowy Świat Street]] together with [[Władysław Reymont]], a Polish writer and the winner of the Nobel Prize of 1924.<ref name="nobelprize-1">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1924/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1924.

The main theme of the poems of this period was the feeling of being isolated and misunderstood by the crowd.

|-
|}

At the beginning of the 20th century he withdrew from public life and became lonely and forgotten. He collected his last poems in notebooks and never allowed anyone to publish them.<ref>The poems were published posthumously in 1931 in the appendix to Lange's play ''[[Malczewski]]''</ref>

Lange's prestige as a writer was undermined by a new generation of [[avant-garde|avant-gardists]]. He died in isolation, destitution and obscurity in [[Warsaw]] in 1929.  He never married and had no children.

Antoni Lange was a friend of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Jan Kasprowicz]] and [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]].

There are only two portraits of Lange, one of them was painted by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]] in 1890.

==Writing==
[[Image:Władysław Podkowiński, Ulica Nowy Świat w Warszawie w dzień letni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Władysław Podkowiński]], {{Lang|pl|Nowy Świat}} ''Street in Warsaw on a summer’s day'' (1900), where Lange lived]]
Lange was a prolific and versatile writer. He wrote many novels (''[[Miranda (novel)|Miranda]]''), [[short story|short stories]] ({{Lang|pl|Zbrodnia, Amor i Faun}}), dramas ({{Lang|pl|Malczewski, Wenedzi}}), essays and poems. Lange's poetry is contemplative and erudite. It connects the traditions of European culture with [[Buddhism]]. The overriding theme of Lange's [[Existentialism|existential]] concerns was 'extremity' and the 'cycle' of death. In order to form of the poetry Lange connect to contradictory points of [[impressionism]], [[romantism|romantic]] sentimentality and experimental theories of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. Lange was fond of rare poetic forms: [[acrostic]]s, [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyls]], [[pantoum]]s, [[Prelude (short story)|praeludiums]], [[scherzo]]s, [[canticle]]s and [[triolet]]s. He was also the author of many [[pastoral]]s concerning the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] side of village life; [[Philosophy of history|historiosophical]] songs inspired by the philosophy of [[Juliusz Słowacki]]; and exotic genesis mythologies from all over the world (from Mexico to Japan).

Lange was also the author of many lyrical essays presenting original views about the relationship between poet and reader concerning [[eschatology|eschatological]] issues (''Thoughts'', ''The Grave'').

In the first phase of his writing he was a lover of [[aestheticism]], formal innovation and the theories of Stéphane Mallarmé. However, later he faced to [[primitivism]], anonymity, writings of folk poets and 16th century poets and [[blank verse]].

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:W 4 wymiarze.JPG|left|thumb|Front cover for Lange's "In the Fourth Dimension" (1912)]] -->
Both Lange and [[Jerzy Żuławski]] are often referred to as "The Pioneers of Polish Science-Fiction". Lange's short stories from the book {{Lang|pl|W czwartym wymiarze}} (In the Fourth Dimension, 1912) such as {{Lang|pl|Babunia}} (Grandma), {{Lang|pl|Rozaura, Lenora, Rebus}} (Puzzle), {{Lang|pl|Nowe mieszkanie}} (The New House) and {{Lang|pl|Memoriał doktora Czang-Fu-Li}} (Dr. Chang Fu Li's Report) are regarded as early examples of science fiction and [[weird fiction]] in Poland.<ref>However, ''Wojciech Zdarzyński'' by [[Michał Dymitr Krajewski]] published in 1785 is considered the first Polish science-fiction novel.</ref> The main themes of the stories are: [[hypnosis]], the elixir of youth, eternal love and the [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] of phantoms. On a different note, Dr. Chang Fu Li's eponymous report, "written in Paris in 2652", is concerned with the [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]] brought about by the re-routing of the [[Gulf Stream]] and the subsequent freezing over of Europe, with China taking over as the leading civilization.

Lange's works influenced many poets of the next generation, for example: [[Bolesław Leśmian]], [[Antoni Słonimski]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Julian Przyboś]], [[Jan Lechoń]], [[Leopold Staff]]. Paradoxically, most of these poets criticized Lange for his [[anachronism]], eccentricity and overintellectualism.

Lange was also a left-wing journalist. He wrote for many important Polish newspapers such as {{Lang|pl|Pobudka, Tygodnik Illustrowany}} and {{Lang|pl|Przegląd tygodniowy}}. He created an original way of [[cultural assimilation]] for Jews via mixed marriage.

Lange's numerous translations of classic 19th century literature from all over the world are still highly regarded. His translations of ''The Golem'' by [[Gustav Meyrink]] and poems by [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[George Gordon Byron]] are masterpieces of Polish translation. He also edited many [[anthology|anthologies]] of his own translations of Egyptian, Syrian, Persian, Arabic, Indian and Hebrew poems.

His main sources of inspiration were: the poetry of the [[Three Bards]],; the theories of Stéphane Mallarmé; the writings of [[Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle]]; [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] of ancient India such as ''[[Mahabharata]]'' or ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]''; and the poetry of the Polish [[Baroque]] era, especially [[metaphysical poets]] such as [[Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński]] and [[Józef Baka]] because of their obsession with death.

===''Vita Nova'' and other love poems===
Lange was the author of many love poems influenced by Romanticism, spiritualism and Indian mythology.

'''Where are you, goddess?'''
|-

:{{Lang|pl|Gdzie jesteś, czarodziejko, bogini, królewno,<br>Życiodawczy, uwodny duchu ty krwiożerny,<br>Cudotwórcza, stugłowa, wieczna hydro Lerny,<br>Syreno, co mię nęcisz w Scyllę grobów śpiewną?|italic=no}}

:Life giving, deluding and bloodthirsty phantom.
:Hundred headed thaumaturgus, immortal Hydra of Lerna.

|-
|}

Other love poems by Lange, for example ''Vita Nova'' (A New Life) written in 1898, present an original vision of a decadent and melancholy poet who momentarily becomes an [[Übermensch]] thanks to the illusion of requited love. Unfortunately, there is always a conflict between the vision of ideal love and its realisation. Lange takes also notes the "painful impossibility" of the absolute and eternal union of lovers' souls; he creates a pessimistic vision of the relationship between man and woman, which is always burdened by the certainty that complete fulfilment is impossible.

[[Image:Lady-Lilith.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Lady Lilith'' by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The symbol of [[Lilith]] was frequently used by Lange]]
In Lange's verses love always makes the subject feel as if he has been ''exiled'' from and ''deprived'' of a latent part of his own existence, but simultaneously he believes that lovers can communicate and feel the same by transmitting their pain and the power of their affection in defiance of metaphorical distance.

===''Deuteronomion'', ''The Hour'', ''Logos'' and ''Sonnets of Veda''===
The most characteristic feature of Lange's writings is the strong influence of Eastern traditions, religions and philosophies such as the [[Veda]], [[Brahmin]]ism and [[Buddhism]].

Written in 1887, the cycle of seven [[sonnets]] entitled ''The Sonnets of Veda'' shows the seven stages of human existence<ref>They are: Rupa (the stage of the stone); Jiv-Atma (the stage of the plant); Linga-Sharira (the stage of the stars); Kama-Rupa (Anima bruta); Manas (human spirit); Buddhi (Anima spiritualis); Atma (the Great Soul)</ref> on the way to [[Nirvana]].

Similar in form to the ''Sonnets of Veda'' is the ''Logos'' cycle of ten sonnets which discuss ten points of view on the ''logos'' of history by ten outstanding representatives of the [[historiosophy]] of Polish Romanticism.<ref>There are: [[Józef Hoene-Wroński]], Józef Gołuchowski, [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Andrzej Towiański, [[Juliusz Słowacki]], [[Zygmunt Krasiński]], Henryk Cieszkowski, Bronisław Ferdynand Trentowski, [[Karol Libelt]], [[Józef Kremer]]</ref> The poems are strongly influenced by ideas of [[messianism]].
[[File:Fałat Świteź.jpg|left|thumb|200px|{{Lang|pl|Świteź}} by [[Julian Fałat]]. A lake where Lange wrote many of his poems]]
''The Hour'' written in 1894 was the first prose by Lange, but the short [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] novel was published in 1895 in the first volume of ''Poems''. It is a story of [[Artemis]] and [[Aurora (mythology)|Auora]], the two [[ancient]] [[goddess]]es who descend to [[Earth]] to witness human life. In some ways ''The Hour'' is similar to [[August Strindberg]]'s 1901 drama ''[[A Dream Play]]'' and ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten|The Woman without a Shadow]]'' written by [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] in 1919. The novel contains many mystical fragments stylized as [[religious text|religious writings]], a [[psalms]], a [[manifesto]], [[greek tragedy]] and the [[ode]]. It also connects prose with elements of poetry and drama.

One of the most representative of Lange's works is ''Deuteronomion'', a mystical [[occult]]ic poem written in Paris in 1902. It is hermetic and hard to interpret because of its many allusions to the Bible, [[Kabbalah]], [[Sanscrit]] writings and ancient Slavic myths. It speaks of a Poet's spiritual journey to achieve an initiation that is both personal and universal. It is significant that ''Deuteronomion'' begins with the ''Epilogue to myself'' and ends with the ''Prologue to the unknown god''.

===Narrative poems===
Lange inaugurated a return to [[narrative poetry]], a form which was unprecedented in Polish literature. This form of poetry was mainly used in Romanticism (for example, by [[George Gordon Byron]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]]) and was no longer used after the late 19th century. Therefore, Lange was probably the last and only poet who wrote narrative poems in Poland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} There are:
* ''The Oracle'', a poem based on an Indian legend
* ''Ilya Muromets'', a poem inspired by [[bylina]]
* ''The Vision of Catherine of Alexandria''

Lange wrote also ''A Song of'' {{Lang|pl|Płanetnik}}, a narrative poem referring to the character of {{Lang|pl|Płanetnik|italic=no}}. In [[pagan]] [[Slavic mythology]] a {{Lang|pl|płanetnik}} was a guardian spirit of clouds and a lonely dreamer who predicted the weather. It was thought that {{Lang|pl|płanetniks}} were the lost souls of those who had committed suicide and victims of murder.  One would call them by sprinkling flour into the wind or fire. ''A Song of'' {{Lang|pl|Płanetnik}} by Lange tells the story of a young sensitive man who lost touch with reality and set off on the path of solitary existence.<!-- Is "ain't no" the right translation for this poem? Kind of an odd tone and no Google results for it. I don't know Polish though -->

:ain't the Świteź of the waters

===Philosophy===
In Lange's cosmogony-philosophy, he announced that evolution of the soul is parallel to evolution of a nation. Capitalism is the enemy of this principle because it acts against individualism, so capitalism is the ideology of the anonymous crowd. If there is no individualism among the people, then there is also not a problem of "bad" versus "good". Then the world comes to disturb its own logic. According to Lange, a world that 'was being born' from ideal space, is still coming to the highest stage of evolution; sometime, it will return to its primary stage. Every step to evolution is a step to the ideal primary. An exception of this "rule of time-line" is the person of genius, who is between the times. In Lange's philosophy he referred to [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

Lange was interested in [[spiritualism]] and [[parapsychology]] to contain his own philosophy.

===Critic of Romanticism===
An important part of Lange's writing was the criticism of legacy of [[romanticism]] in modern poetry. In 1924 he founded ''Astrea'', a science-magazine and the first forum about Polish and European romanticism. Lange rejected romantic [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|illumination]]. In his view, theological truth is within the reach only of erudition, intellect and afterthought. Lange criticized also the importance of [[individualism]] and the authorial personality. Placing the poem as an artwork at the center, as an ''[[Theory of forms|eidos]]'' of poetry, he affirmed the ''poem's own existence'' and a ''clear idea of creation;'' therefore he disagreed with the cult of individualism.
