== Life ==
Boris Bugaev was born in [[Moscow]], into a prominent intellectual family.  His father, [[Nikolai Bugaev]], was a noted mathematician<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Pattison|first1=George|title=The Oxford Handbook of Russian Religious Thought|last2=Emerson|first2=Caryl|last3=Poole|first3=Randall A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2020|isbn=978-0-19-879644-2|location=Oxford, UK|pages=294}}</ref> who is regarded as a founder of the Moscow school of mathematics. His mother was not only highly intelligent but a famous society beauty, and the focus of considerable gossip. She was also a pianist, providing Bugaev his musical education at a young age.

Young Boris grew up at the Arbat, a historical area in Moscow.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Matich|first=Olga|title=Erotic Utopia: The Decadent Imagination in Russia's Fin de Siecle|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-299-20883-7|location=Madison|pages=89}}</ref> He was a polymath whose interests included mathematics, biology, chemistry, music, philosophy, and literature.

Bugaev became friendly with [[Alexander Blok]] and his wife; he fell in love with her, which caused tensions between the two poets. During their wedding, Buagev was invited but was unable to attend due to his father's death.<ref name=":0" />

Nikolai Bugaev was well known for his influential philosophical essays, in which he decried [[geometry]] and [[probability]] and trumpeted the virtues of hard [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Despite—or because of—his father's mathematical tastes, Boris Bugaev was fascinated by probability and particularly by [[entropy]], a notion to which he frequently refers in works such as ''Kotik Letaev''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janecek|first1=Gerald|title=The Spiral as Image and Structural Principle in Andrej Belyj's ''Kotik Lataev''|journal=Russian Literature|date=1976|volume=4|issue= 4|pages=357–63|doi=10.1016/0304-3479(76)90010-7}}</ref>

As a young man, Bely was strongly influenced by his acquaintance with the family of philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], especially Vladimir's younger brother Mikhail, described in his long autobiographical poem ''The First Encounter'' (1921); the title is a reflection of Vladimir Solovyov's ''Three Encounters''.  It was Mikhail Solovyov who gave Bugaev his pseudonym Andrei Bely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

[[File:Бакст Леон. Андрей Белый.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Bely by [[Léon Bakst]], 1905]]

In his later years Bely was influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]]’s [[anthroposophy]]<ref>Judith Wermuth-Atkinson, ''The Red Jester: Andrei Bely's Petersburg as a Novel of the European Modern'' (2012). {{ISBN|3643901542}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/be/Bely-And.html Bely, Andrei.

== Major works ==
Bely has started his literary career as the author of ''The Symphonies'', a cycle experimental prose works, written from 1900 to 1908. In 1909 he published a symbolist novel ''[[The Silver Dove]]'', which became his first novel. As critics note, it is notable for its ''[[skaz]]'' techniques and its unique ''ornamental prose'', for its "ability to capture haunting, mesmerizing sense of apocalyptic doom". The novel is the first part of Bely's unfinished trilogy ''East or West''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehaZrlRY_YgC&q=silver+dove&pg=PA743|title = Reference Guide to Russian Literature|isbn = 9781884964107|last1 = Cornwell|first1 = Neil|last2 = Christian|first2 = Nicole|year = 1998}}</ref>

Bely's novel ''[[Petersburg (novel)|Petersburg]]'' (1913/1922), the second part of the unfinished trilogy, is generally considered to be his masterpiece.  The book employs a striking prose method in which sounds often evoke colors. The novel is set in the somewhat hysterical atmosphere of turn-of-the-century Petersburg and the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. To the extent that the book can be said to possess a plot, this can be summarized as the story of the hapless Nikolai Apollonovich, a ne'er-do-well who is caught up in revolutionary politics and assigned the task of assassinating a certain government official—his own father. At one point, Nikolai is pursued through the Petersburg mists by the ringing hooves of the famous bronze statue of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} There are scholars who cite that Petersburg included ideas from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s therapeutic method such as how psychoanalysis was used as his interpretive tool for literary criticism and a source of creativity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Livak|first=Leonid|title=A Reader's Guide to Andrei Bely's "petersburg|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-299-31930-4|location=Madison|pages=111|language=en}}</ref>

After the Revolution, Bely wrote two psychological autobiographical novels, highly influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s antroposophy, ''[[Kotik Letaev]]'' (1918) and ''The Christened Chinaman'' (1921). He also wrote poems ''Glossolalia'' (1917), ''Christ is Risen'' (1918), in which he glorifies the Revolution, and ''The First Encounter'' (1921). His last novel is ''Moscow'' (1926—1932), an attempt to give an image of Russian ''[[intelligentsia]]'' during the [[World War I]] and [[Russian Revolution]]. It differs from ''The Silver Dove'' and ''Petersburg'' with complex, multi-faceted characters who experience a transformation of personality. It also continues Bely's linguistic experiments. The first part of ''Moscow'', ''The Moscow Eccentric'', was published in English in 2016.

Bely's essay ''[[Rhythm as Dialectic in The Bronze Horseman]]'' is cited in [[Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[The Gift (Nabokov novel)|The Gift]]'', where it is mentioned as "monumental research on rhythm".<ref name="NabokovRhythm">Nabokov (1938) ''[[The Gift (Nabokov novel)|The Gift]]'', chapter 3, p. 141.</ref> Fyodor, poet and main character, praises the system Bely created for graphically marking off and calculating the 'half-stresses' in the [[Iamb (foot)|iambs]]. Bely found that the diagrams plotted over the compositions of the great poets frequently had the shapes of rectangles and trapeziums. Fyodor, after discovering Bely's work, re-read all his old [[iambic tetrameter]]s from the new point of view, and was terribly pained to find out that the diagrams for his poems were instead plain and gappy.<ref name="NabokovRhythm"/> Nabokov's essay ''[[Notes on Prosody]]'' follows for the large part Bely's essay ''Description of the Russian iambic tetrameter'' (published in the collection of essays ''Symbolism'', Moscow, 1910).
