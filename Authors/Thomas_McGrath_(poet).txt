'''Thomas Matthew McGrath''', (November 20, 1916 near [[Sheldon, North Dakota]] â€“ September 20, 1990, [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]) was a celebrated American [[poet]] and screenwriter of documentary films.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/literaryhistoryo00west| url-access=registration| page=[https://archive.org/details/literaryhistoryo00west/page/806 806]| quote=Thomas McGrath.| chapter=Thomas McGrath| title=A Literary history of the American West| publisher=TCU Press| year= 1987| isbn= 978-0-87565-021-0 }}</ref><ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8450837.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Sep+22%2C+1990&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=B6&desc=Thomas+McGrath "Thomas McGrath", ''The Washington Post'']</ref>

McGrath grew up on a farm in [[Ransom County, North Dakota]]. He earned a B.A. from the [[University of North Dakota]] at Grand Forks. He served in the Aleutian Islands with the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. He was awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]], at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. McGrath also pursued postgraduate studies at [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge. He taught at [[Colby College]] in Maine and at [[California State University, Los Angeles|Los Angeles State College]], from which he was dismissed in connection with his appearance, as an unfriendly witness, before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1953. Later he taught at [[North Dakota State University]], and [[Minnesota State University, Moorhead]]. McGrath was married three times and had one son, Tomasito, to whom much of the poet's later work was dedicated.

McGrath wrote mainly about his own life and [[social]] concerns. His best-known work, ''Letter to an Imaginary Friend,'' was published in sections between 1957 and 1985 and as a single poem in 1997 by [[Copper Canyon Press]].<ref>http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=4563</ref>

==Reviews==
<blockquote>Best of all, Letter to an Imaginary Friend licks its fingers and burps at the table. Polite it is not--and the better for it when McGrath turns from his populist vitriol to what may be his most abiding talent: that of bestowing praise--grace, even--on the common, the unruly, the inconsolable, those McGrath chose to side and sing with and for whom "the world is too much but not enough with us.<ref>[http://www.raintaxi.com/online/1997winter/mcgrath.shtml ''Rain Taxi'', Josie Rawson Vol. 2 No. 4, Winter 1997/1998 (#8)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127051531/http://raintaxi.com/online/1997winter/mcgrath.shtml |date=2010-11-27 }}</ref></blockquote>
