'''James Crerar Reaney''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC}} (September 1, 1926 &ndash; June 11, 2008) was a [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]], playwright, [[libretto|librettist]], and [[professor]],<ref name="University of Waterloo">[http://www.lib.uwo.ca/ University of Waterloo]</ref> "whose works transform small-town [[Ontario]] life into the realm of dream and symbol."<ref>""[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/493180/James-Crerar-Reaney James Crerar Reaney]," ''Encyclopædia Britannica," Britannica Online, Web, Apr. 11, 2011.</ref> Reaney won [[Canada]]'s highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]], three times and received the Governor General's Award for Poetry or Drama for both his poetry and his drama.

==Life==

Reaney was born on a farm in Easthope near [[Stratford, Ontario]]<ref name=reaney/> to James Nesbitt Reaney and Elizabeth Henrietta Crerar.<ref name=stingle>Richard Stingle, James Reaney and his Works (ECW Press, 1990)</ref> Almost all of Reaney's poems, stories, and plays are articulations of where he grew up.<ref name=stingle/> At a young age he was interested in theatre, and created a puppet show for children while in his early teens.<ref>[http://www.everything2.com/ everything2.com]</ref>

===Poet and story writer===

Reaney studied English at [[University College, University of Toronto]], receiving his M.A. in 1949.<ref name=answers>"[http://www.answers.com/topic/james-reaney James Reaney]," ''Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature,'' Answers.com, Web, Apr. 11, 2001.</ref> The same year he also received the [[Governor General's Award]], the first of three, at the age of 23, for his first book of poetry, ''Red Heart.''.<ref name="CBC News">[http://www.cbc.com/ CBC News]</ref>

Reaney married fellow poet Colleen Thibaudeau on December 29, 1951 in [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]].<ref name=reaney/> He has three children: two sons, James Stewart (born 1952) and John Andrew (1954), born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]<ref name=stingle/> and a daughter, Susan Alice Elizabeth, born 1959 in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].<ref name=stingle/>

After teaching English at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1949 until 1956, Reaney returned to the University of Toronto to complete a doctorate awarded in 1958; [[Northrop Frye]] was his thesis supervisor.<ref name="answers"/> Also in 1958 Reaney released a second book of poetry, ''A Suit of Nettles'', which again won the Governor-General's Award.<ref name=ross>Catherine Ross, "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0006706 Reaney, James Crerar]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton:Hurtig, 1988), 1831.</ref>

During the 1940s and 1950s Reaney also wrote and published short stories. While not published in book form until years later, his stories were influential in establishing the style of writing later called [[Southern Ontario Gothic]]<ref name=answers/> (later made world-famous by [[Alice Munro]]).

In 1960 Reaney began teaching in the [[University of Western Ontario]]'s English Department.<ref name=ross/> Also in 1960 he put out the first issue of his journal,''Alphabet: A Semi-Annual Devoted to the Iconography of the Imagination,''<ref name=answers/> which he would edit until 1971.  This journal published a variety of poets, including [[Jay Macpherson]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Al Purdy]], [[Milton Acorn]],<ref name=reaney/> and [[bp Nichol]], and work from such artists as [[Tony Urquhart]], and [[Greg Curnoe]].<ref name="University of Waterloo"/>

===Playwright===

For Reaney, the new decade also coincided with "a shift of emphasis from poetry to the public and communal form of drama," starting with  ''The Killdeer''.<ref name=ross/> "Though he had been interested in drama since childhood, he was encouraged by a friend to write a piece for the University of Toronto's Alumnae Theatre and the work he created, ''The Killdeer'', launched his drama career (and won a prize in the [[Dominion Drama Festival]])."<ref name=theatre>"[http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Reaney%2C%20James Reaney, James]," ''Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia'', CanadianTheatre.com, Web, Apr. 11, 2011,</ref> In [[1962 Governor General's Awards|1962]] he won the Governor General's Award for Poetry or Drama a third time, this time for both his newest book of poetry, ''Twelve Letters to a Small Town,'' and his first book of plays, ''The Killdeer and Other Plays''.<ref name=ross/>

Reaney "followed up ''The Killdeer'' with ''[[Colours in the Dark]]'' (1969), ''Listen to the Wind'' (1972), ''Masks of Childhood'' (1972) and plays for children."<ref name=ross/> His play ''Colours in the Dark'' was produced at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/productions/86 | title = Colours in the Dark (1967) production credits | website = Stratford Festival Archives | access-date = 2019-06-23}}</ref>

From 1973 to 1975 Reaney wrote the trilogy The Donnellys, which the ''Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia'' calls "one of the nation's most important dramas." The three plays debuted at Toronto's [[Tarragon Theatre]], directed by Keith Turnbull.<ref name=theatre/> ''The St. Nicholas Hotel,'' Part II of the trilogy, won the [[Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award|Chalmers Award]]. The [[Donnellys]] toured nationally in 1975, from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] to [[Vancouver]] with the [[NDWT Theatre Company]],<ref name=reaney/> again with Turnbull directing.<ref name=donnellys >"[http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=The%20Donnellys The Donnellys]," ''Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia'', CanadianTheatre.com, Web, Apr. 11, 2011,</ref>

As well, Reaney coauthored several operas with musician [[John Beckwith (composer)|John Beckwith]], including ''Night-Blooming Cereus'' (1960), ''The Shivaree'' (1982), and ''Crazy To Kill'' (1988).<ref name=reaney/>

Other notable Reaney plays include ''Names and Nicknames'', which premiered at the [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]] in 1963, directed by [[John Hirsch]] and Robert Sherrin); and ''Alice Through the Looking Glass'', which played at the Stratford Festival in 1994, 1995 and in 2014.<ref name=theatre/><ref>{{cite web | url =https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/productions/447 | title = Alice Through the Looking Glass (1994) production credits | website = Stratford Festival Archives | access-date = 2019-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/productions/728 | title = Alice Through the Looking Glass (2014) production credits | website = Stratford Festival Archives | access-date = 2019-06-23}}</ref>

Reaney also enjoyed painting and drawing and his art works, from the 1940s to 1990s, were put on exhibit at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in [[Kleinberg, Ontario|Kleinburg, Ontario]] in 2008.<ref name=reaney/>

Reaney died on June 11, 2008, in [[London, Ontario]].<ref name="CBC News"/>

==Writing==

Reaney's complex symbolic and poetic regional drama defies categorizing. Reaney's plays are a combination of symbol, metaphor, chant, poetic incantation, choral speaking, improvisation, miming, and child play. Reaney depends on the concept that we, the audience, are all "children of an older growth" and his audience have responded to this expectation. The symbolic quest as the children search for truth and end in reconciliation with the adult world are the basis of Reaney's plays.<ref>[http://www.uogulph.com/ University of Guelph website]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Critics have called him a colonial, a rationalist and internationalist, a rabid nationalist, a symbolist, and a poet with the myth of coherence who is yet able to say something in an age of the random.<ref name=stingle/>

Of his poetry, ''The [[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' says: "Reaney's poetry, collected in ''Poems'' (1972), has earned him a reputation as an erudite poet at once deriving structures from  metaphor, mythology, and a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] literary tradition while deeply rooted in a regional sense of place."<ref name=ross/>

Reaney's fiction of the 1940s and 1950s (collected in the 1994 book ''The Box Social and Other Stories,'' was "influential in establishing the style of writing that has since become known as ‘Southern Ontario Gothic’. [[Margaret Atwood]] has remarked that ‘without "The Bully", my fiction would have followed other paths'.... Playing sophisticated games by switching voice, he achieves a kind of ‘magic realism’, often through the distorted perspective and sense of disproportion of his child narrators."<ref name=answers/>
