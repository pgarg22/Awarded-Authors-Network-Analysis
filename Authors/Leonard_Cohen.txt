'''Leonard Norman Cohen''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|GOQ}} (September 21, 1934 – November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and novelist. His work explored religion, politics, isolation, depression, sexuality, loss, death and romantic relationships.<ref>{{cite web|last=de Melo|first=Jessica|title=Leonard Cohen to Receive Lifetime Achievement Award at 2010 Grammys|url=http://www.spinner.ca/2009/12/11/leonard-cohen-neil-young-to-be-honoured-at-2010-grammys/|publisher=Spinner Canada|date=December 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203928/http://www.spinner.ca/2009/12/11/leonard-cohen-neil-young-to-be-honoured-at-2010-grammys/|archive-date=July 6, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=February 24, 2010}}</ref> Cohen was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]], the [[Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. He was invested as a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, Cohen received one of the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Awards]] for literature and the ninth [[Glenn Gould Prize]].

Cohen pursued a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s, and did not begin a music career until 1967 at the age of 33. His first album, ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'' (1967), was followed by three more albums of [[Contemporary folk music|folk music]]: ''[[Songs from a Room]]'' (1969), ''[[Songs of Love and Hate]]'' (1971) and ''[[New Skin for the Old Ceremony]]'' (1974). His 1977 record ''[[Death of a Ladies' Man (album)|Death of a Ladies' Man]]'', co-written and produced by [[Phil Spector]], was a move away from Cohen's previous minimalist sound. In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional ''[[Recent Songs]]'', which blended his acoustic style with jazz, East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]", was first released on his studio album ''[[Various Positions]]'' in 1984. ''[[I'm Your Man (Leonard Cohen album)|I'm Your Man]]'' in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, ''[[The Future (Leonard Cohen album)|The Future]]'', which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.

Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of ''[[Ten New Songs]]'', which was a major hit in Canada and Europe. His 11th album, ''[[Dear Heather]]'', followed in 2004. Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, Cohen released three albums in the final four years of his life: ''[[Old Ideas]]'' (2012), ''[[Popular Problems]]'' (2014) and ''[[You Want It Darker]]'' (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death. A posthumous album, ''[[Thanks for the Dance]],'' was released in November 2019, his fifteenth and final studio album.

== Early life ==
Leonard Cohen was born in the [[Montreal]] suburb of [[Westmount, Quebec]] on September 21, 1934.

Cohen attended [[Roslyn Elementary School]] and completed grades seven through nine at [[Herzliah High School]], where his literary mentor, and later inspiration, [[Irving Layton]] taught,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hour.ca/2010/12/09/into-the-consciousness/|title=Inductee: Leonard Cohen – Into the consciousness – Hour Community|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111122918/http://hour.ca/2010/12/09/into-the-consciousness/|archive-date=November 11, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> then transferred in 1948 to [[Westmount High School]], where he studied music and poetry. He became especially interested in the poetry of [[Federico García Lorca]].<ref name="Nadel 1996" /> Cohen involved himself actively beyond Westmount's curriculum, in photography, on the yearbook staff, as a cheerleader, in the arts and current events clubs, and even served in the position of president of the Students' Council while "heavily involved in the school's theater program". During that time, Cohen taught himself to play the acoustic guitar, and formed a [[country music|country]]–[[contemporary folk music|folk]] group that he called the Buckskin Boys. After a young Spanish guitar player taught him "a few chords and some [[flamenco]]", Cohen switched to a [[classical guitar]].<ref name="Nadel 1996" /> He has attributed his love of music to his mother, who sang songs around the house: "I know that those changes, those melodies, touched me very much. She would sing with us when I took my guitar to a restaurant with some friends; my mother would come, and we'd often sing all night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUxOOns1j1M|title=Leonard Cohen, "Joan of Arc", Norway 1988|last=AmericaSings|date=November 12, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721061146/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUxOOns1j1M|archive-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref>

Cohen frequented Montreal's [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]] for fun and ate at such places as the [[Main Deli Steak House]].<ref>{{citation|title=Celine Dion: Montreal's Schwartz's will go on|first=Nelson|last=Wyatt|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/72405-celine-dion-montreals-schwartzs-will-go|journal=The Chronicle Herald|date=March 11, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514092527/http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/72405-celine-dion-montreals-schwartzs-will-go|archive-date=May 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=CL>{{citation|title=First We Take The Main|first=Christine|last=Langlois|date=October 2009|publisher=Reader's Digest|url=http://www.christinelanglois.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/cohenmontreal.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730201813/http://www.christinelanglois.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/cohenmontreal.pdf|archive-date=July 30, 2013}}</ref> According to journalist [[David Sax]], Cohen and one of his cousins would go to the Main Deli to "watch the gangsters, pimps, and wrestlers dance around the night".<ref>{{citation|title=Late Night Noshing|first=David|last=Sax|year=2009|journal=Save the Deli|url=http://www.savethedeli.com/2009/03/17/late-night-noshing/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907020520/http://www.savethedeli.com/2009/03/17/late-night-noshing|archive-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref> Cohen enjoyed the formerly raucous bars of [[Old Montreal]] as well as [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], which had the restaurant nearest to Westmount, for him and his friend Mort Rosengarten to share coffee and cigarettes.<ref name=CL /> When Cohen left Westmount, he purchased a place on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, in the previously working-class neighbourhood of [[Little Portugal, Montreal|Little Portugal]]. He would read his poetry at assorted nearby clubs. In that period and that place, Cohen wrote the lyrics to some of his most famous songs.<ref name=CL />

In 1951, Cohen enrolled at [[McGill University]], where he became president of the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate|McGill Debating Union]] and won the Chester MacNaghten Literary Competition for the poems "Sparrows" and "Thoughts of a Landsman".<ref name="Simmons, Sylvie 2012">Simmons, Sylvie. ''I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen''. NY: HarperCollins, 2012.</ref> Cohen published his first poems in March 1954 in the magazine ''CIV/n''. The issue also included poems by Cohen's poet–professors (who were also on the editorial board) [[Irving Layton]] and [[Louis Dudek]].<ref name="Simmons, Sylvie 2012" /> Cohen graduated from McGill the following year with a B.A. degree.<ref name="Nadel 1996">Nadel, Ira B. ''Various Position: A Life of Leonard Cohen''. Pantheon Books: New York, 1996.</ref> His literary influences during this time included [[W.&nbsp;B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], [[Irving Layton]] (who taught political science at McGill and became both Cohen's mentor and his friend),<ref name="Nadel 1996" /> [[Walt Whitman]], [[Federico García Lorca]], and [[Henry Miller]].<ref>Adria, Marco, "Chapter and Verse: Leonard Cohen", ''Music of Our Times: Eight Canadian Singer-Songwriters'' (Toronto: Lorimer, 1990), p. 28.</ref> His first published book of poetry, ''[[Let Us Compare Mythologies]]'' (1956), was published by Dudek as the first book in the McGill Poetry Series the year after Cohen's graduation. The book contained poems written largely when Cohen was between the ages of 15 and 20, and Cohen dedicated the book to his late father.<ref name="Nadel 1996" /> The well-known Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] wrote a review of the book in which he gave Cohen "restrained praise".<ref name="Nadel 1996" />

After completing his undergraduate degree, Cohen spent a term in the [[McGill Faculty of Law]] and then a year (1956–1957) at the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]]. Cohen described his graduate school experience as "passion without flesh, love without climax".<ref name=Nadel>{{cite book|last=Nadel|first=Ira Bruce|title=Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen|year=1996|publisher=Random House|location=Toronto|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gePAHlZHJJIC&q=passion+without+flesh+leonard+cohen&pg=PA51|isbn=9780292717329}}</ref> Consequently, Cohen left New York and returned to Montreal in 1957, working various odd jobs and focusing on the writing of fiction and poetry, including the poems for his next book, ''[[The Spice-Box of Earth]]'' (1961), which was the first book that Cohen published through the Canadian publishing company [[McClelland & Stewart]]. His father's will provided him with a modest [[trust law|trust]] income sufficient to allow him to pursue his literary ambitions for the time, and ''The Spice-Box of Earth'' was successful in helping to expand the audience for Cohen's poetry, helping him reach out to the poetry scene in Canada, outside the confines of McGill University. The book also helped Cohen gain critical recognition as an important new voice in Canadian poetry. One of Cohen's biographers, [[Ira Nadel]], stated that "reaction to the finished book was enthusiastic and admiring...."The critic [[Robert Weaver (editor)|Robert Weaver]] found it powerful and declared that Cohen was 'probably the best young poet in English Canada right now.'"<ref name="Nadel 1996" />

Cohen continued to write poetry and fiction throughout the 1960s and preferred to live in quasi-reclusive circumstances after he bought a house on [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]], a Greek island in the [[Saronic Islands|Saronic Gulf]]. While living and writing on Hydra, Cohen published the poetry collection ''[[Flowers for Hitler]]'' (1964), and the novels ''[[The Favourite Game]]'' (1963) and ''[[Beautiful Losers]]'' (1966). His novel ''The Favourite Game'' was an autobiographical ''[[bildungsroman]]'' about a young man who discovers his identity through writing. ''Beautiful Losers'' received a good deal of attention from the Canadian press and stirred up controversy because of a number of sexually graphic passages.<ref name="Nadel 1996" /> Regarding ''Beautiful Losers,'' [[the Boston Globe]] stated: "James Joyce is not dead. He is living in Montreal under the name of Cohen." In 1966 Cohen also published ''Parasites of Heaven'', a book of poems. Both ''Beautiful Losers'' and ''Parasites of Heaven'' received mixed reviews and sold few copies.<ref name="Nadel 1996" />

In 1966, CBC-TV producer Andrew Simon produced a local Montreal current affairs program, ''Seven on Six'', and offered Cohen a position as host. "I decided I'm going to be a songwriter. I want to write songs," Simon recalled Cohen telling him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-11-2016-1.3845820/i-want-to-write-songs-leonard-cohen-gave-up-hosting-cbc-tv-show-to-be-songwriter-1.3847401|title='I want to write songs': Leonard Cohen gave up hosting CBC TV show to be songwriter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113033555/http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-11-2016-1.3845820/i-want-to-write-songs-leonard-cohen-gave-up-hosting-cbc-tv-show-to-be-songwriter-1.3847401|archive-date=November 13, 2016}}</ref>

And yet, despite his “disappointing” career, and before ever publishing a song, Cohen was the subject of a 44-minute-long short documentary from the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]] called ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen]]''.

Subsequently, Cohen published less, with major gaps, concentrating more on recording songs. In 1978, he published his first book of poetry in many years, ''Death of a Lady's Man'' (not to be confused with the album he released the previous year, the similarly titled ''[[Death of a Ladies' Man (album)|Death of a Ladies' Man]]''). It was not until 1984 that Cohen published his next book of poems, ''[[Book of Mercy]]'', which won him the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award for Poetry. The book contains 50 prose-poems, influenced by the Hebrew Bible and Zen writings. Cohen himself referred to the pieces as "prayers".<ref>Simmons, Sylvie. ''I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2012.</ref> In 1993 Cohen published ''Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs'', and in 2006, after 10 years of delays, additions, and rewritings, ''[[Book of Longing]]''. ''The Book of Longing'' is dedicated to the poet [[Irving Layton]]. Also, during the late 1990s and 2000s, many of Cohen's new poems and lyrics were first published on the fan website The Leonard Cohen Files, including the original version of the poem "A Thousand Kisses Deep" (which Cohen later adapted for a song).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com|title=The Leonard Cohen Files|publisher=Leonardcohenfiles.com|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920035927/http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/|archive-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name="The Blackening Pages">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/mirror.html|title=The Blackening Pages|publisher=Leonardcohenfiles.com|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019205842/http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/mirror.html|archive-date=October 19, 2014}}</ref>

Cohen's writing process, as he told an interviewer in 1998, was "like a bear stumbling into a beehive or a honey cache: I'm stumbling right into it and getting stuck, and it's delicious and it's horrible and I'm in it and it's not very graceful and it's very awkward and it's very painful and yet there's something inevitable about it."<ref name="utne.com">{{cite web|last=Iyer|first=Pico|url=http://www.utne.com/Spirituality/Leonard-Cohen-Interview-at-Buddhist-Monk-Mountain-Retreat.aspx|title=Listening to Leonard Cohen &#124; Utne Reader|publisher=Utne.com|date=October 22, 2001|access-date=November 13, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115095547/http://www.utne.com/Spirituality/Leonard-Cohen-Interview-at-Buddhist-Monk-Mountain-Retreat.aspx|archive-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref>

In 2011, Cohen was awarded the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laureates – Princess of Asturias Awards – The Princess of Asturias Foundation|url=http://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/literature/|website=The Princess of Asturias Foundation|access-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015254/http://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/literature/|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref>

In 1967, disappointed with his lack of success as a writer, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk music singer–songwriter. During the 1960s, he was a fringe figure in [[Andy Warhol]]'s "Factory" crowd. Warhol speculated that Cohen had spent time listening to [[Nico]] in clubs and that this had influenced his musical style.<ref>Warhol, Andy: Popism. Orlando: Harcourt Press, 1980.</ref>

His song "[[Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)|Suzanne]]" became a hit for [[Judy Collins]] (who subsequently covered a number of Cohen's other songs as well), and was for many years his most-covered song. Collins recalls that when she first met him, he said he couldn't sing or play the guitar, nor did he think "Suzanne" was even a song:

{{blockquote|And then he played me "Suzanne" &nbsp;... I said, "Leonard, you must come with me to this big fundraiser I'm doing"&nbsp;... Jimi Hendrix was on it. He'd never sung [in front of a large audience] before then. He got out on stage and started singing. Everybody was going crazy{{mdash}}they loved it. And he stopped about halfway through and walked off the stage. Everybody went nuts.&nbsp;... They demanded that he come back. And I demanded; I said, "I'll go out with you." So we went out, and we sang it.

In 1973, Columbia Records released "Leonard Cohen: Live Songs". Then beginning around 1974, Cohen's collaboration with pianist and arranger [[John Lissauer]] created a live sound praised by the critics. They toured together in 1974 in Europe and in US and Canada in late 1974 and early 1975, in support of Cohen's record ''[[New Skin for the Old Ceremony]]''. In late 1975 Cohen and Lissauer performed a short series of shows in the US and Canada with a new band, in support of Cohen's ''[[The Best of Leonard Cohen|Best Of]]'' release. The tour included new songs from an album in progress, co-written by Cohen and Lissauer and entitled ''Songs for Rebecca''. None of the recordings from these live tours with Lissauer were ever officially released, and the album was abandoned in 1976.

In 1976, Cohen embarked on a new major European tour with a new band and changes in his sound and arrangements, again, in support of his ''[[The Best of Leonard Cohen]]'' release (in Europe retitled as ''Greatest Hits''). [[Laura Branigan]] was one of his backup singers during the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1heckofaguy.com/2006/07/06/the-best-leonard-cohen-song-youve-probably-never-heard/|title=Pictures of various European records with recording|publisher=1heckofaguy.com|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707061807/http://1heckofaguy.com/2006/07/06/the-best-leonard-cohen-song-youve-probably-never-heard/|archive-date=July 7, 2012}}</ref> From April to July, Cohen gave 55 shows, including his first appearance at the famous [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].

After the European tour of 1976, Cohen again attempted a new change in his style and arrangements: his new 1977 record, ''[[Death of a Ladies' Man (album)|Death of a Ladies' Man]]'' was co-written and produced by [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=Leibovitz>{{cite web|last1=Leibovitz|first1=Liel|title=Wall of Crazy: Phil Spector and Leonard Cohen's incredible album, released 35 years ago, is a time capsule of American pop music|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/music/118825/wall-of-crazy|website=Tablet: A New Read on Jewish Life|publisher=Nextbook Inc.|access-date=March 12, 2015|date=December 11, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215073849/http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/music/118825/wall-of-crazy|archive-date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>{{efn|The recording of the album was fraught with difficulty; Spector reportedly mixed the album in secret studio sessions, and Cohen said Spector once threatened him with a crossbow.

The song is the subject of the book ''The Holy or the Broken: Leonard Cohen, Jeff Buckley & the Unlikely Ascent of 'Hallelujah''' (2012) by [[Alan Light]]. In a ''New York Times'' review [[Janet Maslin]] praised the book and the song, noting that "Cohen spent years struggling with his song "Hallelujah", which eventually became one of the most "oft-performed songs in American musical history."<ref>Maslin, Janet.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:I'm Your Man - Interview with Leonard Cohen, 1988.webm|thumb|Cohen interviewed in 1988.]]
The album track "[[Everybody Knows (Leonard Cohen song)|Everybody Knows]]" from ''I'm Your Man'' and "If It Be Your Will" in the 1990 film ''[[Pump Up the Volume (film)|Pump Up the Volume]]'' helped expose Cohen's music to a wider audience. He first introduced the song during his world tour in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_9b-EpsmM|title=Leonard Cohen – Live in Spain 1988 – Everybody Knows|last=AmericaSings|date=September 23, 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609182351/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_9b-EpsmM|archive-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref> The song "Everybody Knows" also featured prominently in fellow Canadian [[Atom Egoyan]]'s 1994 film, ''[[Exotica (film)|Exotica]]''. In 1992, Cohen released ''[[The Future (Leonard Cohen album)|The Future]]'', which urges (often in terms of [[Bible|biblical]] prophecy) perseverance, reformation, and hope in the face of grim prospects. Three tracks from the album – "[[The Future (Leonard Cohen album)#Waiting for the Miracle|Waiting for the Miracle]]", "The Future" and "Anthem" – were featured in the movie ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', which also promoted Cohen's work to a new generation of US listeners.

As with ''I'm Your Man'', the lyrics on ''The Future'' were dark, and made references to political and social unrest. The title track is reportedly a response to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. Cohen promoted the album with two music videos, for "Closing Time" and "The Future", and supported the release with the major tour through Europe, United States and Canada, with the same band as in his 1988 tour, including a second appearance on [[PBS]]'s ''[[Austin City Limits]]''. Some of the Scandinavian shows were broadcast live on the radio. The selection of performances, mostly recorded on the Canadian leg of the tour, was released on the 1994 ''[[Cohen Live]]'' album.

In 1993, Cohen also published his book of selected poems and songs, ''Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs'', on which he had worked since 1989. It includes a number of new poems from the late 1980s and early 1990s and major revision of his 1978 book ''Death of a Lady's Man''.<ref>Cohen, Leonard. ''Death of a Lady's Man: A Collection of Poetry and Prose'', Andre Deutsch, reprint edition (1978, 2011)</ref>

In 1994, Cohen retreated to the [[Mt. Baldy Zen Center]] near Los Angeles, beginning what became five years of seclusion at the center.<ref name="nytimes.com" /> In 1996, Cohen was ordained as a [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] Zen [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk and took the [[Dharma]] name ''Jikan'', meaning "silence". He served as personal assistant to [[Kyozan Joshu Sasaki]] Roshi.

In 1997, Cohen oversaw the selection and release of the ''[[More Best of Leonard Cohen]]'' album, which included a previously unreleased track, "Never Any Good", and an experimental piece "The Great Event". The first was left over from Cohen's unfinished mid-1990s album, which was announced to include songs like "In My Secret Life" (already recited as a song-in-progress in 1988) and "A Thousand Kisses Deep",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/news0.html|title=News and future plans|publisher=Leonardcohenfiles.com|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223062115/http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/news0.html|archive-date=February 23, 2015}}</ref> both later re-worked with [[Sharon Robinson (songwriter)|Sharon Robinson]] for the 2001 album ''[[Ten New Songs]]''.<ref name=Nadel />

Although there was a public impression that Cohen would not resume recording or publishing, he returned to Los Angeles in May 1999. He began to contribute regularly to The Leonard Cohen Files fan website, emailing new poems and drawings from ''Book of Longing'' and early versions of new songs, like "A Thousand Kisses Deep" in September 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/kisses.html|title=A Thousand Kisses Deep|publisher=Leonardcohenfiles.com|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027162511/http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/kisses.html|archive-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref> and [[Anjani]] Thomas's story sent on May 6, 1999, the day they were recording "Villanelle for our Time"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/anjani.html|title=Anjani Thomas|publisher=Leonardcohenfiles.com|date=May 18, 1999|access-date=February 21, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125031122/http://leonardcohenfiles.com/anjani.html|archive-date=November 25, 2010}}</ref> (released on 2004's ''[[Dear Heather]]'' album).

=== 2000s ===

==== Post-monastery records ====
After two years of production, Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of ''[[Ten New Songs]]'', featuring a major influence from producer and co-composer [[Sharon Robinson (songwriter)|Sharon Robinson]]. The album, recorded at Cohen's and Robinson's home studios – '''''Still Life Studios''''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/340810-Still-Life-Studios|title=Still Life Studios|publisher=[[discogs]]|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030033834/http://www.discogs.com/label/340810-Still-Life-Studios|archive-date=October 30, 2014}}</ref> includes the song "Alexandra Leaving", a transformation of the poem "[[The God Abandons Antony]]", by the Greek poet [[Constantine P. Cavafy]]. The album was a major hit for Cohen in Canada and Europe, and he supported it with the hit single "In My Secret Life" and accompanying video shot by [[Floria Sigismondi]]. The album won him four Canadian Juno Awards in 2002: Best Artist, Best Songwriter, Best Pop Album, and Best Video ("In My Secret Life").<ref name=Nadel /> And the following year he was invested with Canada's highest civilian honor, the [[Companion of the Order of Canada]].<ref name=Nadel />

In October 2004, Cohen released ''[[Dear Heather]]'', largely a musical collaboration with jazz chanteuse (and romantic partner) [[Anjani]] Thomas, although Sharon Robinson returned to collaborate on three tracks (including a duet). As light as the previous album was dark, ''Dear Heather'' reflects Cohen's own change of mood – he said in a number of interviews that his depression had lifted in recent years, which he attributed to Zen Buddhism. In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended to be a kind of notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.

''[[Blue Alert (album)|Blue Alert]]'', an album of songs co-written by Anjani and Cohen, was released in 2006 to positive reviews. Sung by Anjani, who according to one reviewer "... sounds like Cohen reincarnated as woman ... though Cohen doesn't sing a note on the album, his voice permeates it like smoke."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|date=August 22, 2005|title=Up Close and Personal|url=http://www.maartenmassa.be/LCdocs/magazines/2005-08-22_Macleans.pdf|magazine=Maclean's|pages=48–49|location=Ontario|access-date=January 19, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125202541/http://www.maartenmassa.be/LCdocs/magazines/2005-08-22_Macleans.pdf|archive-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref>{{efn|The album includes a recent musical setting of Cohen's "As the mist leaves no scar", a poem originally published in ''[[The Spice-Box of Earth]]'' in 1961 and adapted by [[Phil Spector]] as "True Love Leaves No Traces" on ''[[Death of a Ladies' Man (album)|Death of a Ladies' Man]]'' album. ''Blue Alert'' also included Anjani's own version of "Nightingale", performed by her and Cohen on his ''Dear Heather'', as well the country song "Never Got to Love You", apparently made after an early demo version of Cohen's own 1992 song "Closing Time". During the 2010 tour, Cohen was closing his live shows with the performance of "Closing Time" that included the recitation of verses from "Never Got to Love You". The title song, "Blue Alert", and "Half the Perfect World" were covered by [[Madeleine Peyroux]] on her 2006 album ''[[Half the Perfect World]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/27/jazz.shopping1|title=Madeleine Peyroux, Half the Perfect World|last=Fordham|first=John|work=The Guardian|date=October 28, 2006|access-date=November 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111195910/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/27/jazz.shopping1|archive-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref>}}

Before embarking on his 2008–2010 world tour, and without finishing the new album that had been in work since 2006, Cohen contributed a few tracks to other artists' albums – a new version of his own "Tower of Song" was performed by him, Anjani Thomas and [[U2]] in the 2006 tribute film ''Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/movies/21leon.html|title='Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man': A Documentary Song of Praise|work=The New York Times|first=Stephen|last=Holden|date=June 21, 2006|access-date=November 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111203520/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/movies/21leon.html|archive-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> (the video and track were included on the film's soundtrack and released as the B-side of U2's single "[[Window in the Skies]]", reaching No 1 in the [[Canadian Singles Chart]]).

==== Lawsuits and financial troubles ====
In late 2005, Cohen's daughter Lorca began to suspect Kelley Lynch, Cohen's longtime manager, of financial impropriety. According to Cohen biographer [[Sylvie Simmons]], Lynch "took care of Leonard's business affairs ... [She was] not simply his manager but a close friend, almost part of the family."<ref name="ReferenceA">Simmons, Sylvie. I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen. NY: HarperCollins, 2012.</ref> Cohen discovered that he had unknowingly paid a credit card bill of Lynch's for $75,000, and that most of the money in his accounts was gone, including money from his retirement accounts and charitable trust funds. This had begun as early as 1996, when Lynch started selling Cohen's music publishing rights, despite the fact that Cohen had had no financial incentive to do so.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In October 2005, Cohen sued Lynch, alleging that she had misappropriated over US$5&nbsp;million from Cohen's retirement fund, leaving only $150,000.<ref name=sued>{{cite news|last=Glaister|first=Dan|title=Cohen stays calm as $5m disappears|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/08/usa.topstories3|date=October 8, 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=September 29, 2009|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829184338/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/08/usa.topstories3|archive-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name="macleansbroke" /> Cohen was sued in turn by other former business associates.<ref name=sued /> These events placed him in the public spotlight, including a cover feature on him with the headline "Devastated!" in Canada's ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine.<ref name="macleansbroke">{{cite journal|title=Leonard Cohen Goes Broke|first1=Katherine|last1=Macklem|first2=Charlie|last2=Gillis|first3=Brian D.|last3=Johnson|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/leonard-cohen-goes-broke/|date=August 22, 2005|journal=[[Maclean's]]|postscript=,|access-date=September 19, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415105140/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/leonard-cohen-goes-broke/|archive-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> In March 2006, Cohen won a [[civil suit]] and was awarded US$9&nbsp;million by a Los Angeles County superior court.

Cohen published a book of poetry and drawings, ''[[Book of Longing]]'', in May 2006. In March, a Toronto-based retailer offered signed copies to the first 1,500 orders placed online: all 1,500 sold within hours. The book quickly topped bestseller lists in Canada. On May 13, Cohen made his first public appearance in 13 years, at an in-store event at a bookstore in Toronto. Approximately 3,000 people arrived, causing the streets surrounding the bookstore to be closed. He sang two of his earliest and best-known songs: "So Long, Marianne" and "[[Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye]]", accompanied by the [[Barenaked Ladies]] and [[Ron Sexsmith]]. Appearing with him was Anjani, promoting her new CD along with his book.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cohen returns to limelight with bestselling book|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/05/14/cohen-toronto.html|publisher=CBC Arts|access-date=May 19, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209003659/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/05/14/cohen-toronto.html|archive-date=December 9, 2006|date=May 14, 2006}}</ref>

The third leg of Cohen's World Tour 2008–2009 encompassed New Zealand and Australia from January 20 to February 10, 2009. In January 2009, The Pacific Tour first came to New Zealand, where the audience of 12,000 responded with five standing ovations.{{efn|Simon Sweetman in The [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]] (Wellington) of January 21 wrote "It is hard work having to put this concert in to words so I'll just say something I have never said in a review before and will never say again: this was the best show I have ever seen."The [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]] show on January 28 sold out rapidly, which motivated promoters to announce a second show at the venue. The first performance was well-received, and the audience of 12,000 responded with five standing ovations. In response to hearing about the devastation to the Yarra Valley region of Victoria in Australia, Cohen donated $200,000 to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal in support of those affected by the extensive [[Black Saturday bushfires]] that razed the area just weeks after his performance at the Rochford Winery in the ''A Day on the Green'' concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/10/leonard-cohen-australian-bushfire-donation|title=Leonard Cohen donates £90,000 to Australian bushfire victims|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Rosie|last=Swash|date=February 10, 2009|access-date=May 7, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906041107/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/10/leonard-cohen-australian-bushfire-donation|archive-date=September 6, 2013}}</ref> Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported: "Tour promoter Frontier Touring said $200,000 would be donated on behalf of Cohen, fellow performer [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] and Frontier to aid victims of the bushfires."<ref>{{cite news|title=Leonard Cohen donates concert profits to bushfire relief fund|work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=February 11, 2009|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25037004-5012974,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214170438/http://news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C25037004-5012974%2C00.html|archive-date=February 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

On February 19, 2009, Cohen played his first American concert in 15 years at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Leonard Cohen Dazzles at New York Tour Warm-Up|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269375/leonard-cohen-dazzles-at-new-york-tour-warm-up|access-date=February 20, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915155202/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269375/leonard-cohen-dazzles-at-new-york-tour-warm-up|archive-date=September 15, 2014}}</ref> The show, showcased as the special performance for fans, Leonard Cohen Forum members and press, was the only show in the whole three-year tour that was broadcast on the radio (NPR) and available as a free podcast.

The North American Tour of 2009 opened on April 1, and included the performance at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] on Friday, April 17, 2009, in front of one of the largest outdoor theatre crowds in the history of the festival. His performance of ''Hallelujah'' was widely regarded as one of the highlights of the festival, thus repeating the major success of the 2008 Glastonbury appearance.

In July 2009, Cohen started his marathon European tour, his third in two years. The itinerary mostly included sport arenas and open air Summer festivals in Germany, UK, France, Spain, Ireland (the show at [[The O2 (Dublin)|O2]] in Dublin won him the second [[Meteor Music Awards|Meteor Music Award]] in a row), but also performances in Serbia in the [[Belgrade Arena]], in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Turkey, and again in Romania.

On September 18, 2009, on the stage at a concert in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], Spain, Cohen suddenly fainted halfway through performing his song "Bird on the Wire", the fourth in the two-act set list; Cohen was brought down backstage by his band members and then admitted to local hospital, while the concert was suspended.<ref>{{cite news|title=Leonard Cohen OK after fainting on stage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/09/19/cohen-collapse.html|date=September 19, 2009|publisher=CBC News|access-date=September 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214346/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/09/19/cohen-collapse.html|archive-date=September 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was reported that Cohen had stomach problems, and possibly food poisoning.<ref>{{cite news|title=Leonard Cohen collapses on stage|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8264447.stm|date=September 19, 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=September 19, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923112651/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8264447.stm|archive-date=September 23, 2009}}</ref> Three days later, on September 21, his 75th birthday, he performed in Barcelona. The show, last in Europe in 2009 and rumoured to be the last European concert ever, attracted many international fans, who lighted the green candles honouring Cohen's birthday, leading Cohen to give a special speech of thanks for the fans and the Leonard Cohen Forum.

The last concert of this leg was held in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] on September 24 at [[Ramat Gan Stadium]]. The event was surrounded by public discussion due to a cultural boycott of Israel proposed by a number of musicians.<ref name="Kliger">{{cite news|last=Kliger|first=Rachelle|title=Leonard Cohen's Ramallah gig called off|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=July 13, 2009|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443798463&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|access-date=February 20, 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Nevertheless, tickets for the Tel Aviv concert, Cohen's first performance in Israel since 1980, sold out in less than 24 hours.<ref>{{cite news|title=Leonard Cohen's blessed summer finale|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=September 26, 2009|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253820682564&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|access-date=September 26, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> It was announced that the proceeds from the sale of the 47,000 tickets would go into a charitable fund in partnership with [[Amnesty International]] and would be used by Israeli and Palestinian peace groups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Haaretz on proceeds from Tel Aviv concert|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/leonard-cohen-s-tel-aviv-concert-sells-out-in-a-day-1.281246|date=August 2, 2009|access-date=July 15, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025115030/http://www.haaretz.com/news/leonard-cohen-s-tel-aviv-concert-sells-out-in-a-day-1.281246|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>{{efn|Amnesty International withdrew from any involvement with the concert and its proceeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amnesty International and the Leonard Cohen Fund for Reconciliation, Tolerance and Peace|work=Public document|format=PDF|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=August 17, 2009|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/025/2009/en/|access-date=February 20, 2012}}</ref> Amnesty International later stated that its withdrawal was not due to the boycott but "the lack of support from Israeli and Palestinian NGOs."

The sixth leg of the 2008–2009 world tour went again to the US, with 15 shows. The 2009 world tour earned a reported $9.5&nbsp;million, putting Cohen at number 39 on ''Billboard'' magazine's list of the year's top musical "money makers".<ref>{{cite web|title=Music's Top 40 Money Makers|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959249/money-makers-page-1|date=February 26, 2010|work=Billboard|access-date=March 1, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224192933/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959249/money-makers-page-1|archive-date=February 24, 2013}}</ref>

On September 14, 2010, Sony Music released a live CD/DVD album, ''Songs from the Road'', showcasing Cohen's 2008 and 2009 live performances.

Cohen's 2008–2009 world tour was prolonged into 2010.

In 2011, Cohen's poetical output was represented in Everyman's Library Pocket Poets, in a selection ''Poems and Songs'' edited by Robert Faggen. The collection included a selection from all Cohen's books, based on his 1993 books of selected works, ''Stranger Music'', and as well from ''Book of Longing'', with addition of six new song lyrics. Nevertheless, three of those songs, "A Street", recited in 2006, "Feels So Good", performed live in 2009 and 2010, and "Born in Chains", performed live in 2010, were not released on Cohen's 2012 album ''[[Old Ideas]]'', with him being unhappy with the versions of the songs in the last moment; the song "Lullaby", as presented in the book and performed live in 2009, was completely re-recorded for the album, presenting new lyrics on the same melody.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A biography, ''I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen'', written by Sylvie Simmons, was published in October 2012. The book is the second major biography of Cohen (Ira Nadel's 1997 biography ''Various Positions'' was the first).<ref>Simmons, Sylvie. ''I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen'', Ecco (2013)</ref>

== Cultural impact and themes ==

Writing for [[AllMusic]], critic Bruce Eder assessed Cohen's overall career in popular music by asserting that "[he is] one of the most fascinating and enigmatic&nbsp;... singer-songwriters of the late '60s&nbsp;... Second only to [[Bob Dylan]] (and perhaps [[Paul Simon]]), he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the 1960s who continued to work in the 21st century."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/leonard-cohen-mn0000071209/biography|title=Eder, Bruce.

"When people talk about Leonard, they fail to mention his melodies, which to me, along with his lyrics, are his greatest genius. ... Even the counterpoint lines--they give a celestial character & melodic lift to his songs. ... no one else comes close to this in modern music. ... I like all of Leonard's songs, early or late. ... they make you think & feel. I like some of his later songs even better than his early ones. Yet there's a simplicity to his early ones that I like, too. ... He's very much a descendant of [[Irving Berlin]]. ... Both of them just hear melodies that most of us can only strive for. ... Both Leonard & Berlin are incredibly crafty. Leonard particularly uses chord progressions that are classical in shape. He is a much more savvy musician than you'd think."<ref>The New Yorker, October 17, 2016 article ' Leonard Cohen makes it darker', by David Remnick</ref>

Themes of political and social justice also recur in Cohen's work, especially in later albums. In "Democracy", he both acknowledges political problems and celebrates {{Citation needed|reason= He seems to be merely enumerating "causes" and differing points of view throughout the song|date=May 2018}} the hopes of reformers: "from the wars against disorder/ from the sirens night and day/ from the fires of the homeless/ from the ashes of the gay/ Democracy is coming to the USA."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohen.com/us/music/futureten-new-songs/democracy|title=Democracy lyrics on the Official Leonard Cohen Site|access-date=April 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414194110/http://www.leonardcohen.com/us/music/futureten-new-songs/democracy|archive-date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> He made the observation in "Tower of Song" that "the rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor/ And there's a mighty judgment coming." In the title track of ''The Future'' he recasts this prophecy on a pacifist note: "I've seen the nations rise and fall/ ... / But love's the only engine of survival." In that same song he comments on current topics (abortion, anal sex and the use of drugs): "Give me crack and anal sex. Take the only tree that's left and stuff it up the hole in your culture", "Destroy another fetus now, we don't like children anyhow".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-the-future-lyrics|title=Leonard Cohen – the Future|access-date=May 25, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041410/https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-the-future-lyrics|archive-date=May 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/future.html|title=Analysis|access-date=May 25, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203063930/http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/future.html|archive-date=December 3, 2017}}</ref> In "Anthem", he promises that "the killers in high places [who] say their prayers out loud/ [are] gonna hear from me."

War is an enduring theme of Cohen's work that—in his earlier songs and early life—he approached ambivalently. Challenged in 1974 over his serious demeanor in concerts and the military salutes he ended them with, Cohen remarked, "I sing serious songs, and I'm serious onstage because I couldn't do it any other way ... I don't consider myself a civilian. I consider myself a soldier, and that's the way soldiers salute."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webheights.net/speakingcohen/spain1.htm|title=1974 Interview from 'Leonard Cohen' by Manzano|publisher=Webheights.net|date=October 12, 1974|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222225302/http://www.webheights.net/speakingcohen/spain1.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

Deeply moved by encounters with Israeli and Arab soldiers, he left the country to write "[[Lover Lover Lover]]". This song has been interpreted as a personal renunciation of armed conflict, and ends with the hope his song will serve a listener as "a shield against the enemy".

Cohen is mentioned in the [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] song "[[Pennyroyal Tea]]" from the band's 1993 release, ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''. [[Kurt Cobain]] wrote, "Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld/So I can sigh eternally." Cohen, after Cobain's suicide, was quoted as saying "I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man.

Cohen was one of the inspirations for [[Matt Bissonnette (director)|Matt Bissonnette]] and Steven Clark's 2002 film ''[[Looking for Leonard]]''.

The Leonard Cohen song "[[So Long, Marianne]]" is the title of the season 4, episode 9 episode of ''[[This is Us]]''. The song is played and its meaning is discussed as an important plot point of the episode.

Cohen had three grandchildren: grandson Cassius through his son Adam, and granddaughter Viva (whose father is musician [[Rufus Wainwright]]) and grandson Lyon through Lorca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/the-gloomy-grim-and-triumphant-third-act-of-leonard-cohen/|title=Leonard Cohen's third act – Macleans.ca|date=September 21, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111040202/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/the-gloomy-grim-and-triumphant-third-act-of-leonard-cohen/|archive-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/11/16/leonard-cohen-died-in-his-sleep-after-fall-manager-says.html/|title=Leonard Cohen died in his sleep after fall, manager says – Fox News|website=[[Fox News]]|date=November 16, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127085614/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/11/16/leonard-cohen-died-in-his-sleep-after-fall-manager-says.html|archive-date=November 27, 2016}}</ref>

Cohen was in a relationship with French photographer [[Dominique Issermann]] in the 1980s. They worked together on several occasions: she shot his first two music videos for the songs "[[Dance Me to the End of Love]]" and "[[First We Take Manhattan]]" and her photographs were used for the covers of his 1993 book ''Stranger Music'' and his album ''[[More Best of Leonard Cohen]]'' and for the inside booklet of ''[[I'm Your Man (Leonard Cohen album)|I'm Your Man]]'' (1988), which he also dedicated to her.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Leonard|title=I'm Your Man|publisher=Leonardcohencroatia.com|language=hr|year=2012|url=http://www.leonardcohencroatia.com/glazba/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3&Itemid=4&album=album8.php|access-date=February 20, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620102058/http://www.leonardcohencroatia.com/glazba/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3&Itemid=4&album=album8.php|archive-date=June 20, 2010}}</ref> In 2010, she was also the official photographer of his world tour.

=== Religious beliefs and practices ===
Cohen was described as a [[Shomer Shabbat|Sabbath-observant]] Jew in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'':

<blockquote>Mr. Cohen keeps the Sabbath even while on tour and performed for Israeli troops during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. So how does he square that faith with his continued practice of Zen? "[[Allen Ginsberg]] asked me the same question many years ago", he said. "Well, for one thing, in the tradition of Zen that I've practiced, there is no prayerful worship and there is no affirmation of a deity. So theologically there is no challenge to any Jewish belief."<ref>See Larry Rohter, "On the Road, for Reasons Practical and Spiritual." The New York Times, February 25, 2009. For an extended discussion of the Jewish mystical and Buddhist motifs in Cohen's songs and poems, see Elliot R. Wolfson, "New Jerusalem Glowing: Songs and Poems of Leonard Cohen in a Kabbalistic Key", ''Kabbalah: A Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts'' 15 (2006): 103–152.</ref></blockquote>

In his concert in [[Ramat Gan]], Israel on September 24, 2009, Cohen spoke Jewish prayers and blessings to the audience in Hebrew. He opened the show with the first sentence of [[Ma Tovu]]. At the middle he used [[Baruch Hashem]], and he ended the concert reciting the blessing of [[Birkat Kohanim]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/115181/|title=Cohen using Jewish prayers and blessings in Hebrew in his concert in Israel|publisher=Forward.com|access-date=November 13, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122190447/http://forward.com/articles/115181/|archive-date=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

Cohen had a brief phase around 1970 of being interested in a variety of world views, which he later described as "from the Communist party to the Republican Party. From Scientology to delusions of me as the High Priest rebuilding the Temple".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsD0AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA374|page=374|title=Leonard Cohen on Leonard Cohen|first=Jeff|last=Burger|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=April 1, 2014|isbn=9781613747582}}</ref>

Cohen was involved with [[Buddhism]] beginning in the 1970s and was ordained a Buddhist priest in 1996; he continued to consider himself Jewish: "I'm not looking for a new religion. I'm quite happy with the old one, with Judaism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Literature/Jewish_American_Literature/Into_the_Literary_Mainstream/Leonard_Cohen.shtml|title=Leonard Cohen: Poet, Prophet, Eternal Optimist;|publisher=Myjewishlearning.com|access-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831061323/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Literature/Jewish_American_Literature/Into_the_Literary_Mainstream/Leonard_Cohen.shtml|archive-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, Cohen was associated with Buddhist monk and [[rōshi]] (venerable teacher) [[Kyozan Joshu Sasaki]], regularly visiting him at [[Mount Baldy Zen Center]] and serving him as personal assistant during Cohen's period of reclusion at Mount Baldy monastery in the 1990s. Sasaki appears as a regular motif or addressee in Cohen's poetry, especially in his ''[[Book of Longing]]'', and took part in a 1997 documentary about Cohen's monastery years, ''Leonard Cohen: Spring 1996''. Cohen's 2001 album ''[[Ten New Songs]]'' is dedicated to Joshu Sasaki.

In a 1993 interview entitled "I am the little Jew who wrote the Bible," he says, "at our best, we inhabit a biblical landscape, and this is where we should situate ourselves without apology. ... That biblical landscape is our urgent invitation ... Otherwise, it's really not worth saving or manifesting or redeeming or anything, unless we really take up that invitation to walk into that biblical landscape."

Cohen showed an interest in [[Jesus]] as a universal figure, saying, "I'm very fond of Jesus Christ. He may be the most beautiful guy who walked the face of this earth. Any guy who says 'Blessed are the poor. Blessed are the meek' has got to be a figure of unparalleled generosity and insight and madness ... A man who declared himself to stand among the thieves, the prostitutes and the homeless. His position cannot be comprehended. It is an inhuman generosity. A generosity that would overthrow the world if it was embraced because nothing would weather that compassion. I'm not trying to alter the Jewish view of Jesus Christ. But to me, in spite of what I know about the history of legal Christianity, the figure of the man has touched me."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Devlin|first1=Jim (Editor)|title=Leonard Cohen: In His Own Words|date=1 March 1999|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9780711968783|pages=96}}</ref>

Speaking about his religion in a 2007 interview for [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]]'' (partially re-broadcast on November 11, 2016) Cohen said:

<blockquote>My friend [[Brian D. Johnson|Brian Johnson]] said of me that I'd never met a religion I didn't like. ... That's why I've tried to correct that impression [that Cohen was looking for another religion besides Judaism] because I very much feel part of that tradition and I practice that and my children practice it, so that was never in question. The investigations that I've done into other spiritual systems have certainly illuminated and enriched my understanding of my own tradition.<ref name="BBC Front Row 11 November 2016">{{cite episode|title=Leonard Cohen, BalletBoyz, Contemporary war poetry|series=Front Row|series-link=Front Row (radio programme)|credits=Presenter: [[Kirsty Lang]] Producer: Ella-mai Robey|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b081l8bn|airdate=November 11, 2016|minutes=26:28|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111194514/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b081l8bn|archive-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
