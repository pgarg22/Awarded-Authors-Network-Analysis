==Career==
Shue's two best-known plays were written and first performed while he was playwright-in-residence at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]]:
*''[[The Nerd (play)|The Nerd]]'' premiered in April 1981, and was produced successfully in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]]. It transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1987. It is a simple character-based comedy, in which a normal dinner party, interrupted by the house-guest from hell, dissolves into insanity.
*[[The Foreigner (play)|''The Foreigner'']] premiered in 1983, and transferred to [[Off-Broadway]]. The central character is Charlie Baker, who, while on a vacation in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] hunting lodge, pretends not to be able to understand [[English language|English]], so as to avoid the attentions of the other guests. His plan backfires and he soon finds himself the confidant of everyone there, especially a young man named Ellard, who thinks he is teaching Charlie English. Charlie ends up having to foil the schemes of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter without revealing his secret.

His other plays include:
*''Grandma Duck is Dead'' – about antics in a college [[dormitory]]
*''My Emperor's New Clothes'' – "set in the kingdom of Mango-Chutney, a [[One-act play|one-act]] children's [[Musical theatre|musical]] based on the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] [[The Emperor's New Clothes|story]] (Shue works in some cross-dressing, as well as a rhyme for "orange")"<ref name= "appreciation">{{cite web |url= http://ahoneyofananklet.com/home/shue/index.html |author= Gorsline, David |title= Larry Shue, an appreciation |access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>
*''Wenceslas Square'' – set in 1974 [[Prague]] after the Soviet invasion of 1968

The off-Broadway production of ''The Foreigner'' resulted in two [[Obie]] awards in 1985, to [[Jerry Zaks]] for direction and [[Anthony Heald]] for performance.<ref name=obies-1985>{{cite web|title=New York Obies Theater Awards|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/obies/index/1985/|publisher=Village Voice, LLC|access-date=8 April 2013}}</ref> From the [[Outer Critics Circle]], it received the John Gassner Playwriting Award and the award for Best Off Broadway Play.<ref name=occ-1984>{{cite web|title=Awards Archive|url=http://www.outercritics.org/AwardArchives.aspx?_y=1984-1985|publisher=Outer Critics Circle|access-date=8 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505212110/http://www.outercritics.org/AwardArchives.aspx?_y=1984-1985|archive-date=5 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Death==
Shue's success was short-lived. At the age of 39, he died in the [[Henson Airlines Flight 1517|crash of a Beech 99 commuter plane]] en route to [[Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport]] near [[Weyers Cave, Virginia]]; all fourteen people on the flight were killed, twelve passengers and two crew.<ref name=specter-carton>{{cite news|last1=Specter|first1=Michael|last2=Carton|first2=Barbara|title=Crash Cause Sought At Blue Ridge Site|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 September 1985|pages=C1,C5}}</ref><ref name=smith-victims>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Philip|title=Actor-Playwright and Businessmen Among Victims Aboard Henson Flight|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 September 1985|page=C5}}</ref> At the time, Shue was preparing for his first big Broadway role, as Reverend Crisparkle in [[Joseph Papp]]'s ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''.<ref name="simon">{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=John |title=Southern Exposure |journal=New York |date=11 November 2004 |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/theater/reviews/10393/ |access-date=7 September 2019}}</ref>

Among many other eulogies, author [[Thomas M. Disch]] said that Shue's death was "fate's cruelest trick on the theater since the murder of [[Joe Orton]]."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Disch |first= Thomas M. |title= ''The Nerd'' |journal= [[The Nation]] |volume= 244 |date= April 18, 1987 |page= 517}}</ref> Also in remembrance, Canadian actor [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112048/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Jeff Brooks] said, "I knew him, and I saw him play Charlie [in the play ''The Foreigner''] in New York. Then I played it in New York after him, although we're quite different as actors." Shue played the smaller role of Froggy, and Brooks had something to say about that, as well: "I know damn well he wrote Charlie for himself. As an actor, he was such a cut-up. When I saw him, he was wonderful. I remember thinking a couple of times that he's doing things that if he were the playwright sitting out here, he'd be saying, 'Oh, stop that. Cut that out.' But he was having so much fun inventively in the role."<ref name= "Atla" />
