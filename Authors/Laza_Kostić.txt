==Biography==
Laza Kostić was born in 1841 in [[Kovilj]], [[Vojvodina]]—which was then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—to a military family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://svetigora.com/kulturni-magazin-laza-kostic/|title=Културни магазин: Лаза Костић • Радио ~ Светигора ~|website=svetigora.com|language=sr-RS|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Kostić graduated from the Law School of the [[University of Budapest]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[jurisprudence]] at the same university in 1866. A part of his thesis was about the [[Dušan's Code]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?query=ARTAK%26and%26Laza%2bKosti%25c4%2587&page=1&sort=1&stype=0&backurl=%2fSearchResults.aspx%3fquery%3dARTAK%2526and%2526Laza%252bKosti%2525c4%252587%26page%3d0%26sort%3d1%26stype%3d0=/article.aspx|title=Doktorska disertacija pesnika Laze Kostića 'De legibus serbicis Stephani Uros Dusan'|website=scindeks.ceon.rs|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> After completing his studies, Kostić occupied several positions and was active in cultural and political life in [[Novi Sad]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Montenegro]]. He was one of the leaders of ''[[United Serb Youth|Ujedinjena omladina srpska]]'' (United Serb Youth)<ref name="auto5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:606450-Laza-Kostic-sklapao-niti-srpskog-jedinstva|title=Laza Kostić sklapao niti srpskog jedinstva|website=www.novosti.rs|language=sr-Latn|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> and was elected a Serbian representative to the Hungarian parliament, thanks to his mentor [[Svetozar Miletić]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ravnoplov.rs/zelen-dobos-dobuje-laza-kostic-robuje/|title=ZELEN DOBOŠ DOBUJE, LAZA KOSTIĆ ROBUJE… – Ravnoplov|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Because of his liberal and nationalistic views, Kostić had to leave the Hungarian-occupied part of Serbia but he returned home after several years in Belgrade and Montenegro.

From 1869 to 1872, Kostić was the president of Novi Sad's Court House and was virtually the leader of his party in his county. He was a delegate in the clerico-secular [[Sabor]] at [[Sremski Karlovci]] several times. He served as Lord Mayor of Novi Sad twice and also twice as [[Sajkasi]] delegate to the Parliament in Budapest.<ref name="auto5"/>

After Svetozar Miletić and [[Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]], Laza Kostić was the most active leader in Novi Sad; his politics were distinct from those of his associates but he was convinced his mission to save Serbia through art had been baulked by [[obscurantist]] courtiers. In 1867, the Austrian Empire became [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] became one of two autonomous parts of the new state. This was followed by a policy of [[Hungarization]] of the non-Hungarian nationalities, most notably promotion of the Hungarian-language and suppression of Romanian and Slavic languages, including Serbian. As the chief defender of the United Serbian Youth movement, Kostić was especially active in securing the repeal of some laws imposed on his and other nationalities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When [[Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia]], was assassinated, the Austro-Hungarian authorities sought to falsely implicate Laza, his mentor Miletić, and other Serbian intellectuals in a murder plot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krbalkan.rs/santa-maria-della-salute_cirilica.html|title=kreativna radionica balkan|website=www.krbalkan.rs|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> 

Kostić was arrested and incarcerated but like the rest of them he was later released. In 1868, the new Prince of Serbia was the fourteen-year-old [[Milan IV]] Obrenović, who had fallen in love with Laza's most recent work ''[[Maksim Crnojević]]'', which had been released that year. Milan's first act as monarch was to send for Kostić, "that great Serbian poet and activist for Serbian rights in Austria-Hungary".{{cn|date=January 2020}} At the time, Kostić was back in Novi Sad after making a vitriolic speech against the [[Habsburgs]] at Milan's inauguration in Belgrade. He was returned to prison and a accused of high treason. The charges came to naught and he was eventually freed. With more false accusations pending against him, Kostić sought refuge in Belgrade.

[[File:Maksim Crnojević cover 1866.jpg|thumb|left|Front page of Kostić's play ''Maksim Crnojević'', 1866]]

Kostić moved to Belgrade, where he became a popular figure as a poet. Through Milan's influence, Kostić obtained the position of editor of ''Srpsku nezavisnost'' (Serbian Independence), an influential political and literary magazine. Milan chose him to be [[Jovan Ristić]]'s principal assistant at the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] and in 1880 Kostić was sent to [[Saint Petersburg]] as a member of the Serbian delegation.<ref name="auto1"/> Belgrade's opposition parties began taking issue with Kostić's writings; he had boasted of his power over the King in jest but had disdain to make influential friends at court so in 1883 King Milan ask him to leave Belgrade for a time. Despite his bizarreness, Kostić was ranked a great poet and writer. Soon after, he took up residence in [[Cetinje]] and became editor-in-chief of the official paper of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] ''Glas Crnogoraca'' (The Montenegrin Voice),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.muzejvojvodine.org.rs/index.php/predavanja/2005-laza-kostic-veliki-pesnik-vizionar-i-zurnalista|title=Лаза Костић - велики песник, визионар и журналиста|last=Admin|website=Музеј Војводине|language=sr-rs|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> where he met intellectuals [[Simo Matavulj]], [[Pavel Rovinsky]], and [[Valtazar Bogišić]]. In 1890, Kostić moved to [[Sombor]] where he married Julijana Palanački in September 1895 and spent the rest of his life there. In Sombor he wrote a book which describes his dreams ''Dnevnik snova'' (''Diary of Dreams''),<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://galaksijanova.rs/otkrivalacke-snohvatice/|title=ОТКРИВАЛАЧКЕ СНОХВАТИЦЕ|date=2017-04-20|website=Galaksija Nova|language=sr-RS|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> and the popular poem ''Santa Maria della Salute'', which is considered the finest example of his [[love poem]]s and [[Elegy|elegies]].<ref name=autobiografija>[[Scribd]]: [https://www.scribd.com/doc/8179893/Laza-Kostic-biografija Laza Kostić: ''Autobiografija''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105194233/http://www.scribd.com/doc/8179893/Laza-Kostic-biografija |date=5 November 2012 }} (Autobiography of Laza Kostić) {{in lang|sr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/13076|title=Пројекат Растко: Dragan Stojanović : Između astralnog i sakralnog : "Santa Maria della Salute" Laze Kostića|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scindeks.ceon.rs/Error.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/article.aspx|title=Korifej onirizma srpske romantičarske književnosti, Laza Kostić|website=scindeks.ceon.rs|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>

==Verse and prose==
[[File:Laza Kostić u narodnoj nošnji.jpg|thumb|Laza Kostić in traditional clothes from [[Montenegro]]]]

In his poetry, Kostić often touched upon universal themes and human concerns, especially the relationships between man and God, society, and fellow humans. He contributed stylistic and linguistic innovations, experimenting freely, often at the expense of clarity. His work is closer to European [[Romanticism]] than that of any other Serbian poet of his time. Kostić attempted unsuccessfully in numerous, incomplete theoretical essays to combine the elements of the native folk song with those of European Romanticism. The lack of success can be attributed to the advanced nature of his poetry, the ideas of his time, and his eccentricity.

Of Kostić's plays. ''[[Maksim Crnojević]]'' (1863) represents the first attempt to dramatize an epic poem. ''[[Pera Segedinac]]'' (1875) deals with the struggle of the Serbs for their rights in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and his play ''[[Gordana]]'' (1890) did not receive much praise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mingl.rs/mingl-mobile/apdejt/61/2018/01/31/kosticeve-drame.html|title=Kostićeve drame|website=Mingl|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>

Kostić was a controversial personality; he was more celebrated than understood in his youth and became less popular in his old age, only achieving real fame after his death. Today, it is generally accepted that Kostić is the originator of modern Serbian poetry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Translation of works in English==
At the age of eighteen, in 1859, Kostić undertook the task of translating the works of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref name="auto4">{{Cite web|url=http://the-laza-kostic-fund.com/sr/o-lazi-kosticu.1.2.html|title=Фонд Лаза Костић {{!}} О Лази Костићу|website=the-laza-kostic-fund.com|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> Kostić researched and published works on Shakespeare for around 50 years.<ref name="auto4"/>

The cultural ideals that motivated Kostić to translate ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' into Serbian were part of the Serbian literary revival that originated with [[Dositej Obradović]] in the eighteenth century. At the time, theatre emerged following the Serbian people's campaign for national independence in the late eighteenth century. During the 1850s and inter-war years, Kostić and his collaborator Andrejević made efforts to introduce Shakespeare to the Serbian public.

He tried to bring closer the Balkan cultures and the [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], experimenting with the translation of [[Homer]] into the Serbian-epic [[decametre]].<ref name="auto4"/> He translated the works of many other foreign authors, notably [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Heinrich Dernburg]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton]]'s [[The Last Days of Pompeii]], and Hungarian poet [[József Kiss (poet)|József Kiss]].

All Serbian intellectuals of the period believed the existence of their country was bound to the fate of their native tongue, then spoken widely throughout the two foreign empires. This premise provided for Kostić's translation of ''Romeo and Juliet''. The Serbian translation of ''[[Richard III]]'' was the joint effort of Kostić and his friend, the physician and author [[Jovan Andrejević-Joles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scindeks.ceon.rs/Error.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/article.aspx|title=dr Jovan Andrejević Joles, prvi srpski anatom - život i delo|website=scindeks.ceon.rs|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>  Andrejević also participated in the founding of Novi Sad's [[Serbian National Theatre]] in 1861. The year of the appearance of ''Richard III'' (1864) in Novi Sad coincided with the 300-year anniversary of Shakespeare's birth; for that occasion, Kostić adapted two scenes from ''Richard III'' using the [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic verse]] for the first time. ''Richard III'' was staged in Serbia and directed by Kostić himself. Later, he translated ''[[Hamlet]]'' but his work was met with criticism by notable literary critic [[Bogdan Popović]].<ref name="auto2"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/29384/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%B4-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%83-%D1%82%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%BC%D1%80%D1%82|title=Sad nema tu trt – mrt!|last=Ružić|first=Žarko|website=Politika Online|access-date=2020-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602175705/http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/29384/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%B4-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%83-%D1%82%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%BC%D1%80%D1%82|archive-date=2 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Laza Kostić may be characterized as an eccentric but had a spark of genius. He was the first to introduce iambic meter into dramatic poetry and the first translator of Shakespeare into Serbian. At a European authors' convention at the turn of the 20th century he tried to explain the relationship between the culture of Serbia and those of major Western European cultures.

Kostić was friends with [[Lazar Dunđerski]], the patriarch of one of the most important Serbian noble families in Austria-Hungary.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ravnoplov.rs/prva-lazina-pesma-o-lenki/|title=PRVA LAZINA PESMA O LENKI – Ravnoplov|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> He was in love with Jelena ''Lenka'' Dunđerski, Lazar's younger daughter,<ref name="auto"/> who was 29 years his junior.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite web|url=https://wannabemagazine.com/ljubavi-srpskih-pisaca-laza-kostic/|title=Ljubavi srpskih pisaca: Laza Kostić|date=2012-03-10|website=WANNABE MAGAZINE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> Although Lenka returned his love, Lazar Dunđerski did not approve of their relationship and would not allow them to marry.<ref name="auto6"/> He arranged a marriage between Kostić and Juliana Palanački.<ref name="auto6"/> Kostić attempted to arrange a marriage between Lenka and the Serbian-American scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] but Tesla rejected the offer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ravnoplov.rs/kako-je-laza-kostic-udavao-lenku-za-nikolu-teslu/|title=KAKO JE LAZA KOSTIĆ UDAVAO LENKU ZA NIKOLU TESLU – Ravnoplov|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>
