'''Henry Archibald Hertzberg Lawson''' (17 June 1867 – 2 September 1922)<ref name=ADB>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last= Matthews |first=Brian |title=Lawson, Henry (1867–1922) |id2=lawson-henry-7118 |access-date=30 September 2012}}</ref> was an Australian writer and [[bush poet]]. Along with his contemporary [[Banjo Paterson]], Lawson is among the best-known Australian poets and fiction writers of the colonial period and is often called Australia's "greatest short story writer".<ref>{{Citation | author1=Elder, Bruce | title=In Lawson's tracks [The Henry Lawson Trail from Bourke (NSW) to Hungerford (Qld).

A vocal [[Australian nationalism|nationalist]] and [[republicanism in Australia|republican]], Lawson regularly contributed to ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', and many of his works helped popularise the [[Australian English|Australian vernacular]] in fiction. He wrote prolifically into the 1890s, after which his output declined, in part due to struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. At times destitute, he spent periods in [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] and psychiatric institutions. After he died in 1922 following a cerebral haemorrhage, Lawson became the first Australian writer to be granted a [[state funeral]].

He was the son of the poet, publisher and feminist [[Louisa Lawson]].

== Family and early life ==
[[File:Grenfell Main Street 002.JPG|thumb|left|Grenfell, Lawson's birthplace, during the 2011 Henry Lawson Festival]]
Henry Lawson was born 17 June 1867 in a town on the [[Grenfell, New South Wales|Grenfell goldfields]] of [[New South Wales]]. His father was Niels Hertzberg Larsen, a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born miner.  Niels Larsen went to sea at 21 and arrived in [[Melbourne]] in 1855 to join the gold rush, along with partner [[William Henry John Slee]].<ref name=ADB/> Lawson's parents met at the goldfields of Pipeclay (now Eurunderee, [[Gloucester County, New South Wales]]). Niels and [[Louisa Lawson|Louisa Albury]] (1848–1920) married on 7 July 1866 when he was 32 and she 18. On Henry's birth, the family surname was [[Anglicised]] and Niels became Peter Lawson. The newly married couple were to have an unhappy marriage.  Louisa, after family-raising, took a significant part in women's movements, and edited a women's paper called ''[[The Dawn (feminist magazine)|The Dawn]]'' (published May 1888 to July 1905). She also published her son's first volume, and around 1904 brought out a volume of her own, ''Dert and Do'', a simple story of 18,000 words. In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, ''The Lonely Crossing and other Poems''. Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son's literary work in its earliest days.<ref name=DAB>{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogL.html#lawson2|title=Lawson, Henry (1867 - 1922) |access-date=2009-07-17 |author=Percival Serle |work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |publisher=[[Angus and Robertson]] |year=1949 |author-link=Percival Serle }}</ref> Peter Lawson's grave (with headstone) is in the little private cemetery at [[Hartley Vale, New South Wales|Hartley Vale]], New South Wales, a few minutes' walk behind what was Collitt's Inn.

Lawson attended school at Eurunderee from 2 October 1876 but suffered an ear infection at around this time. It left him with partial deafness and by the age of fourteen he had lost his hearing entirely. However, his master John Tierney was kind and did all he could for Lawson, who was quite shy.<ref name=DAB/> Lawson later attended a [[Catholic]] school at [[Mudgee]], New South Wales around 8&nbsp;km away; the master there, Mr Kevan, would teach Lawson about poetry. Lawson was a keen reader of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[Frederick Marryat|Marryat]] and Australian novels such as [[Marcus Clarke]]'s ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'' (1874) and [[Rolf Boldrewood]]'s ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'' (1882); an aunt had also given him a volume by [[Bret Harte]]. Reading became a major source of his education because, due to his deafness, he had trouble learning in the classroom.

In 1883, after working on building jobs with his father in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], Lawson joined his mother in Sydney at her request. Louisa was then living with Henry's sister and brother. At this time, Lawson was working during the day and studying at night for his matriculation in the hopes of receiving a university education. However, he failed his exams. Lawson lived in a boarding house along [[William Street, Sydney|William Street]] and wrote a poem titled [https://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/lawson-henry/poems/william-street-0107009 William Street]. Lawson also spent time in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] at the Wickham School of Arts while working for the Hudson Brothers branch railway workshops. He remarked that he "haunted the School of Arts, still with an idea of learning before it was too late."<ref>{{Cite web|last=University of Newcastle, Special Collections|date=2018-09-10|title=Henry Lawson and the Wickham School of Arts|url=https://hunterlivinghistories.com/2018/09/11/henry-lawson-wickham-soa/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-30|website=Hunter Living Histories|language=en-AU}}</ref> At around 20 years of age Lawson went to the eye and ear hospital in [[Melbourne]] but nothing could be done for his deafness.<ref name=DAB/>

In 1890 he began a relationship with [[Mary Gilmore]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gilmore-dame-mary-jean-6391|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=W. H.|last=Wilde|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}</ref> She writes of an unofficial engagement and Lawson's wish to marry her, but it was broken by his frequent absences from Sydney. The story of the relationship is told in [[Anne Brooksbank]]'s play ''All My Love''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/literary-lovers3a-henry-lawson-and-henry-lawson-and-mary-gilmo/6627114|title=Literary lovers: Henry Lawson and Mary Gilmore|date=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glenstreet.com.au/whats/all-my-love|title=All My Love - Glen Street Theatre|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181357/http://www.glenstreet.com.au/whats/all-my-love|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>

In 1896, Lawson married Bertha Bredt, Jr., daughter of [[Bertha Bredt]], the prominent socialist. The marriage ended very unhappily.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Falkiner, Suzanne | title=Wilderness | date=1992 | page=64 | publisher=Simon & Schuster | isbn=978-0-7318-0144-2 | author1-link=Falkiner, Suzanne }}</ref> Bertha filed for divorce and in her [[affidavit]] she stated: {{Cquote|''My husband has during three years and upwards been a habitual drunkard and habitually been guilty of cruelty towards me. My affidavit consists of the acts and matters following. That my husband during the last three years struck me in the face and about the body and blacked my eye and hit me with a bottle and attempted to stab me and pulled me out of bed when I was ill and purposely made a noise in my room when I was ill and pulled my hair and repeatedly used abusive and insulting language to me and was guilty of divers other acts of cruelty to me whereby my health and safety are endangered.''}}

A judicial separation was granted and was declared in June 1903.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A wife's heart|last=1972-|first=Davies, Kerrie|isbn=9780702259197|location=St Lucia, Qld.|oclc=960694840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/henry-lawsons-marriage-a-dark-tale-of-drink-and-domestic-violence/news-story/9231066f3db506de4c230d215fb9038d|title=Henry Lawson's marriage a dark tale of drink and domestic violence|last=Davies|first=Kerrie|date=1 April 2017|work=The Australian|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> They had two children, son Jim (Joseph) and daughter Bertha.

== Poetry and prose writing ==
[[Image:Archibald.jpg|thumb|left|Lawson (right) with [[J. F. Archibald]], founder of ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'']]

Henry Lawson's first published poem was 'A Song of the Republic' which appeared in ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', 1 October 1887; his mother's republican friends were an influence. This was followed by 'The Wreck of the [[Derry Castle (barque)|Derry Castle]]' and then 'Golden Gully.' Prefixed to the former poem was an editorial note:
{{Cquote|''In publishing the subjoined verses we take pleasure in stating that the writer is a boy of 17 years, a young Australian, who has as yet had an imperfect education and is earning his living under some difficulties as a housepainter, a youth whose poetic genius here speaks eloquently for itself.''}} 
Lawson was 20 years old, not 17.<ref name=DAB/>

In 1890-1891 Lawson worked in [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]].<ref>{{Citation | author1=Falkiner, Suzanne | title=Wilderness | date=1992 | page=62 | publisher=Simon & Schuster | isbn=978-0-7318-0144-2 }}</ref> He then received an offer to write for the Brisbane ''Boomerang'' in 1891, but he lasted only around 7–8 months as the ''Boomerang'' was soon in trouble. While in Brisbane he contributed to [[William Lane]]'s [[The Worker (Brisbane)|Worker]]; he later angled for an editorial position with the similarly named ''[[The Worker (Wagga)|Worker]]'' of Sydney, but was unsuccessful.<ref name=DAB/> He returned to Sydney and continued to write for the ''Bulletin'' which, in 1892, paid for an inland trip where he experienced the harsh realities of drought-affected New South Wales.<ref name="Elder 113">{{Citation | author1=Elder, Bruce | title=In Lawson's tracks [The Henry Lawson Trail from Bourke (NSW) to Hungerford (Qld).

Lawson's most successful prose collection is ''While the Billy Boils'', published in 1896.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Falkiner, Suzanne | title=Wilderness | date=1992 | page=63 | publisher=Simon & Schuster | isbn=978-0-7318-0144-2 }}</ref> In it he "continued his assault on Paterson and the romantics, and in the process, virtually reinvented Australian realism".<ref name="Elder 113"/> Elder writes that "he used short, sharp sentences, with language as raw as [[Ernest Hemingway]] or [[Raymond Carver]]. With sparse adjectives and honed-to-the-bone description, Lawson created a style and defined Australians: dryly laconic, passionately egalitarian and deeply humane."<ref name="Elder 113"/> Most of his work focuses on the [[Australian outback|Australian bush]], such as the desolate "Past Carin'", and is considered by some to be among the first accurate descriptions of Australian life as it was at the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} "The Drover's Wife" with its "heart-breaking depiction of bleakness and loneliness" is regarded as one of his finest short stories.<ref name = "BE113">Elder (2008) p. 113</ref> It is regularly studied in schools and has often been adapted for film and theatre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Rachel|title=Keeping bush ballads alive and well|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Arts/Keeping-bush-ballads/2005/05/16/1116095902715.html|work=The Age|date=17 May 2005|access-date=11 December 2013}}</ref>

Lawson was a firm believer in the merits of the [[sketch story]], commonly known simply as 'the sketch,' claiming that "the sketch story is best of all."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Henry|title=A fantasy of man: Henry Lawson complete works, 1901-1922|year=1984|publisher=Lansdowne|isbn=0701818751|pages=987|editor=Leonard Cronin|chapter=Three or Four Archibalds and the Writer}}</ref> Lawson's [[Jack Mitchell (Fictional Character)|Jack Mitchell]] story ''[[On the Edge of a Plain]]'' is often cited as one of the most accomplished examples of the sketch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Henry|title=The Penguin Henry Lawson short stories|year=1986|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0140092153|pages=[https://archive.org/details/penguinhenrylaws00laws/page/11 11–12]|editor=Introduction by John Barnes|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/penguinhenrylaws00laws/page/11}}</ref>

Like the majority of Australians, Lawson lived in a city, but had had plenty of experience in outback life, in fact, many of his stories reflected his experiences in real life. In Sydney in 1898 he was a prominent member of the [[Dawn and Dusk Club]], a bohemian club of writer friends who met for drinks and conversation.

In 1903 he bought a room at Mrs Isabel Byers' Coffee Palace in North Sydney. This marked the beginning of a 20-year friendship between Mrs Byers and Lawson. Despite his position as the most celebrated Australian writer of the time, Lawson was deeply depressed and perpetually poor. He lacked money due to unfortunate royalty deals with publishers. His ex-wife repeatedly reported him for non-payment of child maintenance. He was gaoled at [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] for drunkenness, wife desertion, child desertion, and non-payment of child support seven times between 1905 and 1909, for a total of 159 days<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.sydney.edu.au/nodes/view/7484|title=Henry Lawson to Fred Shenstone from Darlinghurst Gaol (with inserts from Angus, Robertson & Shenstone publishers)|website=University of Sydney Library|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.sydney.edu.au/nodes/view/7486|title=Henry Lawson to Reverend John Walker from Darlinghurst Gaol|website=University of Sydney Library|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> and recorded his experience in the haunting poem "One Hundred and Three" (his prison number) which was published in 1908. He refers to the prison as "Starvinghurst Gaol" because of the meagre rations given to the inmates.<ref name="DC HL">{{cite web|title=Henry Lawson – poet of the people|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/stories/henry-lawson-poet-people|work=Discover Collections|date=4 September 2015|publisher=State Library of NSW|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/lawson-henry/one-hundred-and-three-0698001|title=One Hundred and Three - Henry Lawson - Poem - Australian Poetry Library|website=www.poetrylibrary.edu.au}}</ref>

At this time, Lawson became withdrawn, alcoholic, and unable to carry on the usual routine of life.

Mrs Byers (née Ward) was an excellent poet herself and, although of modest education, had been writing vivid poetry since her teens in a similar style to Lawson's. Long separated from her husband and elderly, Mrs Byers was, at the time she met Lawson, a woman of independent means looking forward to retirement. Byers regarded Lawson as Australia's greatest living poet, and hoped to sustain him well enough to keep him writing. She negotiated on his behalf with publishers, helped to arrange contact with his children, contacted friends and supporters to help him financially, and assisted and nursed him through his mental and alcohol problems. She wrote countless letters on his behalf and knocked on any doors that could provide Henry with financial assistance or a publishing deal.<ref name="DC HL"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Olive|title=The Good Wards of Windsor|year=2004|publisher=Deerubbin|isbn=0975099132|pages=49–53}}</ref>

It was in Mrs Isabel Byers' home that Henry Lawson died, of cerebral hemorrhage, in [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]], Sydney in 1922. He was given a state funeral. His death registration on the NSW Births, Deaths & Marriages index<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/Index/IndexingOrder.cgi/search?event=births|title = NSW Registry of Births Deaths & Marriages}}</ref> is ref. 10451/1922 and was recorded at the Petersham Registration District.<ref>{{cite web|title=NSW Registry of Births, Deaths & Marriages |url=http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/IndexSearch?form=IndexingSearch&SessionID=43058586&sname=lawson&gname=henry&fname=&mname=&event=deaths&frange=1922&trange=1922&place= |access-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125214928/http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/IndexSearch?form=IndexingSearch&SessionID=43058586&sname=lawson&gname=henry&fname=&mname=&event=deaths&frange=1922&trange=1922&place= |archive-date=25 November 2014}}</ref> It shows his parents as Peter and Louisa.  His funeral was attended by the Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] and the (later) Premier of [[New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] (who was the husband of Lawson's sister-in-law Hilda Bredt), as well as thousands of citizens.
