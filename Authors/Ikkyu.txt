{{nihongo|'''Ikkyū'''|一休宗純| Ikkyū Sōjun|1394–1481}} was an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], iconoclastic [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk and [[poet]]. He had a great impact on the infusion of Japanese art and literature with Zen attitudes and ideals,<ref name="Kodansha">Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, entry "Ikkyū" by James H. Sanford</ref> as well as on Zen itself, often breaking religious taboos with his stance against [[celibacy]].<ref name=Qiu>{{cite book|author=Peipei Qiu|title=Basho and the Dao: The Zhuangzi and the Transformation of Haikai|date=2005|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824828455}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Ikkyū was born in 1394 in a small suburb of [[Kyoto]]. It is generally held that he was the son of [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]] and a low-ranking court noblewoman.<ref name="Kodansha" /> His mother was forced to flee to Saga ([[:ja:嵯峨野|嵯峨]]), where Ikkyū was raised by servants. At the age of five, Ikkyū was separated from his mother and placed in a Rinzai Zen temple in Kyoto called [[Ankoku-ji]], as an acolyte.<ref name="Kodansha" /> The temple masters taught Chinese culture and language as part of the curriculum, a method termed ''Gozan Zen''. He was given the name Shuken, and learned about [[Chinese poetry]], art and literature.

===Training===
When Ikkyū turned thirteen he entered [[Kennin-ji]] in Kyoto to study Zen under a well known priest by the name of [[Botetsu]]. Here Ikkyū began to write poetry frequently that was non-traditional in form. He was openly critical of Kennin-ji's leadership in his poetry, disheartened with the social stratum and lack of [[zazen]] practice he saw around him.  In 1410, at the age of sixteen, Ikkyū left Kennin-ji and entered the temple [[Mibu-dera]], where an abbot named Seiso was in residence. He did not stay long, and soon found himself at [[Saikin-ji]] in the [[Lake Biwa]] region where he was the sole student of an abbot named Ken'o. It seemed Ikkyū had finally found a master that taught true Rinzai Zen as Ikkyū saw it. Ken'o was sporadic in his teaching style and was a strong believer in the supremacy of [[zazen]]. In 1414, when Ikkyū was 21, Ken'o died. Ikkyū performed funeral rites and fasted for seven days. In despair Ikkyū tried to [[suicide|kill himself]] by drowning himself in Lake Biwa, but was talked out of it from the shore by a servant of his mother.

Ikkyū soon found a new teacher in a master named Kaso at [[Zenko-an]], a branch temple of [[Daitoku-ji]]. Kaso was much like Ken'o in his style. For years he worked hard on assigned [[kōan]]s and made dolls for a local merchant in Kyoto.  In 1418 Ikkyū was given Case 15 of the [[Mumonkan]], ("The Gateless Gate", a famous set of 49 [[kōan]]s), known as "Tozan's Three (or 60?) Blows", which depicts Tozan becoming enlightened when Ummon rebukes him for wandering from one monastery to another. One day a band of blind singers performed at the temple and Ikkyū penetrated his koan while engrossed in the music. In recognition of his understanding Kaso gave Shuken the [[Dharma name]] Ikkyū, which roughly means ''One Pause.''  In 1420 Ikkyū was meditating in a boat on Lake Biwa when the sound of a crow sparked [[satori]]. Kaso confirmed this great enlightenment and granted Ikkyū ''[[inka shōmei|inka]]''. Ikkyū came up against the jealousy of Yoso, a more senior student who eventually came to run the monastery. In Ikkyū's poems, Yoso appears as a character unhealthily obsessed with material goods, who sold Zen to increase the prosperity of the temple.

===Vagabond===
Ikkyū could sometimes be a troublemaker. Known to drink in excess, he would often upset Kaso with his remarks and actions to guests. In response, Kaso gave inka to Yoso and made him Dharma heir. Ikkyū quickly left the temple and lived many years as a [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]. He was not alone, however, as he had a regular circle of notable artists and poets from that era. Around this time, he established a relationship with a blind singer, Mori, who became the love of his later life.

Ikkyū worked to live Zen outside of formal religious institutions. However, the [[Ōnin War]] had reduced Daitokuji to ashes, and Ikkyū was elected [[Abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]] late in life, a role he reluctantly took on. This firmly placed him in one of the most important Zen lineages. In 1481, Ikkyū died at the age of eighty-seven from acute [[fever|ague]].

==Impact==
Ikkyū is one of the most significant (and eccentric) figures in Zen history. To Japanese children, he is a folk hero, mischievous and always outsmarting his teachers and the ''[[shōgun]]''. In addition to passed down oral stories, this is due to the very popular animated TV series ''[[Ikkyū-san (TV series)|Ikkyū-san]]''.

In [[Rinzai]] [[Zen]] tradition, he is both heretic and saint.<ref name=Fleu>{{cite book|author=William R. LaFleur|title=Liquid Life: Abortion and Buddhism in Japan|date=2020|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400843671}}</ref> He was among the few Zen priests who addressed the subject of [[sexuality]] from a religious context, and he stood out for arguing that [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] was deepened by partaking in love and sex, including lovers, [[prostitute]]s and [[Homosexuality in Japan#Monastic same-sex "love"|monastic homosexuality]].<ref name=Qiu/><ref name=Fleu/><ref>{{cite book|title=Ikkyū and The Crazy Cloud Anthology: A Zen Poet of Medieval Japan|date=1986|publisher=University of Tokyo Press|isbn=9780860083405|page=33}}</ref> He believed that sex was part of the human nature, and therefore purer than hypocritical organizations and worldly pursuits. At the same time, he warned Zen against its own bureaucratic politicising.<ref name=Qiu/>

Usually he is referred to as one of the main influences on the [[Fuke Zen|Fuke]] sect of Rinzai zen, as he is one of the most famous flute player mendicants of the medieval times of Japan. The piece "Murasaki Reibo" is attributed to him. He is credited as one of the great influences on the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], and renowned as one of medieval Japan's greatest [[Japanese calligraphy|calligrapher]]s and ''[[sumi-e]]'' artists.

Ikkyū wrote in ''[[Kanbun]]'' style [[classical Chinese]], which was employed by many contemporary Japanese authors. For instance, the "Calling My Hand Mori's Hand" poem.
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|zh|我手何似森手
自信公風流主
發病治玉茎萌
且喜我会裏衆}}

My hand, how it resembles Mori's hand.
I believe the lady is the master of loveplay;
If I get ill, she can cure the jeweled stem.
And then they rejoice, the monks at my meeting.<ref>Tr. Arntzen 1987:158, note Ikkyū's use of the literary metaphor ''gyōkeihō'' 玉茎萌 "jeweled stem" meaning "phallus".</ref>}}
