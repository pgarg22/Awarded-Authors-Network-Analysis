'''George Michael Cohan''' (July 3, 1878<ref name=kenrick/>{{spaced ndash}}November 5, 1942) was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and theatrical producer.

Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a [[vaudeville]] act known as "The Four Cohans". Beginning with ''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan wrote more than 50 shows and published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards "[[Over There]]", "[[Give My Regards to Broadway]]", "[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]" and "[[You're a Grand Old Flag]]". As a composer, he was one of the early members of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers ([[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]]). He displayed remarkable theatrical longevity, appearing in films until the 1930s and continuing to perform as a headline artist until 1940.

Known in the decade before World War I as "the man who owned Broadway", he is considered the father of American musical comedy.<ref name=Benjamin/> His life and music were depicted in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942) and the 1968 musical ''[[George M!]]'' A [[Statue of George M. Cohan|statue of Cohan]] in [[Times Square]], New York City commemorates his contributions to American musical theatre.<ref name=Mondello>Mondello, Bob.

Cohan was born in 1878 in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. A baptismal certificate from [[St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (Providence, Rhode Island)|St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church]] (which gave the wrong first name for his mother) indicated that he was born on July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been "born on the Fourth of July!"<ref name=kenrick>[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]].

He and his sister made their Broadway debuts in 1893 in a sketch called ''The Lively Bootblack''. Temperamental in his early years, Cohan later learned to control his frustrations. During these years, Cohan originated his famous curtain speech: "My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you."<ref name=obit/>

As a child, Cohan and his family toured most of the year and spent summer vacations from the vaudeville circuit at his grandmother's home in [[North Brookfield, Massachusetts|North Brookfield]], Massachusetts, where Cohan befriended baseball player [[Connie Mack]].<ref name=Mack>Macht, Norman L.

Cohan's memories of those happy summers inspired his 1907 musical ''50 Miles from Boston'', which is set in North Brookfield and contains one of his most famous songs, "[[Harrigan (song)|Harrigan]]". As Cohan matured through his teens, he used the quiet summers there to write. When he returned to the town in the cast of ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' in 1934, he told a reporter "I've knocked around everywhere, but there's no place like North Brookfield."<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WO&p_theme=wo&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=allfields(cohan)%20AND%20date(7/2/2000%20to%207/2/2000)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=7/2/2000%20to%207/2/2000)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22cohan%22)&xcal_numdocs=50&p_perpage=25&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no "Give My Regards to North Brookfield: Creator of 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' Called Family Vacation Spot 'Home'"], ''[[Telegram & Gazette]]'', [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts, July 2, 2000, accessed July 23, 2014 (fee required)</ref>

From 1904 to 1920, Cohan created and produced over 50 musicals, plays and [[revues]] on Broadway together with his friend [[Sam H.

===Later career===
[[File:George M. Cohan by Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|upright|Cohan in a 1933 photograph by [[Carl Van Vechten]].]]
Cohan appeared in 1930 in ''The Song and Dance Man'', a revival of his tribute to vaudeville and his father.<ref name=obit/> In 1932, Cohan starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film ''[[The Phantom President]]''. The film co-starred [[Claudette Colbert]] and [[Jimmy Durante]], with songs by [[Rodgers and Hart]], and was released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, ''Gambling'' (1934), based on his [[Gambling (play)|own 1929 play]] and shot in New York City. A critic called ''Gambling'' a "stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique".<ref>{{cite book|last=Koszarski|first=Richard| title=Hollywood On the Hudson: Film and Television in New York from Griffith to Sarnoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EF2xmI5pEx8C&pg=PA283|access-date=2014-05-11|pages=283–284 |date=2008-08-27|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4552-3}}</ref> It is considered a [[lost film]].<ref>McCabe, p. 229</ref>

Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s only comedy ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1933) and in the role of a song-and-dance President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s musical ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'' (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play titled ''Fulton of Oak Falls'', starring Cohan. His final play, ''The Return of the Vagabond'' (1940), featured a young [[Celeste Holm]] in the cast.<ref>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/cohanbio4.htm "Cohan Bio: Part III: Comebacks"].

In 1940, [[Judy Garland]] played the title role in [[Little Nellie Kelly|a film version]] of his 1922 musical ''[[Little Nellie Kelly (musical)|Little Nellie Kelly]]''. Cohan's mystery play ''Seven Keys to Baldpate'' was first filmed in 1916 and has been remade seven times, most recently as ''[[House of the Long Shadows]]'' (1983), starring [[Vincent Price]]. In 1942, a musical biopic of Cohan, ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', was released, and [[James Cagney]]'s performance in the title role earned the Best Actor [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].<ref name=Cagney>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m6O5-spILIUC&pg=PA167|title=Historical Dictionary of Contemporary American Theater: 1930-2010|last=Fisher|first=James|date=2011-06-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=167|isbn=9780810879508}}</ref> The film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer, and he commented on Cagney's performance: "My God, what an act to follow!"<ref>Ebert, Roger.

==Legacy==
Although Cohan mainly is remembered for his songs, he became an early pioneer in the development of the "[[book musical]]", using his engaging libretti to bridge the gaps between drama and music. More than three decades before [[Agnes de Mille]] choreographed ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', Cohan used dance not merely as razzle-dazzle, but to advance the plot. Cohan's main characters were "average Joes and Janes" who appealed to a wide American audience.<ref>Hischak, Thomas S. ''Boy Loses Girl'' {{ISBN|0-8108-4440-0}}</ref>

In 1914, Cohan became one of the founding members of [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]].<ref name=song/> Although Cohan was known as generous to his fellow actors in need,<ref name=obit/> in 1919, he unsuccessfully opposed a historic strike by [[Actors' Equity Association]], for which many in the theatrical professions never forgave him. Cohan opposed the strike because in addition to being an actor in his productions, he was also the producer of the musical that set the terms and conditions of the actors' employment. During the strike, he donated $100,000 to finance the Actors' Retirement Fund in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. After Actors' Equity was recognized, Cohan refused to join the union as an actor, which hampered his ability to appear in his own productions. Cohan sought a waiver from Equity allowing him to act in any theatrical production. In 1930, Cohan won a law case against the [[Internal Revenue Service]] that allowed the deduction, for federal income tax purposes, of his business travel and entertainment expenses, even though he was not able to document them with certainty. This became known as the "Cohan rule" and frequently is cited in tax cases.<ref>[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~bandy/cohan.htm "George M. Cohan, Petitioner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Respondent"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718100255/http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~bandy/cohan.htm |date=2009-07-18 }}.

Cohan wrote numerous Broadway musicals and straight plays in addition to contributing material to shows written by others&mdash;more than 50 in all.<ref name=obit/> Cohan shows included ''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' (1904), ''[[Forty-five Minutes from Broadway]]'' (1905), ''George Washington, Jr.'' (1906), ''The Talk of New York'' and ''The Honeymooners'' (1907), ''Fifty Miles from Boston'' and ''The Yankee Prince'' (1908), ''Broadway Jones'' (1912), ''[[Seven Keys to Baldpate (play)|Seven Keys to Baldpate]]'' (1913), ''The American Idea'', ''Get Rich Quick Wallingford'', ''The Man Who Owns Broadway'', ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]'', ''The Cohan Revue of 1916'' (and ''1918''; co-written with [[Irving Berlin]]), ''The Tavern'' (1920), ''The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly'' (1923, featuring a 13-year-old [[Ruby Keeler]] among the chorus girls), ''The Song and Dance Man'' (1923), ''Molly Malone'', ''The Miracle Man'', ''Hello Broadway'', ''American Born'' (1925), ''The Baby Cyclone'' (1927, one of [[Spencer Tracy]]'s early breaks), ''Elmer the Great'' (1928, co-written with [[Ring Lardner]]), and ''Pigeons and People'' (1933).<ref name=obit/> At this point in his life, he walked in and out of retirement.<ref name=song>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C213 "George M.
