==Poetic career==

McKay is the author of twelve books of poetry, including ''Birding, or Desire'' (1986), ''Apparatus'' (1997) and ''Paradoxides'' (2012). He has twice won the [[Governor General's Award]], for ''Night Field'' (1991) and ''Another Gravity'' (2000).  In June 2007, he won the [[Griffin Poetry Prize]] for ''Strike/Slip'' (2006). Beginning in 2002, he has also published five books of non-fiction prose, mixing [[nature writing]], thoughts on poetics, and philosophical and environmental reflections. Critical discourse has included him in a group of Canadian poets known as the 'thinking and singing poets,' along with Robert Bringhurst, Dennis Lee, Tim Lilburn and Jan Zwicky.  

McKay, published since 1973, is described as ' a poet with a patient eye, an acute arresting ear, over flowing with details of ornithology, botany, weather, industry, books and music; nuanced descriptions, philosophical phrasing, folksy idiom. madcap humour and elegy'.<ref>Synopsis 'Don McKay, Essays on his works' ed.Brian Bartlett Guernica Editions 2007 {{ISBN|978 1550712520}}</ref> Others,<ref>Wells,Zachariah  'Faulty lines:The Poetry and Poetics of Don McKay ' Poetry Review.ca May 2006</ref> consider 'awe, astonishment and wonder to be the keynotes of McKay's poems and poetics' and that his prime subject matter to be 'the workings of the human mind'.

McKay has also made a wide impression as a teacher and editor. He was the co-founder and a manuscript reader for Brick Books [http://www.brickbooks.ca/about .], one of Canada's leading poetry presses, and was editor of the literary journal ''[[The Fiddlehead]]'' from 1991 to 1996. He has participated in the Sage Hill Writing experience in [[Saskatchewan]] and was Associate Director for poetry at the [[Banff Centre for the Arts]] Writing Studio. He has mentored many fellow poets, including [[Ken Babstock]], Marlene Cookshaw, Barbara Colebrook Peace, [[Michael Redhill]], Anne Simpson and Sue Sinclair. 

McKay is an avid [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]];<ref>Cook, Meira , Introduction 'Field Marks' by Don McKay Wilfrid Laurier University Press Aug 2009</ref> and bird themes and flight are dominant topics in his poetry. In ''Birding, or Desire'' (1983), the quirky protagonist is never far from his ''Birds of Canada'' hobbyist's field guide. McKay's passion for birds and nature percolates throughout all of his work, and some consider 'McKay's preferred environment is located in the natural world'.<ref>Emslie, Susan 'Got to Meander:Excursions and Excursionist figures in Don McKay:Wascana Review 30.1 1995</ref> McKay himself sees his writing as "nature poetry in a time of environmental crisis."<ref>McKay, Don. ''Vis-à-Vis: Field Notes on Poetry & Wilderness''. Wolfville: Gaspereau Press, 2001, p.9.</ref> McKay's poems are ecologically centred, inspired by the conflict between inspiration and spirit, instinct and knowledge.

In his book of poetic philosophy ''Vis à Vis: Field Notes on Poetry & Wilderness'', McKay details many of his beliefs on metaphor, wildness, and the homing instinct.
In that book, his definitive 1993 essay 'Baler Twine' describes those moments 'before wrestling with words and music ', a 'state of mind ' ,a preparedness, which he labels as 'poetic attention'; and further describes as a 'sort of readiness ', a 'form of knowing'. McKay also touches on his other main poetic themes of 'Wilderness', 'Home', and 'Matériel' (material existence).
