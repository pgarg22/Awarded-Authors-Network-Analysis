==Early life==
Adcock, the older of two sisters, was born in [[Papakura]] to Cyril John Adcock and Irene Robinson Adcock. Her birth name was Kareen Fleur Adcock, but she was known as Fleur and legally changed her name to Fleur Adcock in 1982. She spent eight years of her childhood (1939–1947) in [[England]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

Adcock studied [[Classics]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1954 and a [[Masters of Arts]] in 1956.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Adcock|first=Fleur|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/beyond-expectations-fourteen-new-zealand-women-write-about-their-lives/oclc/1103883342|title=Beyond expectations: fourteen New Zealand women write about their lives|publisher=Allen & Unwin/Port Nicholson Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-86861-650-6|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Margaret|location=Wellington, N.Z|pages=99–111|language=en|chapter=A lifetime of writing|oclc=1103883342}}</ref> 

== Career ==
Adcock worked as an assistant lecturer in classics and librarian at the [[University of Otago]] in [[Dunedin]] between 1958 and 1962, and as a librarian at the [[National Library of New Zealand|Alexander Turnbull Library]] in Wellington between 1962 and 1963.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> 

In 1963, she returned to England and took up a post as a librarian at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in London. She had already had poems published in a few literary journals in New Zealand at this time.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Janet |title=Fleur Adcock |date=2007 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-1-78694-274-6 |page=47 |jstor=j.ctv5qdhns |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5qdhns |access-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> Her first collection of poetry, ''The Eye of the Hurricane'', was published in New Zealand in 1964, and in 1967 ''Tigers'' was her first collection published in Britain.<ref name="OCNZL" /><ref name=":0" /> 

In 1975, Adcock returned briefly to New Zealand for the first time since she had left for London, and on returning to London in 1976, she became a full time writer. She was the Arts Council Creative Writing Fellow at the [[Charlotte Mason|Charlotte Mason College of Education]] in [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] from 1977-1978, followed by the Northern Arts Literary Fellowship at the universities of [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] and [[Durham University|Durham]] from 1979–1981.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name="Wilson" />

Since 1980, Adcock has worked as a freelance writer, living in [[East Finchley]], north London, a translator and poetry commentator for the [[BBC]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Fleur Adcock {{!}} Biography, Poems, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fleur-Adcock|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref>

Adcock's poetry is typically concerned with themes of place, human relationships and everyday activities, but frequently with a dark twist given to the mundane events she writes about. Formerly, her early work was influenced by her training as a classicist but her more recent work is looser in structure and more concerned with the world of the unconscious mind.<ref name=":1" /> The ''Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'' (2006) notes that her poems are often written from the perspective of an outsider or express a divided sense of identity inherited from her own emigrant experience and separation from New Zealand family.<ref name="OCNZL" />

In 2006, Adcock won one of Britain's top poetry awards, the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]], for her collected works, ''Poems 1960-2000''.<ref name="Queen's Gold">{{cite news |last1=Lea |first1=Richard |title=Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry awarded to Fleur Adcock |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/24/news.richardlea |access-date=6 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=24 April 2006}}</ref> She was only the seventh female poet to receive the award in its 73 years.

== Personal life ==
Adcock was married to two notable New Zealand literary personalities. In August 1952, she married [[Alistair Campbell (poet)|Alistair Campbell]] (divorced 1958), and in February 1962 she married [[Barry Crump]], divorcing in 1963. She has two sons, Gregory and Andrew, both with her first husband.<ref name=":1" /> 

Adcock's mother Irene Adcock is also a writer, and her sister [[Marilyn Duckworth]] is a novelist.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="OCNZL" /><ref name=":0" />
