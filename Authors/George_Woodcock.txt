He was also a [[poet]] and published several volumes of [[travel literature|travel writing]].<ref name="Colombo1984">{{cite book|author=John Robert Colombo|title=Canadian Literary Landmarks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0zbdUkJkm10C&pg=PA280|access-date=September 12, 2013|date=January 1, 1984|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-0-88882-073-0|pages=280–}}</ref> In 1959 he was the founding editor of the journal ''[[Canadian Literature (journal)|Canadian Literature]]'' which was the first academic journal specifically dedicated to Canadian writing.<ref name="Reznowski2011">{{cite book|author=Gabriella Reznowski|title=Literary Research and Canadian Literature: Strategies and Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ps26JhFFS8wC&pg=PA89|access-date=September 12, 2013|date=February 7, 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7769-6|pages=89–}}</ref> He is most commonly known outside Canada for his book ''[[Anarchism (Woodcock book)|Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements]]'' (1962).

==Life==
Woodcock was born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], but moved with his parents to [[England]] at an early age, attending [[Sir William Borlase's Grammar School]] in Marlow and [[Morley College]]. Though his family was quite poor, Woodcock's grandfather offered to pay his tuition if he went to [[Cambridge University]] which he turned down due to the condition that he undertake seminary training for the [[Anglican clergy]].<ref>[http://www.canlit.ca/woodcock.php Canadian Literature, "About George Woodcock"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117170252/http://canlit.ca/woodcock.php |date=January 17, 2011 }} Retrieved August 19, 2013.</ref> Instead, he took a job as a [[clerk]] at the [[Great Western Railway]] and it was there that he first became interested in anarchism. He was to remain an anarchist for the rest of his life, writing several books on the subject, including ''Anarchism'', the anthology ''The Anarchist Reader'' (1977), and biographies of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[William Godwin]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. It was during these years that he met several prominent literary figures, including [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Aldous Huxley]], and forging a particularly close relationship with the [[art theorist]] [[Herbert Read]].<ref>David Goodway, ''Herbert Read Reassessed'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1998) p.5</ref> Woodcock's first published work was ''The White Island'', a collection of [[poetry]], which was issued by [[Fortune Press]] in 1940.<ref name="Ogunyemi2005">{{cite book|author=Yemi Ogunyemi|title=The Writers and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CYXzZITDqcC&pg=PA12|access-date=September 12, 2013|date=July 15, 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4620-9131-7|pages=12–}}</ref>

Woodcock spent [[World War II]] working as a [[conscientious objector]] on a farm in [[Essex]], and in 1949, moved to [[British Columbia]].

At [[Camp Angel]] in [[Oregon]], a camp for [[conscientious objectors]], he was a founder of the [[Untide Press]], which sought to bring poetry to the public in an inexpensive but attractive format. Following the war, he returned to Canada, eventually settling in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. In 1955, he took a post in the English department of the [[University of British Columbia]], where he stayed until the 1970s. Around this time he started to write more prolifically, producing several travel books and collections of poetry, as well as the works on anarchism for which he is best known in collaboration with [[Ivan Avakumović]].

Towards the end of his life, Woodcock became increasingly interested in what he saw as the plight of [[Tibet]]ans. He traveled to [[India]], studied [[Buddhism]], became friends with the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] and established the Tibetan Refugee Aid Society. With Inge, his wife, Woodcock established Canada India Village Aid, which sponsors self-help projects in rural [[India]]. Both organizations exemplify Woodcock's ideal of voluntary cooperation between peoples across national boundaries.

George and Inge also established a program to support professional Canadian writers. The Woodcock Fund, which began in 1989, provides financial assistance to writers in mid-book-project who face an unforeseen financial need that threatens the completion of their book. The Fund is available to writers of fiction, creative non-fiction, plays, and poetry. The Woodcocks helped create an endowment for the program in excess of two million dollars. The Woodcock Fund program is administered by the [[Writers' Trust of Canada]] and by March 2012 had distributed $887,273 to 180 Canadian writers.<ref>[http://www.writerstrust.com/Programs/Financial-Grant.aspx The Woodcock Fund] [[Writers' Trust of Canada]]. Retrieved August 19, 2013.</ref>

George Woodcock died at his home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on January 28, 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/obituaries/george-woodcock-writer-dies-at-82.html|title=George Woodcock, Writer, Dies at 82|author=[[The Associated Press]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 1, 1995|accessdate= September 11, 2013}}</ref>

==Orwell==
Woodcock first came to know [[George Orwell]] after they had a public disagreement in the pages of the ''[[Partisan Review]]''. In his "[[London Letter]]" published in the March–April 1942 issue of the review, Orwell had written that in the context of a war against fascism, [[pacifism]] was "objectively [[fascism|pro-fascist]]".<ref name="My Country Right or Left">Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.) ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2: My Country Right or Left'', pp. 210–212 (London, Penguin)</ref> As the founder and editor of ''[[Now (1940–1947)|Now]]'', an "anti-war paper" which Orwell had mentioned in his article as an example of publications that published contributions by both [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and [[fascists]], Woodcock took exception to this.<ref name="My Country Right or Left"/>{{rp|257}} Woodcock stated that "the review had abandoned its position as an independent forum", and was now "the cultural review of the British Anarchist movement".<ref name="My Country Right or Left"/> Despite this difference, the two became good friends and kept up a correspondence until Orwell's death, and ''Now'' would publish Orwell's article "[[How the Poor Die]]" in its November 6, 1946 issue.<ref name="Bowker2013">{{cite book|author=Gordon Bowker|author-link=Gordon Bowker (writer)|title=George Orwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brRjuvvrbzgC&pg=PT477|access-date=September 11, 2013|date=March 14, 2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1-4055-2805-4|pages=477–}}</ref>

Woodcock and Orwell would both also be active members of the [[Freedom Defence Committee]].

Woodcock later wrote ''[[The Crystal Spirit]]'' (1966), a critical study of Orwell and his work which won a [[1966 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]].<ref name=matt>[http://hpcanpub.mcmaster.ca/case-study/canada-and-abroad-diverse-publishing-career-george-woodcock Hiebert, Matt.

==Recognition==
Woodcock was honoured with several awards, including a Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1968, the UBC Medal for Popular Biography in 1973 and 1976, and the [[Molson Prize]] in 1973. In 1970, he received an honorary doctorate from [[Sir George Williams University]], which later became [[Concordia University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/woodcock|title=Honorary Degree Citation - George Woodcock* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref> However, he only accepted awards given by his peers, refusing several awards given by the Canadian state, including the [[Order of Canada]]. The one exception was the award of the Freedom of the City of Vancouver, which he accepted in 1994.<ref>[http://vancouver.ca/your-government/freedom-of-the-city-honorees-prior-to-2010.aspx Freedom of the City honorees] City of Vancouver Official Site.
