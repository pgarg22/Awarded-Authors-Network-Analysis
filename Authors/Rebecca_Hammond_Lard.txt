'''Rebecca Hammond Lard (Laird)''' (born '''Rebecca Hammond'''; March 7, 1772 – September 28, 1855),  is called by some critics "the first poet in [[Indiana]]".<ref name="indianabkrec">Cavinder, Fred D.

Lard's works are mainly religious and meditative in tone, but draw their inspiration in part from the [[Bucolics]] and [[Georgics]] of [[Virgil]].<ref>Goodrich, J. E.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Rebecca (sometimes Rebekah) Lard (Laird) was born on March 7, 1772, in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], to parents Jabez and Priscilla (Delano) Hammond.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mattapoisett (Mass.)|author2=Leonard, Mary Hall|title=Mattapoisett and Old Rochester, Massachusetts|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPwcAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA382|accessdate=September 20, 2012|year=1907|publisher=The Grafton press|page=382|chapter=Infant Baptisms}}</ref><ref name="SCRrecords">{{cite book|author=Rochester (Mass.)|title=Vital Records of Rochester, Massachusetts: To the Year 1850|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hM4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA154|accessdate=September 20, 2012|year=1914|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|page=154|chapter=Records of the Second Church of Rochester.}}</ref> The following month, she was baptized at Mattapoisett in [[Rochester, Massachusetts]].<ref name="SCRrecords" /> Lard was the oldest of ten children.<ref name="HammondFamilyRecord">{{cite web |url=http://www.lynnesgenealogy.com/HammondDescendants/website/b932.htm |title=Fourth Generation |publisher=Lynnesgenealogy.com |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128042750/http://www.lynnesgenealogy.com/HammondDescendants/website/b932.htm |archivedate=2013-01-28 }}</ref> Jabez Hammond Jr. named his other children, from the next of oldest to the youngest: Abigail, Caleb, Jabez Delano, Priscilla, George C, Mary, Rhoda, Thankful and Philip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/39113745 |title=Jabez Hammond (1741–1807) |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> At age ten, Rebecca moved with her father's family from Rochester to [[Woodstock, Vermont]].<ref name="HammondFamilyRecord" /> On her mother's side of the family, her great grandmother was sister to [[William Penn]].<ref name="CoffeeCreek">{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jlopp/coffeecreek.html |title=Coffee Creek Baptist Church Cemetery |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>

At the age of fourteen Rebecca began to teach at a school; she became a teacher despite a lack of schooling herself but relied on her own talents. Her brother, [[Jabez Delano Hammond]], followed in her footsteps and began teaching at the age of fifteen, eight years later. Hammond continued to read and practice medicine in [[Reading, Vermont]], and also to read and practice law in [[Cherry Valley, New York]], where he was elected a member of Congress. Rebecca would later dedicate her first book to this brother.<ref name="BoV">{{cite book|last=Gilman|first=Marcus Davis|title=The Bibliography of Vermont|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1I0AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150|accessdate=September 20, 2012|year=1897|publisher=Printed by the Free press association|pages=150–151}}</ref>

===Family===

Rebecca Hammond married Samuel Laird on February 12, 1801 in Woodstock, Vermont and had four children.<ref name="SamuelLaird">{{cite web|url=http://www.ingenweb.org/injennings/bios.html |title=Biographical Sketches of Early Settlers of the Jennings County Area |publisher=Ingenweb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> She continued to teach, being her chief occupation there.<ref name="BoV" /><ref name="rarebook">{{cite web|url=http://rarebooksmailinglist.com/pipermail/rarebooks_rarebooksmailinglist.com/2004-January/000180.html |title=Poetry by Women in English: 1773-1863 |publisher=Rarebookmailinglist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> About 1807 Samuel moved the Laird family to [[Hancock, Vermont]], and from there to [[Cherry Valley, New York]], where her brother was living at that time. From there, Samuel decided to migrate to Indiana.<ref name="SamuelLaird" />

Rebecca refused to join him, taking her children back to Vermont to be with her own family, instead.<ref name="SamuelLaird" /> Marcus Davis Gilman said of her, "Her life struggle appears to have been a severe one, having a family of four children dependent upon her for support from their childhood, but bravely did she triumph over all obstacles".<ref name="BoV" />

Samuel Laird filed land entry papers in 1815 for 160 acres in [[Montgomery Township, Jennings County, Indiana]]. Their son, Samuel Jr., joined his father in 1817. They made a permanent home there on Graham Creek. In 1819, Samuel Jr. returned to convince his mother to bring the family west.<ref name="SamuelLaird" />

At some unknown date, prior to the birth of their children, Samuel changed the spelling of his surname to LAIRD from LARD.  All of their children and descendants carry the name of LAIRD.
===Poetry===
{{Quote box |width=350px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote  =<poem>
The power that form’d the hills and spread the plain
And bade the rivers roll towards the main
By the same fiat gave this clime to rise 
And bloom in splendour ‘neath the western skies
Crown’d with his richest gifts this favour’d land'
And pour’d his bounties with unsparing hand

Then beasts of prey here found a resting place
And savage men delighted in the chase.
No cultering hand improv’d the fertile soil
But herbs and flowers in wild confusion lay 
And trees umbrageous veil’d the noontide ray. 
</poem>
 |source = from "On the Banks of the Ohio."<ref name="landandlit.iweb"/>}}

Rebecca's first collection of 143 pages of poetry, ''Miscellaneous Poems'' by a Lady, was first published by David Watson of Woodstock in 1820 as ''Miscellaneous Poems on Moral and Religious Subjects'' by a Lady.<ref name="rarebook" /> She dedicated this work to her brother, [[Jabez Delano Hammond]].<ref name="BoV" /> In these poems, she talks about beauty, death, and feeling by comparing them to phenomena in nature.<ref name="landandlit.iweb" />

Rebecca's twelve-page poem, ''On the Banks of the Ohio'', was published in 1823 as a booklet and was featured widely by many magazines and papers.<ref name="wabash.lib" /><ref name="BoV" /><ref name="rarebook" /> This is recorded as Indiana's first published poetry.<ref name="indianabkrec" /> In this poem, Rebecca talks about the area's landscape and the beauty of undisturbed nature. She also describes the native people as dangerous.<ref name="landandlit.iweb" />

An old edition of Rebecca's five-page volume of verse is maintained in the collection of the Historical and Philosophical Society of Ohio, [[Cincinnati]], and an undated clipping of the ''Cincinnati Gazette'' identifies the work as that of Mrs. Lard, "a lady of Indiana".<ref name="wabash.lib" />

===Divorce and death===
Rebecca left Montgomery township in 1823 to become a school teacher in [[Vernon, Indiana]]. A cabin was built there by John Vawter to serve as the area's schoolhouse and board Mrs. Laird as a means of payment.<ref name="JCHS">"Montgomery Township." ''Jennings County --Indiana-- 1816-1999''. Jennings County Historical Society. 1999. p.85.</ref> She was one of the first women school teachers in Jennings county<ref name="CoffeeCreek" /> and taught some of the best minds in Indiana.<ref name="BoV" /> Among her students were Squire Billy Deputy's children.<ref name="CoffeeCreek" />

In 1826, Samuel started divorce proceedings against Rebecca for not returning after leaving him.<ref name="JCHS" /> He was granted a divorce on March 4, 1828, in the Jennings County court.<ref name="CoffeeCreek" /> Rebecca later left the Vernon area of Jennings county and returned south. She started teaching at Solomon's Temple by Coffee Creek.<ref name="JCHS" />

Rebecca Laird died on September 28, 1855, and is buried at the Coffee Creek Baptist Church Cemetery in [[Paris Crossing, Indiana]].<ref>"Rebecca H. Laird".
