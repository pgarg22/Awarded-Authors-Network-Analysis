|quote =<poem>
It was a yellow voice, a high, shrill treble in the nursery
White always and high, I remember it so,
White cupboard, off-white table, mugs, dolls' faces
And I was four or five. The garden could have been
Miles away. We were taken down to the green
Asparagus beds, the cut lawn, and the smell of it
Comes each summer after rain when white returns. Our bird,
A canary called Peter, sang behind bars. The black and white cat
Curled and snoozed by the fire and danger was far away.
</poem>

Jennings' early poetry was published in journals such as ''Oxford Poetry'', ''New English Weekly'', ''The Spectator'', ''Outposts'' and ''Poetry Review'', but her first book was not published until she was 27. The lyrical poets she cited as having influenced her were [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[W. H. Auden|Auden]], [[Robert Graves|Graves]] and [[Edwin Muir|Muir]].<ref Name="Couzyn"/> Her second book, ''A Way of Looking'', won the Somerset Maugham award and marked a turning point, as the prize money allowed her to spend nearly three months in [[Rome]], which was a revelation. It brought a new dimension to her religious belief and inspired her imagination.<ref Name="Couzyn"/>

Regarded as traditionalist rather than an innovator, Jennings is known for her lyric poetry and mastery of form.<ref Name="Couzyn"/> Her work displays a simplicity of metre and rhyme shared with [[Philip Larkin]], [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[Thom Gunn]], all members of the group of English poets known as [[Movement (literature)|The Movement]].<ref Name="Couzyn"/> She always made it clear that, whilst her life, which included a spell of severe mental illness, contributed to the themes contained within her work, she did not write explicitly autobiographical poetry. Her deeply held [[Roman Catholicism]] coloured much of her work.<ref Name="Couzyn"/>

She spent the latter years of her life in Unity House (8 St Andrew's Lane) in Old Headington and died in a care home in [[Bampton, Oxfordshire]]. She is buried in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], Oxford.

The life and career of "the bag lady of the sonnets", as tabloid newspapers called her when honoured by the Queen in 1992, were reviewed in 2018 by Dana Gioia, concluding: "Despite her worldly failures, her artistic career was a steady course of achievement. Jennings ranks among the finest British poets of the second half of the twentieth century. She is also England’s best Catholic poet since Gerard Manley Hopkins."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/05/clarify-me-please-god-of-the-galaxies|title=Clarify Me, Please, God of the Galaxies - Dana Gioia}}</ref>

Jennings was a very prolific poet, meaning that she wrote many poems. Yet somehow she always managed to go back to her usual themes: love, religion, death, etc. Her poems are meant to engage many people who have suffered what she has, or perhaps shared experiences.
