'''Georg Moritz Ebers''' ([[Berlin]], 1 March 1837 – [[Tutzing]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], 7 August 1898) was a German [[Egyptologist]] and novelist. He is best known for his purchase of the [[Ebers Papyrus]], one of the oldest Egyptian medical documents in the world.

==Life==
Georg Ebers was born in Berlin and was the youngest of the five children of an affluent family of bankers and porcelain manufacturers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The German Historical Novel since the Eighteenth Century: More than a Bestseller|last=Richter|first=Daniela|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781443897662|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=47}}</ref> The Ebers children were raised by their mother on her own, after their father committed suicide shortly after Ebers was born.<ref name=":0" /> His mother ran a salon popular among members of the intelligentsia, which included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm Brothers]], and [[Alexander von Humboldt]].<ref name=":0" />

At [[Göttingen]], Ebers studied jurisprudence, and at Berlin Oriental languages and archaeology. Having made a special study of Egyptology, he became in 1865 ''[[Dozent]]'' in Egyptian language and antiquities at [[Jena]], becoming professor in 1868. In 1870 he was appointed professor in these subjects at [[Leipzig]]. He had made two scientific journeys to Egypt, and his first work of importance, ''Ägypten und die Bücher [[Moses]],'' appeared in 1867–1868. In 1874 he edited the celebrated medical papyrus (''Papyrus Ebers'') which he had discovered in Thebes (translation by H. Joachim, 1890).

Ebers early conceived the idea of popularising Egyptian lore by means of historical romances. ''Eine ägyptische Königstochter'' (''An Egyptian Princess'') was published in 1864 and obtained great success. His subsequent works of the same kind — ''Uarda'' (1877), ''Homo sum'' (1878), ''Die Schwestern'' (1880), ''Der Kaiser'' (1881), of which the scene is laid in Egypt at the time of [[Hadrian]], ''Serapis'' (1885), ''Die Nilbraut'' (1887), and ''[[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Kleopatra]]'' (1894) — were also well received, and did much to make the public familiar with the discoveries of Egyptologists.<ref>"Ebers had an extraordinary career, as Professor of Egyptology at Leipzig, journalist and best-selling novelist. His series of Egyptian-themed romances (''Varda, An Egyptian Princess, Cleopatra'', and others) helped stimulate interest in Egyptian artefacts and keep it alive." Dominic Montserrat, ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt''. London; Routledge, 2014 {{ISBN|9781134690343}} (p. 97).</ref> Ebers also turned his attention to other fields of historical fiction — especially the 16th century (''Die Frau Bürgermeisterin,'' 1882; ''Die Gred,'' 1887) — without, however, attaining the success of his Egyptian novels.

Ebers discovered the [[Ebers Papyrus]] (''ca.'' 1550 BCE) at [[Luxor]] ([[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]) in the winter of 1873–74. Now in the [[Leipzig University Library]], the Ebers Papyrus is among the most important ancient Egyptian medical papyri. It is one of two of the oldest preserved medical documents anywhere — the other being the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] (''ca.'' 1600 BCE). The Ebers Papyrus mentions more than 700 substances and medical recipes that include incantations and concoctions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular, Clinical and Environmental Toxicology: Volume 1: Molecular Toxicology|last=Luch|first=Andreas|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9783764383350|location=Basel|pages=5}}</ref> Ebers published it as a facsimile with an English-Latin vocabulary and introduction.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

His other writings include a descriptive work on Egypt (''Aegypten in Wort und Bild,'' 2nd ed., 1880); ''[[Palestine in Picture and Word]]'' (''{{lang|de|Palästina in Bild und Word}}''), an 1884 translation of the English series ''[[Picturesque Palestine, Sinai, and Egypt]]''; a life (1885) of his old teacher, the Egyptologist [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]; and a guide to Egypt (1886). In 1889, the state of his health led him to retire from his chair at Leipzig on a pension.

Ebers's ''Collected Works'' appeared in 25 volumes at [[Stuttgart]] (1893–1895). Many of his books have been translated into English. For his life, see his ''Die Geschichte meines Lebens'' (Stuttgart, 1893); also R. Gosche, ''G. Ebers, der Forscher und Dichter'' (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1887).

''Arachne'', which was published on 7 August 1898, was Ebers' last novel. It was written at the Villa Ebers in [[Tutzing]], near [[Munich]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Story of my Life from Childhood to Manhood |author=Georg Ebers |publisher=Outlook |year=2018 |isbn=9783734054358 |location=Frankfurt am Main |page=5}}</ref>
