Jules has also written stories inspired by her experiences as an elementary school librarian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sungazette.net/articles/2008/01/15/arlington/news/nws265.prt|title=INSIDENOVA.COM|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorincolorado.org/fromtheheart/27484|title=Jacqueline Jules - Colorín Colorado|work=Colorín Colorado|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref> ''No English'' is the story of two second grade girls who find a creative way to overcome a language barrier.

With ''Zapato Power: Freddie Ramos Takes Off'', Jules created a [[chapter book]] series about a boy who can outrun trains with his super-powered purple sneakers.
