==On writing for children==

In an essay on realism in children's literature, Paton Walsh stated that realism (like fantasy) is also metaphorical, and that she would like the relationship between the reader and her characters Bill and Julie to be as metaphorical as that between "dragons and the reader's greed or courage".<ref>{{cite book|title=Celebrating Children's Books: Essays on Children's Literature in Honor of Zena Sutherland|last=Walsh|first=Jill Paton|author2=Betsy Hearne, Marilyn Kaye (eds)|year=1981|publisher=Lathrop, Lee, and Shepard Books|location=New York|isbn=0-688-00752-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/celebratingchild00suth/page/37 37]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/celebratingchild00suth/page/37}}</ref>
