'''Lion Feuchtwanger''' ({{IPA-de|ˈliː.ɔn ˈfɔɪ̯çt.ˌvaŋ.ɐ|lang|De-Lion Feuchtwanger.ogg}}; 7 July 1884 – 21 December 1958) was a Bavarian Jewish novelist and playwright.  A prominent figure in the literary world of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], he influenced contemporaries including playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].

Feuchtwanger's [[Judaism]] and fierce criticism of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]], years before it assumed power, ensured that he would be a target of government-sponsored persecution after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s appointment as chancellor of Germany in January 1933.  Following a brief period of internment in France and a harrowing escape from [[Continental Europe]], he found asylum in the United States, where he died in 1958.

==Ancestry==
Feuchtwanger's [[Jewish]] ancestors originated from the [[Middle Franconia]]n city of [[Feuchtwangen]]; following a [[pogrom]] in 1555, it had expelled all its resident Jews. Some of the expellees subsequently settled in [[Fürth]], where they were called the Feuchtwangers, meaning those from Feuchtwangen.<ref>W. von Sternburg, ''Lion Feuchtwanger'', p. 40f</ref> Feuchtwanger's grandfather Elkan moved to [[Munich]] in the middle of the 19th century.<ref>R. Jaretzky, ''Lion Feuchtwanger'', p. 9</ref>

==Early life==
He was born in 1884 to [[Orthodox Jewish]] [[margarine]] manufacturer Sigmund Feuchtwanger and his wife, Johanna née Bodenheim. He was the oldest in a family of nine siblings of whom two, Martin and [[Ludwig Feuchtwanger]], became authors; Ludwig's son is the London-based historian [[Edgar Feuchtwanger]]. Two of his sisters settled in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] following the rise of the Nazi Party. One was killed in a concentration camp, and another settled in New York.

Feuchtwanger studied literature and philosophy in the universities of [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]]. He made his first attempt at writing while still a student and won an award. In 1903 in Munich, he passed his [[Abitur]] examinations at an elite school, [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (Munich)|Wilhelmsgymnasium]]. He then studied history, philosophy and German philology in Munich and Berlin. He received his PhD in 1907, under Francis Muncker, on [[Heinrich Heine]]'s ''The Rabbi of [[Bacharach]]''.

==Early career==

After studying a variety of subjects, he became a theatre critic and founded the culture magazine ''Der Spiegel'' in 1908.<ref>Marta Feuchtwanger: Nur eine Frau, Jahre Tage Stunden (Just a Woman, Years, Days, Hours), pub: [[Aufbau-Verlag]] Berlin Leipzig, 1984. p 143.</ref> The first issue appeared on 30 April. After 15 issues and six months, ''Der Spiegel'' merged with [[Siegfried Jacobsohn]]'s journal ''Die Schaubühne'' (renamed in 1918 to ''[[Die Weltbühne]]'') for which Feuchtwanger continued to write.  In 1912, he married a Jewish merchant's daughter, Marta Loeffler. She was pregnant at the wedding, but the child died shortly after birth.

At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Feuchtwanger served in the German military service but was released early for health reasons.  His experience as a soldier contributed to his leftist writings.

In 1916, he published a play based on the story of [[Joseph Süß Oppenheimer]] which premiered in 1917, but Feuchtwanger withdrew it a couple years later as he was dissatisfied with it.

During the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], Feuchtwanger was ill and unable to participate.

==Association with Brecht==
Feuchtwanger soon became a figure in the literary world, and he was sought out by the young [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Both  collaborated on drafts of Brecht's early work, ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'', in 1923–1924.<ref>In the dedication of ''The Life of Edward II of England'', Brecht wrote, "I wrote this play with Lion Feuchtwanger"; Dedication page from ''Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England'', 1924.</ref> According to Feuchtwanger's widow, Marta, Feuchtwanger was a possible source for the titles of two other Brecht works, including ''[[Drums in the Night]]'' (first called ''Spartakus'' by Brecht).<ref>"Acting Brecht: The Munich Years," by W. Stuart McDowell, in ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors ([[Routledge]], 2000).</ref>

==Shift from drama to novels==
After some success as a playwright, Feuchtwanger shifted his emphasis to the historical novel. His most successful work in this genre was ''[[Jud Süß (Feuchtwanger novel)|Jud Süß]]'' (''Jew Suss''), written 1921–1922, published 1925, which was well-received internationally.  His second great success was ''The Ugly Duchess [[Margarete Maultasch]]''. For professional reasons, he moved to Berlin in 1925 and then to a large villa in [[Grunewald]] in 1932.

He published the first part of the trilogy ''Josephus The Jewish War'' in 1932.

==Early opposition to Nazis==
Feuchtwanger was one of the first to produce propaganda against Hitler and the Nazi Party. As early as 1920 he published in the satirical text ''Conversations with the Wandering Jew'':

<blockquote>Towers of Hebrew books were burned, and bonfires were erected high up in the clouds, and people burnt, innumerable priests and voices sang: [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]]. Traits of men, women, children dragged themselves across the square from all sides, they were naked or in rags, and they had nothing with them as corpses and the tatters of book rolls of torn, disgraced, soiled with feces Books roles. And they followed men and women in kaftans and dresses the children in our day, countless, endless.</blockquote>

==''Jud Süß''==
Feuchtwanger was already well known throughout Germany in 1925, when his first popular novel, ''[[Jud Süß (Feuchtwanger novel)|Jud Süß]]'' (''Jew Suss''), appeared. The story of [[Joseph Süß Oppenheimer]] had been the subject of a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of the past century; the earliest [[Wilhelm Hauff]]'s 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Feuchtwanger's 1925 [[Jud Süß (Feuchtwanger novel)|novel]], based on a play he had written in 1916 but then withdrew. Feuchtwanger intended his portrayal of Süß not as an antisemitic slur but as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition.

The novel was rejected by the major publishing houses and then was reluctantly taken on by a small publishing house. However, the novel was so well-received that it went through five printings of 39,000 copies within a year as well as being translated into 17 languages by 1931. The novel's success established Feuchtwanger as a major German author as well as giving him a royalty stream that afforded him a measure of financial independence for the rest of his life.<ref name="WellberyRyan2004">{{cite book|author1=David E. Wellbery|author-link=David E. Wellbery|author2=Judith Ryan|author3=Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht|author3-link=Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht|title=A new history of German literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRWthlOI_34C&pg=PA729|access-date=31 October 2011|year=2004|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-674-01503-6|page=729}}</ref>

His drama and his hugely successful novel were adapted for the cinema screen initially in a sympathetic version produced at [[Denham Studios]] in Great Britain in 1934 under the direction of fellow German expatriate [[Lothar Mendes]] with one of Germany's greatest actors, also a refugee from Nazi persecution, [[Conrad Veidt]]: ''[[Jew Süss (1934 film)|Jew Süss]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQm8fuT5rnsC&pg=PT218&lpg=PT218&dq=blattner+suss&source=bl&ots=MF4BKwmzIR&sig=ydvlAB8jey2AuyY-7rfgOzz9HVg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EB7UUoy5DNSQhQf3hoHwBA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=blattner%20suss&f=false Jew Suss: His Life and Afterlife in Legend, Literature and Film], - Google Books - by Susan Tegel, Continuum Publishing, London, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-6297-7}}</ref>

The NSDAP party in Germany then made their own anti-Semitic version under the very same title, to undercut the British film.<ref>Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939, by Thomas Doherty, p. 59</ref> The [[Nazi film industry]] version was made under the direction of [[Veit Harlan]]: ''[[Jud Süß (1940 film)|Jud Süß]]'' (1940). Unlike the British version, the anti-Semitic film, released in 1940, portrays Oppenheimer as an evil character.<ref name="Christiane Schönfeld 2009">{{cite journal|last=Schönfeld|first=Christiane|title=Feuchtwanger and the Propaganda Ministry: The Transposition of Jud Süß from Novel to Nazi Film|journal=Feuchtwanger-Studien|year=2009|volume=1|pages=125–151}}</ref>

==Persecution by the Nazis==
Feuchtwanger also published ''Erfolg'' (''Success''), a fictionalized account of the rise and fall of the Nazi Party (in 1930, he considered it a thing of the past) during the inflation era. The new regime soon began persecuting him, and while he was on a speaking tour of America, in [[Washington, D.C.]], he was guest of honor at a dinner hosted by the then ambassador [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Prittwitz und Gaffron]] on the same day (30 January 1933) that Hitler was appointed Chancellor. The next day, Prittwitz resigned from the diplomatic corps and called Feuchtwanger to recommend that he not return home.

In 1933, while Feuchtwanger was on tour, his house was ransacked by government agents who stole or destroyed many items from his extensive library, including invaluable manuscripts of some of his projected works (one of the characters in ''The Oppermanns'' undergoes an identical experience). In the summer of 1933, his name appeared on the first of Hitler's Germany [[:de:Erste Ausbürgerungsliste des Deutschen Reichs von 1933|Ausbürgerungsliste]], which were documents by which the Nazis arbitrarily deprived Germans of their citizenship and so rendered them stateless. During that time, he published the novel ''The Oppermanns''. Feuchtwanger and his wife did not return to Germany but moved to [[Southern France]], settling in [[Sanary-sur-Mer]]. His works were included among those burned in the 10 May 1933, [[Nazi book burning]] held across Germany.

On 25 August 1933, the official government gazette, ''[[Reichsanzeiger]]'', included Feuchtwanger's name on the list of those whose German citizenship was revoked because of "disloyalty to the German Reich and the German people." Because Feuchtwanger had addressed and predicted many of the Nazis' crimes even before they came to power, Hitler considered him a personal enemy and the Nazis designated Feuchtwanger as the "Enemy of the state number one," as mentioned in ''The Devil in France''.

In his writings, Feuchtwanger exposed Nazi racist policies years before the British and French governments abandoned their policy of [[appeasement]] towards Hitler. He remembered that American politicians were also among those who suggested that "Hitler be given a chance." With the publication of ''The Oppermanns'' in 1933, he became a prominent spokesman in opposition to the [[Third Reich]]. Within a year, the novel was translated into [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Danish language|Danish]], English, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] languages. In 1936, still in Sanary, he wrote ''The Pretender'' (''Der falsche Nero''), in which he compared the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] upstart [[Terentius Maximus]], who had claimed to be [[Nero]], with Hitler.

After leaving Germany in 1933, Feuchtwanger lived in Sanary-sur-Mer. The high sales of his books, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, allowed him a relatively comfortable life in exile.

==Stalinism==
In response to the Western Powers pursuing a policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy (the Anglo-German Naval Treaty; allowing the reoccupation of the [[Rhineland]]; non-intervention against the [[Francoist Spain|Falangist Coup in Spain]]; Italy's attack on [[Abyssinia]]), he flirted with [[Soviet communism]] out of a longing to find the staunchest enemy of Germany's National Socialism. [cite: Karl Schlogel, Moscow 1937, Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2017, chapter 5]

From November 1936 to February 1937 he travelled to the [[Soviet Union]]. In his book ''[[Moskau 1937]]'', he praised life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Feuchtwanger also defended the [[Great Purge]] and the [[show trial]]s which were then taking place against both real and imagined [[Trotskyites]] and enemies of the state. Feuchtwanger's praise of Stalin triggered outrage from [[Arnold Zweig]] and [[Franz Werfel]].<ref>[https://libraries.usc.edu/sites/default/files/Feuchtwanger%20and%20Exile%20Studies%20Journal%2034-2021.pdf Feuchtwanger and Exile Studies Journal 34-2021]</ref> The book has been criticized by [[Trotskyites]] as a work of naive [[apologism]].<ref>H.

(Bern: [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]], 2009), 237-46.</ref> Feuchtwanger's friendly attitude toward Stalin later delayed his naturalization in the United States.

==Imprisonment and escape==
When France declared war on Germany in 1939, Feuchtwanger was interned for a few weeks in [[Camp des Milles]]. When the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] in 1940, Feuchtwanger was captured and again imprisoned at Les Milles.<ref>Jean-Marc Chouraqui, Gilles Dorival, Colette Zytnicki, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ25I02Q9OUC&pg=PA548&dq=%22Fritz+Brugel%22&lr= ''Enjeux d'Histoire, Jeux de Mémoire: les Usages du Passé Juif''], [[Maisonneuve & Larose]], 2006, p. 548</ref> Later, the prisoners of Les Milles were moved to a makeshift tent camp near [[Nîmes]] because of the advance of German troops. From there, he was smuggled to [[Marseille]] disguised as a woman. After months of waiting in Marseille, he was able to flee with his wife Marta to the United States via Spain and Portugal, staying briefly in [[Estoril]].<ref>[[Exiles Memorial Center]].</ref> He escaped with the help of Marta; [[Varian Fry]], an American journalist who helped refugees escape from occupied France; [[Hiram Bingham IV]], US Vice Consul in Marseille; [[Waitstill Sharp]] and [[Martha Sharp]], a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] minister and his wife who were in Europe on a similar mission as Fry. Waitstill Sharp volunteered to accompany Feuchtwanger by rail from Marseille, across Spain, to [[Lisbon]]. If Feuchtwanger had been recognized at border crossings in France or Spain, he would have been detained and turned over to the [[Gestapo]].

Realizing that Feuchtwanger might be abducted by Nazi agents even in Portugal, Martha Sharp gave up her own berth on the ''Excalibur'' so Feuchtwanger could sail immediately for [[New York City]] with her husband.

==Asylum in United States==
Feuchtwanger was granted [[political asylum]] in the United States and settled in Los Angeles in 1941, when he published a memoir of his internment, ''The Devil in France'' (''Der Teufel in Frankreich'').

In 1943, Feuchtwanger bought [[Villa Aurora]] in [[Pacific Palisades, California]], and he continued to write there until his death in 1958.

In 1944, he cofounded the publishing house [[Aurora-Verlag]] in [[New York City]].

==Postwar==
During the [[McCarthy era]], he became the target of suspicion as a [[Pro-Soviet]] intellectual. In 1947 he wrote a play about the [[Salem Witch Trials]], ''Wahn oder der Teufel in Boston'' (''Delusion, or The Devil in Boston''), thus anticipating the theme of ''[[The Crucible]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]]; ''Wahn'' premiered in Germany in 1949. It was translated by [[June Barrows Mussey]] and performed in Los Angeles in 1953 under the title "The Devil in Boston."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maierhofer|first1=Waltraud|title='Another Play On Salem Witch Trials:' Lion Feuchtwanger, Communists, and Nazi.|journal=Comparative Drama|date=2009|volume=43|issue=3|pages=355–378|doi=10.1353/cdr.0.0068|url=https://wmich.edu/compdr/Pages/Abstracts/Volume%2043/Maierhofer%20Abstract.html|access-date=23 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208194319/https://wmich.edu/compdr/Pages/Abstracts/Volume%2043/Maierhofer%20Abstract.html|archive-date=8 December 2015}}</ref> In New York a Yiddish translation was shown. At the end of life, he dealt with Jewish themes again (''[[Die Jüdin von Toledo|The Jewess of Toledo]]'') and advocated for the [[State of Israel]] as a Jewish refuge.

In 1953, Feuchtwanger won the [[National Prize of East Germany]] first Class for art and literature.

==Illness and death==
Lion Feuchtwanger became ill with [[stomach cancer]] in 1957. After several operations he died from internal bleeding in late 1958. His wife Marta continued to live in their house on the coast and remained an important figure in the exile community, devoting the remainder of her life to the work of her husband.  Before her death in 1987, [[Marta Feuchtwanger]] donated her husband's papers, photos and personal library to the [[Feuchtwanger Memorial Library]], housed within the Special Collections of the [[Doheny Memorial Library]] at the [[University of Southern California]].
