== Life ==
Karpiński was born in 1741 in [[Kolomyia Raion|Hołosków]] (Holoskiv) near [[Kolomyia]] and educated at [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanisławów]] (then the territory of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], now [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] in western [[Ukraine]]). He attended university in [[Lviv|Lwow]], obtaining the title of Doctor of Philosophy. He spent a further eighteen months in [[Vienna]], where he studied foreign languages. His first employment was as tutor in the [[magnate]] courts.

In 1780, his first volume of poetry came to the attention of the powerful [[House of Czartoryski|Czartoryski family]]. Under their patronage, he travelled to [[Warsaw]] to become secretary to Prince [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]]. He wrote three books of poetry, which saw great popularity, but after a few years he became disillusioned by the hypocrisy prevalent in the capital, and retired back to the Polish [[Kresy]] (Eastern Borderlands) countryside, by then under the [[Austrian partition]].

Between 1785 and 1818 he worked as a tutor to the [[Branicki (surname)|Branicki]] family in [[Białystok]]. There he wrote some of his most famous works, including "[[Bóg się rodzi|Bóg się rodzi, moc truchleje]]" ("God is Born, Power Trembles") and "Kiedy ranne wstają zorze" ("When the Morning Lights Arise"). It was primarily those religious and patriotic songs, hymns and carols that would be sung by later generations and immortalize his works in Poland.<ref name=davies/><ref name=milosz/> In 1800 he became a member of the newly formed [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning|Society of Friends of Science]].

Several of his poems make romantic references to one "Justina"; for this he was known as "Justina's lover" during his lifetime.<ref name=milosz/> Some speculate he nicknamed all of his loves Justina, and that he referred to at least three different women by this name.

In 1818, he retired to a manor near [[Vawkavysk|Wołkowysk]] (now [[Vawkavysk]] in [[Belarus]]), where he wrote his memoirs. He died on 16 September 1825.

Franciszek Karpiński is buried in Łysków (currently Lyskava in [[Pruzhany District]], [[Belarus]]).<ref>[https://www.radzima.org/pl/object/1000.html Grób Franciszka Karpińskiego | Łysków]</ref>
