{{short description|American writer}}
'''Gillian Marucha Bradshaw''' (born May 14, 1956) is an American writer of [[Historical novel|historical fiction]], [[historical fantasy]], [[children's literature]], [[science fiction]], and contemporary science-based novels, who lives in Britain. Her serious historical novels are often set in classical antiquity — [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Saka]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], [[Imperial Rome]], [[Sub-Roman Britain]] and [[Roman Britain]]. She has also written two novels set in the [[English Civil War]].

==Biography==
Gillian Bradshaw was born in [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], [[Virginia]],<ref>Bradshaw, Gillian. ''The Hawk of May''. 1980, Simon and Schuster. p. 315.</ref> and spent part of her youth in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]. She attended the [[University of Michigan]], where she won the Phillips Prize for Classical Greek in 1975 and 1977, as well as the Hopwood Prize for fiction for her first novel, ''Hawk of May''. She went on to advanced study at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], where she studied [[Classical philology]]. ''Hawk of May'' was published while she was preparing for [[University of Cambridge]] exams.

Bradshaw decided to stay in [[Cambridge]] for another year to write another novel and think about what to do for a career. However, while there, she discovered she could live on her income as a novelist, and she has been writing novels ever since. She also met her husband, who was completing his doctorate in [[physics]]. Bradshaw and her husband, British [[Mathematical physics]] professor (and 2012 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] winner) Robin Ball, have four children. She says of herself, "I am an enthusiast for [[classical antiquity]], and love roaming about [[Graeco-Roman]] ruins on holiday. The rest of the family has a huge exposure to [[hypocaust]]s and [[hippodrome]]s. They have sometimes protested ('Not another Roman ruin!') but mostly they've quite enjoyed it."<ref>[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~phsep/bradshaw/ Gillian Bradshaw<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Bradshaw's physicist husband provided one aspect of her portrayal of [[Archimedes]] in her novel ''The Sand-Reckoner''. But as she states in the afterword, her portrayal is based on the ancient sources on Archimedes and not on any living person such as the theoretical physicists she knows. Bradshaw has been a judge in the [[Institute of Physics]] Paperclip Physics competition, and her contemporary and historical novels with a scientific background show a deep interest in human responses to scientific discoveries.

==Works==

===1980–1990===
Bradshaw's first published novels were the [[Arthurian]] [[historical fantasy]] trilogy, ''[[Down the Long Wind]]''. These three [[young-adult literature|young adult books]] — ''[[Hawk of May]]'', ''[[Kingdom of Summer]]'', and ''[[In Winter's Shadow]]'' — were released between 1980 and 1982. Set in [[Sub-Roman Britain]], the trilogy's main character is [[Gawain|Gwalchmai]] (Gawain), who must choose between supporting his evil mother [[Morgause|Morgawse]] or his maternal uncle [[King Arthur]]. The title ''Down the Long Wind'' is taken from [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]'':
:"And fainter onward, like wild birds that change
:Their season in the night and wail their way
:From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream
:Shrilled; but in going mingled
:with dim cries."

Bradshaw next began writing adult [[historical fiction]]. Her 1986 novel, ''The Beacon at Alexandria'', features Charis of [[Ephesus]], a female [[Physician|doctor]] [[cross-dressing]] as a [[eunuch]] in 4th century [[Alexandria]], in [[Roman Egypt]].

''The Bearkeeper's Daughter'' tells the story of [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], [[empress consort]] of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]]. Theodora was born into the lowest class of Byzantine society, and was the daughter of Acacius, a bearkeeper for the circus.

''Imperial Purple'' (UK title: ''The Colour of Power''), released in 1988, features Demetrias of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], a woman who was born into slavery but who is becoming a skilled weaver. The plot focuses on her discovery of a plot to depose [[Theodosius II]] and remove from power his sister [[Pulcheria]].

In 1990 Bradshaw wrote ''Horses of Heaven'', about a marriage alliance between the [[Saka]] Kingdom of [[Fergana|Ferghana]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. The marriage of King Mauakes and Princess Heliokleia occurs around 140 BC, and brings many changes at court.

===1991–2000===

Bradshaw next turned to writing three [[children's literature|children's books]] — starting with two linked tales involving [[Ancient Egypt]], ''The Dragon and the Thief'' in 1991 and ''The Land of Gold'' in 1992. The latter features a [[Nubia]]n princess who survives her parents' murder, and attempts to regain her throne with the assistance of the dragon [[Hathor]].

These two books were followed by ''Beyond the North Wind'' (1993). The novel features a young [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] assigned by [[Apollo]] to protect a tribe of [[griffin]]s from a hostile queen. The title is again a reference to an earlier work, in this that of case [[Aristeas]] of [[Marmara Island|Proconnesus]], a 7th-century BC Greek, who reported that the griffins lived in [[Scythia]], near the cave of [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the North Wind. ''The Dragon and the Thief'', ''The Land of Gold'', and ''Beyond the North Wind'' all began as stories for the pleasure of her own children.

Bradshaw then continued her works of serious adult historical fiction with ''Island of Ghosts'' in 1998. The novel tells the story of Ariantes, one of 8,000 [[Sarmatians]] in military service to [[Marcus Aurelius]].

In 2000 she wrote her first [[science fiction]] novel, ''The Wrong Reflection'', about an [[amnesia]]c who finds his given identity of "Paul Anderson" to be a fabrication.

This was followed by historical novel ''The Sand-Reckoner'', a telling of the story of [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Italy]], from his studies at the [[Library of Alexandria]] to his involvement in the [[Second Punic War]] (218 – 202 BC).

===2001–present===

In 2001, Bradshaw published her second science fiction novel, ''Dangerous Notes''. It features Valeria Thornham, a young classical guitarist and composer whose brain was implanted with [[Cloning|cloned]] [[stem cells]] in childhood after an accident. She is considered a potential [[Psychosis|psychotic]] and is arrested and detained at a mental research facility, where she is threatened with the prospect of undergoing surgery to remove the part of her brain that is responsible for her extraordinary musical talent.

Bradshaw's 2001 historical novel ''The Wolf Hunt'' was based on [[Marie de France]]'s [[Breton lai]] ''[[Bisclavret]]'', and features Marie Penthive of Chalendrey, a [[Normans|Norman]] kidnapped and taken to the [[Duchy of Brittany]]. Marie then becomes involved in the life of the late 11th-century Duchy's court and its plots.

Her next historical novel, ''Cleopatra's Heir'' (2002) tells the tale of [[Caesarion]], son of [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]], who managed to escape execution at the order of his adoptive brother [[Caesar Augustus]]. The young man is then forced in a life of poverty in his new environment, the [[Roman Empire]].

In 2002 Bradshaw also wrote a short story set in [[Ancient Egypt]], ''The Justice of Isis'', taking place in [[Alexandria]] in [[58 BC|58 BCE]], during the reign of [[Ptolemy XII]]. It was published in ''The Mammoth Book of Egyptian Whodunits.'' This short story was also published in [[Czech language|Czech]] as ''Esetina spravedlnost'' in 2004.

This was followed by another historical novel, ''Render Unto Caesar'' (2003), featuring Hermogenes, a Roman citizen of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin, meeting [[prejudice]] in the city of [[Rome]] when he tries to collect a debt, and his body guard, "Cantabra", a former [[gladiatrix]], originally from [[Cantabria]].

In 2003, Bradshaw also wrote a short story set in the last decades of [[Imperial Rome]], ''The Malice of the Anicii''. Written in the style of a scholarly edition of [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'s ''History of Rome'', the story was published in ''The Mammoth Book of Roman Whodunits.''

Bradshaw returned to science fiction with ''The Somers Treatment'' (2003). The novel features [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] David Somers advancing his own unique treatment of [[specific language impairment]]. However, his research receives its funding from [[MI5]], for reasons that remain secret to the public.

Her 2004 historical novel ''The Alchemy of Fire'' takes place in [[Constantinople]] under [[Constantine IV]]. Anna, former concubine to a prince of the [[Heraclian Dynasty]], attempts to raise her daughter Theodosia on her own while protecting the secret of the girl's noble birth. Meanwhile, [[Alchemy|alchemist]] Kallinikos of [[Baalbek]] works in creating [[Greek fire]].

''The Elixir of Youth'' (2006) was Bradshaw's next novel, looking at the complex relationship between a philosopher daughter and her molecular biologist father, who walked out of the family when she was a child, and whose serum to repair the effects of aging on the skin has gone missing. Like her earlier novel ''Dangerous Notes'' (2001), the use of stem cells in research is a theme.

''Bloodwood'' was published in 2007. This novel is set in contemporary Britain, and focuses on Antonia Lanchester, a terminally ill employee of a home-furnishing company, who hands over incriminating files about [[illegal logging]] and corruption from her employer's computer to an environmental campaign group.

Her next novel, ''Dark North'' (2007), was a return to [[Roman Britain]] for Bradshaw. Set in 208 [[Common Era|CE]], it looks at the troubled reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] — and his attempt to conquer [[Roman Britain|Scotland]] — through the eyes of Memnon (an African cavalry scout) and members of Empress [[Julia Domna]]'s household.

''The Sun's Bride'' (2008) is set in [[Ancient Greece]], in [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]] in the year 246 BCE. Shipping, piracy and the politics of the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] are the well-researched backdrop to the story of two people caught up in the end of the reign of [[Antiochus II Theos]] and the beginning of the [[Syrian wars#Third Syrian War .28246-241 BC.29|Third Syrian War]], and how these change their lives.

''London in Chains'' (2009) is her first historical novel of a planned two set in the [[English Civil War]]. Like many of her novels, it focuses on one woman's struggle for independence in a male dominated world. Starting in 1647, it is set around a Lucy Wentor, a young woman establishing herself in the politically sensitive publishing trade in London.

''A Corruptible Crown'' (2011) follows Lucy's career in publishing: printing news-books and avoiding censors.

==Impact and critical reception==

Bradshaw has a vast knowledge of classical culture — of life in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds — and she puts that to use in her historical fiction. These critically acclaimed historical novels have led some to consider her [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s literary heir. Bradshaw's novels with a scientific basis are similarly highly credible.

Gillian Bradshaw's novels have been published in English in Britain and the U.S., and have been translated into: [[Czech language|Czech]] (her name also being sometimes translated, as ''Gillian Bradshawová''); [[Danish language|Danish]]; French; German; and Spanish. In all six of her major published languages, Bradshaw's writing has earned critical acclaim.

In [[Czech language|Czech]], she has also had two short stories published. ''The Justice of Isis'' was published as ''Esetina spravedlnost'' in 2004, and ''The Malice of the Anicii'' was published as ''Zlovolnost Anicijských'' in 2008.
