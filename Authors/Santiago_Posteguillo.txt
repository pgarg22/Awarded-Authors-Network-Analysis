At the end of the 3rd century BC., Rome was at risk from the Carthaginian army under the command of one of the greatest military strategists of history, [[Hannibal]].

Scipio, known by the name of Africanus, who received many of the military qualities of his father and uncle, had also created some important enemies: Hasdrubal, brother of Hannibal; and the Punic general Giscón. Enemies also survive in Rome, where Senator Maximus Q. Fabius forced Scipio to accept the task of leading the legions V and VI which stayed neglected for a long time in Sicily.
