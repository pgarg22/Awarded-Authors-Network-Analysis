He sent a copy of ''Journey's End'' to the headmaster after the play was first performed in 1928, and was a generous benefactor to the school until his death, paying particularly close attention to the school rowing club, whose supporters' club now bears his name. He financed a number of boats named after his plays (''Journey's End'', ''White Carnation'', ''Home at Seven'', ''Long Sunset'' and ''Badger's Green''). He also purchased a piece of land at the end of Aragon Avenue in [[Thames Ditton]] for the purpose of building a school boathouse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherriffclub.org/boathousehistory.html|title=Boathouse history|publisher=KGS Sherriff Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227194922/http://www.sherriffclub.org/boathousehistory.html |archivedate=27 February 2018}}</ref> which was completed in 1980. |group= n}}

==Career==

===Playwright===
Sherriff wrote his first play to help [[Kingston Rowing Club]] raise money to buy a new boat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/sherriff-blog-11/|title=The road to Journey's End...A Hitch in the Proceedings and other early plays by R C Sherriff |website=Exploring Surrey's Past|date=21 November 2014}}</ref> His seventh play, ''[[Journey's End]]'', was written in 1928 and published in 1929 and was based on his experiences in the war.<ref name=britannica>{{Britannica|540148|R.C.

===Novelist===
Sherriff also wrote prose. A novelised version of ''Journey's End'', co-written with [[Vernon Bartlett]], was published in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catalog of Copyright Entries. New Series: 1930|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CKUhAQAAIAAJ|year=1931|publisher=Copyright Office, Library of Congress|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CKUhAQAAIAAJ/page/n18 1]}}</ref> His 1939 novel, ''[[The Hopkins Manuscript]]'' is an [[H.

''The Fortnight in September'', an earlier novel, published in 1931, is a rather more plausible story about a [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] holiday enjoyed by a lower-middle-class family from [[Dulwich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/the-fortnight-in-september.html |title=The Fortnight in September |website=Persephone Books}}</ref> It was nominated by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] as a book to 'inspire, uplift and offer escape' in a list compiled by ''[[The Guardian]]'' during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]], describing it as "just about the most uplifting, life-affirming novel I can think of right now".<ref>{{Cite news|date=5 May 2020|title=Novelists pick books to inspire, uplift, and offer escape|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/05/novelists-pick-books-to-inspire-uplift-and-offer-escape|access-date=2020-10-04|work=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

His 1936 novel ''Green Gates'' is a realistic novel about a middle-aged couple, Tom and Edith Baldwin, moving from an established London suburb into the then-new suburbs of [[Metro-land]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bookssnob.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/greengates-by-r-c-sherriff/|title=Greengates by R C Sherriff|date=3 December 2016 |website=Book Snob}}</ref>
