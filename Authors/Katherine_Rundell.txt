I didn’t wear shoes, and there was none of the teenage culture that exists in Europe. My friends and I were still climbing trees and having swimming competitions".<ref name="Newsweek 22 January 2017"/></blockquote>  De Lisle notes, "She gives Belgium some credit for broadening her mind […] But she resented it too, to the point where all her books, and her play, contain a joke at Belgium’s expense".<ref name="Newsweek 22 January 2017"/>

She completed her undergraduate studies at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]] (2005 – 2008). During this period she developed an interest in rooftop climbing,<ref name="Guardian 3 April 2014">{{cite news |last= Drabble |first= Emily |title= Katherine Rundell wins the Waterstones children's book prize 2014 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/apr/03/waterstones-childrens-books-prize-2014-katherine-rundell| date= 3 April 2014 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate= 23 January 2017 }}</ref> inspired by a 1937 book, ''[[The Night Climbers of Cambridge]]'', about the adventures of undergraduate students at that university.<ref name="Newsweek 22 January 2017"/> Shortly after graduating, Rundell successfully applied to become a fellow in English Literature at All Souls College, Oxford.<ref name="All Souls College"/> She told ''[[The Bookseller]]'''s Anna James that the application process had involved a three-hour written examination on the single word 'novelty', adding that, "I wrote about Derridean deconstructionist theory and Christmas crackers [...] I feel like they might have let me in despite rather than because of it".<ref name="The Bookseller 14 July 2014" /> She subsequently completed a doctoral thesis on "the literary and textual afterlives" of the English  [[Metaphysical poets|metaphysical poet]] and cleric [[John Donne]].<ref name="All Souls College"/>

==Writing career==
Rundell's first book, published in 2011, was ''The Girl Savage''; it told the story of Wilhelmina Silver, a girl from Zimbabwe, who is sent to an English boarding school following the death of her father. A slightly revised version was released in the United States in 2014, under the title ''Cartwheeling in Thunderstorms'', where it won the 2015 [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award]] for fiction.<ref name="Boston Globe Horn Book 2015"/>

Her second book, ''Rooftoppers'', followed the adventures of Sophie, apparently orphaned in a shipwreck on her first birthday.  Sophie later attempts to find her mother, who she is convinced survived the disaster, whilst also taking to the rooftops of Paris in order to thwart officials trying to send her to a British orphanage. It won the overall [[Waterstones Children's Book Prize]]<ref name="BBC News 3 April 2014">{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26870557|title= Katherine Rundell wins Waterstones Children's Book Prize|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 3 April 2014|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC | accessdate= 22 January 2017 }}</ref> and the [[Blue Peter Book Award]] for Best Story,<ref name="BookTrust: Blue Peter Book Awards 2014">{{cite web |url= http://www.booktrust.org.uk/prizes/2/2014|title= Blue Peter Book Awards 2014| author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= www.booktrust.org.uk |publisher= [[Booktrust|BookTrust]]| accessdate= 22 January 2017 }}</ref> and was short-listed for the Carnegie Medal.<ref name="Telegraph 25 April 2014" /> Translated into French by Emmanuelle Ghez as ''Le ciel nous appartient'' for Les Grandes Personnes<ref name="Le ciel nous appartient">{{cite book | author-last= Rundell | author-first= Katherine| translator-last= Ghez | translator-first= Emmanuelle |title= Le ciel nous appartient |publisher= Les Grandes Personnes |date=28 August 2014| orig-year=First published 2013 in English as Rooftoppers by [[Simon & Schuster| Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers]] | isbn=978-2361932664 }}</ref> it was the winner of the 2015 [[Prix Sorcières#Junior novels category|Prix Sorcières Junior novels category]].<ref name="Prix Sorcières 2015">{{cite web |url= http://www.abf.asso.fr/4/145/504/ABF/prix-sorcieres-laureats-2015|title= Prix Sorcières - Lauréats 2015: Romans Juniors - Lauréat |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 4 April 2016 |website= www.abf.asso.fr | publisher= Association des Bibliothécaires de France | accessdate= 22 April 2017 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Rundell's hobbies include tightrope walking and roof walking,<ref name="Telegraph 25 April 2014" /> and she says she begins each day with a cartwheel because "reading is almost exactly the same as cartwheeling: it turns the world upside down and leaves you breathless".<ref name="Simon & Schuster bio">{{cite web |url= http://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Katherine-Rundell/410789881|title= Katherine Rundell|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= www.simonandschuster.com |publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]] | accessdate= 23 January 2017}}</ref>
