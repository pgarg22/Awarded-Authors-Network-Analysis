Many of Twichell's poems are heavily influenced by her years as a [[Zen Buddhist]] student of [[John Daido Loori]] at [[Zen Mountain Monastery]], and her poetry in the book ''The Snow Watcher'' shows it.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=6985 The Poetry Foundation > Poet > Chase Twichell Biography]</ref><ref name="blueflowerarts.com">[http://www.blueflowerarts.com/chase-twichell Blue Flower Arts > Author Booking Agency > Chase Twichell Bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115034418/http://www.blueflowerarts.com/chase-twichell |date=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> She attended the [[Foote School]] in New Haven. In the Fall 2003 ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle magazine]]'' interview with Chase, she says, "Zazen and poetry are both studies of the mind. I find the internal pressure exerted by emotion and by a koan to be similar in surprising and unpredictable ways. Zen is a wonderful sieve through which to pour a poem. It strains out whatever's inessential."

Twichell was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and earned her B.A. from [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] and her M.F.A. from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. She lives in [[New York City]] with her husband, novelist [[Russell Banks]].
