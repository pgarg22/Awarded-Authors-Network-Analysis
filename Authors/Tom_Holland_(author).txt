'''Thomas Holland''' {{postnom|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born 5 January 1968) is an English author who has published best-selling books on topics including [[Classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval history]] and the origins of [[Islam]]. In addition to his writing, he has worked with the BBC to create and host historical television documentaries, and presents the radio series ''Making History''.

==Early life and education==
Holland was born in [[Oxfordshire]] and brought up in the village of [[Broad Chalke]] near [[Salisbury]], Wiltshire, England,<ref name=Dodds>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfsite.com/07a/th60.htm |title=A Conversation with Tom Holland |last=Dodds |first=Georges |date=June 1999 |website=The SF Site |access-date=April 28, 2019 }}</ref> the elder of two sons.

There's a splendour and a terror about them that appealed to me – and that kind of emotional attachment is something that stays with you."<ref name=Robinson>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=David |date=7 April 2019 |title=Interview: Tom Holland, author of In the Shadow of the Sword |url=https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/books/interview-tom-holland-author-of-in-the-shadow-of-the-sword-1-2221063 |work=The Scotsman|access-date=2 May 2019 }}</ref>

==Writing career==

===Novels===
Holland's first books were [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] novels about vampires, set in various time periods throughout history.

His first novel, ''The Vampyre: Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron'' (1995), drew on his knowledge of Lord Byron from his university studies and recast the 19th-century poet as a vampire.  It was re-titled ''Lord of the Dead: The Secret History of Byron'' for the 1996 U.S. release.  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "a good vampire yarn—elevated and elegant enough to make you feel you needn't conceal it behind the dust jacket of some self-help work, yet happily gory and perilous" although they felt "the newly plowed plot ground is sometimes hurried through as if to get to the scholarly stuff, where the author feels perhaps on more solid ground."<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrison |first=Patt |date=February 25, 1999 |title=Mad, Bad and Dangerous : FICTION : LORD OF THE DEAD: The Secret History Of Byron, By Tom Holland |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-02-25-bk-39697-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 28, 2019 }}</ref> Its sequel, ''Supping with Panthers'', was published in 1996 (it was also re-titled for the U.S. release, to ''Slave of My Thirst'').<ref>{{cite news |last=Clarke |first=Roger |date=August 24, 1996 |title=Book Review / Vaudevillian vampires and the scent of baloney |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review-vaudevillian-vampires-and-the-scent-of-baloney-1311158.html |work=The Independent |access-date=April 28, 2019 }}</ref>

Holland stayed with the supernatural horror genre for his next few books, continuing to use his knowledge of ancient cultures and settings. In ''Attis'' (1996), he took historical figures from the ancient [[Roman Republic]] like [[Pompey]] and the poet [[Catullus]] and put them in a modern setting among a string of brutal murders. He set 1997's ''Deliver Us From Evil'' in 17th-century England, with a man named Faustus leading an army of the undead. 1999's ''Sleeper in the Sands'' is set in Egypt, starting with the discovery of the [[Tomb of Tutankhamun]] in 1922 and travelling backward in time as a deadly secret is unveiled.<ref name=Mathew/>

Holland's last novel to date departed from the supernatural genre. ''The Bone Hunter'' (1999) is a thriller, set in the United States, about the rivalry between two 19th-century [[paleontology|paleontologists]] around whom people begin dying.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holland |first=Tom |date=1999 |title=The Bone Hunter |publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=9780748131075}}</ref>

===Historical non-fiction books===
While doing research for ''The Bone Hunter'', Holland read ''From Alexander to Actium'' by historian [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] and his childhood passion for ancient history and civilisations was reignited. {{quote|All my old fascination with antiquity just went Whoosh! up again. From that moment I started re-immersing myself in that world. I had a sense that antiquity was almost like a science fiction world, that it was utterly remote and yet eerily like our own. I was doing vampire books at the time and it never crossed my mind to write history–but I was finding that my real interests were welling up, and the vampire books were really historical novels, and that I was much less interested in the fiction than in the research.}} He gave up writing fiction and turned to writing history.<ref name=Robinson/>

His first book of history, ''[[Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic]]'', was published in 2003 and garnered positive reviews. It was called "gripping and hugely entertaining" by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Frederic |first=Raphael |date=August 17, 2003 |title=Review: Ancient history: Rubicon by Tom Holland |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-ancient-history-rubicon-by-tom-holland-qm2h63kf73n |work=The Sunday Times |access-date=April 29, 2019 }}</ref> "informative, balanced and accessible" by ''BookPage'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Watts |first=Justin |date=February 2004 |title=Rubicon: Tom Holland |url=https://bookpage.com/reviews/3331-tom-holland-rubicon-history#.XMbEkuhKjIU |work=BookPage |access-date=April 29, 2019 }}</ref> and "a model of exactly how a popular history of the classical world should be written" by ''The Guardian''.<ref name="Miles">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview10|title=What the Romans did last|last=Miles|first=Richard|date=November 7, 2003|work=Guardian|access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> ''Rubicon'' won the 2004 [[Hessell-Tiltman Prize]], awarded to the best work of non-fiction of historical content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hessell-Tiltman Prize|url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/hessell-tiltman-prize/|publisher=English PEN|access-date=31 July 2012}}</ref>

''[[Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West]]'' (2005) is an account of the 5th-century B.C. [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. It was reviewed positively by [[Paul Cartledge]], a professor of Greek history at Cambridge University, for ''[[The Independent]]'': "If ''Persian Fire'' does not win the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]], there is no justice in this world."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/persian-fire-the-first-world-empire-and-the-battle-for-the-west-by-tom-holland-309582.html independent.co.uk: "Persian Fire: The first world empire and the battle for the west, by Tom Holland "], 2 Sep 2005</ref> Writing in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', historian [[Dominic Sandbrook]] called it "riveting" and praised the "enormous strengths" of the author.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3646640/A-civilising-influence.html telegraph.co.uk: "A civilising influence – Dominic Sandbrook reviews ''Persian Fire'' by Tom Holland"], 18 Sep 2015</ref> It won the [[Anglo-Hellenic League]]'s 2006 [[Runciman Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/40955/article/ekathimerini/life/two-runciman-winners-named |title=Two Runciman winners named |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=August 6, 2006 |website=Kathimerini |access-date=April 29, 2019 }}</ref>

''[[Millennium: The End of the World and the Forging of Christendom]]'' (2008) examines the two centuries on either side of the seminal year 1000 A.D., and how Western Europe ascended out of the Dark Ages to become a leading world civilization once again. [[Noel Malcolm]] reviewed it for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and called it "a tremendously good read" but criticised the lack of detail about historical evidence and Holland's "elevated" style of prose.<ref>{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Noel |date=October 3, 2008 |title=Review: Millennium by Tom Holland |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3561036/Review-Millennium-by-Tom-Holland.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=April 29, 2019 }}</ref> [[Christina Hardyment]], reviewing it for ''The Independent'', praised Holland's writing style, saying he "excels at narration, never jogging when he can gallop&nbsp;...

Holland's book on the rise of Islam, ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword: The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World]]'' (2012), was called "a work of impressive sensitivity and scholarship" by ''The Daily Telegraph''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9188586/In-the-Shadow-of-the-Sword-by-Tom-Holland-review.html|date=5 April 2012|author=Dan Jones|title=In the Shadow of the Sword by Tom Holland: review|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref> and "a book of extraordinary richness ...

''Dynasty: The Rise and Fall of the House of Caesar'' (2015) covers the reigns of the five emperors of Rome's [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], from [[Augustus]] to [[Nero]]. Classics professor [[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]], reviewing it for ''The Guardian'', was critical of the "overblown style" of Holland's writing and the narrative's lurid details, saying of the book  "this is ancient Rome for the age of Donald Trump".<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Emily |date=October 29, 2015 |title=Dynasty by Tom Holland review: The soap opera version of history |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/29/dynasty-tom-holland-rome-review|work=The Guardian |access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> But in his review for ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Nick Cohen]] wrote "Among the many virtues of Tom Holland's terrific history is that he does not shrink from seeing the Roman emperors for what they were: 'the west's primal examples of tyranny'."<ref>{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Nick |date=September 6, 2015 |title=Dynasty: The Rise and Fall of the House of Caesar review – deft and skillful |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/06/dynasty-house-of-caesar-tom-holland-book-review-nick-cohen |work=The Observer |access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref>

Holland next wrote two short historical biographies. The first, ''Athelstan: The Making of England'' (2016), is a part of the 'Penguin Monarchs' series and covers the life of [[Æthelstan]], the 10th-century ruler widely regarded as the first king of England.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holland |first=Tom |date=2016 |title=Athelstan: the Making of England |publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0241187814}}</ref> The second, ''Æthelflæd: England's Forgotten Founder'' (2019) is an entry in the ''[[Ladybird Expert]]'' series and tells of Athelstan's aunt (and daughter of [[Alfred the Great]]), [[Æthelflæd]], who ruled the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Mercia]] in the early 10th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holland |first=Tom |date=2019 |title=Æthelflæd: England's Forgotten Founder |publisher=Penguin Random House UK|isbn=978-0718188269}}</ref>

''Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind'' (titled ''Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World'' for the U.S. edition), was published in 2019. It is an examination of Christianity's influence on Western civilisation in which Holland maintains that the religion's influence continues to be seen in ethics and cultural norms throughout the world today, even when the religion itself is rejected: "To live in a western country is to live in a society still utterly saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind|last=Holland|first=Tom|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2019|isbn=978-1408706954|location=London}}</ref> ''Dominion'' received positive reviews, with ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' calling it "astute and thoughtful",<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 August 2019|title=Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World by Tom Holland {{!}} Kirkus Review|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tom-holland/dominion-holland/|journal=Kirkus Reviews}}</ref> and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' saying that "entertaining is too light a term and instructive is too heavy a term for a rich work that is enjoyably both".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-465-09350-2|title=Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World|date=October 2019|website=Publishers Weekly|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> Reviewing it for ''[[The Times]]'', Gerard DeGroot argued that much of what Holland attributes to Christian influence is simply humanity evolving the need to work together for survival, but said "I have to commend the originality of this book, not to mention [Holland's] brave ambition."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dominion-by-tom-holland-review-7pc255qs7|title=Dominion by Tom Holland review — are we all children of the Christian revolution?|last=DeGroot|first=Gerard|date=23 August 2019|work=The Times|access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref>

==Television documentaries==
===''Dinosaurs, Myths and Monsters''===
In February 2011, Holland wrote and presented ''[[Dinosaurs, Myths and Monsters]]'', a [[BBC Four]] television programme.

{{Main|Islam: The Untold Story}}
In August 2012, Holland produced and presented a documentary for [[Channel 4]] television titled ''[[Islam: The Untold Story]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Islam – The Untold Story|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/islam-the-untold-story|publisher=Channel 4|access-date=30 August 2012}}</ref> which questioned Islamic doctrine that maintains [[Muhammad]] founded the religion in [[Mecca]] in the 7th century, and that the [[Quran]] was transmitted, in full, directly to Muhammad by [[Allah]] (God) via the angel [[Gabriel]], rather than being written by a person or persons. Holland argued that there is very little contemporary historical evidence about the life of Muhammad, with no mention of him at all in historical texts until decades after his death, and no mention of Mecca in any datable text relating to him until over a century after he died. He concluded that it is much more likely that Islamic theology developed gradually over several centuries as the Arab Empire expanded, and that descriptions of Muhammad's home more closely resemble what is now southern [[Israel]] than Mecca.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Holland | first = Tom | date = 8 January 2015 | title = Viewpoint: The roots of the battle for free speech | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30714702 | journal = BBC News Magazine | access-date = 14 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3352/channel-4-islam-untold-story |title=Britain: Islam Documentary Cancelled Amid Threats of Physical Violence |last=kern |first=soeren |date=21 September 2012 |website=Gatestone Institute |access-date=1 May 2019 }}</ref>

Writing on the Channel 4 website, Holland responded to the criticism by saying that the origins of Islam is a "legitimate subject of historical enquiry" and that his documentary was "a historical endeavour and is not a critique of one of the major monotheistic religions".<ref name=complaints/>

===''Isis: The Origins of Violence''===
In 2017, Holland revisited the topic of Islam by writing and presenting another documentary for Channel 4. ''Isis: The Origins of Violence'' looked at the militant terror group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] and argued that they use Islamic doctrine to inform and justify their quest for a global [[caliphate]].<ref name=Lawson>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/17/isis-the-origins-of-violence-a-brave-documentary-that-will-start-many-a-fight|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 May 2017|author=Mark Lawson|title=Isis: The Origins of Violence – a brave documentary that will start many a fight|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref>

In the film, Holland visited the site of the 2015 [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Bataclan theatre massacre]] in Paris, interviewed a [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] leader in Jordan, and then went to the Iraqi city of [[Sinjar]], which had historically been largely populated by the [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] minority. In 2014, ISIS forces swept into the city and killed most of the Yazidi men and old women, taking the young women as sex slaves and the young boys to train as ISIS soldiers. At one point, Holland was shown approaching a pit filled with the remains of Yazidi women whom Isis considered too old to be used as sex slaves, and then had to vomit off-camera.<ref>{{cite news |last=Murray |first=Douglas |date=18 May 2017 |title=The British broadcaster brave enough to discuss Islamic violence |url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/british-broadcaster-brave-enough-discuss-islamic-violence/ |work=The Spectator |access-date=1 May 2019 }}</ref>

In an interview with the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' to promote the film, he said "Just as Nazis justified genocide in terms of racial theory, there are Islamic scholars who justify it in terms of what the Koran says. Not to engage with that, to pretend that's not an issue, is essentially to be complicit in genocide." He also said that westerners are wrong to blame their own foreign policy for the existence of ISIS: "We want to believe we have agency. We want to believe it's about foreign policy — because then we can do something about it. But you just have to read ''Dabiq'' [the ISIS magazine]. They say upfront: 'We hate you because you're not Muslim'."<ref name=Urwin>{{cite news |last=Urwin |first=Rosamund |date=17 May 2017 |title=Historian Tom Holland on Isis, receiving death threats and why there is a 'civil war' in the Muslim world |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/interview-historian-tom-holland-on-isis-receiving-death-threats-and-why-there-is-a-civil-war-in-the-a3541236.html |work=Evening Standard |access-date=3 May 2019 }}</ref>

Although some Muslim groups once again registered their disapproval of the programme's content and of Channel 4 for airing it, Holland stated their reaction this time was much less severe than with ''Islam: the Untold Story''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhatandthewhy.com/an-interview-with-tom-holland/ |title=An Interview With...Tom Holland |last=Marshall |first=Tim |date=26 May 2017 |website=The What & the Why |access-date=3 May 2019 }}</ref> Journalist [[Peter Oborne]] wrote a rebuttal to it on the website ''[[Middle East Eye]]'' titled "No, Channel 4: Islam is not responsible for the Islamic State", in which he stated that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] is responsible for ISIS, not Islamic teachings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/no-channel-4-islam-not-responsible-islamic-state |title=No, Channel 4: Islam is not responsible for the Islamic State |last=Oborne |first=Peter |date=25 July 2017 |website=Middle East Eye |access-date=2 May 2019 }}</ref> However, ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the documentary, saying "''ISIS: The Origins of Violence'' will start many arguments, but we should be grateful for having broadcasters brave and thoughtful enough to make them."<ref name=Lawson/>

==Activism==
===Conservation===
Holland has campaigned and written articles in support of measures to save London's disappearing [[hedgehog]] population.<ref name=hedgehogs/><ref>{{cite news |last=Holland|first=Tom |date=9 September 2018 |title=If we love hedgehogs so much, why are we letting them vanish? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/09/if-we-love-hedgehogs-why-let-them-vanish |work=The Guardian |access-date=6 May 2019 }}</ref>

He is a staunch opponent of the proposed [[Stonehenge road tunnel]] and other development projects that threaten landscapes around Britain's historic sites and since 2018 has been president of the Stonehenge Alliance, a group dedicated to stopping construction of the tunnel (or at least convincing the government to redesign it from the planned 1.8 miles. in length to a longer, deep bored tunnel of at least 2.8 miles that would be less obtrusive to the [[World Heritage Site]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stonehengealliance.org.uk/our-campaign/about-us/ |title=About us |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Stonehenge Alliance |access-date=15 June 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://stonehengealliance.org.uk/our-campaign/our-campaign/ |title=What we are campaigning for |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Stonehenge Alliance |access-date=15 June 2019 }}</ref>  In 2017, he said of the Stonehenge tunnel: "The issue is whether Stonehenge exists to provide a tourist experience, or whether it is something more significant, both historically and spiritually.  It has stood there for 4,500 years. And up to now, no one's thought of injecting enormous quantities of concrete into the landscape and permanently disfiguring it."<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris|first=John |date=25 April 2017 |title=The Stonehenge tunnel: 'A monstrous act of desecration is brewing' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/25/stonehenge-tunnel-desecration-prehistoric-traffic-jams|work=The Guardian |access-date=5 May 2019 }}</ref>

===Politics===
In August 2014, Holland and fellow historian [[Dan Snow]] organized 200 British public figures in signing a letter to the people of Scotland, published by ''The Guardian'', expressing the hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the September 2014 [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue]]. The letter read in part "We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them. What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together." Among the signatories were Sir [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[Mick Jagger]], Dame [[Judi Dench]] and [[Stephen Hawking]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |access-date=26 August 2014}}</ref>

Earlier that year, he had voiced his desire for the United Kingdom to stay a part of the [[European Union]], saying: "I would like to remain a citizen of the European Union, but I would like even more to continue in a country that includes Scotland ... the likelier it seems the United Kingdom will leave the EU, the likelier Scotland is to leave the United Kingdom. I don't want to be a Little Englander. I want to stay European, and I want to stay British."<ref name=Latin/> After Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, Holland stated that he himself had voted Remain, but that since [[Brexit]] had been chosen by the people in a democratic vote, the government had to carry through with it. He posted on his Twitter account in October 2018: "Brexit has to happen – anything else would be undemocratic. But the result was close, close, close – so the Brexit settlement should properly accept that. I'm sure that's what most people feel."<ref>{{cite tweet |user=Holland_Tom |url=https://twitter.com/holland_tom/status/1053657154559848449?lang=en |number=1053657154559848449|date=20 October 2018 |title=Brexit has to happen}}</ref>

In 2017, Holland joined Scottish businessman/blogger Kevin Hague and history professor [[Ali Ansari]] to create a new [[think tank]] which they named "These Islands". It is devoted to stimulating positive debate about Britain's identity, Brexit and the Scottish independence issue, and promoting the idea that staying united as a nation is beneficial to all the countries that make up Great Britain. A number of academics and activists have contributed papers to the These Islands website.<ref>{{cite news |last=Studemann |first=Frederick |date=8 November 2017 |title=Brexit and Britain's fraught democratic experiment |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d08dbfb8-c3e5-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |work=Financial Times |access-date=10 May 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.these-islands.co.uk/ |title=These Islands: Uniting Not Dividing |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=These Islands |access-date=10 May 2019 }}</ref>

In 2019, Holland was a signatory on a public letter to ''The Guardian'' denouncing [[Jeremy Corbyn]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and candidate for [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], for [[antisemitism]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/labour-antisemitism-row-public-figures-say-they-cannot-vote-for-party-under-corbyn|title=Labour antisemitism row: public figures say they cannot vote for party under Corbyn|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=2019-11-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-30|last2=Perraudin|first2=Frances|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In an article for ''The Telegraph'', he wrote that Corbyn's support for Palestinian activist [[Raed Salah]] was particularly offensive to him due to Salah's spread of the [[blood libel]], which originated in England in the 12th century: "England, as the birthplace of this most toxic of lies, has a particular responsibility to take a stand against it. Taking a stand against it, however, is something that Jeremy Corbyn, by backing a promoter of the blood libel, has failed to do."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/16/englands-shameful-history-blood-libel-compelled-denounce-corbyns/|title=As a historian of England’s shameful anti-Semitic past, I dread the idea of Prime Minister Corbyn|author=Tom Holland|date=16 November 2019|access-date=30 November 2019|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

===Yazidi===
While filming ''Isis: Origins of Evil'', Holland interviewed [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] refugees, survivors of an ethnoreligious population of northern Iraq who in 2014 suffered the mass murder of many of their men and older women, and the kidnapping of their children and young women, by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. In 2017, he wrote an article for ''The Spectator'' in which he implored the [[Western world]] not to forget the Yazidi. In it, he detailed what ISIS had inflicted upon the Yazidi: <blockquote>"Yazidis [were] shot and thrown like refuse into pits; men and boys beheaded in front of their families; girls as young as eight subjected to gang rape; beatings; forced conversions; torture; slavery. In a camp I visited, a woman who had been raped for an entire year, then shot in the head when her owner grew tired of her, then finally sold back to her husband, lay curled in a foetal ball in a makeshift tent, rocking and moaning to herself."<ref>{{cite news |last=Holland |first=Tom |date=12 August 2017 |title=Don't forget the Yazidis: To avoid the next genocide, remember the last |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/08/dont-forget-the-yazidis-to-avoid-the-next-genocide-remember-the-last/ |work=Spectator |access-date=17 June 2019 }}</ref> </blockquote>In June 2018, he gave an interview to [[James Delingpole]] on the latter's podcast and spoke about Western apathy toward the Yazidi's suffering: "Nobody in the West really gives a shit. And the reason nobody gives a shit, as a Yazidi refugee I spoke to said, is that in the West you have Christians, you have Muslims, you have Jews who all speak up for their co-religionists, but who cares about the Yazidi?

===Antisemitism===
Holland has also written about historical [[antisemitism]] in England and explained how one can draw a connection between this and more recent antisemitic attitudes expressed by some activists in the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] when under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/16/englands-shameful-history-blood-libel-compelled-denounce-corbyns/ |title= As a historian of England’s shameful anti-Semitic past, I dread the idea of Prime Minister Corbyn|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |author= Tom Holland |date=16 November 2019 |access-date=29 December 2020}}</ref>

==Views==

===Education===
Holland has been a proponent of state education over private, saying in 2014:<blockquote>The wealth that the leading [independent] schools can call upon has become obscene. How can state-funded schools possibly compete with sports fields and state-of-the-art facilities that have seen sport, acting and even popular music dominated by the privately educated? Which said, I am not convinced that the teaching in private schools is any better than in state schools. Our local primary school has teachers as good as any you could hope to meet, and when I compare the start that it has given my children to that given to the prep-school pupils I know, I do not remotely feel that my children have come off second-best. Just the opposite, in fact.<ref name=Latin>{{cite news |last=Holland |first=Tom |date=7 February 2014 |title=The Big Questions: Should Latin be taught in state schools? Is flooding in the UK a fact of life? Should Tube workers have gone on strike? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-big-questions-should-latin-be-taught-in-state-schools-is-flooding-in-the-uk-a-fact-of-life-9115637.html |work=The Independent |access-date=5 May 2019 }}</ref></blockquote>

He supported the plan by [[Secretary of State for Education]] [[Michael Gove]] to spread the teaching of Latin in state schools. saying in 2014: <blockquote>Traditionally, an education in ancient languages has served as a marker of privilege – which is why public schools have always been so keen on providing it. I don't see, though, why children should be deprived of the riches of classical civilisation, just because they are in the state system ... It is not an elitist policy but the precise opposite: impeccably progressive.<ref name=Latin/></blockquote>

===Christianity===
Although his father is an atheist, Holland was raised in the Christian church by his "devout [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]" mother, and he said in 2013 that because of her example "I've always associated Anglicanism with goodness and decency and generosity of spirit and compassion, so I never had that visceral association of Christianity or institutional religion with repression or dogma or illiberalism".<ref name=Shaha>{{cite news |last=Shaha |first=Alom |date=20 December 2013 |title='Secularism is Christianity's greatest gift to the world' |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4487/secularism-is-christianitys-greatest-gift-to-the-world |work=New Humanist |access-date=5 May 2019 }}</ref>  Nonetheless, as an adult he disavowed belief in the existence of God, saying "I have seen no evidence that would satisfy me that anything supernatural exists. I have seen no proof for god".<ref name=Shaha/>

In 2016, he wrote an article titled "Why I Was Wrong About Christianity" for the ''New Statesman'', in which he said that he had come to realise he was incorrect to have thought in the past that his own western values derived from the Greece and Rome of antiquity and owed nothing to Christianity: <blockquote>Familiarity with the biblical narrative of the crucifixion has dulled our sense of just how completely novel a deity Christ was ... [Christianity] is the principal reason why, by and large, most of us who live in post-Christian societies still take for granted that it is nobler to suffer than to inflict suffering. It is why we generally assume that every human life is of equal value. In my morals and ethics, I have learned to accept that I am not Greek or Roman at all, but thoroughly and proudly Christian.<ref>{{cite news |last=Holland |first=Tom |date=14 September 2016 |title=Tom Holland: Why I was wrong about Christianity |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/religion/2016/09/tom-holland-why-i-was-wrong-about-christianity |work=New Statesman |access-date=5 May 2019 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Islam and the Islamic State===
He has defended himself from critics who have suggested that his views on Islam and its origins are rooted in '[[Islamophobia]]', saying that he merely believes Islam should receive the same kind of historical analysis that other religions do. In 2013, he said in an interview with ''The Daily Telegraph'': "Islam is like a shot of caffeine into British culture. It adds a new dimension to the world, it enriches the variety and scope of our intellectual life."<ref name=Rahim/>

In March 2015, Holland published a piece titled "We must not deny the religious roots of Islamic State" in the ''New Statesman''. It argued that the jihadis of [[ISIS]] call themselves Islamic and use text from the Quran to justify their actions, so therefore people like the writer [[Mehdi Hasan]] ought not to claim they are not Muslims, as Hasan had in the previous week's issue. Holland wrote that "It is not merely coincidence that ISIS currently boasts a caliph, imposes quranically mandated taxes, topples idols, chops the hands off thieves, stones adulterers, executes homosexuals and carries a flag that bears the Muslim declaration of faith."<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/tom-holland-we-must-not-deny-relgious-roots-islamic-state newstatesman.com: "Tom Holland: We must not deny the religious roots of Islamic State"], 17 March 2015</ref> In 2017, he said "The mistake people make is to replicate Isis's position, which is that there's one, true form of Islam and anyone who deviates from that isn't a Muslim. That's Isis's justification for killing Shia. Ironically, when Western leaders say 'it's nothing to do with Islam', they're doing the same. I don't think it's the business—particularly of non-Muslims—to specify what a Muslim is. If people say they're Muslim, they're Muslim."<ref name=Urwin/>

In May 2015, Holland gave the inaugural [[Christopher Hitchens]] Lecture at the [[Hay Festival]], in which he addressed the subject of ''De-Radicalising Muhammad''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hayfestival.com/p-9673-tom-holland.aspx|title=Tom Holland|website=Hay Festival}}</ref> In an interview he gave to the literary website ''Quadrapheme'' the following month he explained that he wanted the lecture to promote discussion of the way [[Muhammad]]'s life is interpreted, arguing that his "mythos lies at the core of what is pernicious in the goings-on of Islamic State and other radicals."<ref name=quadrapheme>{{Cite web|title = Mission Impossible?
