'''Francisco Arriví''' (June 24, 1915 – February 8, 2007), a.k.a. ''Paco,'' was a writer, poet and playwright known as "The Father of the Puerto Rican Theater."

==Early years==
Arriví (birth name: '''Francisco Arriví Alegria''' <ref group=note>{{family name hatnote|'''Arriví'''|'''Alegria'''|lang=Spanish}}</ref>) was born in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], a section of the City [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]], to a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] father and [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] mother. He loved to read books, a habit which he acquired at the age of six. His grandmother, who used to take him to the theater every week, inspired his interest in theatrical works. He built a small stage in the backyard of his house on ''Calle [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'' (Wilson Street) when he was 10 years old where, together with his friends, he would make presentations of children's tales.<ref name="ND">{{Cite web |url=http://biblioteca.uprh.edu/cultural/biografias/letra%20a/Francisco%20Arrivi.htm |title=El Nuevo Dia |access-date=2009-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214407/http://biblioteca.uprh.edu/cultural/biografias/letra%20a/Francisco%20Arrivi.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
 
He received his primary education at the Padre Rufo and [[Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón]] public schools, and his secondary high school education at the ''Escuela Superior Central'' (Central High School). He became interested in writing poetry during this period of his life. After he graduated from high school, he applied for admission to [[University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras]] where he continued his education. He wrote one of his first musical compositions, ''Himno al Alma Máter,'' which is the official hymn of said educational institution and in 1938 earned a degree in Spanish and Latin-American literature.<ref name="FA">[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/escritores/FranciscoArriv%C3%AD.htm Francisco Arrivi]</ref>

==Theatrical career==
Upon his return to Puerto Rico, and under the direction of Leopoldo Santiago Lavandero, Arriví joined the ''Sociedad Dramática de Teatro Popular'' (Drama Society of Popular Theater), who called themselves ''Areyto'' (Areyto is a [[Taíno language|Taino]] word which means "majestic ceremonial dance"). Arriví used his experience with ''Areyto'' in his later theatrical presentations.

Arriví earned a living as an educator at the ''Escuela Superior de Ponce'' ([[Ponce High School]]) where he founded the school's student drama club, the ''Tinglado Puertorriqueño.'' In 1940 he began his career as a playwright at the school, after staging his original play ''Club de Solteros'' (Bachelors Club).<ref name="FA"/>

Arriví actively collaborated with an educational program sponsored by the Department of Education called ''Escuela del Aire'' (The Airwave School) broadcast over WIPR Radio. His show, ''From the Jungle to the Skyscrapers,'' presented many radio plays and was considered the best radio show on the island. These plays included ''Hacienda Villareal,'' ''Alma de Leyenda'' (Legendary Soul), ''Heroes de Guerra'' (War Heroes) and ''Pajinas de Nuestra Historia'' (Pages of our History), all written by Arriví.

In 1949, in [[New York City]], Arriví was granted a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation and earned his master's degree in Radio and Theater from [[Columbia University]].<ref name="FA"/>

In 1951, Arriví had the distinction of writing ''Ayer y Hoy'' (Yesterday and Today), the first television program transmitted in Puerto Rico. During the two years that he spent behind the T.V. cameras, he wrote the script for ''El Niño Dios'' (The Child God) and ''[[Luis Muñoz Rivera]]''.<ref name="FA"/>

In 1955, Arriví presented one of his greatest works ''Bolero y Plena'' at the University Theater and, in 1958, he presented ''Vejigantes'' in the First Festival of Puerto Rican Theater. These were followed by ''Sirena'' (Mermaid) and ''Medusa en la Bahía'' (Medusa in the Bay). In addition, Arriví gained international recognition and his plays were presented abroad.

In 1959, ''Vejigantes'' presented by Frank Dauster received an award from the Institute of Literature. That same year he was named director of the theater program of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture.

In 1961 he organized the First Playwright's Seminary. In the seventh celebration of the Puerto Rican Theater Festival, Arriví presented a new version of his first play ''Club de Solteros'' (Bachelors Club), now titled ''Coctel de Don Nadie'' (Mr. Nobody's Cocktail). His other acclaimed works include: ''Acto de Fe'' (Act of Faith), ''Cantico Para un Recuerdo'' (Song of Remembrance) and ''Absurdos Contra la Muerte'' (Absurdities Against Death).<ref name="FA"/>

==Poet==
In 1958, Arriví published his first book of poems titled ''Isla y Nada'' (Island and Nothing) which was awarded the first place prize of the ''Círculo Cultural Yaucano''.

In 1960, he published another book of poems titled ''Frontera'' (Frontier) which was also awarded the first place prize of the ''Círculo Cultural Yaucano,'' in addition to a first place prize from the Puerto Rican Institute of Literature.<ref name="FA"/>

Arriví was also the author of many essays dealing with the theater. Amongst these were ''Entrada por las Raíces,'' (Entering by the Roots), ''Conciencia Puertorriqueña del Teatro Contemporáneo'' (Puerto Rican Conscience of the Contemporary Theater), and ''Areyto Mayor'' (High Areyto).<ref name="FA"/>

Arriví, who was also the cousin of Dr. [[Ricardo Alegría]] known as the "Father of Modern Puerto Rican [[Archaeology]]", played an instrumental role in the establishment of the [[Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferré]] (Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center) in Puerto Rico.<ref name="ND"/>

On February 8, 2007, Arriví died of [[cardiac arrest]] at the Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital. A vigil was held at the ''Teatro Francisco Arriví'' (Francisco Arriví Theater), an old restored theater which the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture named in his honor. He was buried in the Cementerio Los Angeles cemetery of the city of [[Guaynabo]]. Arriví was survived by his son Francisco Arriví Cros and two grandchildren.<ref name="ND"/>

There is a commemorative plaque in the lobby of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]'s [[Teatro La Perla]] that reads: "Francisco Arriví: Poet, Playwright, Essayist, perennial promoter of Puerto Ricanism and of the eternal values of the universal man." It was placed there by the administration of mayor [[Jose Dapena Thompson]] (1984–1988).
