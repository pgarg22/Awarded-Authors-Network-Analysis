'''János Erdélyi''' (1814 in [[Veľké Kapušany]] &ndash; January 23, 1868 in [[Sárospatak]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] poet, critic, author, philosopher and ethnographist.

He was born in 1814 at [[Veľké Kapušany]] ([[Slovakia]]), in the county of [[Ung County|Ung]], and educated at the [[Protestant]] college of [[Sárospatak]]. In 1833 he removed to [[Pest (city)|Pest]], where he was, in 1839, elected member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He began his literary career with poems written in folk style (published in 1844).

His literary fame was made by his collection of Hungarian national poems and folk-tales, ''Magyar népköltési gyűjtemény, népdalok és mondák'' ("Collection of Hungarian Folklore, Folk Songs and Tales", Pest, 1846–1847). This work, published by the Kisfaludy Society, was supplemented his ''ilnon Hiinaarian national ooetrv'' <!-- ??? --> afterwards partially translated into German by Stier (Berlin, 1851). Erdélyi also compiled for the Kisfaludy Society an extensive collection of Hungarian proverbs ''Magyar közmondások könyve'' ("Book of Hungarian Proverbs", Pest, 1851),and was for some time editor of the ''Szépirodalmi Szemle'' ("Review of Polite Literature"). In 1848 he was appointed director of the national theatre at Pest; but after 1849 he resided at his native town. He died on 23 January 1868. A collection of [[folklore]] was published the year after his death, entitled ''A nép költészete: népdalok, népmesék és közmondások'' ("Poetry of the People: Folk Songs, Tales and Proverbs", Pest, 1869). This work contains 300 national songs, 19 folk-tales and 7362 Hungarian [[proverb]]s.

As a philosopher he was an utopian socialist, influenced by [[Hegel]].
