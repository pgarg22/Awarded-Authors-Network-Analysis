His novels include ''[[Quarantine (Crace novel)|Quarantine]]'', which was judged [[Costa Book Award|Whitbread Novel]] of 1998, and ''[[Harvest (Jim Crace novel)|Harvest]]'', which won the 2015 [[International Dublin Literary Award]], the 2013 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]], and was shortlisted for the 2013 [[Booker Prize]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Crace was born at [[Brocket Hall]], Hertfordshire, while it was a [[maternity hospital]]. He grew up on an estate in Enfield, north London and attended [[Enfield Grammar School]]. He studied for a degree at the Birmingham College of Commerce (now part of [[Birmingham City University]]), where he was enrolled as an [[University of London External System|external student]] of the [[University of London]].<ref>[http://europa.bcu.ac.uk/alumni/res/newsletter.pdf Europa.bcu.ac.uk]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/25/fiction.features|title =Death and the optimist|first =Sally|last = Vincent|
date=24 August 2001|newspaper =The Guardian}}</ref> While at university, Crace edited and contributed to the Birmingham Sun, [[Aston University]]'s student newspaper. He was awarded an external Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the University of London in 1968.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Immediately after graduating from university, Crace joined [[Voluntary Services Overseas]] (VSO) and was sent to [[Khartoum]], Sudan. He traveled through Africa and briefly taught at a village school called Kgosi Kgari Sechele Secondary School in Molepolole, Botswana. Two years later he returned to the UK, and worked for the [[BBC]] writing educational programmes.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Writing career===
From 1976 to 1987 he worked as a [[Freelancer|freelance journalist]], before giving up due to the excessive "political interference" he experienced at newspapers such as ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.<ref>Paris Review, 'Jim Crace, The Art of Fiction No. 179': "I had a falling out with the Sunday Times over what I took to be political interference. My report on the Broadwater Farm Estate, a mainly black housing project in Tottenham, North London, didn't match the editor's prejudices that it was a 'hellhole'." [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/122/the-art-of-fiction-no-179-jim-crace The Paris Review]</ref>

In 1974 he published his first work of prose fiction, ''Annie, California Plates'' in ''The New Review'', and in the next 10 years would write a number of short stories and [[radio drama|radio plays]], including:
* ''Helter Skelter, Hang Sorrow, Care’ll Kill a Cat'', The New Review (December 1975). Reprinted in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and included in ''Introduction 6: Stories by new writers'', [[Faber and Faber]] (1977).
* ''Refugees'', winner of the Socialist Challenge short story competition (judges: [[John Fowles]], [[Fay Weldon]], [[Terry Eagleton]]), [[Socialist Challenge (Canada)|Socialist Challenge]] (1977).
* ''Seven Ages'', [[Quarto]] (June 1980), broadcast as ''Middling'' by [[BBC Radio 3]].
* ''The Bird Has Flown'', radio play, broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], 28 October 1976.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/4f206ed94a6b42a797d2725567b8eb60 BBC]</ref>
* ''A Coat of Many Colours'', radio play, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 24 March 1979.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/7439b694d3654151974b534d6e9cf194 BBC]</ref>

''[[Continent (novel)|Continent]]'', Crace's first book, was published in 1986. The book's sale to America enabled him to leave journalism and concentrate on writing books. ''Continent'' consists of seven stories united by their setting and themes. It won the Whitbread First Novel of the Year Award, the David Higham Prize for Fiction, and the Guardian Fiction prize. ''[[New York Times]]'' critic Robert Olen Butler called it "brilliant, provocative and delightful".

Follow-up book ''[[The Gift of Stones]]'' is set in a village in the Neolithic period, while ''Quarantine'' is set in the Judean desert, 2000 years ago. The latter book won the Whitbread Novel Award in 1997, and was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]], as was his 2013 novel ''Harvest''. He won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 1999, for ''[[Being Dead]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
