'''William Rowley''' (c.1585 – February 1626) was an [[England|English]] Jacobean [[dramatist]], best known for works written in collaboration with more successful writers. His date of birth is estimated to have been c. 1585; he was buried on 11 February 1626 in the graveyard of [[St James's, Clerkenwell]] in north London. (An unambiguous record of Rowley's death was discovered in 1928,<ref>M. J. Dickson, "William Rowley," ''Times Literary Supplement,'' 28 March 1929, p. 260. Five days after his death, on 16 February 1626, his widow petitioned for relief in administering his estate.</ref> but some authorities persist in listing his death-date as 1642.)

==Life and work==
Rowley was an actor-playwright who specialized in playing clown characters (that is, characters whose function is to provide low comedy). He must also have been a large man, since his forte lay specifically in fat-clown roles. He played the Fat Bishop in [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[A Game at Chess]]'', and Plumporridge in the same author's ''Inner Temple Masque''. He also wrote fat-clown parts for himself to play: Jaques in ''All's Lost by Lust'' (a role "personated by the Poet," the 1633 quarto states), and Bustopha in ''The Maid in the Mill'', his collaboration with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]. He certainly played Simplicity in ''The World Tossed at Tennis'', and probably Chough in ''A Fair Quarrel'' — and since these are Middleton/Rowley collaborations, they qualify as two more parts that Rowley wrote for himself. (Internal evidence shows that in collaborations, Rowley normally handled the comic subplot – though he was not restricted solely to comic material: in ''The Changeling'', ''A Fair Quarrel'', and ''The Maid in the Mill'', he wrote substantial portions of the main plots as well.) The part of the otherwise-unnamed Clown in ''The Birth of Merlin'' shows signs of being another role that Rowley the playwright wrote with Rowley the actor in mind.

As a writer, Rowley was almost exclusively a dramatist; the pamphlet ''A Search for Money'' (1609) is his only sustained work of non-dramatic prose. Two plays are generally accepted as Rowley's solo works: ''A Shoemaker a Gentleman'' (c. 1607–9) and ''All's Lost by Lust'' (1619). Three other works that might have been Rowley solo plays have not survived: ''Hymen's Holidays or Cupid's Vagaries'' (1612), ''A Knave in Print'' (1613), and ''The Fool Without Book'' (also 1613).

Rowley appears to have begun his career working for [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]]. In 1609, he was part of a group of actors who set up a new playing company, the Duke of York's Men, which became known as [[Prince Charles's Men]] after 1612. Most of Rowley's career was spent writing and clowning for this company, which was based at a series of different playhouses, including the [[Curtain playhouse|Curtain]], the [[Hope Theatre|Hope]], and the Red Bull. Rowley was the troupe's payee for their Court performances in the 1610–15 era.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 473.</ref>

In 1623, Rowley left his company and joined the highly successful [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], until his death in 1626. Though relatively brief, his stay with the troupe was eventful: in 1624 he was embroiled in both the ''Game at Chess'' controversy in August and the ''[[The Spanish Viceroy|Spanish Viceroy]]'' affair in December. The roles he took with the company likely included Cacafogo in ''[[Rule a Wife and Have a Wife]]'', the Cook in ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy]]'', and Tony in ''[[A Wife for a Month]]''.<ref>Gurr, p. 239.</ref>

Notably, Rowley did not necessarily restrict his playwriting efforts to the company to which he was committed as an actor. In 1624 he was a member of the King's Men, Shakespeare's famous company, and in August of that year played in their notorious production of ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' — yet in the same year he worked on the now-lost play ''[[Keep the Widow Waking]]'' with Dekker, Ford, and Webster, which was intended for the Red Bull Theatre.

==Plays by Rowley==
Rowley's canon is plagued by uncertainty and by the complexities of collaboration: the following is only an approximate guide.
[[File:Houghton 14433.26.13 - Witch of Edmonton, title.jpg|thumb|''The Witch of Edmonton'', 1658]]
*''[[All's Lost by Lust]]'' (performed 1618–19; printed 1633)
*''[[The Birth of Merlin]]; or, The Child Hath Found its Father'' (performed 1622; printed 1662). The title page claims [[William Shakespeare]] as Rowley's co-writer, but this claim is disputed.
*''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'' (performed 1622; printed 1653). Co-written with [[Thomas Middleton]].
*''[[A Cure for a Cuckold]]'' (performed 1624; printed 1661). Co-written with [[John Webster]].
*''[[A Fair Quarrel]]'' (performed 1614–17; printed 1617). Co-written with [[Thomas Middleton]].
*''[[Fortune by Land and Sea]]'' (performed ''c.''1607; printed 1655). Co-written with [[Thomas Heywood]].
*''[[The Maid in the Mill]]'' (performed 1623; printed 1647). Co-written with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].
*''[[A Match at Midnight]]'' (performed ''c.''1622; printed 1633). Attributed only to 'W. R.', and stylistic analysis suggests that it may not be by Rowley.
*''[[A New Wonder, a Woman Never Vexed]]'' (performed 1610–14; printed 1632). Possibly a collaboration; [[George Wilkins]] and [[Thomas Heywood]] have been suggested as co-writers.
*''[[The Old Law]], or A New Way to Please You'' (performed 1618; printed 1656). Co-written with [[Thomas Middleton]], and, possibly, a third collaborator who may have been [[Philip Massinger]] or [[Thomas Heywood]].
*''[[A Shoemaker a Gentleman]]'' (date of composition unknown; printed 1638)
*''[[The Spanish Gypsy]]'' (performed 1623; printed 1653). Although the title page attributes this play to Rowley and [[Thomas Middleton]], stylistic analysis favours a different playwriting team: [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]].
*''[[The Thracian Wonder]]'' (date of composition unknown; printed 1661). The title page attributes this play to Rowley and [[John Webster]] although few readers accept Webster's presence.
*''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'' (performed and printed 1607). Co-written with [[George Wilkins]] and [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]].
*''[[Wit at Several Weapons]]'' (performed ''c.''1615; printed 1647). Although it was first printed as part of the [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] folio, stylistic analysis suggests that this play was heavily revised by Rowley and [[Thomas Middleton]].
*''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (performed 1621; published 1658). Co-written with [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]].
*''[[The World Tossed at Tennis]]'' (performed and printed 1620). Co-written with [[Thomas Middleton]].
