'''Lawrence Monsanto Ferlinghetti''' (March 24, 1919 – February 22, 2021) was an American poet, painter, social activist, and co-founder of [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights Booksellers & Publishers]].<ref name=WaPoObit/> The author of poetry, translations, fiction, theatre, art criticism, and film narration, Ferlinghetti was best known for his second collection of poems, ''[[A Coney Island of the Mind]]'' (1958), which has been translated into nine languages and sold over a million copies.<ref name="abouthebeats">{{Cite web |last=Mark Howell |date=2007-09-30 |title=About The Beats: The Key West Interview: Lawrence Ferlinghetti, 1994 |url=http://abouthebeats.blogspot.com/2007/09/by-mark-howell-watchman-what-of-night.html |access-date=2014-02-18 |publisher=Abouthebeats.blogspot.com}}</ref> When Ferlinghetti [[Centenarian|turned 100]] in March 2019, the city of [[San Francisco]] turned his birthday, March 24, into "Lawrence Ferlinghetti Day".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Veltman |first=Chloe |date=March 20, 2019 |title=City Lights founder Lawrence Ferlinghetti: 'The US isn't ready for a revolution' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/19/lawrence-ferlinghetti-turned-100-interview-city-lights |access-date=March 24, 2019 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

Ferlinghetti was born on March 24, 1919, in [[Yonkers, New York]].<ref name="heritage">{{Cite web |title=Academic.Brooklyn |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/modlang/carasi/via/ViaVol3_1Kirschenbaum.htm |access-date=October 30, 2006 |website=Lawrence Ferlinghetti's italianita}}</ref> 
Shortly before his birth, his father, Carlo, a native of [[Brescia]], died of a heart attack;<ref name=WaPoObit/> and his mother, Clemence Albertine (née Mendes-Monsanto), of [[Sephardic Jewish]] descent, was committed to a mental hospital shortly after.

He served in the [[U.S. Navy]] throughout [[World War II]], as the captain of a [[submarine chaser]] in the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy invasion]].<ref>{{cite news |title="On the Road," "Howl" and Poetry as Insurgent Art: Legendary Bookseller Lawrence Ferlinghetti on the Beat Generation |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2007/9/3/legendary_beat_generation_bookseller_and_poet |access-date=25 February 2021 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=3 September 2007}}</ref> In 1947, he earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in English literature from [[Columbia University]] with a thesis on [[John Ruskin]] and the British painter [[J.

Ferlinghetti met his wife-to-be, Selden Kirby-Smith, the granddaughter of [[Edmund Kirby-Smith]], in 1946 aboard a ship en route to France. They were both heading to Paris to study at the [[Sorbonne]]. Kirby-Smith went by the name Kirby.<ref name="sfgate2012" />

He moved to San Francisco in 1951 and founded City Lights in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] in 1953, in partnership with [[Peter D.

==Poetry==

Ferlinghetti published many of the [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets and is considered by some as a Beat poet as well.<ref name="Gold 2013">{{Cite news |last=Gold |first=Daniel |date=February 7, 2013 |title=A Beat Generation Star Who Won't Answer to that Name |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/movies/ferlinghetti-a-rebirth-of-wonder-by-christopher-felver.html |access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> Yet Ferlinghetti did not consider himself to be a Beat poet, as he said in the 2013 documentary ''Ferlinghetti: Rebirth of Wonder'': "Don't call me a Beat. I was never a Beat poet."<ref name="Gold 2013" />

[[File:Lawrence Ferlinghetti 2012 04.jpg|thumb|Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 2012 at Caffe Trieste]]

Ferlinghetti penned much of his early poetry in the vein of [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref name="Foley 2008">{{Cite magazine |last=Foley |first=Jack |date=2008 |title=A Second Coming |url=https://poetrysociety.org.uk/directory/contemporary-poetry-review/ |magazine=Contemporary Poetry Review |access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> Ferlinghetti told poet and critic [[Jack Foley (poet)|Jack Foley]], "Everything I wrote sounded just like him."<ref name="Foley 2008" /> Yet, even in his poems inspired by Eliot such as Ferlinghetti's "Constantly Risking Absurdity," Ferlinghetti is ever the populist as he compares the poet first to a trapeze artist in a circus and then to a "little charleychaplin man."<ref name="Foley 2008" />

Critics have noted that Ferlinghetti's poetry often takes on a highly visual dimension as befits this poet who was also a painter.<ref name="Landauer 2015">{{Cite magazine |last=Landauer |first=Susan and Carl |date=March 1, 2015 |title=Open Eye, Open Palette: The Art of Lawrence Ferlinghetti. |magazine=[[Confrontation (journal)|Confrontation]] |volume=117 |issue=17 |pages=93–108}}</ref> As the poet and critic Jack Foley states, Ferlinghetti's poems "tell little stories, make 'pictures'."<ref name="Foley cprw">{{Cite magazine |last=Foley |first=Jack |date=2008 |title=A Second Coming |url=http://www.cprw.com/Foley/ferlinghetti.htm |magazine=Contemporary Poetry Review |access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> Ferlinghetti as a poet paints with his words pictures full of color capturing the average American experience as seen in his poem "In Golden Gate Park that Day: "In [[Golden Gate Park]] that day/ a man and his wife were coming along/ ... He was wearing green suspenders ... while his wife was carrying a bunch of grapes."<ref name="Landauer 2015" /> In the first poem in ''A Coney Island of the Mind'' entitled, "In Goya's Greatest Scenes, We Seem To See," Ferlinghetti describes with words the "suffering humanity" that Goya portrayed by brush in his paintings.<ref name="Foley 2008" /> Ferlinghetti concludes his poem with the recognition that "suffering humanity" today might be painted as average Americans drowning in the materialism: "on a freeway fifty lanes wide/ a concrete continent/ spaced with bland billboards/ illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ferlinghetti |first=Lawrence |url=https://archive.org/details/coneyislandofmin0000ferl_u7s4/page/1 |title=A Coney Island of the Mind |date=2015 |publisher=New Directions |isbn=9780811217477 |edition=50th Anniversary |page=[https://archive.org/details/coneyislandofmin0000ferl_u7s4/page/1 1] |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Ferlinghetti took a distinctly populist approach to poetry, emphasizing throughout his work "that art should be accessible to all people, not just a handful of highly educated intellectuals."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lawrence Ferlinghetti |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/lawrence-ferlinghetti |access-date=November 4, 2016 |website=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> [[Larry Smith (editor)|Larry Smith]], an American author and editor, stated that Ferlinghetti is a poet, "of the people engaged conscientiously in the creation of new poetic and cultural forms."<ref name="Robinson 1984 119–120" /> This perception of art as a broad socio-cultural force, as opposed to an elitist academic enterprise, is explicitly evident in Poem 9 from ''Pictures of the Gone World'', wherein the speaker states: {{"'}}Truth is not the secret of a few' / yet / you would maybe think so / the way some / librarians / and cultural ambassadors and / especially museum directors / act" (1–8). In addition to Ferlinghetti's aesthetic egalitarianism, this passage highlights two additional formal features of the poet's work, namely, his incorporation of a common American idiom as well as his experimental approach to line arrangement which, as Crale Hopkins notes, is inherited from the poetry of [[William Carlos Williams]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hopkins |first=Crale |date=1974 |title=The Poetry of Lawrence Ferlinghetti: A Reconsideration |journal=[[Italian Americana]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=59–76 |jstor=29775818}}</ref>

Reflecting his broad aesthetic concerns, Ferlinghetti's poetry often engages with several non-literary artistic forms, most notably [[jazz music]] and painting. William Lawlor asserts that much of Ferlinghetti's free verse attempts to capture the spontaneity and imaginative creativity of modern jazz; the poet is noted for having frequently incorporated jazz accompaniments into public readings of his work.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lawlor |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMZqLXP01e4C&q=ferlinghetti+jazz&pg=PA341 |title=Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact |date=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781851094059 |location=Santa Barbara |pages=34–37 |access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Political engagement==
Soon after settling in San Francisco in 1951, Ferlinghetti met the poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]], whose concepts of [[philosophical anarchism]] influenced his political development. He self-identified as a [[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical anarchist]], regularly associated with other anarchists in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]], and sold Italian anarchist newspapers at the [[City Lights Bookstore]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |author-link=Kevin Kelly (editor) |date=Winter 1988 |title=Lawrence Ferlinghetti – interview |work=[[Whole Earth Review]] |issue=61 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_n61/ai_6896896 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628124345/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_n61/ai_6896896/ |archive-date=2009-06-28}} "I'm in the anarchist tradition. By "anarchist" I don't mean someone with a homemade bomb in his pocket. I mean philosophical anarchism in the tradition of [[Herbert Read|Herbert Reed]] in England."</ref> A critic of [[U.S. foreign policy]], Ferlinghetti took a stand against [[totalitarianism]] {{clarify|date=July 2020}} and war. While Ferlinghetti said he was "an anarchist at heart", he conceded that the world would need to be populated by "saints" in order for pure [[anarchism]] to be lived practically. Hence he espoused what can be achieved by Scandinavian-style [[democratic socialism]].<ref>Felver, Christopher. 1996 ''The Coney Island of Lawrence Ferlinghetti''. San Francisco: Mystic Fire Video [documentary film].</ref>

Ferlinghetti's work challenges the definition of art and the artist's role in the world. He urged poets to be engaged in the political and cultural life of the country. As he writes in ''Populist Manifesto'': "Poets, come out of your closets, Open your windows, open your doors, You have been holed up too long in your closed worlds ... Poetry should transport the public / to higher places / than other wheels can carry it ..."{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

On January 14, 1967, he was a featured presenter at the [[Gathering of the tribes]] "[[Human Be-In]]," which drew tens of thousands of people and launched San Francisco's "[[Summer of Love]]." In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968, ''[[New York Post]]''</ref>

In 1998, in his inaugural address as Poet Laureate of San Francisco, Ferlinghetti urged San Franciscans to vote to remove a portion of the earthquake-damaged [[Central Freeway]] and replace it with a [[Octavia Boulevard|boulevard]]. "What destroys the poetry of a city? Automobiles destroy it, and they destroy more than the poetry. All over America, all over Europe in fact, cities and towns are under assault by the automobile, are being literally destroyed by car culture. But cities are gradually learning that they don't have to let it happen to them. Witness our beautiful new [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]! And in San Francisco right now we have another chance to stop Autogeddon from happening here. Just a few blocks from here, the ugly [[Central Freeway]] can be brought down for good if you vote for Proposition E on the November ballot."<ref>[http://www.citylights.com/Ferlinghetti/?fa=ferlinghetti_interviews "Poetry and City Culture"]. Address at the San Francisco Public Library, October 13, 1998. Accessed February 19, 2016.</ref> The result was [[Octavia Boulevard]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In March 2012, he added his support to the movement to save the Gold Dust Lounge, a historic bar in San Francisco, which lost its lease in [[Union Square, San Francisco, California|Union Square]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Painting==
Alongside his bookselling and publishing, Ferlinghetti painted for 60 years and much of his work was displayed in galleries and museums throughout the United States.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal |date=2008 |title=Lawrence Ferlinghetti Wins the John Ciardi Award for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry |journal=Italian Americana |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=167–170 |jstor=41353794}}</ref>

In 2009, Ferlinghetti became a member of the Honour Committee of the Italian artistic literary movement IMMAGINE&POESIA, founded under the patronage of [[Aeronwy Thomas]]. A retrospective of Ferlinghetti's artwork, ''60 Years of Painting'', was staged in [[Rome]] and [[Reggio Calabria]] in 2010.<ref>''Lawrence Ferlinghetti: 60 years of painting'', edited by Giada Diano and Elisa Polimeni, Silvana Editoriale, Cinisello Balsamo (MI), 2009</ref>

==Jack Kerouac Alley==
In 1987, he was the initiator of the transformation of [[Jack Kerouac Alley]], located at the side of his shop. He presented his idea to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] calling for repavement and renewal.<ref name="sfgate1">{{Cite news |last=Nolte |first=Carl |date=March 30, 2007 |title=Kerouac Alley has face-lift |work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Kerouac-Alley-has-face-lift-2605999.php |access-date=November 18, 2007}}</ref>

In 2012, Ferlinghetti was awarded the inaugural [[Janus Pannonius International Poetry Prize]] from the [[Hungarian PEN Club]]. After learning that the government of Hungary under Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] is a partial sponsor of the {{currency|50,000|EUR}} prize, he declined to accept the award.

The Italian band [[Timoria]] dedicated the song "Ferlinghetti Blues" (from the album ''El Topo Grand Hotel'') to the poet, where Ferlinghetti recites one of his poems. Recordings of Ferlinghetti reading want ads, as featured on radio station [[KPFA]] in 1957, were recorded by [[Henry Jacobs]] and are featured on the [[Meat Beat Manifesto]] album 'At the Center'. Ferlinghetti gave Canadian punk band [[Propagandhi]] permission to use his painting ''The Unfinished Flag of the United States'', which features a map of the world painted in the stars and stripes, as the cover of their 2001 release ''[[Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes]]''. Before this, the same painting was used for the cover of [[Michael Parenti]]'s 1995 book, ''Against Empire'', which was published by City Lights.

Ferlinghetti recited the poem ''Loud Prayer'' at [[The Band]]'s final performance; the concert was filmed by [[Martin Scorsese]] and released as a documentary entitled ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', which included Ferlinghetti's recitation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/01/the-band-the-lords-prayer-lawrence-ferlinghetti.html|title=The Band - the Lord's Prayer (Lawrence Ferlinghetti)|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref> [[Julio Cortázar]], in his ''[[Rayuela]]'' (''Hopscotch'') (1963), references a poem from ''A Coney Island of the Mind'' in Chapter 121.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonet |first1=Juan Manuel |title=Para un diccionario Cortázar-París |journal=Rayuela: El París de Cortázar |date=May 2013 |page=131 |access-date= 25 February 2021 |publisher=Instituto Cervantes París |url=https://ep00.epimg.net/descargables/2013/06/28/2783ac7deb8601250cdb495da52e0dfd.pdf}}</ref> He appears as himself in the 2006 comedy film ''[[The Darwin Awards (film)|The Darwin Awards]]''.

[[Roger McGuinn]], the former leader of the [[Byrds]], refers to Ferlinghetti and "A Coney Island of the Mind" in his song "Russian Hill", from his 1977 album ''[[Thunderbyrd]]''. [[Cyndi Lauper]] was inspired by ''A Coney Island of the Mind'' to write the song "[[Into the Nightlife]]" for her 2008 album ''[[Bring Ya to the Brink]]''. Seamus McNally's 2007 filmed adaptation of Jacques Prévert's "To Paint the Portrait of a Bird" uses Ferlinghetti's English translation as its narrative text.

The [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps]]'s 2008 marching show was entitled "Constantly Risking Absurdity", with movements entitled after various lines in Ferlinghetti's poem. The corps took second place at the [[Drum Corps International]] Finals. [[Aztec Two-Step]] is an American folk-rock band formed by Rex Fowler and Neal Shulman at a chance meeting on open stage at a Boston coffee house, the Stone Phoenix, in 1971. The band was named after a line from the poem "A Coney Island of the Mind" by Ferlinghetti. [[Bristol Sound]] band ''Unforscene'' used Ferlinghetti's poem "Pictures of the Gone World 11" (or "The World is a Beautiful Place ...") in the song "The World Is" on its 2002 album ''New World Disorder''.

Ferlinghetti was played in the 2010 film [[Howl (2010 film)|''Howl'']] by Andrew Rogers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/23/lawrence-ferlinghetti-poet-activist-dies-471233|title = Lawrence Ferlinghetti, poet and activist, dies at 101}}</ref>

In 2011, Ferlinghetti contributed two of his poems to the celebration of the 150th [[anniversary of Italian unification]], ''Song of the Third World War'' and ''Old Italians Dying'' inspired by the artists of the exhibition ''Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Italy 150'' held in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] (May–June 2011).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2001-06-03 |title=Evento Ferlinghetti: La poesia incontra l'arte |url=http://www.artecittaamica.it/mostre/2011/0527/to7.pdf |access-date=February 18, 2014 |website=LA STAMPA |publisher=Arte Citta' Amica}}</ref> On the book of lithographs ''The Sea Within Us'' first published in Italy as ''Il Mare Dentro'' in 2012, Ferlinghetti collaborated with lithographer and abstract artist [[James Claussen]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=James Claussen |url=http://www.jamesclaussen.com/about-james-claussen.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Sea Within Us |date=February 14, 2013|publisher=Aletti Editore|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Within-Us-Lawrence-Ferlinghetti-ebook/dp/B00BG0HJ6G}}</ref>
