'''Johann Ludwig Tieck''' ({{IPAc-en|t|iː|k}}; {{IPA-de|tiːk|lang}}; 31 May 1773{{snd}}28 April 1853) was a German poet, fiction writer, translator, and critic. He was one of the founding fathers of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Early life==
Tieck was born in [[Berlin]], the son of a rope-maker. His siblings were the sculptor [[Christian Friedrich Tieck]] and the poet [[Sophie Tieck]]. He was educated at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrichswerdersches Gymnasium|de}}, where he learned Greek and Latin, as required in most preparatory schools. He also began learning Italian at a very young age, from a grenadier with whom he became acquainted. Through this friendship, Tieck was given a first-hand look at the poor, which could be linked to his work as a Romanticist. He later attended the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]]. At Göttingen, he studied [[Shakespeare]] and [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] drama.<ref name=EB1911/>

On returning to Berlin in 1794, Tieck attempted to make a living by writing. He contributed a number of short stories (1795&ndash;98) to the series ''Straussfedern'', published by the bookseller [[C. F. Nicolai]] and originally edited by [[J. K. A. Musäus]]. He also wrote ''Abdallah'' (1796) and a novel in letters, ''William Lovell'' (3 vols, 1795&ndash;96).<ref name=EB1911/>

==Adoption of Romanticism==
Tieck's transition to [[Romanticism]] is seen in the series of plays and stories published under the title ''Volksmärchen von Peter Lebrecht'' (3 vols., 1797), a collection containing the fairy tale ''[[Der blonde Eckbert]]'', which blends exploration of the paranoiac mind with the realm of the supernatural, and a witty dramatic satire on Berlin literary taste, ''[[Der gestiefelte Kater]]''. With his school and college friend [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]] (1773–1798), he planned the novel ''[[Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen]]'' (vols. i–ii. 1798) which, with Wackenroder's ''Herzensergiessungen'' (1796), was the first expression of the Romantic enthusiasm for old German art.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1798 Tieck married and in the following year settled in [[Jena]], where he, the two brothers [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|August]] and [[Friedrich von Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], and [[Novalis]] were the leaders of the early Romantic school (also known as [[Jena Romanticism]]). His writings between 1798 and 1804 include the satirical drama, ''Prinz Zerbino'' (1799), and ''Romantische Dichtungen'' (2 vols., 1799–1800). The latter contains Tieck's most ambitious dramatic poems, ''Leben und Tod der heiligen Genoveva'', ''Leben und Tod des kleinen Rotkäppchens'', which were followed in 1804 by the "comedy" in two parts, ''Kaiser Oktavianus''. These dramas are typical plays of the first Romantic school. Although formless and destitute of dramatic qualities, they show the influence of both [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and Shakespeare. ''Kaiser Oktavianus'' is a poetic glorification of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1801 Tieck went to [[Dresden]], then lived for a time at [[Cybinka|Ziebingen]] near [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt]], and spent many months in Italy. In 1803 he published a translation of ''Minnelieder aus der schwäbischen Vorzeit'', then between 1799 and 1804 an excellent version of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and in 1811 two volumes of Elizabethan dramas, ''Altenglisches Theater''. From 1812 to 1817 he collected in three volumes a number of his earlier stories and dramas, under the title ''Phantasus''. In this collection appeared the stories "Der Runenberg", "Die Elfen", "Der Pokal", and the dramatic fairy tale "Fortunat".<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1817 Tieck visited England in order to collect materials for a work on Shakespeare, which was never finished. In 1819 he settled permanently in Dresden, and from 1825 he was literary adviser to the Court Theatre. His semi-public readings from the dramatic poets gave him a reputation which extended far beyond the capital of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]. The new series of short stories which he began to publish in 1822 also won him a wide popularity. Notable among these are "Die Gemälde", "Die Reisenden", "Die Verlobung", and "Des Lebens Überfluss".

More ambitious and on a wider canvas are the historical or semi-historical novels ''Dichterleben'' (1826), ''Der Aufruhr in den Cevennen'' (1826, unfinished), and ''Der Tod des Dichters'' (1834). ''Der junge Tischlermeister'' (1836; but begun in 1811) is a work written under the influence of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister''. His story of ''Vittoria Accorombona'' (1840) was written in the style of the French Romanticists and shows a falling-off.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Later years==
In later years Tieck carried on a varied literary activity as a critic (''Dramaturgische Blätter'', 2 vols., 1825–1826; ''Kritische Schriften'', 2 vols., 1848). He also edited the translation of Shakespeare by [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], who was assisted by Tieck's daughter [[Dorothea Tieck|Dorothea]] (1790–1841) and by [[Wolf Heinrich, Graf von Baudissin]] (1789–1878); ''Shakespeares Vorschule'' (2 vols., 1823–1829); and the works of [[Heinrich von Kleist]] (1826) and of [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1828). In 1841 [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]] invited Tieck to Berlin, where he received a pension for his remaining years. He died in Berlin on 28 April 1853.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Literary significance==
Tieck's importance lay in the readiness with which he adapted himself to the emerging new ideas which arose at the close of the 18th century, as well as his Romantic works, such as ''Der blonde Eckbert''. His importance in [[German poetry]], however, is restricted to his early period. In later years it was as the helpful friend and adviser of others, or as the well-read critic of wide sympathies, that Tieck distinguished himself.<ref name=EB1911/>

Tieck also influenced [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''. It was from ''Phantasus'' that Wagner based the idea of Tannhäuser going to see the Pope and of Elisabeth dying in the song battle.

==Works==
Tieck's ''Schriften'' appeared in twenty volumes (1828–1846), and his ''Gesammelte Novellen'' in twelve (1852–1854). ''Nachgelassene Schriften'' were published in two volumes in 1855. There are several editions of ''Ausgewählte Werke'' by H. Welti (8 vols., 1886–1888); by J. Minor (in Kirschner's ''Deutsche Nationalliteratur'', 144, 2 vols., 1885); by G. Klee (with an excellent biography, 3 vols., 1892), and G. Witkowski (4 vols., 1903)<ref name=EB1911/> and Marianne Thalmann (4 vols., 1963–66).

==Translations==
"The Elves" and "The Goblet" were translated by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in ''German Romance'' (1827), "The Pictures" and "The Betrothal" by Bishop Thirlwall (1825). A translation of ''Vittoria Accorombona'' was published in 1845.<ref name=EB1911/> A translation of "Des Lebens Überfluss" ("Life's Luxuries", by E. N. Bennett) appeared in ''German Short Stories'' in the [[Oxford University Press]] ''World's Classics'' series in 1934, but the wit of the original comes over more strongly in ''The Superfluities of Life. A Tale Abridged from Tieck,'' which appeared anonymously in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' in February 1845. ''The Journey into the Blue Distance'' (''Das Alte Buch: oder Reise ins Blaue hinein'', 1834). "The Romance of Little Red Riding Hood" (1801) was translated by Jack Zipes and included in his book "The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood."

==Influences==
Tieck's biggest influence was 16th-century Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso]], who is featured in Tieck's novel, ''Vittoria Accorombona'', as a secondary character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}
