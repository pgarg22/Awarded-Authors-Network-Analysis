'''Sterling Edmund Lanier''' (December 18, 1927 – June 28, 2007) was an American editor, [[science fiction author]] and sculptor.<ref name="Clute2007">{{cite web |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2753352.ece |date=July 11, 2007 |title=Sterling E.

==Life==
Lanier was born on December 18, 1927 in [[New York City]] to Priscilla Thorne Taylor and Berwick Bruce Lanier.<ref name="Reginald2010">{{cite book|last=Reginald|first=R.|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature: A Checklist 1700-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L25ycEzuXxIC&pg=PA968|volume=2: Contemporary Science FIction Authors II|year=1979|publisher=Gale Research Company|isbn=978-0-941028-77-6|pages=968–969}}</ref> He was trained as an anthropologist and archaeologist, and educated at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], from which he graduated during 1951. He was a lifelong devotee of [[speculative fiction]], as well as a [[cryptozoology]] enthusiast. Before beginning his literary career Lanier worked as a research historian at the [[Winterthur Museum]] from 1958 to 1960.<ref name="SFFA">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfwa.org/news/2007/slanier.htm |date=June 30, 2007 |title=Sterling E.

==Literary career==
Lanier's career as an author and editor began during 1961, when his first short story was published and he became an editor for [[Chilton Publishing Company|Chilton Books]].

He was with Chilton in 1965, when he was instrumental in persuading the firm to publish [[Frank Herbert]]’s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. Having read ''Dune World'' in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' magazine, he was responsible for tracking down the author and conveying Chilton's offer. More than twenty other publishing companies had already turned the book down.  Despite Lanier's brilliant insight on the worth of the book, he was dismissed from Chilton a year later because of high publication costs and poor initial book sales. Lanier also worked as an editor for the [[John C. Winston Company]] and [[McRae-Smith]].

The most prominent of Lanier's own writings are his stories of the crypto-adventurer Brigadier Donald Ffellowes (told in the "club story" style of [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[Jorkens]]'' tales), and the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] novels ''[[Hiero's Journey (novel)|Hiero's Journey]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Unforsaken Hiero (novel)|The Unforsaken Hiero]]'' (1983). His short story "A Father's Tale" (1974) was a [[World Fantasy Award]] nominee. His major works including ''Hiero's Journey'', ''The Unforsaken Hiero'', and the Brigadier Ffellowes stories are now available in an electronic version for Kindle.

==Sculpture==
Lanier’s sculptures have been exhibited at a number of museums, including the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He specialized in miniatures, among which were a series featuring characters from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]] ''. One set was given to Tolkien himself, with whom Lanier corresponded. Tolkien reportedly admired the miniatures but did not want them to be marketed commercially, a wish Lanier respected.
