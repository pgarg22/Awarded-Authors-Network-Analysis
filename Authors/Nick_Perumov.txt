'''Nick Perumov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ник Перумов}}) is the pen name of '''Nikolay Daniilovich Perumov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Николай Даниилович Перумов}}; born 21 November 1963), a Russian [[fantasy]] and science fiction writer.

== Biography ==

Perumov was born 21 November 1963 in [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]]. His father, Daniil Alexandrovich Perumov, was a biologist. Nikolai began writing short stories when he was a teenager, and after reading ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the early 1980s, he became a fantasy fan. After studying at the [[Leningrad Polytechnical Institute]], Perumov worked at a research institute, and later as a translator.

In 1985–1991 he wrote his first fantasy novel ''Нисхождение тьмы (Descent of Darkness)'', which consisted of two volumes: ''Эльфийский Клинок (Elven Blade)'' and ''Черное Копье (Black Lance)''. The book was set in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], 300 years after the [[War of the Ring]]. Perumov initially regarded his novel as just a [[fan fiction]] written for friends, until one of his colleagues offered to publish it. In 1993 the duology, re-edited and renamed ''Кольцо Тьмы (The Ring of Darkness)'' was published by [[Severo-Zapad]], which paid Perumov a small sum of $300. ''The Ring of Darkness'' was a surprising success. It sold at least 100,000 copies, and spurred Perumov's popularity. The book also provoked a controversy in [[Tolkien fandom]]; some fans considered it was not fair to set the book in Middle-earth rather than Perumov's own setting, and to challenge Tolkien's philosophy of "[[Conflict between good and evil|Good against Evil]]" in it. ''Koltso Tmy'', however, was one of a number of such projects, as several other 1990's Russian writers, including Natalia "Niennah" Vasilyeva and [[Kirill Yeskov]], would publish unauthorized Middle-earth books that challenged Tolkien far more sharply.

After the success of his debut, Perumov decided to start a career as a professional writer. He wrote the novel ''Гибель Богов (Godsdoom''), heavily inspired by Norse mythology. It was the first book to be set in ''Упорядоченное (The Consistent)'', a multiverse of many connected worlds. The Consistent became the main setting of his following books, including the most known, 8-volume series ''Хранитель Мечей (The Keeper of Swords)''.

Over 4 million copies of Perumov's books have been published and his work has been translated into many languages, [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and Eastern European mostly. One of his books, Godsdoom has also been translated to English by Liv Bliss. At [[Eurocon]] 2004 he was given an award as the best fiction writer of Europe. He is a good friend of [[Vera Kamsha]], whom he persuaded to start a career as a writer. In the 2000s Kamsha also became a popular fantasy writer. Perumov enjoys [[Melnitsa]] music and wrote a cameo appearance for the band in one of his books.

In 1998, during the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian financial crisis]], Perumov moved to the United States. He currently works there for [[North Carolina Research Campus]] as a microbiologist. Nick claims writing is his '[[hobby]]', and science is his job.

'''Империя Превыше Всего (Empire Above All)'''

This science fiction duology tells about a distant future in which the "German nation" became the human hegemon in the Galaxy, namely through abandoning its Nazi ideology in favour of a multicultural "Empire Above All" nationalism. The book centers on the quest of Ruslan Fateev to attain independence for his homeworld of New Crimea, the sole Russian-speaking corner of the Empire (according to the books, the overwhelming majority of Russians chose voluntary Germanisation over the centuries). All this is set in an atmosphere of uprisings of a federation of colony worlds against the Empire and the invasion of human planets by mysterious alien creatures named "Biomorphs".
