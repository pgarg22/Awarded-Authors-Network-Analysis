'''Pamela Ayres''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 14 March 1947) is an English poet, comedian, songwriter and presenter of radio and television programmes. Her 1975 appearance on the television talent show ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' led to appearances on other TV and radio shows, a one-woman touring stage show and performing before The Queen.

==Early life==
Pam Ayres was born in [[Stanford in the Vale]], Berkshire (now administered as part of [[Oxfordshire]]), the youngest of six children (having four elder brothers and a sister) of Stanley and Phyllis Ayres. Her father worked for 44 years as a [[lineworker|linesman]] for the Southern Electricity Board, having been a Sergeant in the [[Grenadier Guards]] during the [[Second World War]]. Ayres considered her upbringing "a country childhood"; she was raised in one of a row of small council houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/17/pam-ayres-my-family-values|title=Pam Ayres: My family values|first=Tina|last=Jackson|date=16 September 2011|website=The Guardian|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=25 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725211203/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/17/pam-ayres-my-family-values|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/pam-ayres-ayres-and-graces-787688.html|title=Pam Ayres: Ayres and graces|date=1 March 2008|website=The Independent|access-date=25 July 2021|archive-date=25 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725211201/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/pam-ayres-ayres-and-graces-787688.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lady.co.uk/i-met-my-husband-broadway-lewisham-broadway|title='I met my husband on broadway...

After leaving Faringdon Secondary School at the age of 15, she joined the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] as a clerical assistant and worked at the Army (RAOC) Central Ordnance Depot in [[Bicester]]. She soon left and signed up for the [[Women's Royal Air Force]], where she trained as a Plotter Air Photographer, working at [[JARIC]] in a drawing office dealing with operational maps.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= Fight of Flight |series= [[QI]] |network= [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]|airdate= 12 December 2009|season= F }}</ref> Whilst serving in the air force, she gained [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-level]] passes in English language and English literature and began her career as an entertainer. She began reading her verses at the local folk club in Oxfordshire, and this led to an invitation to read on the local [[BBC Radio]] station in 1974. Her reading was re-broadcast nationally, and then broadcast again as an item in the BBC's ''Pick of the Year''.

[[Bob Dylan]] inspired Ayres to write poetry,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5311602.stm|title=The Magazine Monitor|date=8 September 2006|via=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=22 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122175433/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5311602.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> and in a 2006 interview she added that, at the age of twelve, she enjoyed writing parodies of the [[Lonnie Donegan]] songs popular at that time.

==Career==
In 1975, Ayres appeared on the television talent show ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]''. This led to a wide variety of guest appearances on TV and radio shows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0674z0n|title=BBC One - The TV That Made Me, Series 1, Pam Ayres|website=BBC|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=3 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003194657/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0674z0n|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then she has published six books of poems, toured in a one-woman stage show, hosted her own TV show and performed her stage show for the Queen.

Her poetry has a deceptively simple style and deals with everyday subject matter. Her poem "Oh, I Wish I'd Looked After Me Teeth", was voted into the Top 10 of a BBC poll to find the nation's 100 Favourite Comic Poems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/190291.stm|title=BBC News &#124; ENTERTAINMENT &#124; Top poetry is complete nonsense|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612150147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/190291.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[UK Arts Council]]'s report on poetry, Ayres was identified as the fifth best-selling poet in Britain in 1998 and 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Ayres continues to perform her work, the humorous quality of which is enhanced by her idiosyncratic delivery and by her distinctive North Berkshire accent.

From 1996, Ayres has appeared frequently on [[BBC Radio]]: from 1996 until 1999 Ayres presented a two-hour music and chat show every Sunday afternoon on [[BBC Radio 2]]; this was followed by two series of ''Pam Ayres' Open Road'', in which she visited various parts of the United Kingdom, interviewing people with interesting stories to tell about their lives and local areas. More recently Ayres has become a regular contributor to [[BBC Radio 4]], appearing in programmes such as ''[[Just a Minute]]'', ''Say the Word'', ''[[That Reminds Me]]'', and six series of her own show, ''Ayres on the Air'', a radio show of her poetry and sketches.<ref name="Pam Ayres">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pamayres.com/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211193142/http://www.pamayres.com/index.asp|url-status=dead|title=Pam Ayres<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=11 December 2006}}</ref>

In 2007, Ayres acted in a radio [[Situation comedy|sitcom]], ''[[Potting On]]'' for Radio 4, co-starring [[Geoffrey Whitehead]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/pottingon/pip/z18ey/|title=BBC - (none) - Potting On - Stones|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=27 February 2008|archive-date=8 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408131014/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/pottingon/pip/z18ey/|url-status=live}}</ref> She wrote and recorded six series of her Radio 4 programme ''Ayres on the Air'', the latest of which was broadcast in 2018.<ref name="Pam Ayres"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ymll|title=BBC Radio 4 - Ayres on the Air|website=BBC|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=23 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210623011026/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ymll|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 2002 Ayres has appeared a number of times on [[Channel 4]] in ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Dictionary Corner alongside [[Susie Dent]].

In 2009, she made her first appearance on the [[BBC TV]] programme, ''[[QI]]''.  In 2011 she said in a ''Daily Telegraph'' magazine interview that she was "about to go on my 14th tour of Australia".

Her autobiography, ''The Necessary Aptitude: A Memoir'', was published in 2011. It traces her life and career from growing as the youngest of six children in a council house in the Vale of White Horse, Berkshire, her time in the Women's Royal Air Force and the string of events that led to ''Opportunity Knocks''. The title refers to the number of times she was told in her life she "did not have the necessary aptitude".

In 2013 she published her latest book of poems, entitled ''You Made me Late Again!''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ayres|first=Pam|title=You Made me Late Again!|date=26 February 2015|publisher=[[Ebury]]|isbn=978-0091940478}}</ref>

In September 2021, her TV series ''The Cotswolds with Pam Ayres'' premiered on [[Channel 5 (British TV channel)]]. Each episode ends with Pam reciting a short, uplifting verse summing up her adventures.


===Influence===
The poet [[John Cooper Clarke]] has cited Ayres' early success on ''Opportunity Knocks'' as being highly influential on his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/06/john-cooper-clarke-poetry-bard-salford|title=John Cooper Clarke interview: 'Poetry is not something you have to retire from'|date=5 April 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=3 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203075725/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/06/john-cooper-clarke-poetry-bard-salford|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ayres is married to theatre producer Dudley Russell, and they have two sons, William and James. They live in the [[Cotswolds]] and keep rare breeds of cattle, as well as sheep, pigs, chickens, and guinea fowl.
