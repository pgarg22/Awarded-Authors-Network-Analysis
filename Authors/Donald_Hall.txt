He was the author of over 50 books across several genres from children's literature, biography, memoir, essays, and including 22 volumes of verse. Hall was a graduate of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-donald-hall-dead-20180624-story.html|title=Prolific, painfully candid ex-poet laureate Donald Hall dies|last=Italie|first=Hillel|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Early in his career, he became the first poetry editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' (1953–1961), the quarterly literary journal, and was noted for interviewing poets and other authors on their craft.

On June 14, 2006, Hall was appointed as the [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Library of Congress's 14th Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] (commonly known as "Poet Laureate of the United States").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-2001-present.html|title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 2001–present|year=2009|publisher=Library of Congress|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805022616/http://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-2001-present.html|archive-date=August 5, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=2009-01-01|df=mdy}}</ref> He is regarded as a "plainspoken, rural poet," and it has been said that, in his work, he "explores the longing for a more bucolic past and reflects [an] abiding reverence for nature."<ref name="PoetryFdnBio">Poetry Foundation (Chicago, Illinois).

Hall was respected for his work as an academic, having taught at [[Stanford University]], [[Bennington College]] and the [[University of Michigan]], and having made significant contributions to the study and craft of writing.

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Hall was born in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], the only child of Donald Andrew Hall, a businessman, and Lucy Wells.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2163/donald-hall-the-art-of-poetry-no-43-donald-hall|title=Donald Hall, The Art of Poetry No. 43|last=Stitt|first=Interviewed by Peter A.|date=1991|work=The Paris Review|access-date=2018-06-24|issue=120|volume=Fall 1991|language=en|issn=0031-2037}}</ref> He was educated at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], then earned an [[A.B.]] [[magna cum laude]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1951, where he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and a [[B.Litt.]], from [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1953. Hall received an honorary PhD, Lit. from [[Bates College]] in 1991.

Hall began writing even before reaching his teens,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/24/623033688/donald-hall-former-poet-laureate-dies-at-89|title=Donald Hall, Former Poet Laureate, Dies At 89|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}</ref> beginning with poems and short stories, and then moving on to novels and dramatic verse. Hall continued to write throughout his prep school years at Exeter, and, while still only sixteen years old, attended the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]], where he made his first acquaintance with the poet [[Robert Frost]]. That same year, he published his first work. While an undergraduate at Harvard, Hall served on the editorial board of ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and got to know a number of people who, like him, were poised with significant ambitions in the literary world, amongst them [[John Ashbery]], [[Robert Bly]], [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[Adrienne Rich]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/obituaries/donald-hall-a-poet-laureate-of-the-rural-life-is-dead-at-89.html|title=Donald Hall, a Poet Laureate of the Rural Life, Is Dead at 89|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}</ref> During his senior year, he won the [[Glascock Prize]] that Koch had won 3 years earlier.

After leaving Harvard, Hall went to Oxford for two years, to study for the B.Litt. He was editor of the magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', as literary editor of Isis, as editor of New Poems, and as poetry editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]''. At the end of his first Oxford year, Hall also won the university's [[Newdigate Prize]], awarded for his long poem, 'Exile'.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Learning|first=Gale, Cengage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcIPDQAAQBAJ&q=newdigate+Prize+Donald+Hall&pg=PT5|title=A Study Guide for Donald Hall's "Names of Horses"|year=2016|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4103-5358-0|language=en}}</ref> In September 1952, he married his first wife, Kirby Thompson, with whom he had his son and daughter.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://theamericanscholar.org/one-road|title=One Road|last=Hall|first=Donald|date=2013-03-01|magazine=The American Scholar|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}</ref>

On returning to the United States, Hall went to [[Stanford University]], where he spent one year as a Creative Writing Fellow, studying under the poet-critic, [[Yvor Winters]]. Following his year at Stanford, Hall went back to Harvard, where he spent three years in the Society of Fellows. During that time, he put together his first book, ''Exiles and Marriages''. In 1957, with Robert Pack and [[Louis Simpson]], he edited an anthology which was to make a significant impression on both sides of the Atlantic, ''[[New Poets of England and America]].'' It was later juxtaposed with [[Donald Allen]]'s ''[[The New American Poetry 1945–1960]]''. In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>

While teaching at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], he met the poet [[Jane Kenyon]], whom he married in 1972.<ref name=":0" /> Three years later, the couple moved to Eagle Pond Farm, his grandparents' former home in [[Wilmot, New Hampshire]]. Hall and Kenyon were profiled at their home in a 1993 PBS documentary, "A Life Together," which aired as an episode of ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]''. In 1989, when Hall was in his early sixties, it was discovered that he had colon cancer. Surgery followed, but by 1992 the cancer had metastasized to his liver. After another operation, and chemotherapy, he went into remission, though he was told that he only had a one-in-three chance of surviving the next five years. Then, early in 1994, it was discovered that Kenyon had leukemia. Her illness, her death fifteen months later, and Hall's struggle to come to terms with these things, were the subject of his 1998 book, ''Without''. Another book of poems dedicated to Kenyon, ''Painted Bed'', is cited by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as "more controlled, more varied and more powerful, this taut follow-up volume reexamines Hall's grief while exploring the life he has made since. The book's first poem, 'Kill the Day,' stands among the best Hall has ever written. It examines mourning in 16 long-lined stanzas, alternating catalogue with aphorism, understatement with keened lament: 'How many times will he die in his own lifetime?'"

Hall served as a member of the editorial board for poetry at the [[Wesleyan University Press]] from 1958 to 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waywiser-press.com/imprints/seven.html|title=Seven American Poets in Conversation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120124039/http://www.waywiser-press.com/imprints/seven.html|archive-date=November 20, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=2012-10-18|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was closely affiliated with the [[Bennington College|Bennington College's]] graduate writing program since 1994, giving lectures and readings annually.

===Career===
[[File:Donald Hall receiving his National Medal of Arts. (5492692544).jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] awarding Hall with the National Medal of Arts]]
Hall published fifteen books of poetry, most recently ''White Apples and the Taste of Stone'' (2006), ''The Painted Bed'' (2002) and ''Without: Poems'' (1998), which was published on the third anniversary of Kenyon's death. Most of the poems in ''Without'' deal with Kenyon's illness and death, and many are [[epistolary poem]]s. In addition to poetry, he also wrote several memoirs (among them ''Life Work'' and ''String Too Short to be Saved''), children's books (notably ''[[Ox-Cart Man]]'', which won the [[Caldecott Medal]]), and a number of plays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/donald-hall|title=Donald Hall|last=Hall|first=Donald|date=2000-06-22|website=Donald Hall|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}</ref> His recurring themes include [[New England]] rural living, baseball, and how work conveys meaning to ordinary life. He is regarded as a master both of received [[poetic form|forms]] and [[free verse]], and a champion of the art of revision, for whom writing is a craft, not merely a mode of self-expression. Hall won many awards, including two [[Guggenheim Fellowships]] and a [[Robert Frost]] Medal, and served as [[poet laureate]] of his state. He lived and worked at Eagle Pond Farm.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/books/review/Stevenson-t.html|title=Book Review {{!}} 'Unpacking the Boxes: A Memoir of a Life in Poetry,' by Donald Hall|last=Stevenson|first=Peter|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}</ref>

When not working on poems, he turned his hand to reviews, criticism, textbooks, sports journalism, memoirs, biographies, children's stories, and plays. He also devoted a lot of time to editing: between 1983 and 1996 he oversaw publication of more than sixty titles for the University of Michigan Press alone. He was for five years [[Poet Laureate]] of his home state, [[New Hampshire]] (1984–89), and among the many other honours and awards to have come his way were: the [[Lamont Poetry Prize]] for ''Exiles and Marriages'' (1955), the Edna St Vincent Millay Award (1956), two Guggenheim Fellowships (1963–64, 1972–73), inclusion on the Horn Book Honour List (1986), the Sarah Josepha Hale Award (1983), the [[Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize]] (1987), the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Poetry (1988), the NBCC Award (1989), the [[Los Angeles Times]] Book Prize in poetry (1989), and the [[Frost Medal]] (1990). He was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] on three separate occasions (1956, 1979 and 1993). In 1994, he received the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]] for his lifetime achievement.

Hall was named the fourteenth [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|U.S. Poet Laureate]], succeeding [[Ted Kooser]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Beverley | last=Wang | title=Donald Hall named nation's poet laureate | date=June 14, 2006 | publisher=Associated Press | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060614/ap_en_ot/poet_laureate }}</ref> He served from October 1, 2006, and was succeeded by [[Charles Simic]] the following year.<ref>{{cite news | first=Motoko| last=Rich| title=Charles Simic, Surrealist With Dark View, Is Named Poet Laureate | date=August 2, 2007 | newspaper=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/books/02poet.html?ex=1343880000&en=591f301dff2a8100&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink}}</ref> At the time of his appointment, Hall was profiled in episode of ''[[The News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' which aired on October 16, 2006.
