Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his [[nature writing|writings on natural history]] and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of [[ecology]] and [[environmental history]], two sources of modern-day [[environmentalism]]. His [[literary language|literary]] style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, [[symbol]]ic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical [[Asceticism|austerity]], and attention to practical detail.<ref name="ReferenceA">Thoreau, Henry David.

<blockquote>His face, once seen, could not be forgotten.

Upon graduation Thoreau returned home to Concord, where he met [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] through a mutual friend.<ref name=McElroy/> Emerson, who was 14 years his senior, took a paternal and at times patron-like interest in Thoreau, advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers, including [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Bronson Alcott]], and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and his son [[Julian Hawthorne]], who was a boy at the time.

Emerson urged Thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical, ''[[The Dial]]'', and lobbied the editor, Margaret Fuller, to publish those writings. Thoreau's first essay published in ''The Dial'' was "Aulus Persius Flaccus",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|title=Aulus Persius Flaccus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925021512/http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|archive-date=September 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> an essay on the Roman poet and satirist, in July 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |title=''The Dial'' |publisher=Walden.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018151944/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |archive-date=October 18, 2015  }}</ref> It consisted of revised passages from his journal, which he had begun keeping at Emerson's suggestion. The first journal entry, on October 22, 1837, reads, "'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my first entry to-day."<ref>Thoreau, Henry David (2007). ''I to Myself: An Annotated Selection from the Journal of Henry D. Thoreau''. Jeffrey S. Cramer, ed. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 1.</ref>

Thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition. In his early years he followed [[Transcendentalism]], a loose and eclectic [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the "radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts", as Emerson wrote in ''Nature'' (1836).

Thoreau returned to Concord and worked in his family's [[pencil]] factory, which he would continue to do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior [[graphite]] by using clay as the binder.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pencilhistoryofd00petr|url-access=registration|title=The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance|last=Petroski|first=Henry|publisher=Knopf|year=1992|isbn=9780679734154|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pencilhistoryofd00petr/page/104 104]–125}}</ref> This invention allowed profitable use of a graphite source found in [[New Hampshire]] that had been purchased in 1821 by Thoreau's uncle, Charles Dunbar. The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] in 1795. The company's other source of graphite had been [[Tantiusques]], a mine operated by Native Americans in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the [[electrotyping]] process.<ref>Conrad, Randall. (Fall 2005).

On July 24 or July 25, 1846, Thoreau ran into the local [[tax collector]], Sam Staples, who asked him to pay six years of delinquent [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]. Thoreau refused because of his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal. The next day Thoreau was freed when someone, likely to have been his aunt, paid the tax, against his wishes.<ref name=":2">Rosenwald, Lawrence.

In January and February 1848, he delivered lectures on "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government",<ref>Thoreau, H. D., letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, February 23, 1848.</ref> explaining his tax resistance at the [[Concord Lyceum]]. Bronson Alcott attended the lecture, writing in his journal on January 26:

Thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Resistance to Civil Government]]" (also known as "Civil Disobedience"). It was published by [[Elizabeth Peabody]] in the ''Aesthetic Papers'' in May 1849. Thoreau had taken up a version of [[Percy Shelley]]'s principle in the political poem "[[The Mask of Anarchy]]" (1819), which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |title=Morrissociety.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |archive-date=January 5, 2011  }}</ref>

At Walden Pond, Thoreau completed a first draft of ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'', an [[elegy]] to his brother John, describing their trip to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in 1839. Thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed 1,000 copies at his own expense; fewer than 300 were sold.<ref name="Cheever" />{{Rp|234}} He self-published the book on the advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.

In August 1846, Thoreau briefly left Walden to make a trip to [[Mount Katahdin]] in [[Maine]], a journey later recorded in "Ktaadn", the first part of ''The Maine Woods''.

Thoreau left Walden Pond on September 6, 1847.<ref name="Cheever" />{{Rp|244}} At Emerson's request, he immediately moved back to the Emerson house to help Emerson's wife, Lidian, manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |title=Thoreausociety.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129085846/http://thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |archive-date=November 29, 2010  }}</ref> Over several years, as he worked to pay off his debts, he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as ''[[Walden|Walden, or Life in the Woods]]'' in 1854, recounting the two years, two months, and two days he had spent at Walden Pond. The book compresses that time into a single calendar year, using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development. Part [[memoir]] and part spiritual quest, ''Walden'' at first won few admirers, but later critics have regarded it as a classic American work that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions.

The American poet [[Robert Frost]] wrote of Thoreau, "In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America."<ref>Frost, Robert (1968). Letter to Wade Van Dore, June 24, 1922, in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Walden''. Richard Ruland, ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall. p. 8. {{LCCN|6814480}}.</ref>

The American author [[John Updike]] said of the book, "A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible."<ref>Updike, John (2004).

Thoreau moved out of Emerson's house in July 1848 and stayed at a house on nearby Belknap Street. In 1850, he moved into a house at [[Thoreau-Alcott House|255 Main Street]], where he lived until his death.<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene; Carruth, Gorton (1982).

===Later years, 1851–1862===
[[File:VII. Rowse.jpg|thumb|Thoreau in 1854]]
In 1851, Thoreau became increasingly fascinated with [[natural history]] and narratives of travel and expedition. He read avidly on [[botany]] and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal. He admired [[William Bartram]] and [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]]''. He kept detailed observations on Concord's nature lore, recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of Walden Pond and the days certain birds migrated. The point of this task was to "anticipate" the seasons of nature, in his word.<ref>[http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/Thoreau/writings/correspondence/LettersBlake.pdf#page34 Letters to H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O.

He became a [[Surveying|land surveyor]] and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town, covering an area of {{convert|26|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|sp=us}}, in his journal, a two-million-word document he kept for 24 years. He also kept a series of notebooks, and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history, such as "Autumnal Tints", "The Succession of Trees", and "Wild Apples", an essay lamenting the destruction of the local wild apple species.

With the rise of [[environmental history]] and [[ecocriticism]] as academic disciplines, several new readings of Thoreau began to emerge, showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thorson|first1=Robert M.|title=Walden's Shore: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth-Century Science|date=December 6, 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674724785}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Primack|first1=Richard B.|title=Tracking Climate Change with the Help of Henry David Thoreau|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/tracking-climate-change-with-the-help-of-henry-david-thoreau|access-date=September 23, 2015|date=June 13, 2013|archive-date=September 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923155958/http://www.elsevier.com/connect/tracking-climate-change-with-the-help-of-henry-david-thoreau|url-status=live}}</ref> For instance, "The Succession of Forest Trees", shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction, through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals. In this lecture, first presented to a cattle show in Concord, and considered his greatest contribution to ecology, Thoreau explained why one species of tree can grow in a place where a  different tree did previously. He observed that squirrels often carry nuts far from the tree from which they fell to create stashes. These seeds are likely to germinate and grow should the squirrel die or abandon the stash. He credited the squirrel for performing a "great service ... in the economy of the universe."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Worster|first1=Donald|title=Nature's Economy|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge University|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-521-45273-2|pages=69–71}}</ref>

He traveled to [[Canada East]] once, [[Cape Cod]] four times, and Maine three times; these landscapes inspired his "excursion" books, ''[[A Yankee in Canada]]'', ''Cape Cod'', and ''The Maine Woods'', in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography, history and philosophy. Other travels took him southwest to [[Philadelphia]] and New York City in 1854 and west across the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] in 1861, when he visited [[Niagara Falls]], Detroit, Chicago, [[Milwaukee]], [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and [[Mackinac Island]].<ref>Thoreau, Henry David (1970).

He read [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[James Cook]]; the [[arctic explorer]]s [[John Franklin]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] and [[William Parry (explorer)|William Parry]]; [[David Livingstone]] and [[Richard Francis Burton]] on Africa; [[Lewis and Clark]]; and hundreds of lesser-known works by explorers and literate travelers.<ref>Christie, John Aldrich (1965). ''Thoreau as World Traveler''. New York: Columbia University Press.</ref> Astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples, cultures, religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals. He processed everything he read, in the local laboratory of his Concord experience. Among his famous aphorisms is his advice to "live at home like a traveler".<ref>[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Correspondence Letters of H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O.

After [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]], many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from Brown or [[Damn with faint praise|damned him with faint praise]]. Thoreau was disgusted by this, and he composed a key speech, ''[[A Plea for Captain John Brown]]'', which was uncompromising in its defense of Brown and his actions. Thoreau's speech proved persuasive: the abolitionist movement began to accept Brown as a martyr, and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] entire armies of the North were [[John Brown's Body|literally singing Brown's praises]]. As a biographer of Brown put it, "If, as Alfred Kazin suggests, without John Brown there would have been no Civil War, we would add that without the Concord Transcendentalists, John Brown would have had little cultural impact."<ref>Reynolds, David S. (2005). ''John Brown, Abolitionist''. Knopf. p. 4.</ref>

===Death===
Thoreau contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with [[bronchitis]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richardson, Jr.|first=Robert D.|title=Faith in a Seed: The First Publication of Thoreau's Last Manuscript|publisher=Island Press|year=1993|editor-last=Dean|editor-first=Bradley P.|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=17|chapter=Introduction}}</ref><ref>[https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau,_the_Man About Thoreau: Thoreau, the Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620045648/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau%2C_the_Man |date=June 20, 2016 }}.</ref><ref>[http://thoreau.eserver.org/wfchron.html Thoreau Chronology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620133904/http://thoreau.eserver.org/wfchron.html |date=June 20, 2017 }}.</ref> His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly ''The Maine Woods'' and [[Excursions (anthology)|''Excursions'']], and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of ''A Week'' and ''Walden''. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death.

Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and [[canoeing]], of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], after a ride with him, noted that "Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it."<ref>Nathaniel Hawthorne, Passages From the American Note-Books, entry for September 2, 1842.</ref>

He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet<ref>Brooks, Van Wyck. ''The Flowering of New England''. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952. p. 310</ref> and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in ''Walden'', "The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth."<ref name="Cheever241">Cheever, Susan (2006).

[[File:Thoreaus quote near his cabin site, Walden Pond.jpg|thumb|Thoreau's famous quotation, near his cabin site at Walden Pond]]
Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred "partially cultivated country". His idea of being "far in the recesses of the wilderness" of Maine was to "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [[Roderick Nash]] wrote, "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance."<ref>Nash, Roderick. ''Wilderness and the American Mind: Henry David Thoreau: Philosopher''.</ref>

Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, "I would fain keep sober always. ... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor. ... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?"<ref name="Cheever241" />

===Sexuality===
Thoreau [[bachelor|never married]] and was childless. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan.

Thoreau was fervently against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and actively supported the abolitionist movement.<ref name=":6"/> He participated as a conductor in the [[Underground Railroad]], delivered lectures that attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his party.<ref name=":6">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Furtak|first=Rick|title=Henry David Thoreau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=July 27, 2013|archive-date=August 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813055226/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/|url-status=live}}</ref> Two weeks after the ill-fated [[raid on Harpers Ferry]] and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to [[Pontius Pilate]] and likened Brown's execution to the [[crucifixion of Jesus Christ]]:

{{quote|Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.<ref name="ReferenceA" />}}

In ''[[The Last Days of John Brown]]'', Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.<ref name=":1">[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Last Days of John Brown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection</ref> In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as "crazy".<ref name=":1"/>

Thoreau was a proponent of [[limited government]] and [[individualism]]. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which "governs not at all", he distanced himself from contemporary "no-government men" ([[anarchists]]), writing: "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government."<ref name="resistance" />

Thoreau deemed the evolution from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[limited monarchy]] to [[democracy]] as "a progress toward true respect for the individual" and theorized about further improvements "towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man".<ref name="resistance" /> Echoing this belief, he went on to write: "There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly."<ref name="resistance" />

It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against the British administration and [[Catholicism]] in ''A Yankee in Canada''. Despotic authority, Thoreau argued, had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian ''habitants'' had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|title=A Yankee in Canada|url=https://archive.org/details/yankeeincanada0000thor|url-access=registration|date=1961|publisher=Harvest House|location=Montreal|pages=[https://archive.org/details/yankeeincanada0000thor/page/105 105–107]}}</ref>

Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of [[tax resistance]] displayed in ''Resistance to Civil Government''), he regarded [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[nonresistance]] as temptation to passivity,<ref name=":4">[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection</ref> writing: "Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp."<ref name=":4"/> Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject "Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?", arguing the affirmative.<ref>[http://thoreau.eserver.org/mjf/MJF1.html Transcendental Ethos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919100132/http://thoreau.eserver.org/MJF/MJF1.html |date=September 19, 2013 }} from The Thoreau Reader</ref>

Likewise, his condemnation of the [[Mexican–American War]] did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico "unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army" as a means to expand the slave territory.<ref name=":5" />

Thoreau was [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] towards [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]]. On one hand he regarded commerce as "unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied"<ref name="ReferenceA" /> and expressed admiration for its associated [[cosmopolitanism]], writing:

{{quote|I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer.<ref name="ReferenceA" />}}

On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:

{{quote|I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that the corporations may be enriched.<ref name="ReferenceA" />}}

Thoreau also favored [[bioregionalism]], the protection of animals and wild areas, [[free trade]], and taxation for schools and highways.<ref name=":6"/> He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, [[technological utopianism]], [[consumerism]], [[philistinism]], mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.<ref name=":6"/>

===Intellectual interests, influences, and affinities===
====Indian sacred texts and philosophy====
Thoreau was influenced by [[Hindu texts|Indian spiritual thought]]. In ''Walden'', there are many overt references to the sacred texts of India. For example, in the first chapter ("Economy"), he writes: "How much more admirable the [[Bhagvat-geeta|Bhagvat-Geeta]] than all the ruins of the East!"<ref name="ReferenceA" /> ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world",<ref>{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |date = 2007 |isbn = 978-0415939263 |page = 310 }}</ref> also a characteristic of Hinduism.

Furthermore, in "The Pond in Winter", he equates Walden Pond with the sacred [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges river]], writing:
{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.<ref name="ReferenceA" />}}

Thoreau was aware his Ganges imagery could have been factual. He wrote about ice harvesting at Walden Pond. And he knew that New England's [[Ice trade|ice merchants]] were shipping ice to foreign ports, including [[Calcutta]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dickason|first=David G.|date=1991|title=The Nineteenth-Century Indo-American Ice Trade: An Hyperborean Epic|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/312669|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=25|issue=1|pages=53–89|doi=10.1017/S0026749X00015845|jstor=312669|issn=0026-749X|via=JSTOR|access-date=April 18, 2021|archive-date=April 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418213408/https://www.jstor.org/stable/312669|url-status=live}}</ref>

Additionally, Thoreau followed various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] customs, including a diet largely consisting of rice ("It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India."<ref name="ReferenceA" />), [[flute playing]] (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of [[Krishna]]),<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|last2=|last3=|first3=|date=July 12, 2020|title=Simplicity Day 2020: How Bhagavad Gita inspired American philosopher Henry David Thoreau|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/simplicity-day-2020-how-bhagwat-geeta-inspired-american-philosopher-henry-david-thoreau/articleshow/76918441.cms|url-status=live|access-date=April 18, 2021|website=Times of India|language=en|archive-date=April 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418213408/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/simplicity-day-2020-how-bhagwat-geeta-inspired-american-philosopher-henry-david-thoreau/articleshow/76918441.cms}}</ref> and [[yoga]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Richard H.|date=January 2018|title=Henry David Thoreau, Yogi|url=https://doi.org/10.1215/0961754X-4253822|journal=Common Knowledge|volume=24|issue=1|pages=56–89|doi=10.1215/0961754X-4253822|issn=0961-754X|via=Duke University Press}}</ref>

In an 1849 letter to his friend H.G.O. Blake, he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him:

{{quote|Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who practice yoga gather in Brahma the certain fruits of their works. Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.<ref>Miller, Barbara S. "Why Did Henry David Thoreau Take the Bhagavad-Gita to Walden Pond?" ''Parabola'' 12.1 (Spring 1986): 58–63.</ref>}}

====Biology====
[[File:Eggs BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|Bird eggs found by Thoreau and given to the [[Boston Society of Natural History]]. Those in the nest are of [[yellow warbler]], the other two of [[red-tailed hawk]].]]
Thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology, including the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Asa Gray]] (Charles Darwin's staunchest American ally).<ref name=":0" /> Thoreau was deeply influenced by Humboldt, especially his work [[Cosmos (Humboldt book)|''Cosmos'']].<ref>Wulf, Andrea. ''The Invention of Nature: Alexander Humboldt's New World''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2015, p. 250.</ref>

In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including [[Louis Agassiz]] who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] and endorsed it,<ref>Cain, William E. ''A Historical Guide to Henry David Thoreau''. {{ISBN|0195138635}}, p. 146.</ref> stating:

{{quote|1=The development theory implies a greater vital force in Nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation.

{{quote|text=Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced ...

Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as "his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical", viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including ''Civil Disobedience''. The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) published in his lifetime, ''Walden'' and ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers'' (1849), both dealt with nature, in which he "loved to wander".<ref name=McElroy/> His obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an 1862 yearbook.<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|date=1863|publisher=D.

Political leaders and reformers like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Russian (citizen)|Russian]] author [[Leo Tolstoy]] all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly ''Civil Disobedience'', as did "[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] theorist [[Frank Chodorov]] [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, ''Analysis'', to an appreciation of Thoreau".<ref name=Rothbard>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

Garden City, 1938. 238–39</ref>

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading "On Civil Disobedience" in 1944 while attending [[Morehouse College]]. He wrote in his autobiography that it was,

<blockquote>Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.<ref>King, M.L.

Players can build the protagonist's cabin, explore the environment, record flora and fauna, farm the land, visit Emerson's house and the town of Concord. At the end of each day players are invited to reflect on their journal which gradually fills up with reflections based on the player's journey and day-to-day experiences.  The game also includes letters between Thoreau and his contemporaries, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Ralph Waldo Emerson. It also includes letters between his contemporaries to build a picture of Thoreau's reception as a writer and his connections in the literary and Transcendentalist scene in America at the time. The game was released for PlayStation 4 in 2018.

==Criticism==
Although his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded. Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of "unmanly" [[effeminacy]] and "womanish solitude", while deeming him a self-indulgent "skulker".<ref>Stevenson, Robert Louis. [http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html "Henry David Thoreau: His Character and Opinions"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012063926/http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html |date=October 12, 2006 }}. Cornhill Magazine. June 1880.</ref>

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that "He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness."<ref>Nathaniel Hawthorne, ''Passages From the American Note-Books'', entry for September 2, 1842.</ref> On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau "repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men".<ref>Hawthorne, ''The Heart of Hawthorne's Journals'', p. 106.</ref><ref>Borst, Raymond R. ''The Thoreau Log: A Documentary Life of Henry David Thoreau, 1817–1862.'' New York: G.K. Hall, 1992.</ref>

In a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the "wicked" and "heathenish" message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to "lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs".<ref>Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 112.</ref>

In response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:
{{quote|text=People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.<ref>''[[The New England Quarterly]]'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec., 1933), pp. 733–46</ref>}}

Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work ''Walden'' by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:

{{quote|text=I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. ... Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; ... I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.<ref>Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)</ref>}}

Recent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy, and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in ''Walden'',<ref name=neworker1>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |title=Henry David Thoreau, Hypocrite |last1=Schultz |first1=Kathryn |date=October 19, 2015 |work=The New Yorker |access-date=October 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019170355/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |archive-date=October 19, 2015 }}</ref> although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.<ref name=medium1>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@TheNewThoreau/why-do-we-love-thoreau-because-he-was-right-175251814c |title=Why do we love Thoreau?

== In popular culture ==
Comedian [[John Mulaney]] portrayed a fictionalised version of Henry Thoreau in the 2019 [[Apple TV+]] original series [[Dickinson (TV series)|''Dickinson'']].

Sam, the boy protagonist in the novel ''[[My Side of the Mountain]]'' by [[Jean Craighead George]] is nicknamed "Thoreau" by a passing vagabond minstrel, due to Sam's determination to experience living within the natural environment of the [[Catskill Mountains]].
