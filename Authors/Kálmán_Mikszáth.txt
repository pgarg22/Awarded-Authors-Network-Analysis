'''Kálmán Mikszáth de Kiscsoltó''' (16 January 1847 – 28 May 1910) was a widely reputed [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] novelist, journalist, and politician. His work remains in print in Hungarian and still appears from time to time in other languages.

==Biography==
Mikszáth was born in [[Sklabiná|Szklabonya]] (also known as Sklabiná or Szlabonya),<ref group="note">In parentheses are official names valid and used in 1808–1863</ref> [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Sklabiná]], [[Slovakia]]) into a family of the [[Nobility and royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|lesser nobility]]. He studied law at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] from 1866 to 1869, although he did not apply for any exam, and became involved in journalism, writing for many Hungarian newspapers including the ''{{ill|Pesti Hírlap|hu}}''.

Mikszáth's early short stories were based on the lives of peasants and artisans and had little appeal at the time. However, they demonstrated his skill in crafting humorous anecdotes, which would be developed in his later, more popular works. Many of his novels contained social commentary and [[satire]], and towards the end of his life they became increasingly critical of the aristocracy and the burden he believed the latter placed on Hungarian society.

Mikszáth was a member of the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]], and in 1887 was elected to the [[Diet of Hungary]] (one of the two top legislatures in [[Austria-Hungary]]). Until 1879 he was the representative for the [[Ilieni|Illyefalva]] District in [[Transylvania]], and from 1892 until his death he represented the [[Făgăraş|Fogaras]] District. During his time in the Diet, he lived at Dohnányi utca 28 in central [[Budapest]].

In 1910, the village he was born was renamed Mikszáthfalva during his 40th annual writer's jubilee.

Kálmán Mikszáth was buried in [[Kerepesi Cemetery]] in [[Budapest]], alongside his sons János (1886–1890) and Albert (1889–1921).

==Reception==
U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] enjoyed his novel ''[[St. Peter's Umbrella (novel)|St. Peter's Umbrella]]'' so much that he visited Mikszáth solely to express his admiration, during a European trip in 1910.<ref>

Mikszáth's work remains popular in Hungary and has been translated sporadically into other languages. The translation of ''St. Peter's Umbrella'' reappeared in 2012, 2018 and 2019. ''The Siege of Beszterce'' was republished in English in 2014 and ''The Town in Black'' (''A fekete város'', 1911) appeared in 2011.<ref>Translated by Bernard Adams. Budapest, Corvina, 2011.</ref>
