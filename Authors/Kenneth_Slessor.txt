'''Kenneth Adolphe Slessor''' {{Post-nominals|country=AUS|OBE}} (27 March 1901{{spaced ndash}}30 June 1971)<ref name=bio>{{cite web |title= MS 3020 Papers of Kenneth Adolf Slessor (1901–1971)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|url= http://www.nla.gov.au/ms/findaids/ms3020/bioghist.html|access-date=29 August 2008}}</ref> was an Australian [[poet]], [[journalist]] and official war correspondent in [[World War II]]. He was one of Australia's leading poets, notable particularly for the absorption of modernist influences into Australian poetry.<ref name=ADB>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Haskell|first=Dennis|authorlink=Dennis Haskell|year=2002|id=A160310b|title=Slessor, Kenneth Adolf (1901–1971)}}</ref> The [[Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry]] is named after him.

==Early life==
Slessor was born Kenneth Adolphe Schloesser<ref name=ADB/><ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/incandescent-indyk-turns-down-the-heat/story-e6frg8n6-1226012001145 "Incandescent Ivor Indyk turns down the heat"] by Miriam Cosic, ''[[The Australian]]'' (26 February 2011)</ref> in [[Orange, New South Wales]].<ref name=bio /> As a boy, he lived in England for a time with his parents<ref>{{harvnb|Haft|2011}} cites (1908–1910: Slessor 1970, 253{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2020}})</ref> and in Australia visited the mines of rural New South Wales with his father, a Jewish mining engineer whose father and grandfather had been distinguished musicians in Germany.{{sfn|Dutton|1991|pp=1–2}}

His family moved to Sydney in 1903. Slessor attended [[Mowbray House School]] (1910–1914) and the [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] (1915–1918),<ref name=bio /> where he began to write poetry. His first published poem, "Goin'", about a wounded [[Digger (soldier)|digger]] in Europe, remembering Sydney and its icons, appeared in ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' in 1917.<ref>''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', vol. 38, 19 July 1917, p. 14</ref> Slessor passed the 1918 NSW Leaving Certificate with first-class honours in English and joined the ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|Sydney Sun]]'' as a journalist. In 1919, seven of his poems were published. He married for the first time in 1922.<ref name=ADB />

==Career==
Slessor made his living as a newspaper journalist, mostly for ''The Sun'', and was a war correspondent during [[World War II]] (1939–1945).<ref name=bio /> In that capacity, he reported not only from Australia but from Greece, Syria, Libya, Egypt, and New Guinea.<ref name=Haft /><ref>{{harvnb|Haft|2011}} article cites (1940–1944: Slessor 1970, 67;{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2020}} {{harvnb|Dutton|1991|p=120}})</ref>

Slessor also wrote on [[rugby league]] football for the popular publication ''[[Smith's Weekly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Headon |first=David |title=Up From the Ashes: The Phoenix of a Rugby League Literature |work=Football Studies Volume 2, Issue 2 |publisher=Football Studies Group |date=October 1999 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202i.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810033028/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202i.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-08-10 |access-date=7 July 2009 }}</ref>

The bulk of Slessor's poetic work was produced before the end of World War II. His poem "[[Five Bells]]"—relating to [[Sydney Harbour]], time, the past, memory, and the death of the artist, friend and colleague of Slessor at ''[[Smith's Weekly]]'', Joe Lynch—remains probably his best known poem, followed by "Beach Burial", a tribute to Australian troops who fought in World War II.

In 1965, Australian writer [[Hal Porter]] wrote of having met and stayed with Slessor in the 1930s. He described Slessor as:
<blockquote>...a city lover, fastidious and excessively courteous, in those qualities resembles [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], as he does in being incapable of sentimentalizing over vegetation, in finding in nature something cruel, something bordering on effrontery. He prefers chiselled stone to the disorganization of grass.{{sfn|Porter|1965|p=40}}</blockquote>

[[Ronald McCuaig]] was the first to produce an in-depth review of Kenneth Slessor (in ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' in August 1939 and republished in "Tales out of bed" (1944)).<ref name="nla4">{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/745192?lookfor=author:%22McCuaig,%20Ronald,%201908-1993%22&offset=2&max=21 |title=Tales out of bed / by Ronald McCuaig &#124; National Library of Australia|publisher=catalogue.nla.gov.au|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref> The review was favourable, ranking Slessor above [[Christopher Brennan|C.J. Brennan]] and [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]]. It was written a year before "[[Five Bells]]", which marked Slessor's move to modernism, a move inspired, according to Rundle and others, by McCuaig. The review therefore covers the pre-modernist parts of Slessor's poetry.<ref name="rundle">Rundle, Guy "The Culturestate", ''[[Meanjin]]'', 69, 2, Winter 2010, pp. 56–63</ref>

According to poet [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]], Kenneth Slessor's poem "[[Five Visions of Captain Cook]]" is equally as important as "Five Bells" and was the 'most dramatic break-through' in Australian poetry of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Jaffa|1977|p=20}}

In 1944 he published his definitive volume of poetry, ''One Hundred Poems'', and from that point on Slessor published only three short poems.  Instead of writing poetry, after 1944, and for the rest of his life, Slessor chose to concentrate on journalism and supporting literary projects whose aim was to help develop Australian poetry.{{sfn|Jaffa|1977|p=22}}

Slessor was a member of The Journalists' Club Sydney and served as its Vice-President 1940–1957, then as its President 1957–1965. A portrait of Slessor was painted by fellow Journalists' Club member [[William Pidgeon]], who painted the portraits of practically every club president up to 1976.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Angel|first=Don|title=The Journalists' Club, Sydney : founded 1939 : a fond history|publisher=Journalists' Club|year=1985|isbn=0-9596107-2-3|location=Sydney|pages=80, 176, 179|oclc=15551597}}</ref>

==Awards==
In the [[1959 New Year Honours]], Slessor was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for services to literature.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1109685&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour]</ref>

==Personal life==
Slessor counted [[Norman Lindsay]], [[Hugh McCrae]] and [[Jack Lindsay]] among his friends.

At the age of 21, Slessor married 28-year-old Noëla Beatrice Myer Ewart Glasson (born 1894) in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield, Sydney]], on 18 August 1922. Noëla was the daughter of Australian soprano and music composer Annie May Colette Summerbelle (1867–1949) and Herbert Edward Glasson (1867–1893), who was later convicted of murder. Noëla died of cancer on 22 October 1945.<ref name=ADB /><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229015930 "Death Of Journalist's Wife"], ''The Sun'' (Sydney, NSW : 1910–1954), 23 October 1945, p. 7, viewed 05 Aug 2018</ref>

He married Pauline Wallace in 1951; and a year later celebrated the birth of his only child, Paul Slessor,<ref name=Haft>{{harvnb|Stewart|1977|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Slessor|Haskell|Dutton|1994}}; Haskell 2002, 16:261;{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2020|comment=It's incomplete in Haft.}} via {{harvnb|Haft|2011}}</ref> before the marriage dissolved in 1961.

He died alone and suddenly of a heart attack on 30 June 1971<ref name=Haft /> at the [[Mater Hospital, North Sydney|Mater Misericordiae Hospital]], North Sydney.
