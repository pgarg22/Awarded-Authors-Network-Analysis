==Life==

He was born in [[Bournemouth]], named William Edward Roberts. He was the eldest child of Edward George Roberts (b. 7 January 1878, d. 14 March 1954) and Henrietta Mary Sellers (b. 23 March 1880, d. 28 June 1918 following the birth of a son nine days earlier).<ref>Information provided by Gerald Roberts, nephew of Michael Roberts, 6 March 2014</ref> They had a farm in the New Forest. He was educated at [[Bournemouth School]]. From 1920 to 1922 he studied at [[King's College London]], taking a BSc in Chemistry. From 1922 to 1925 he read [[mathematics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]; it was during this period of his life he acquired the name Michael (after [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]). In 1925 or 1926 he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] but was expelled within a year.<ref>T.W. Eason, 'Biographical Sketch', in T.W. Eason and R. Hamilton (eds.), ''A Portrait of Michael Roberts'', College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea, London, 1949, pp. 1–4.</ref>

From 1925 to 1931 he taught at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]]. Afterwards, he moved to London, teaching at [[Mercers' School]] from 1931 to 1934. He then returned to the RGS, where he worked until 1941, teaching English, mathematics, physics and chemistry. Having published his first poetry collection in 1930, he began to edit [[anthology|anthologies]], of which ''New Country'' (1933) was celebrated for the group of poets (including [[W. H. Auden]]) that it featured. In 1934, he participated in a high-profile series of radio broadcasts, ''Whither Britain?'', together with major figures such as [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Ernest Bevin]].

The next year, he married [[Janet Adam Smith]], critic, anthologist, and fellow mountaineer; they lived in Fern Avenue, [[Jesmond]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

The ''[[Faber Book of Modern Verse]]'' (1936), which he edited, is the single piece of work for which Roberts is now best remembered.<ref>Michael Roberts, ''The Faber Book of Modern Verse'', 4th revised edition, Faber and Faber, London, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-571-18017-2}}.</ref> He followed it with poetry and prose writing, and a study of [[T.

Tauris, London, 2013, pp. 73–85.</ref> From 1945 to 1948 he was Principal of the [[College of St Mark and St John]] in [[Chelsea, London]], where one of his colleagues was the biologist [[Cyril Bibby]]. He died of [[leukaemia]] in 1948.

Michael and Janet Roberts had built up a large collection of books on mountaineering, which (along with the collection of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044531/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~climbing/amb_site/INFO/locations/library.shtml Oxford University Mountaineering Club]) provided a basis for establishment in December 1992 of the
