'''Thomas Charles Louis Holt''' (born 13 September 1961) is a British novelist. In addition to fiction published under his own name, he writes [[fantasy]] under the pseudonym '''K. J. Parker.'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pornokitsch.com/2015/04/interview-hello-my-name-is-k-j-parker.html|title=Interview: "Hello, My Name is K.J. Parker"|publisher=[[Pornokitsch]]|website=pornokitsch.com|author=Jared Shurin|date=21 April 2015}}</ref>

Holt was born in London, the son of novelist [[Hazel Holt]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/hazel-holt/4d414e00-3565-4522-136f-08d5dd18a1c7|title=Hazel Holt|website=Pan Macmillan|access-date=9 August 2020}}</ref> and was educated at [[Westminster School]], [[Wadham College, Oxford]],<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview17 "Review: The Portable Door", ''The Guardian'', 29 March 2003]. Accessed 3 December 2015</ref> and [[University of Law|The College of Law]], London.

His works include [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] novels which parody or take as their theme various aspects of mythology, history or literature and develop them in new and often humorous ways. He has also written a number of [[historical fiction|historical novels]] writing as Thomas Holt. [[Steve Nallon]] collaborated with Holt to write ''I,&nbsp;Margaret'', a satirical autobiography of [[Margaret Thatcher]] published in 1989.

==K. J. Parker==
K. J. Parker is the pseudonym under which Holt has published [[fantasy]] fiction. Parker's identity as Holt was kept secret for 17 years, until April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pornokitsch.com/2015/04/interview-hello-my-name-is-k-j-parker.html|title=Interview: "Hello, My Name is K.J. Parker"|publisher=pornokitsch.com|author=Jared Shurin|date=21 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitbooks.net/2015/04/21/the-two-of-swords-launches-and-the-real-k-j-parker-stands-up/|title=''The Two of Swords'' launches (and the real K. J. Parker stands up!)|publisher=orbitbooks.net|date=21 April 2015}}</ref>

While Parker's stories take place in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|secondary worlds]] with fictional geographies and [[world history]], some of the typical features of fantasy fiction such as explicit use of magic are not present in his novels. His short stories, on the other hand, frequently deal with magic and the problems it brings for sorcerers. The stories tend to have [[Tragedy|tragic]] themes with characters whose actions are unintentionally, ultimately self-destructive. Other major themes in the books are politics, technology (especially [[disruptive innovation]]), and either or both of the former as a means to power.
