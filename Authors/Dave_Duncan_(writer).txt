<blockquote><poem>The voice I hear this passing night was heard
In ancient days by '''emperor and clown''':
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home,
She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
The same that oft-times hath
Charm'd '''magic casement'''s, opening on the foam
Of '''perilous seas''', in '''faery lands forlorn'''.</poem></blockquote>
