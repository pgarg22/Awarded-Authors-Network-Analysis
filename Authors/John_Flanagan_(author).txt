'''John Anthony Flanagan''' is an Australian fantasy author best known for his medieval fantasy series, the ''[[Ranger's Apprentice]]'' series, and its sister series, the ''[[Brotherband|Brotherband Chronicles]].'' Some of his other works include his ''Storm Peak'' duology, as well as the adult novel ''The Grey Raider.''

== Early life and careers ==
John Flanagan was born in Sydney, Australia on 22 May 1944.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famousauthors.org/john-flanagan|title=John Flanagan {{!}} Biography, Books and Facts|website=www.famousauthors.org|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> He graduated from [[Waverley College]] with plans to become a writer. As he grew up, he changed careers and got a job at an advertising agency. He originally planned to become a trainee copywriter, but the agency instead assigned him to train as a media researcher. While working as a media researcher trainee, he wrote an offensive poem directed toward one of his senior executives. Eventually the poem made it to the desk of one of the company's directors. Flanagan was called into the director's office where he complimented Flanagan's writing skills and offered him the job of trainee copywriter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/?authtype=cookie,ip,uid|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> After working in the advertisement agency for 20 years, Flanagan entered the TV industry and co-wrote a sitcom called [[Hey Dad..!]].<ref name=":0" />

== Becoming a writer ==
Flanagan's early novels originated mainly as thrillers.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/7199-q-a-with-john-flanagan.html|title=Q&A with John Flanagan|website=PublishersWeekly.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> He started working on what would become the ''[[Ranger's Apprentice]]'' series in the 1990s. The series originated as twenty short stories for his twelve-year-old son, Michael.  Flanagan wanted to encourage his son to read and hoped that he could do so by convincing Michael that the stories were children's book ideas that his father wanted to test out.<ref name=":1" /> Also, since Michael was on the smaller side, Flanagan wanted to encourage him by showing that not all heroes must be big and strong.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 2005|title=John Flanagan an interview with John Cohen|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f5h&AN=16192463&site=ehost-live|journal=Reading Time|volume=49|issue=1|pages=4}}</ref> In fact, several characters in Flanagan's books are based on real-life people close to him.  Will, the main character in the series, was initially based on Michael.  Small, agile, and his love of climbing were all things that Michael and Will shared.  Evanlyn, one of the other main characters, was loosely based on Flanagan's daughter Kitty.  Finally, Halt, Will's older teacher, was also based on Flanagan's sixth grade teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofjohnflanagan.com/.html|title=Media|last=Flanagan|first=John|website=The World of John Flanagan|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>  His son fell in love with the series and began asking for more of the stories.<ref name=":1" /> In the early 2000s, John decided to make the stories into the first novel, ''[[The Ruins of Gorlan]],'' and it was published in 2004. 11 books comprise the main [[Ranger's Apprentice]] series. He has also written the [[Ranger's Apprentice: The Early Years]] series which explores the time before the first book, and has continued the story in the [[Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger]] series. His other series in the same world, ''[[Brotherband]]'', was based around Flanagan's passion and love of the sea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/49075-john-flanagan-adds-to-ranger-s-apprentice-and-launches-new-series.html|title=John Flanagan Adds to Ranger's Apprentice and Launches New Series|last=Lodge|first=Sally|website=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>
