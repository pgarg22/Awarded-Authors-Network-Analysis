==Her work==
"Linda Gregg brings us back to poetry. . . . She is original and mysterious, one of the best poets in America", says [[Gerald Stern]].<ref name="''Chosen by the Lion'' (cover)">{{cite web|title=''Chosen by the Lion'' (cover) |work=Poetry, Graywolf Press (1994) |url=http://www.graywolfpress.org/component/page,shop.flypage/product_id,29/category_id,0485aa93fa0558fb1f755721e776984d/option,com_phpshop/ |accessdate=2007-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235937/http://www.graywolfpress.org/component/page%2Cshop.flypage/product_id%2C29/category_id%2C0485aa93fa0558fb1f755721e776984d/option%2Ccom_phpshop/ |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Much of Linda Gregg's poetry is inspired by her extensive travels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-linda-gregg-dead-20190401-story.html|title=Linda Gregg, award-winning poet who explored love and loss, dies at 76|last=Langer|first=Emily|date=April 2, 2019|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2019-04-04|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Her work has received enormous critical praise for its soaring lyrical depictions of grief and loss, and the strange strengths and beauty she mines from them. [[Joseph Brodsky]] once stated that "[t]he blinding intensity of Ms. Gregg's lines stains the reader's psyche the way lightning or heartbreak do."<ref name="Linda Gregg (announcement)">{{cite web|title=Linda Gregg |work=Announcement, New York State Writers Institute, State University of New York (2002) |url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/gregg_linda.html |accessdate=2007-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607145030/http://albany.edu/writers-inst/gregg_linda.html |archivedate=2007-06-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The poet [[Czesław Miłosz]] said, "I consider Linda Gregg to be one of the best American poets, and I value the neatness of design in her poems, as well as the energy of each line."<ref name="Linda Gregg (announcement)"/> [[W. S. Merwin]] confessed:

:"I have loved Linda Gregg's poems since I first read them. They are original in the way that really matters: they speak clearly of their source. They are inseparable from the surprising, unrolling, eventful, pure current of their language, and they convey at once the pain of individual loss, a steady and utterly personal radiance."<ref name="''In the Middle Distance'' (cover)">{{cite web|title=''In the Middle Distance'' (cover) |work=Poetry, Graywolf Press (2006) |url=http://www.graywolfpress.org/component/page,shop.flypage/category_id,0485aa93fa0558fb1f755721e776984d/product_id,198/option,com_phpshop/ |accessdate=2007-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000005/http://www.graywolfpress.org/component/page%2Cshop.flypage/category_id%2C0485aa93fa0558fb1f755721e776984d/product_id%2C198/option%2Ccom_phpshop/ |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>
