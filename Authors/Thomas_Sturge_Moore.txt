'''Thomas Sturge Moore''' (4 March 1870 &ndash; 18 July 1944) was a British poet, author and artist.

==Biography==
Sturge Moore was born at 3 Wellington Square, Hastings, East Sussex, on 4 March 1870 and educated at [[Dulwich College]], the [[Croydon College#Croydon School of Art|Croydon School of Art]] and [[Lambeth School of Art]].<ref name=hodges/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.ulrls.lon.ac.uk/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=ChoiceArchive&search=IN=MS978 |title=Thomas Sturge Moore Papers |accessdate=11 February 2014 |last=Moore |first=Thomas Sturge |work=Archives & Manuscripts |publisher=Senate House Library, University of London}}</ref> In Lambeth he studied under the wood-engraver [[Charles Roberts (wood-engraver)|Charles Roberts]]. He was a long-term friend and correspondent of [[W. B. Yeats]], who was to describe him as "one of the most exquisite poets writing in England". He was also a playwright, writing a ''[[Medea]]'' influenced by Yeats' drama and the Japanese [[Noh]] style. As a wood-engraver and artist he designed the covers for poetry editions of Yeats and others.<ref name=Double>Untermeyer, Louis, ''Modern British Poetry'', Doubleday and Page & Co, 1920</ref><ref name=gwynn>{{cite book|last1=Gwynn|first1=Frederick L.|title=Sturge Moore and the Life of Art|date=1951|publisher=University of Kansas Press|location=Lawrence, Kansas|url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/6344/upk.sturge_moore.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>

He was a prolific poet and his subjects included morality, art and the spirit writing in a 'severely classical tone', according to poet/critic [[Yvor Winters]].<ref name=Double/> His first pamphlet, ''Two Poems'', was printed privately in 1893 and his first book of verse, ''The Vinedresser'', was published in 1899. His love for poetry led him to become an active member of the [[Poetry Society|Poetry Recital Society]].

In 1901, Moore, with Yeats, [[Laurence Binyon]], [[Charles Ricketts]], and Ethel and [[Sybil Pye]], formed the Literary Theatre Club. Moore's first (of 31) play to be produced, a copyright reading of ''Aphrodite against Artemis'', was the first production staged by the club, at the Dalston Theatre on 30 July 1901. Yeats described the play as "powerful with a beautiful constrained passion."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schuchard|first1=Ronald|title=The Last Minstrels : Yeats and the Revival of the Bardic Arts|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191528064|pages=41–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wxUNTepUVEC&pg=PA41&lpg|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>

In 1913 Moore nominated Rabindranath Tagore the Indian poet for the Nobel Prize in literature.

Moore received a [[Pensions in the United Kingdom#Civil List pensions|civil list pension]] of £75 per annum in 1920 in recognition of his contribution to literature. In 1930 he was nominated as one of seven candidates for the position of [[Poet Laureate]]. He suffered from chronic ill health, suffering a series of heart attacks in 1942 and 1943, and died on 18 July 1944 at a convalescent home, St Andrews Cottage in [[Clewer]], [[Windsor, Berkshire]], from a kidney infection following a prostate operation.<ref name=gwynn/><ref>{{cite book |last=Public Records Office |title= England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966 |chapter=1944 |location=Kew, Surrey |publisher=The National Archives |page=756 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58827/58827?back=,35090 |title=Moore, Thomas Sturge |last=Kelly |first=John |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher= Oxford University Press |accessdate=8 June 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowers, Jr.|first1=William Edgar|authorlink1=Edgar Bowers|title=The Poetry of Sturge Moore|date=1953|publisher=Dept. of English, Stanford University|location=Stanford, CA|page=iv}}</ref>

He was cremated at [[Woking]].<ref name=gwynn/> His ashes were scattered near [[Petersfield]] in August 1953.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aggett|first1=Viv|title=Sturge Moore family papers (reference MS1159)|url=http://archives.ulrls.lon.ac.uk/resources/MS1159.pdf|website=Senate House Library|publisher=University of London|accessdate=15 April 2018|page=4}}</ref>

==Family==
Sturge Moore adopted the use of his middle name 'Sturge' (his mother's family name) as a way of avoiding confusion with the poet [[Thomas Moore]].<ref name=gwynn/>

On 26 November 1903 Moore married Marie Appia, niece of [[Louis Appia]], a founder of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], and cousin of the Swiss stage designer [[Adolphe Appia]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yeats|first1=W.B.|authorlink1=W.
