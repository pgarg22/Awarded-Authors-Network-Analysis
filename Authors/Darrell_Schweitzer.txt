==Fiction==
Most of Schweitzer's fiction is in the areas of dark fantasy and horror.<ref name=SFAE/> He works most frequently in fiction of shorter lengths, though he has also written a number of novels. His first, ''[[The White Isle]]'', an epic, disillusioning quest to the underworld, was written in 1976 but remained unpublished until 1989. ''[[The Shattered Goddess]]'' (1982) takes place in a far future "[[Dying Earth (subgenre)|Dying Earth]]" setting, which he later revisited for a sequence of short stories collected as ''[[Echoes of the Goddess]]'' (2013).

The first work in his tales of the world of the Great River focusing on child-sorcerer Sekenre, "To Become a Sorcerer" (1991), was nominated for the 1992 [[World Fantasy Award—Long Fiction|World Fantasy Award for Best Novella]] and later expanded into the novel ''[[The Mask of the Sorcerer]]'' (1995). Additional stories in the series have been collected in ''[[Sekenre: The Book of the Sorcerer]]'' (2004).

His latest novel, ''[[The Dragon House]]'' (2018), melds his customary dark tone with elements of humor in a lighter work for young adults. Other works include his stories of the lapsed knight Julian, most collected in ''[[We Are All Legends]]'' (1981),<ref name="StJames"/> his tales of legendary madman [[Tom O'Bedlam]], numerous works using [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], many collected in ''[[Awaiting Strange Gods: Weird and Lovecraftian Fictions]]'' (2015), and a large body of unconnected short stories.

Schweitzer is an authority on the history of speculative fiction and has written numerous critical and bibliographical works on both the field in general and such writers as [[Lord Dunsany]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[Robert E. Howard]]. Many of his essays, reviews and author interviews have been collected into book form. He has also edited a number of anthologies and short story collections.<ref name=SFE/>
