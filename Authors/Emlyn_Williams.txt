'''George Emlyn Williams''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26 November 1905 &ndash; 25 September 1987), known as '''Emlyn Williams''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]] writer, [[dramatist]] and actor.

==Early life==
Williams was born into a [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking, [[working class]] family at 1 Jones Terrace, [[Pen-y-ffordd]], Ffynnongroyw, [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]. He was the eldest of the three surviving sons of Mary (née Williams) a former maid-servant and Richard Williams, a greengrocer.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39950|title=Williams, (George) Emlyn (1905–1987), actor and playwright|date=2004-09-23|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/39950}}</ref> He spoke only Welsh until the age of eight. Later he said he would probably have begun working in the mines at age 12 if he had not caught the attention of Sarah Grace Cooke, the model for Miss Moffat in ''[[The Corn Is Green]]''. She was a teacher of French at the grammar school in [[Holywell, Flintshire]] in 1915, where Williams had gone on a scholarship. Over the next seven years she encouraged him in his studies and helped pay for him to stay with a French friend of hers in Haute-Savoie in France, where he spent three months perfecting his French. When he was 17 she helped him win a scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he studied French and Italian.<ref>{{cite news |last=Krebs |first=Albin |date=26 September 1987 |title=Emlyn Williams, Welsh Actor and Writer, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/26/obituaries/emlyn-williams-welsh-actor-and-writer-dies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2016-10-18 }}</ref>

In 1926, during his studies at university, Williams had a [[Mental disorder|nervous breakdown]], which was blamed largely on a failed emotional friendship with another undergraduate. As a means of recovery Miss Cooke encouraged him to write.<ref>{{cite news |last=Folkart |first=Burt A. |date=26 September 1987 |title=Welsh Dramatist and Actor Emlyn Williams Dies at 81 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-26/news/mn-2513_1_welsh-background |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2016-10-18 }}</ref> However, Williams intended to enter the theatrical world too and joined the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] (OUDS).<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter|Carpenter, Humphrey]], ''O.U.D.S.: A Centenary History of the Oxford University Dramatic Society 1885–1985'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1985 ({{ISBN|0-19-212241-X}})</ref>

==Professional career==
He performed with the OUDS in his first full-length play, ''Full Moon'', at the original [[Oxford Playhouse]] in 1927 (aged 22), and later that year he joined a London-based repertory company and began his stage career. By age 25 (1930), he had expanded his writing with works such as ''[[A Murder Has Been Arranged]]'' and ''[[The Late Christopher Bean]]''. The same year he appeared in [[Edgar Wallace]]'s hit thriller ''[[On the Spot (play)|On the Spot]]'' in the West End.

Over the next few years, Williams took on roles on stage and on film, including the first film celluloid version of the Edgar Wallace mystery, ''[[The Frightened Lady (1932 film)|The Frightened Lady]]''. At age 30, he became an overnight star, however, with his thriller ''[[Night Must Fall]]'' (1935), in which he also played the lead role of a psychopathic murderer. The play was noted for its exploration of the killer's complex psychological state, a step forward for its genre. It was made into a film in 1937 with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and again in 1964 with [[Albert Finney]]. It has been frequently revived, most recently in the [[West End theatre|West End]] with [[Jason Donovan]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/1996/legit/reviews/night-must-fall-2-1200447108/ | title=Night Must Fall| date=1996-10-28}}</ref> and on Broadway in 1999 with [[Matthew Broderick]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/1999/legit/reviews/night-must-fall-3-1200457048/ | title=Night Must Fall| date=1999-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=6732 |title=Night Must Fall  |publisher=Internet Broadway Database |access-date=2015-08-01}}</ref>

His other great play was very different: ''[[The Corn Is Green]]'' (1938 at age 33), partly based on his own childhood in Wales. He starred as a Welsh schoolboy in the play's London premiere. The play came to Broadway in 1940 with [[Ethel Barrymore]] as the schoolteacher Miss Moffat. A 1950 Broadway revival starred Eva La Gallienne. The play was turned into a very successful film starring [[Bette Davis]], and again into a made-for-television film starring [[Katharine Hepburn]], under the direction of Williams's close friend [[George Cukor]]. An attempt to turn the play into a musical in the 1970s, with Davis again in the role of the schoolteacher with lyrics by Williams, failed. So did a Broadway revival in 1983 starring [[Cicely Tyson]] and [[Peter Gallagher]]. But a 1985 London revival at the [[Old Vic]] with [[Deborah Kerr]] was successful, as was a 2007 production at the [[Williamstown Theatre Festival]] in [[Massachusetts]]. That production starred [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]. Williams was a close friend of Kate's parents, [[Richard Burton]] and Burton's first wife, Sybil. In the [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] production, the schoolboy – the role created by and modeled on Williams himself – was played by Kate Burton's son, Morgan Ritchie.<ref>Isherwood, Charles.

Emlyn Williams' autobiographical light comedy, ''The Druid's Rest'' was first performed at the [[St Martin's Theatre]], [[London]], in 1944. It saw the stage debut of [[Richard Burton]] whom Williams had spotted at an audition in [[Cardiff]]. The play has been revived at [[Clwyd Theatr Cymru]] in both 1976 and 2005, and received its first [[London]] revival in sixty years at London's [[Finborough Theatre]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theatermania.com/london-theater/news/08-2009/emlyn-williams-the-druids-rest-revived-at-finborou_20747.html | title=Emlyn Williams' the Druid's Rest Revived at Finborough Theatre &#124; TheaterMania}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:D78uR_5WvOMJ:www.londonwelsh.org/word_docs/pressthedruidsrest.doc+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ph | title=The Druid's Rest}}</ref>

In addition to stage plays, Emlyn Williams wrote a number of film screenplays, working with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (on ''The Man Who Knew Too Much''), [[Carol Reed]] and other directors. He acted in and contributed dialogue to various films based on the novels of [[A. J. Cronin]], including ''[[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Stars Look Down (film)|The Stars Look Down]]'' (1939), ''[[Hatter's Castle (film)|Hatter's Castle]]'' (1942) and ''[[Web of Evidence]]'' (1959).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He played the mad Roman emperor [[Caligula]] in an uncompleted 1937 film version of Robert Graves's novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'' (with Charles Laughton);<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000271/19651218/076/0004|title=The epic that never was|last=Barker|first=Felix|date=18 December 1965|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|access-date=26 January 2019|issue=26755|page=4|url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref> a kindly veterinarian who accidentally causes the death of a murderess (played by [[Bette Davis]]) in the 1952 suspense drama ''[[Another Man's Poison]]''; and the fool Wamba in the 1952 ''Ivanhoe'' (with [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Other screen credits include Hitchcock's adaptation of [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'' (with [[Charles Laughton]]), Gabriel Pascal's film version of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'' (with [[Wendy Hiller]] and [[Rex Harrison]]), [[José Ferrer]]'s ''I Accuse!'' (playing Émile Zola), ''The Wreck of the Mary Deare'' (with Gary Cooper), ''[[The L-Shaped Room]]'' (with [[Leslie Caron]]), and a made-for-TV adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''David Copperfield'' (with an all-star cast including [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Ralph Richardson]] and [[Edith Evans]]). In 1941 Williams starred in the film ''You Will Remember'', directed by Jack Raymond and written by [[Sewell Stokes]] and Lydia Hayward. The film is based on the life of the popular late Victorian songwriter [[Leslie Stuart]], played here by [[Robert Morley]], with Williams as Stuart's best friend. Also in 1941, he had a principal supporting part (as Snobby Price) in [[Gabriel Pascal]]'s filming of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Major Barbara]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

His only film as a director, ''The Last Days of Dolwyn'' (1949), which he also wrote and starred in, marked the screen debut of his fellow Welshman, Richard Burton. Williams often appeared in his own plays, and was famous for his one-man-shows, with which he toured the world, playing [[Charles Dickens]] in an evening of excerpts from [[Charles Dickens#Novels|Dickens' novels]]. This "one man show" was the start of a whole new theatrical genre. He followed up his Dickens performance with one man shows based on the works of [[Dylan Thomas]], ''Dylan Thomas Growing Up'', and H.H. Munro better known under his pseudonym [[Saki]]. His post-war acting credits included ''[[The Winslow Boy]]'' by [[Terence Rattigan]] and ''[[The Deputy]]'' aka ''The Representative'' by [[Rolf Hochhuth]] on Broadway. He also was the "voice" of [[Lloyd George]] in the seminal [[BBC]] documentary ''[[The Great War (documentary)|The Great War]]'' (1964).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Among Williams' other books was the best seller ''[[Beyond Belief: A Chronicle of Murder and its Detection]]'' (1968), a semi-fictionalised account of the [[Moors murders|Moors murderers]], [[Ian Brady]] and [[Myra Hindley]]. His 1980 novel ''[[Headlong (Williams novel)|Headlong]]'', the fictional story of the unexpected death of the entire British royal family in a freak accident in 1930, and the ascension of a most unlikely heir to the British throne as a result, was the loose basis of the 1991 motion picture ''[[King Ralph]]''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ward|first=David S.|title=King Ralph|date=1991-02-15|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102216/|others=John Goodman, Peter O'Toole, John Hurt|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref>

On Monday 17 February 1975 Williams was [[Roy Plomley]]'s guest on [[Desert Island Discs]] on [[BBC Radio 4]]. The author's book choice was a dictionary with a typewriter, pen and paper combined as his luxury.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009n6xj | title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Emlyn Williams}}</ref>

Williams appeared as an eccentric artist in the 1983 Thames Television production, [[Rumpole]] and the Genuine Article.  When the regular actors in this series turned up for the first read-through of this episode, they were astonished when guest star Williams handed each of them a new version of the script written by himself, keeping to the broad outlines of the story, but rewriting the dialogue and giving himself rather more lines. No-one had asked him to do this, and he was carefully informed in no uncertain terms that the [[John Mortimer]] original script would be used with no alteration. He complied.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0691367/</ref>

==Personal life==
Williams was married in 1935 to actress Mary Marjorie O'Shann (Molly Shan), who died in 1970. They had two sons, [[Alan Williams (novelist)|Alan]], a writer, and Brook, an actor. [[Brook Williams]] became a close friend of Richard Burton's, working as Burton's personal assistant and appearing in many of Burton's films. Williams is godfather to [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]].

Both during his marriage and following his wife's death, Williams was actively bisexual throughout his adult life.<ref>John Russell Stephens Emlyn Williams: the making of a dramatist - Page 147

- 2000 - 
In Emlyn, Williams presents himself as bisexual and in a loose sense he was probably right; but his sexual experience with women was at best limited to a few one-night stands, almost always in brothels, whereas all his committed ..</ref> He maintained a relationship from 1981 to 1986 with American theatre journalist Albert N. Williams whom Emlyn met while appearing at the Northlight Theatre in the [[Chicago]] area with his one-man Charles Dickens show. (Albert Williams served as Emlyn Williams' personal assistant during a 1982 tour of England, Wales and [[Ireland]] with the Charles Dickens and [[Dylan Thomas]] solo shows.){{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
