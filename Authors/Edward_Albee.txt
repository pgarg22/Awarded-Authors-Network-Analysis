'''Edward Franklin Albee III''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|b|iː}} {{respell|AWL|bee}}; March 12, 1928 – September 16, 2016) was an American playwright known for works such as ''[[The Zoo Story]]'' (1958), ''[[The Sandbox (play)|The Sandbox]]'' (1959), ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1962), ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'' (1966), and ''[[Three Tall Women]]'' (1994). Some critics have argued that some of his work constitutes an American variant of what [[Martin Esslin]] identified and named the [[Theater of the Absurd]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw|url-access=limited|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw/page/10 10]}}</ref> Three of his plays won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], and two of his other works won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]].

His works are often considered frank examinations of the modern condition. His early works reflect a mastery and Americanization of the Theatre of the Absurd that found its peak in works by European playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]].

His middle period comprised plays that explored the psychology of maturing, marriage, and sexual relationships. Younger American playwrights, such as [[Paula Vogel]], credit Albee's mix of theatricality and biting dialogue with helping to reinvent postwar American theatre in the early 1960s. Later in life, Albee continued to experiment in works such as ''[[The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?]]'' (2002).

Edward Albee was born in 1928. He was placed for adoption two weeks later and taken to Larchmont, New York, where he grew up. Albee's adoptive father, [[Reed A. Albee]], the wealthy son of [[vaudeville]] magnate [[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward Franklin Albee&nbsp;II]], owned several theaters.

He had attracted theatre attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, essays, a long act play, ''Schism'', and a 500-page novel, ''The Flesh of Unbelievers'' (Horn, 1) in 1946. His formal education continued at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was expelled in 1947 for skipping classes and refusing to attend compulsory chapel.<ref name="latimesobit"/>

Albee left home for good in his late teens. In a later interview, he said: "I never felt comfortable with the adoptive parents. I don't think they knew how to be parents. I probably didn't know how to be a son, either."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/edward-albee/#interview |title=Edward Albee Interview |publisher=Academy of Achievement |date=June 2, 2005 |access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> In a 1994 interview, he said he left home at 18 because "[he] had to get out of that stultifying, suffocating environment."<ref name=":0" /> In 2008, he told interviewer [[Charlie Rose]] that he was "thrown out" because his parents wanted him to become a "corporate thug" and did not approve of his aspirations to become a writer.<ref>{{Charlie Rose view|1004}}, May 27, 2008.</ref>

[[Georgia State University]] English professor Matthew Roudane divides Albee's plays into three periods: the Early Plays (1959–1966), characterized by gladiatorial confrontations, bloodied action and fight to the metaphorical death; the Middle Plays (1971–1987), when Albee lost favor of Broadway audience and started premiering in the U.S. regional theaters and in Europe; and the Later plays (1991–2016), received as a remarkable comeback and watched by appreciative audiences and critics the world over.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/edward-albee/overview-the-theater-of-edward-albee/A5804573603B72A5AE74264BD6E6C887/core-reader|title=Overview: The Theater of Edward Albee|last=Roudané|first=Matthew|date=August 2017|website=Edward Albee: A Critical Introduction|pages=8–16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139034845|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>

According to ''The New York Times'', Albee was "widely considered to be the foremost American playwright of his generation."<ref>{{cite news|title=Edward Albee, Trenchant Playwright Who Laid Bare Modern Life, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/arts/edward-albee-playwright-of-a-desperate-generation-dies-at-88.html|access-date=December 16, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 17, 2016}}</ref>

The less-than-diligent student later dedicated much of his time to promoting American university theatre. He served as a distinguished professor at the University of Houston, where he taught playwriting. His plays are published by [[Dramatists Play Service]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dramatists.com/index.asp |title=Dramatists Play Service |publisher=Dramatists.com |access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> and [[Samuel French, Inc.]]

==Philanthropy==
Albee established the [[Edward F. Albee Foundation, Inc.]] in 1967, from royalties from his play ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''. The foundation funds the [[William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center]] (named after the composer [[William Flanagan (composer)|William Flanagan]], but better known as "The Barn") in [[Montauk, New York]], as a residence for writers and visual artists.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grundberg|first1=Andy|title=The Artists of Summer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/03/arts/the-artists-of-summer.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1988}}</ref>

==Personal life and death==
Albee was gay and stated that he first knew he was gay at age 12 and a half.<ref>{{cite journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412220903/http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6070 |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6070 |url-status=unfit |title=Who's Afraid of Edward Albee? |first=Randy |last=Shulman |journal=Metro Weekly |date=March 10, 2011 |archive-date=April 12, 2014}}</ref> As a teen in Larchmont Albee became a close friend of English-born Muir Weissinger, Jr., and his family. Albee, along with others, referred to Florence, Muir's mother, as "Mummy." For her part, Albee's mother felt he spent too much time at the Weissinger household. Albee dated Muir's sister, Delphine, and escorted her to her coming-out party. Albee and Delphine had a "long and intense relationship" while it lasted; Albee has said they were "unofficially engaged." Albee kept in touch for a long time with Florence and Muir Weissinger.<ref>Gussow, Mel.  ''Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography''.  Simon & Schuster (August 18, 1999) {{ISBN|978-0684802787}} p.44</ref>

Albee insisted that he did not want to be known as a "gay writer," saying in his acceptance speech for the 2011 [[Lambda Literary Foundation]]'s Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement: "A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/06/136923478/playwright-edward-albee-defends-remarks|title=Playwright Edward Albee defends 'gay writer' remarks|publisher=National Public Radio|date=June 6, 2011}}</ref> His longtime partner, Jonathan Richard Thomas, a sculptor, died on May 2, 2005 from bladder cancer.
