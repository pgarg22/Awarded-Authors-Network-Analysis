'''Richard Glover''' (1712 &ndash; 25 November 1785) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and politician.

==Life==
The son of Richard Glover, a [[Hamburg]] merchant, he was born in [[London]] and educated at [[Cheam School|Cheam]] in [[Surrey]]. His mother was a sister of [[Richard West (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|Richard West]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. The young Richard was said to have been something of a favourite of his uncle.

In 1739 he became one of the founding governors for the [[Foundling Hospital]], a charity dedicated to saving children from the plight of abandonment. The success of Glover's ''Leonidas'' led him to take an interest in politics, and in 1761 he entered parliament as member for [[Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Weymouth and Melcombe Regis]]. Glover was one of the reputed authors of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''; but his claims, advocated in 1825 by [[Richard Duppa]], are slight.

==Works==
He wrote in his sixteenth year a poem to the memory of [[Sir Isaac Newton]], which was prefixed by [[Henry Pemberton]] to his ''View of Newton's Philosophy'', published in 1728.

In 1737, he published an epic poem in praise of liberty, ''Leonidas'', which was thought to have a special reference to the politics of the time; commended by the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|prince of Wales]] and his court, it soon passed through several editions. In 1739, Glover published a poem entitled ''London, or the Progress of Commerce''; and in 1740 he published a ballad, ''[[Admiral Hosier]]'s Ghost'', popular in its day. The ballad's real target was not the Spanish but [[Sir Robert Walpole]].

He was also the author of two tragedies, ''Boadicea'' (1753) and ''Medea'' (1761), written in close imitation of Greek models. The ''Athenaid'', an epic in thirty books, was published in 1787, and his diary, entitled ''Memoirs of a distinguished literary and political Character from 1742 to 1757'', appeared in 1813.

In May 1774, shortly after the death of [[Oliver Goldsmith]], Glover published his "Authentic Anecdotes" on the poet in ''[[The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure|The Universal Magazine]]''. [[Edmund Burke]] included the piece in ''[[The Annual Register]]'' for that year, and when [[Edmond Malone]] in 1776 worked on a biographical [[memoir]] for ''Poems and Plays by Oliver Goldsmith'' (1777) he based it on Glover's ''Anecdotes'' as well as first-hand information from Dr. Thomas Wilson, [[Fellow|Senior Fellow]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].{{Sfn|Martin|2005}}
