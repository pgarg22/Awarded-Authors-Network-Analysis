'''Pierre du Ryer''' (c.1606 – 6 November 1658) was a [[France|French]] [[dramatist]].

== Life  and works==
Du Ryer was born in [[Paris]] in about 1606. His early comedies are loosely modelled on those of [[Alexandre Hardy]], but after the production of the ''Cid'' (1636) he became an imitator of [[Pierre Corneille]]; this was the period when he produced his masterpiece ''Scévole'', probably in 1644 (the date generally given is 1646). ''Alcione'' (1638) was so popular that the [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac|abbé d'Aubignac]] knew it by heart, and Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] is said to have had it read to her three times in one day.<ref name=eb>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Du Ryer, Pierre |volume=8 |page=712 |inline=1}}</ref>

Du Ryer was a prolific dramatist. Among his other works were ''Saül'' (printed 1642), and a comedy, ''Les Vendanges de Suresnes'' (1635 or 1636). He died in Paris in 1658.<ref name=eb/>
