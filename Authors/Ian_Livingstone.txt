==Career==

===Games Workshop===
Livingstone co-founded [[Games Workshop]] in early 1975 with flatmates [[John Peake (craftsman)|John Peake]] and [[Steve Jackson (UK)|Steve Jackson]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Livingstone | first = Ian | title = Editorial | journal =[[Owl and Weasel]] | issue = 3 | pages = 2 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = April 1975 }}</ref><ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|43}} They started publishing a monthly newsletter, ''[[Owl and Weasel]]'', and sent copies of the first issue to subscribers of the recently defunct [[fanzine]] ''Albion''; [[Brian Blume]] received one of these copies, and sent them a copy of the new game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' in return. Livingstone and Jackson felt that this game was more imaginative than anything being produced in the UK at the time, and so worked out an arrangement with Blume for an exclusive deal to sell ''D&D'' in Europe.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|43}} They began distributing ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and other [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] products later in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Livingstone | first = Ian | title = Editorial | journal =[[Owl and Weasel]] | issue = 6 | pages = 10 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = July 1975 }}</ref> In late 1975, Livingstone and Jackson organised their first convention, the first [[Games Day]].<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|43}} Because they were selling products out of their flat, people would come looking for a store that did not exist; because of this they were evicted in the summer of 1976.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|43}}

Under the direction of Livingstone and Jackson, Games Workshop expanded from a bedroom mail order company to a successful gaming manufacturer and retail chain, with the first Games Workshop store opening in [[Hammersmith]] in 1977.<ref name=independent>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-visit-to-the-fantasy-world-of-ian-livingstone-1162339.html | author=McGrath, Melanie | title=A Visit to the Fantasy World of Ian Livingstone | work=[[The Independent]] | date=2 June 1998 | access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> In June of that year, partially to advertise the opening, Livingstone and Jackson launched the gaming magazine ''[[White Dwarf magazine|White Dwarf]]'', with Livingstone as the editor. Livingstone picked the title, which had meaning for both fantasy and science fiction readers: a ''white dwarf'' could be a [[white dwarf|stellar phenomenon]] or a [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|fantasy character]].<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|44}} Livingstone stepped down as editor of the magazine after ''White Dwarf'' #74 (February 1986).<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|48}}

In 1980, Livingstone and Jackson began to develop the concept of the ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' [[gamebook]] series, the first volume of which (''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'') was published in 1982 by [[Puffin Books]].<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|46}} Livingstone and Jackson sold Games Workshop in 1991 for {{currency|10|GBP}} million.<ref name=independent/>

The pair, together with [[Bryan Ansell]], founded [[Citadel Miniatures]] in Newark to make miniatures for games.

Livingstone has also invented several board games, including ''Boom Town'', ''Judge Dredd'', ''Automania'', ''Legend of Zagor'', and ''Dragonmasters''.<ref name="HG"/>

===''Fighting Fantasy''===
In 1982, Jackson and Livingstone co-wrote ''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'', the first book in the ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' series,<ref name="HG">{{Cite book | contribution=[[Amun-Re (board game)|Amun-Re]] | title=Hobby Games: The 100 Best | last=Livingstone | first=Ian | title-link=Hobby Games: The 100 Best | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=9–12 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}</ref> but following an instruction from publishers [[Penguin books|Penguin]] to write more books "as quickly as possible" the pair wrote subsequent books separately.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The series had sold over 18 million copies as of 2017,<ref name=port>{{cite web |url=https://shop.scholastic.co.uk/products/Fighting-Fantasy-The-Port-of-Peril-Ian-Livingstone-9781407181295 |title=Fighting Fantasy: The Port of Peril |publisher=Scholastic Ltd |website=Scholastic.co.uk |access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> with Livingstone's ''[[Deathtrap Dungeon]]'' selling over 350,000 copies in its first year alone.<ref name="yath1">{{Cite book | title=You Are The Hero | last=Green | first=Jonathan | publisher=Snow Books | year=2014 | page=33 | isbn=978-1-909679-38-2}}</ref> Livingstone wrote another twelve ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks, including ''[[The Forest of Doom]]'', ''[[City of Thieves (gamebook)|City of Thieves]]'' and ''[[Caverns of the Snow Witch]]'' before marking the 30th anniversary of ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' with a new gamebook, ''Blood of the Zombies'', in 2012,<ref>Ian Livingstone, [https://twitter.com/ian_livingstone/status/125089525574795264 Twitter], 14 October 2011</ref> and with ''The Port of Peril'' in 2017 for the 35th anniversary.<ref name="port"/>

===Videogame industry===
In the mid-1980s Livingstone did design work for video game publisher [[Domark]]; he returned to the company in 1993 as a major investor and board member. Livingstone later recounted, "After the success of Games Workshop, I retired, got bored, and invested in Domark to fund their cartridge development. I got in at just the wrong time - it was all going flat."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Ian Livingstone |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|page=95}}</ref> In 1995, Domark was acquired by the video technology company Eidos Interactive,<ref name=independent/> which had been floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1990, and formed the major part of the newly created [[Eidos Interactive]].
