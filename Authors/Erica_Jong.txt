Grandma's flower paintings were filled with lavish colors, sensuous shapes, and the hand of her abused housekeeper, who'd been holding the flowers since early the day before. Grandma's flower paintings were the stuff of midwestern hotel room walls. But Grandma's portraits of her children and grandchildren seemed to express something more than just a love of flowers or housekeepers: Grandma's paintings of her family highlighted her distaste for motherhood".<ref>{{cite web |last=Jong-Fast |first=Molly |title=Excerpt from ''Girl [Maladjusted]'' |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/88626/girl-maladjusted-by-molly-jong-fast/9780307415301/excerpt |publisher=Penguin Random House Canada |date=2007}}</ref>}} Jong has an elder sister, Suzanna, who married Lebanese businessman Arthur Daou, and a younger sister, Claudia, a social worker who married Gideon S.

==Career==
A 1963 graduate of [[Barnard College]] with additionally an MA (1965) in [[18th century in literature|18th century]] [[English Literature]] from [[Columbia University]], Jong is best known for her first novel, ''[[Fear of Flying (novel)|Fear of Flying]]'' (1973), which created a sensation with its frank treatment of a [[Human female sexuality|woman's sexual desires]].<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Neely |title='Fear of Flying' author Jong zips along 40 years after dropping her literary bombshell |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fear-of-flying-author-erica-jong-zips-along-40-years-after-dropping-her-literary-bombshell/2013/10/07/23fb65f8-29ce-11e3-b139-029811dbb57f_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 7, 2013 |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Although it contains many sexual elements, the book is mainly the account of Isadora Wing, a woman in her late twenties, trying to find who she is and where she is going. It contains many psychological and humorous descriptive elements, as well as rich cultural and literary references. The book tries to answer the many conflicts arising for women in late 1960s and early 1970s America, of womanhood, femininity, love, one's quest for freedom and purpose.<ref>"Jong, Erica" in ''Current Biography Yearbook 1997''. New York / Dublin: The H.W.
