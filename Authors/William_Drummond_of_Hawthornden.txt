'''William Drummond''' (13 December 1585{{snd}}4 December 1649), called "'''of Hawthornden'''", was a Scottish poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-drummond-of-hawthornden|title=William Drummond of Hawthornden|publisher=www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date=2021-07-28}}</ref>

==Life==
Drummond was born at [[Hawthornden Castle]], [[Midlothian]], to John Drummond, the first [[laird]] of Hawthornden, and Susannah Fowler, sister of the poet and courtier [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] and daughter of [[Janet Fockart]]. Sir [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]], one-time [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland]], was his grandfather.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

Drummond received his early education at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School of Edinburgh]], and graduated in July 1605 as M.A. of the recently founded [[University of Edinburgh]]. His father was a gentleman usher at the English court (as he had been at the Scottish court from 1590) and William, in a visit to London in 1606, describes the festivities in connection with the visit of the king of Denmark. Drummond spent two years at [[Bourges]] and Paris in the study of law; and, in 1609, he was again in Scotland, where, by the death of his father in the following year, he became laird of Hawthornden at the early age of 24.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

The list of books he read up to this time is preserved in his own handwriting. It indicates a strong preference for imaginative literature, and shows that he was keenly interested in contemporary verse. His collection (now in the library of the University of Edinburgh) contains many first editions of the most famous productions of the age.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/crc/collections/special-collections/rare-books-manuscripts/rare-books-directory-section/william-drummond|title=William Drummond|work=The University of Edinburgh|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}</ref> On finding himself his own master, Drummond naturally abandoned law for the muses; "for," says his biographer in 1711, "the delicacy of his wit always run on the pleasantness and usefulness of history, and on the fame and softness of poetry".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}} In 1612 began his correspondence with [[William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander of Menstrie]], afterwards Earl of Stirling, which ripened into a lifelong friendship after Drummond's visit to [[Menstrie]] in 1614.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

Drummond's first publication appeared in 1613, an elegy on the death of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], called ''Teares on the Death of Meliades'' (''Moeliades'', 3rd edit. 1614). The poem shows the influence of [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s and [[Philip Sidney|Sidney]]'s pastoralism. In the same year he published an anthology of the elegies of [[George Chapman|Chapman]], [[George Wither|Wither]] and others, entitled ''Mausoleum'', or ''The Choisest Flowres of the Epitaphs''. In 1616, the year of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s death, appeared ''Poems: Amorous, Funerall, Divine, Pastorall: in Sonnets, Songs, Sextains, Madrigals'', being substantially the story of his love for Mary Cunningham of Barns, who was about to become his wife when she died in 1615.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=600–601}}

The poems bear marks of a close study of Sidney, and of the Italian poets. He sometimes translates direct from the Italian, especially from [[Giambattista Marino]]. ''Forth Feasting: A Panegyricke to the King's Most Excellent Majestie'' (1617), a poem written in heroic couplets of remarkable facility, celebrates James's visit to Scotland in that year. In 1618 Drummond began a correspondence with [[Michael Drayton]]. The two poets continued to write at intervals for thirteen years, the last letter being dated in the year of Drayton's death. The latter had almost been persuaded by his "dear Drummond" to print the later books of ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' at Hart's Edinburgh press. In the winter of 1618–1619, Drummond had included [[Ben Jonson]] in his circle of literary friends, and at Christmas 1618 was honoured with a visit of a fortnight or more from the dramatist.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

The account of their conversations, long supposed to be lost, was discovered in the [[Advocates' Library]], Edinburgh, by [[David Laing (Scottish antiquary)|David Laing]], and was edited for the Shakespeare Society in 1842 and printed by Gifford & Cunningham. The conversations are full of literary gossip, and embody Jonson's opinion of himself and of his host, whom he frankly told that "his verses were too much of the schooles, and were not after the fancie of the time," and again that he "was too good and simple, and that oft a man's modestie made a fool of his witt".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}} But the publication of what was obviously intended merely for a private journal has given Jonson an undeserved reputation for harsh judgements, and has cast blame on Drummond for blackening his guest's memory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

In 1623 appeared the poet's fourth publication, entitled ''Flowers of Sion: By William Drummond of Hawthornedenne: to which is adjoyned his Cypresse Grove''. From 1625 till 1630 Drummond was probably for the most part engaged in travelling on the Continent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} On 29 September 1626 he received a sixteen patents for diverse devices, mainly military. These included Glasses of Archimedes which could set ships afire at sea and an early form of [[machine gun]] "in which a number of musket barrels are fastened together in such a manner as to allow one man to take the place of a hundred musketeers in battle.<ref>''The Social History of the Machine Gun'', by John Ellis, Croom Helm, London 1975, p. 11</ref> However, there is no evidence that he actually produced any of these devices.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1627, however, he seems to have been home for a short time, as, in that year, he appears in the entirely new character of the holder of a patent for the construction of military machines, entitled "Litera Magistri Gulielmi Drummond de Fabrica Machinarum Militarium, Anno 1627".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} The same year, 1627, is the date of Drummond's munificent gift (referred to above) of about 500 volumes to the library of the University of Edinburgh.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

In 1630 Drummond again began to reside permanently at Hawthornden, and in 1632 he married Elizabeth Logan, by whom he had five sons and four daughters. In 1633 [[Charles I of England|Charles]] made his coronation-visit to Scotland; and Drummond's pen was employed in writing congratulatory speeches and verses.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} He was involved in organising the King's triumphal procession through Edinburgh.<ref>''Restoring the Temple of Vision'' by Marsha Keith Schuchard, Brill 2002</ref> As Drummond preferred [[Episcopacy]] to [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]], and was an extremely loyal subject, he supported Charles's general policy, though he protested against the methods employed to enforce it. When [[John Elphinstone, 2nd Lord Balmerino]] was put on his trial on the capital charge of retaining in his possession a petition regarded as a libel on the king's government, Drummond in an energetic "Letter" (1635) urged the injustice and folly of the proceedings. About this time a claim by the earl of Menteith to the earldom of Strathearn, which was based on the assertion that [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], husband of [[Anabella Drummond|Annabella Drummond]], was illegitimate, roused the poet's pride of blood and prompted him to prepare an historical defence of his house.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

[[File:Plaque to William Drummond dating from the restoration of his vault in 1892.jpg|thumb|270px|Plaque to William Drummond dating from the restoration of his vault in 1892]]

Partly to please his kinsman the earl of Perth, and partly to satisfy his own curiosity, the poet made researches in the genealogy of the family. This investigation was the real secret of Drummond's interest in Scottish history; and so we find that he now began his ''History of Scotland during the Reigns of the Five Jameses'', a work which did not appear till 1655, and is remarkable only for its good literary style. His next work was called forth by the king's enforced submission to the opposition of his Scottish subjects. It is entitled ''Irene: or a Remonstrance for Concord, Amity, and Love amongst His Majesty's Subjects'' (1638), and embodies Drummond's political creed of submission to authority as the only logical refuge from democracy, which he hated. In 1639 Drummond had to sign the [[Covenanter|Covenant]] in self-protection, but was uneasy under the burden, as several political squibs by him testify. In 1643 he published ''Σκιαμαχία: or a Defence of a Petition tendered to the Lords of the Council of Scotland by certain Noblemen and Gentlemen'', a political pamphlet in support of those royalists in Scotland who wished to espouse the king's cause against the English parliament. Its burden is an invective on the intolerance of the then dominant Presbyterian clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

His later works may be described briefly as royalist pamphlets, written with more or less caution, as the times required. Drummond took the part of [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]]; and a letter from the Royalist leader in 1646 acknowledged his services. He also wrote a pamphlet, ''A Vindication of the Hamiltons'', supporting the claims of the [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] to lead the Scottish army which was to release Charles I. It is said that Drummond's health received a severe shock when news was brought of the king's execution.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

He died on 4 December 1649.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} He was buried in a stone vault in his parish church of [[Lasswade]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} His tomb was restored in the 1880s and a bronze relief added over the entrance.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Public Memorials==

Drummond is one of the sixteen poets and writers whose heads appear on the [[Scott Monument]] on [[Princes Street]] in [[Edinburgh]]. He appears on the far right side on the north face.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orapweb.rcahms.gov.uk/wp/00/WP000440.pdf|title=The Scott Monument|date=9 June 2011|publisher=[[Public Monuments and Sculpture Association]]|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref>

==Works==
Drummond's most important works are the ''Cypresse Grove'' and the poems. The ''Cypresse Grove'' exhibits great wealth of illustration, and an extraordinary command of musical English. It is an essay on the folly of the fear of death. "This globe of the earth," says he, "which seemeth huge to us, in respect of the universe, and compared with that wide pavilion of heaven; is less than little, of no sensible quantity, and but as a point." This is one of Drummond's favourite moods; and he uses constantly in his poems such phrases as "the All," "this great All." Even in such of his poems as may be called more distinctively [[Christianity|Christian]], this philosophic conception is at work.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

A noteworthy feature in Drummond's poetry, as in that of his courtier contemporaries [[Robert Aytoun|Aytoun]], Lord Stirling and others, is that it manifests no characteristic Scottish element, but owes its birth and inspiration rather to the English and Italian masters. Drummond was essentially a follower of Spenser, but, amid all his sensuousness, and even in those lines most conspicuously beautiful, there is a dash of melancholy thoughtfulness—a tendency deepened by the death of his first love, Mary Cunningham. Drummond was called "the Scottish [[Petrarch]]"; and his sonnets, which are the expression of a genuine passion, stand far above most of the contemporary Petrarcan imitations. A remarkable burlesque poem ''Polemo Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam'' (printed anonymously in 1684) has been persistently, and with good reason, ascribed to him. It is a [[mock-heroic]] tale, in [[macaronic Latin]] enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions, of a country feud on the [[Fife]] lands of his old friends the Cunninghams.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

English composer [[Gerald Finzi]]'s ''Three Short Elegies'' [[Opus number|Op.]] 5 (1926) consists of musical settings for unaccompanied chorus of three of Drummond's poems: "Life a Right Shadow Is", "This World A Hunting Is" and "This Life, Which Seems So Fair".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/assemble_texts.html?SongCycleId=1272 |website=lieder.net |title=Three Short Elegies |access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref>
