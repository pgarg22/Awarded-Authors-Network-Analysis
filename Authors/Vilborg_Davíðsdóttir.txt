'''Vilborg Davíðsdóttir''' (born 3 September 1965 in [[Þingeyri]]) is an [[Iceland]]ic writer and journalist. She lives in [[Reykjavík]].

Vilborg has a diploma in journalism, and a BA in English and [[Ethnology]]. She wrote her MA thesis in Ethnology about oral tradition and storytelling. 

Her novels ''The Well of Fates'' (1993) and ''The Witches' Judgement'' (1994) concern a slave in the [[Viking]] era and are influenced by the [[Icelandic sagas]]. She has also written a [[trilogy]], [[historical fiction]] about Auður Djúpúðga ([[Aud the Deep-Minded (Ketilsdóttir)|Aud the Deep-Minded]]), one of Iceland's most famous female settlers.
Vilborg's book ''Ástin, drekinn og dauðinn (On Love, Dragons and Dying)'' (2015) is her most personal story yet. There she writes the story of her husband's journey with terminal brain cancer, and her first year as a widow, during which both her mother-in-law and her father died as well.

Some of her books have been translated and published in [[The United States]], [[Egypt]], [[Germany]] and [[Faroe Islands]].
