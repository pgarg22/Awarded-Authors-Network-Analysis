'''Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery''' (25 April 1621 – 16 October 1679), styled '''Lord Broghill''' from 1628 to 1660, was an Anglo-Irish soldier and politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of England]] at various times between 1654 and 1679. Boyle fought in the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (part of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]) and subsequently became known for his antagonism towards [[Irish Catholic]]s and their political aspirations. He was also a noted playwright and writer on 17th century warfare.

==Background==
Boyle was the third surviving son of [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork]] and his second wife, [[Catherine Fenton Boyle|Catherine Fenton]], daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton of Dublin. He was named after his parents' first son who had died at age nine. He was created '''Baron of Broghill''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] on 28 February 1628, a few months before his 7th birthday.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Joshua|title=A Biographical Index to the Present House of Lords|date=1808|publisher=T. Goddard, G.

From 1636 to 1639 he travelled abroad in France, Switzerland and Italy and then took part in the [[Bishops Wars]] against the Scots on returning home.<ref name=HOP>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/boyle-roger-1621-79 History of Parliament Online – Boyle, Roger, 1st Baron Broghill].</ref>

==Rebellion and civil war==
Boyle returned to Ireland on the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion]] in 1641 and fought with his brothers against the Irish rebels at the [[battle of Liscarroll]] in September 1642. Boyle and the English in Ireland were left vulnerable by the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. Although initially under the command of the Royalist Marquis of Ormonde (later [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]]), Lord Broghill consented to serve under the parliamentary commissioners in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] against the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]]. Boyle fought with the Parliamentarians until the execution of the king, when he retired altogether from public affairs and took up his residence at [[Marston Magna|Marston]] in [[Somerset]].

Subsequently, he originated a scheme to bring about the Restoration. On his way abroad to consult with [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], he was unexpectedly visited by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in London. Cromwell informed him that his plans were well known to the council and warned against persisting in them. Cromwell offered him a command in Ireland against the rebels that entailed no obligation except faithful service. It was accepted.

Boyle's assistance in Ireland proved invaluable during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]. Appointed master of the ordnance, he soon assembled a body of infantry and horse, driving the rebels into [[Kilkenny]], where they surrendered; he induced the Royalist garrison of Cork (English troops with whom he had served earlier in the wars) to defect back to the Parliamentarian side. On 10 May 1650 he completely defeated at [[battle of Macroom|Macroom]] a force of Irish advancing to the relief of Cork. On Cromwell's departure for Scotland, Boyle cooperated with [[Henry Ireton]], whom he joined at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650-51)|siege of Limerick]]. In 1651 he defeated an Irish force marching to Limerick's relief under Lord Muskerry at the [[battle of Knocknaclashy]], the final battle of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], thus effecting the capture of the town.

By this time Broghill had become a fast friend and follower of Cromwell, whose stern measures in Ireland and support of the English and [[Protestants]] were welcomed after the policy of concession to the Irish initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He was returned as member for the [[County Cork|county of Cork]] in 1654 to the [[First Protectorate Parliament]] and in 1656 to the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]]<ref name=HOP/> and also in the latter assembly for [[Edinburgh]], for which he elected to sit. He served this year as Lord President of the Council in Scotland, where he won much popularity. He lodged in Edinburgh at [[Mary (Dudley) Sutton, Countess of Home|Old Moray House]].<ref>John Gough Nichols, ''Autobiography of the Lady Halkett'' (London, 1875), pp. 105-7.</ref> When he returned to England he was included in the inner cabinet of Cromwell's council, and nominated in 1657 as a member of the [[Cromwell's Upper House|new House of Lords]]. He was one of those most in favour of Cromwell's assumption of the royal title,<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' volume 7 (2002) p 110-111</ref> and proposed a union between the Protector's daughter [[Frances Cromwell|Frances]] and Charles II.

==Restoration==
On Oliver Cromwell's death, Boyle gave his support to [[Richard Cromwell]]; but as he saw no possibility of maintaining the government, he left for Ireland, where by resuming command in [[Munster]] he secured the island for Charles, anticipating Monk's overtures by inviting the King to land at Cork.<ref>T. W. Moody, F. X. Martin, F. J. Byrne ''A New History of Ireland, Volume III: Early Modern Ireland 1534–1691'' Oxford University Press (1976) p. 420.</ref> In 1660, he was elected MP for [[Arundel (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel]] in the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], although he was busily engaged in Ireland at the time of the election.<ref name=HOP/> On 5 September 1660 he was created [[Earl of Orrery]]. The same year he was appointed one of the three [[Lord Justices (Ireland)]] and drew up the [[Act of Settlement 1662]]. In 1661, he was re-elected MP for Arundel in the [[Cavalier Parliament]].<ref name=HOP/> He founded the town of [[Charleville, County Cork]], near his estate at Broghill. However, his mansion house in Broghill was burned down by Irish forces before the end of the century.

He continued to exercise his office as [[lord-president of Munster]] till 1668, when he resigned it on account of disputes with the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|duke of Ormonde]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|lord-lieutenant]].  On 25 November, he was [[impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Commons for "raising of money by his own authority upon his majesty's subjects," but the prorogation of parliament by the king interrupted the proceedings, which were not afterwards renewed. In 1673 he was appointed [[Custos Rotulorum of County Limerick]], which position he held until his death.<ref>{{cite book| title= The history, topography and antiquities of the county and city of Limerick|first = Patrick|last = Fitgerald|page= 306}}</ref>

==Boyle's writings==
In addition to Lord Orrery's achievements as a statesman and administrator, he gained some reputation as a writer and a dramatist. He was the author of:
*''An Answer to a Scandalous Letter ... A Full Discovery of the Treachery of the Irish Rebels'' (1662), printed with the letter itself in his ''State Letters'' (1742)
*Another answer to the same letter entitled ''Irish Colors Displayed ...'' also ascribed to him
*''Parthenissa'', a novel (1651, 1654–56, 1669)
*''English-Adventures by a Person of Honor'' (1676), from which [[Thomas Otway|Otway]] drew his tragedy of the ''Orphan''
*''A Treatise of the Art of War'' (1677), a work of considerable historical value

There are some poems, of little interest, including verses:
*''On His Majesty's Happy Restoration'' (unprinted)
*''On the Death of Abraham Cowley'' (1677)
*''The Dream'' (unprinted)
*[http://anglicanhistory.org/poetry/boyle_poems1681.html ''Poems on most of the Festivals of the Church''] (1681)
Plays in verse, of some literary but less dramatic merit:
*''Henry V'' (1664), heroic drama
*''The Generall'' (1664), a tragi-comedy.[http://www.presscom.co.uk/halliwell/plymouth.html#the_generall] Samuel Pepys, 4 October 1664, called it "so dull and so ill-acted, that I think it is the worst I ever saw or heard in all my days."
*''[[Mustapha (1665 play)|Mustapha]]'' (1665), tragedy
*''[[Tryphon (play)|Tryphon : a tragedy]]'' (acted 1668, Printed for H. Herringman, 1669)
*''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' (acted 1667; printed 1669), heroic drama
*''Herod the Great'' (published 1694 but unacted), tragedy
*''Altemira'' (1702), tragedy
*''Guzman'' (1669), comedy
*''Mr. Anthony'' (1690), comedy

A collected edition was published in 1737, to which was added the [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|fourth earl]]'s comedy ''As you find it''. ''The General'' is also attributed to him.

==Family==  
Boyle was a brother of [[Robert Boyle]].

Boyle married Lady Margaret Howard, 3rd daughter of [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk|Theophilus, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]], whose charms were celebrated by [[John Suckling (poet)|Suckling]] in his poem "The Bride". By her he had besides five daughters, two sons, of whom the eldest, [[Roger Boyle, 2nd Earl of Orrery|Roger]] (1646&nbsp;–1681/1682), succeeded as 2nd earl of Orrery. His daughter, Elizabeth, married [[Folliott Wingfield, 1st Viscount Powerscourt]]. Two other children, Henry and Margaret, married children of [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin]]; Henry was the father of [[Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon]].
