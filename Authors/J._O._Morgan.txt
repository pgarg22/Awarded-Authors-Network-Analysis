'''J. O. Morgan''' (born 1978) is a poet from Edinburgh, Scotland. The latest of his seven volumes of verse is set in the far future, when humans "lose their humanity."<ref name=":6"/>

==Works==
Each of Morgan's seven poetry volumes is a single book-length work. His fifth, ''Interference Pattern'', was shortlisted for the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]]<ref name=":1"/> and his first, ''Natural Mechanical'', won the [[Aldeburgh Festival|Aldeburgh Poetry Prize]] in 2009.<ref name=":2"/>

The third work, ''At Maldon'' (2014), revisits the Old English epic [[The Battle of Maldon|Battle of Maldon]], detailing events that took place on the Essex coast in 991 CE.<ref name=":3"/> A recording of Morgan reading it was made for the [[Poetry Archive]] on 27 May 2014.<ref name=":4"/> He has recited the whole work from memory on several occasions.

Royal Air Force involvement in maintaining the Airborne Nuclear Deterrent in the early Cold War period forms the basis for Morgan's sixth publication, ''Assurances'' (2018). It was shortlisted for the [[Forward Prizes for Poetry|Forward Prize]]<ref name=":5"/> and won the [[Costa Book Awards|Costa Poetry Award]], when the judges praised it as "original, compelling, ambitious, highly accomplished and marvellously sustained".

Morgan's most recent work, ''The Martian's Regress'' (2020), is set in the far future. It considers "what humans become when they lose their humanity," and explores "what a fragile environment eventually makes of those who persist in tampering with it."<ref name=":6"/>
