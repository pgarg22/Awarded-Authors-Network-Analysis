'''Octavian Goga''' ({{IPA-ro|oktaviˈan ˈɡoɡa}}; 1 April 1881 – 7 May 1938) was a nationalistic and later far-right [[Romania|Romanian]] politician, [[poetry|poet]], [[playwright]], journalist and translator.

==Life and politics==
{{see|Kingdom of Romania under Fascism}}
Goga was born in [[Rășinari]], near  [[Sibiu]].<ref name=MacGregor-Hastie>{{cite book|last=MacGregor-Hastie|first=Roy|title=Anthology of contemporary Romanian poetry|date=1969|publisher=Owen|page=36|isbn=9780720602807|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmYIAQAAIAAJ&q=%22a+family+which+traditionally+supplied+the+priest+for+the+village+of+Rasinari%22}}</ref>

Goga was an active member in the Romanian nationalistic movement in [[Transylvania]] and of its leading group, the [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR) in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungary]]. Before [[World War I]], Goga was arrested by the Hungarian authorities. At various intervals before the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]] in 1918, Goga took refuge in Romania, becoming active in literary and political circles. Because of his political activity in Romania, the Hungarian state sentenced him to death ''in absentia''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

During World War I, he joined the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] and took part as a soldier in the [[Dobruja]] campaign.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Together with [[Vasile Goldiș]], [[Ioan Lupaș]], and Silviu Dragomir, Octavian Goga left the PNR in 1926 and joined General [[Alexandru Averescu]]'s [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] (PP), a [[populism|populist]] movement created upon the war's end. Interestingly, Goga, Goldiș, Lupaș and Dragomir were all Orthodox, whereas the PNR leader [[Iuliu Maniu]] and other remaining members of the PNR were Greek-Catholic.

Goga clashed with Averescu over the latter's conflict with [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Together with Goldiș, Lupaș and Dragomir, Goga founded the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]] on April 10, 1932. This party he led into an alliance with [[A. C. Cuza]]'s far-right, anti-Semitic [[National-Christian Defense League]], forming the [[National Christian Party]] on July 14, 1935.

When the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] lost the elections in December 1937, King Carol II appointed Goga [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister of Romania]], although the National Christian Party had obtained only 9.15% of the votes for the house. Carol II expected the government to be transitional, allowing him to get rid of the party system. He wrote in his diary that he was conscious that the government would not last long and that, after its collapse, he would be able to free his country and himself from the tyranny and the petty interests of the parties. This calculation proved correct. However, the King miscalculated the impact of the anti-Semitic measures of the Goga cabinet, which he had to deal with throughout his personal regime (the so-called royal dictatorship) that he established on February 10, 1938. The Goga cabinet stripped the Jews of their citizenship, limited their right to work or simply harassed them through its anti-Semitic measures, in an effort to gain the support of the electors of the [[Iron Guard]], another anti-Semitic movement and the rival of both the National Christian Party and the King. As a result, the Goga cabinet damaged the Romanian economy and the relations with France, Great Britain and the [[League of Nations]] and strengthened the Iron Guard. Its „revision of the Romanian citizenship”, as implemented by King Carol II's personal regime, denaturalised 225.222 Jews, i.e. approximately 30% of the Jewish population.

The [[paramilitary]] wing of the National Christian Party, the ''Lănceri'' (meaning  "Lancers", the word was derived from LANC, the Romanian acronym of National-Christian Defense League) contributed to the chaos, attacking both Jews and Iron Guard members.

Carol II first pushed towards a victory of the government in the snap elections in March 1938, which he had called on January 18, 1938. However, he soon abandoned Goga, preparing a coup together with the minister of the Interior [[Armand Călinescu]], a former member of the [[National Peasants' Party]], who acted as a guarantee for the king in the government. The coup was probably precipitated when Goga negotiated an electoral agreement with [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the leader of the Iron Guard, on February 8, 1938, thus posing a considerable threat to the King's power. On February 9, 1938, Carol II, Călinescu and the former national liberal prime minister [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] set the coup for the next day. On February 10, 1938, Carol II received Goga and told him to postpone the snap elections, whereupon Goga resigned. Goga refused to participate in the [[national unity government]] the king appointed the same day and withdrew to his estate in [[Ciucea]], Transylvania, where he suffered a [[stroke]] on 5 May 1938. He died two days later, on May 7, 1938.<ref>{{cite book|last=Quinlan|first=Paul D.|title=Clash over Romania: British and American policies toward Romania, 1938-1947|date=1977|publisher=American Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences|page=29|isbn=9780686232636|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJW3AAAAIAAJ&q=%22no+sooner+had+the+Goga+Government+taken+office%22}}; <br> Rudolph Tessler, University of Missouri Press, 1999, Letter to My Children: From Romania to America Via Auschwitz, p. 31; <br> Itamar Levin, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, ''His Majesty's Enemies: Great Britain's War Against Holocaust Victims and Survivors'', p. 46; <br> Ivan T.
