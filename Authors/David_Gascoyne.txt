'''David Gascoyne''' (10 October 1916 – 25 November 2001) was an English poet associated with the [[Surrealist]] [[artistic movement|movement]], in particular the [[British Surrealist Group]]. Additionally he translated work by French surrealist poets.

==Early life and surrealism==
Gascoyne was born in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] the eldest of three sons of Leslie Noel Gascoyne (1886–1969), a bank clerk, and his wife, Winifred Isobel, née Emery (1890–1972). His mother, a niece of the actors [[Cyril Maude]] and [[Winifred Emery]], was one of two young women present when the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] died in his lake at [[Grim's Dyke]] in May 1911.<ref>Andrew Goodman, ''Grim's Dyke: A Short History of the House and Its Owners'', Glittering Prizes {{ISBN|978-1-85811-550-4}}, pp. 17–18.</ref> Gascoyne grew up in England and [[Scotland]], attending [[Salisbury Cathedral School]] and London's [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]]. He spent some of the early 1930s in Paris.

Gascoyne's first book, ''Roman Balcony and Other Poems'', appeared in 1932, when he was 16.<ref name="vc">[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/27/guardianobituaries.books Obituary:David Gascoyne] Valentine Cunningham, ''The Guardian'', 27 November 2001. Retrieved 17 June 2014.</ref> A novel, ''Opening Day'' was published the following year.<ref name="vc"/> However, it was ''Man's Life is This Meat'' (1936), collecting his early surrealism and translations of French surrealists, and ''Hölderlin's Madness'' (1938) that established his reputation. These, with his 1935 ''A Short Survey of Surrealism'' and his work on the 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]], which he helped to organise, made him one of a small group of English surrealists that included [[Hugh Sykes Davies]] and Roger Roughton. At the exhibition, Gascoyne had to use a spanner to rescue [[Salvador Dalí]] from a deep-sea diving suit he had worn to give his lecture.

==Political outlook==
Gascoyne was an active [[anti-fascist]], who took part in several protests against the [[British Union of Fascists]] in London's East End.<ref>Rachel Lichtenstein and Iain Sinclair: ''Rodinsky's Room'' (London, ''Granta'', 1999), p. 85. {{ISBN|1862072574}}</ref> He joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1936 and travelled to Spain, where he broadcast some radio talks for the [[Barcelona]]-based propaganda ministry.<ref name="pd">Patrick Deane, ''History in our hands: a critical anthology of writings on literature, culture, and politics from the 1930s''. London: Leicester University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|9780718501433}}, pp. 63–64.</ref> However, he soon became disillusioned with the Communists' treatment of the [[POUM]] and the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Anarchists]] and left the party.<ref name="pd"/> Gascoyne had become friends with [[Charles Madge]] and through him became involved in the [[Mass Observation]] movement.<ref name="pd"/>

The diaries Gascoyne kept for six years from 1936 projected an existentialist auto-criticism, recording with honesty his acute emotional and spiritual crises, his struggle to accept his sexual identity as a homosexual, and his affairs. Apart from his involvement with communism and Mass-Observation, he had friendships with [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Kathleen Raine]], [[Lawrence Durrell]], [[Henry Miller]] and others. Also apparent is strong engagement with existentialist philosophy.<ref>Roger Scott, "Gascoyne, David Emery (1916–2001)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2005) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76473 Retrieved 10 October 2016.]</ref>

When later interviewed for the book ''Authors Take Sides on the Falklands'', Gascoyne expressed strong opposition to the [[Falklands War]].<ref>[[Andy Croft]], ''Red Letter Days: British Fiction in the 1930s'' (London, Lawrence & Wishart, 1990), p. 345.</ref>

==Later life and works==
Gascoyne spent the years just before World War II in Paris, where he became friends with [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]] and [[Pierre Jean Jouve]]. His poetry of this period appeared in ''Poems 1937–1942'' (1943) with illustrations by [[Graham Sutherland]].

His poem ''Requiem'', dedicated to the future victims of war, was written for his friend [[Priaulx Rainier]] to set to music. Her ''Requiem'' was first heard in 1956. She died on Gascoyne's 70th birthday, 10 October 1986.

Gascoygne returned to France after the war and lived there at intervals until the mid-1960s. His work from the 1950s appeared in ''A Vagrant and Other Poems'' (1950), and ''Night Thoughts'' (1956). These moved away from surrealism towards a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and religious approach.

After suffering a mental breakdown, Gascoyne returned to England to spend the rest of his life on the [[Isle of Wight]]. He appears to have written little by then. Publication continued due to various "rediscoveries" of his works, with several collections and selections from [[Oxford University Press]], Enitharmon and other imprints. Two books of his journals were returned to him after being lost for some time and were published in separate volumes by [[Alan Clodd]] at [[Enitharmon Press]]. When a third book was found, a collection including the additional material was edited by Lucien Jenkins for Skoob Books Publishing. For this Gascoyne himself provided what he called a "postface", one of the most extended pieces of writing from his later years.

It was in [[Whitecroft Hospital]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] that Gascoyne met his wife, Judy Lewis, in a remarkable coincidence. Judy explains:
:One of my favourite poems was called ''September Sun''. I read it one afternoon and one of the patients came up to me afterwards and said "I wrote that." I put my hand on his shoulder and said "Of course you did, dear." Then of course when I got to know him I realised he had. They married in 1975. David Gascoyne died on 25 November 2001 at the age of 85.<ref>Obituaries: [http://www.connectotel.com/gascoyne/gascnews.html Retrieved 10 October 2016.]</ref>

==Reputation==
In a poetic field dominated by [[W. H. Auden]] and other more political and social poets, the surrealist group tended to be overlooked by critics and the public. He among others was lampooned by [[Dylan Thomas]] in ''Letter to my Aunt.'' Although ''Poems 1937–1942'' (illustrated by [[Graham Sutherland]] and edited by [[Tambimuttu]]) received critical acclaim at the time, it was only with renewed interest in experimental writing associated with the [[British Poetry Revival]] that their work began to be discussed again. His ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 1988. Work of his was included in the Revival anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996).

In later years, Gascoyne seemed remarkably resigned to not altogether achieving in poetry what he had set out to do when young, and not sustaining a remarkable early promise. Still, he was pleased whenever he received critical notice. In his later years his attention was drawn to a balanced assessment of his work by [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] in his immense ''[[Guide to Modern World Literature]]'' (Macmillan), and he was gratified by the tone of the commentary and the assertion that he was still widely read. A tribute volume, ''For David Gascoyne On His Sixty-Fifth Birthday'', appeared in 1981 with contributions from 26 poets, including [[Adrian Henri]], [[Lawrence Durrell]], and [[Michael Hamburger]].
