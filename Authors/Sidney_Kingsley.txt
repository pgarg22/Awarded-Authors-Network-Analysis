'''Sidney Kingsley'''  (22 October 1906 &ndash; 20 March 1995) was an American dramatist. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his play ''[[Men in White (play)|Men in White]]'' in 1934.

== Life and career ==
Kingsley was born '''Sidney Kirschner''' in New York. He studied at [[Cornell University]], where he began his career writing plays for the college dramatic club. He joined the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theater]] for the production of his first major work. In 1933 the company performed his play ''[[Men in White (play)|Men in White]]''. Set in a hospital, the play dealt with the issue of illegal [[abortion]], 1930s medical and surgical practices and the struggle of one promising physician who must choose to dedicate his life to medicine or devote himself to his fiancée.  The play was a box-office smash.

Kingsley followed this success with the play ''[[Dead End (play)|Dead End]]'' in 1935. A story about slum housing and its connection to crime, the piece was also fairly successful, eventually spawning the [[Dead End Kids]]. The two plays which followed, the anti-war ''Ten Million Ghosts'' of 1936 and ''The World We Make'' of 1939, were flops and had short runs.

Despite reaching the rank of lieutenant in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], sometime soon after 1951 [[HUAC]] put Kingsley's name on the [[Hollywood Blacklist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/21/obituaries/sindney-kingsley-playwrite-is-dead-at-88-creator-of-dead-end-and-men-in-white.html|title=Sindney Kingsley, Playwrite, Is Dead at 88; Creator of 'Dead End' and 'Men in White'|first=Peter B.|last=Flint|website= The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.terramedia.co.uk/reference/documents/red_menace_in_hollywood.htm|title=The 'red menace' in Hollywood|website= Terra Media}}</ref> Being on the Blacklist is the main reason he never had a Hollywood film adaption after 1951.

In 1943, Kingsley returned to his previous success with the historical drama ''[[The Patriots (play)|The Patriots]]''. This play, which told the story of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his activities in the young American republic, won the [[New York Drama Critics Circle]] Award for Best Play. Kingsley continued writing for the theater late into his career, adapting [[Arthur Koestler]]'s novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' for the stage in 1951, and writing ''Lunatics and Lovers'' in 1954 and ''Night Life'' in 1962.

In addition to his work for the stage, Kingsley wrote a number of scripts for [[Hollywood]] productions, mostly based on his own work. He later also wrote the scripts and templates for numerous television series and television films.

His marriage to actress [[Madge Evans]] in 1939<ref>''Derby Daily Telegraph'', 26 July 1939</ref> lasted until her death in 1981. The couple lived together in their 18th century [[Oakland, New Jersey]] home for 42 years.

Meeting him in 1957, [[Michael Korda]] described Kingsley as "a short, powerfully built man with broad shoulders, a big head, and rough-hewn features that made him look like a bust by [[Jacob Epstein|Sir Jacob Epstein]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Random House|year=1999|isbn=9780679456599|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/14 14–24]|quote=That was true enough, I thought, though not very nice of Sidney to say. "What's the lesson?" I asked. "Ah, the lesson. Never forget that people who pay a writer always have much, much more money and power than he does, whether it's a publishing house, a movie studio, or a television network. With that in mind,"--his voice changed to a fair imitation of W.C. Fields--"'Never give a sucker an even break.' You can go now."|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/14}}</ref> Kingsley hired Korda as an assistant to do research for a screenplay he was writing for CBS on the Hungarian Revolution which was eventually canceled.<ref name=":0" />

In 1964, Kingsley was elected president of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]]<ref>''The Stage'', 30 December 1965</ref> and in 1983, he was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/theater/theater-hall-of-fame-gets-10-new-members.html|title=Theater Hall of Fame Gets 10 New Members|work=New York Times|date=May 10, 1983}}</ref>

Kingsley died of a stroke on March 20, 1995, in his home in [[Oakland, New Jersey]].<ref>Flint, Peter B. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/21/obituaries/sindney-kingsley-playwrite-is-dead-at-88-creator-of-dead-end-and-men-in-white.html?pagewanted=all "Sidney Kingsley, Playwright, Is Dead at 88; Creator of ''Dead End'' and ''Men in White''"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 21, 1995. Accessed May 25, 2016. "Sidney Kingsley, who brought the gritty drama of mean city streets into the theater in plays including ''Dead End'' and ''Detective Story'' and who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1933 for his first Broadway play, ''Men in White,'' died yesterday at his home in Oakland, N.J."</ref>
