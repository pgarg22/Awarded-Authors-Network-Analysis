'''Anna Thilda May''' "'''May'''" '''Swenson''' (May 28, 1913 – December 4, 1989) was an American poet and playwright. [[Harold Bloom]] considered her one of the most important and original poets of the 20th century.<ref>Blood, Harold. [http://www.bostonreview.net/BR23.2/bloom.html "They have the numbers; we, the heights,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426233445/http://bostonreview.net/BR23.2/bloom.html |date=April 26, 2012 }} ''[[Boston Review]]''. Accessed February 15, 2012.</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/05/obituaries/may-swenson-a-humorous-poet-of-cerebral-verse-is-dead-at-76.html</ref>

The first child of Margaret and Dan Arthur Swenson, she grew up as the eldest of 10 children in a [[Mormon]] household where Swedish was spoken regularly and English was a second language.<ref name=Gould>{{cite book|last1=Gould|first1=Jean|title=Modern American Women Poets|date=1984|publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company|location=New York|isbn=0-396-08443-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00goul/page/75 75]|url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00goul/page/75}}</ref> Although her conservative family struggled to accept the fact that she was a lesbian, they remained close throughout her life. Much of her later poetry works were devoted to children (e.g. the collection ''Iconographs'', 1970).  She also translated the work of contemporary Swedish poets, including the selected poems of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Tomas Tranströmer]].

== Personal life ==

Swenson attended [[Utah State University]] in [[Logan, Utah]], graduating in the class of 1934 with a bachelor's degree. She taught poetry as poet-in-residence at [[Bryn Mawr College]], the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], the [[University of California, Riverside]], [[Purdue University]], and [[Utah State University]]. From 1959 to 1966 she worked as a manuscript reviewer at [[New Directions Publishing]]. Swenson left New Directions Press in 1966 in an effort to focus completely on her own writing.<ref>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/168 Poets.org - Poetry, Poems, Bios & More - May Swenson<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She also served as a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] from 1980 until her death in 1989. She is buried in the Logan City Cemetery, and her grave is marked by a granite bench on which is etched some of her poetry. For the last twenty years of her life, she lived in [[Sea Cliff, New York]].

In 1936, Swenson worked as an editor and ghostwriter for a man called "Plat", who became her "boyfriend." "I think I should like to have a son by Plat", she wrote in her diary, "but I would not like to be married to any man, but only be myself."<ref>''May Swenson: A Poet's Life in Photos'' by R. R. Knudson & Suzzane Bigelow with a foreword by Richard Wilbur (Utah State University Press, 1996), {{ISBN|0-87421-218-9}}, p. 39.</ref>

Her poems were published in [[Antaeus (magazine)|''Antaeus'']], [[The Atlantic|''The Atlantic Monthly'']], ''[[Carleton Miscellany]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Paris Review]]'', [[Saturday Review (US magazine)|''Saturday Review'']], [[Parnassus (magazine)|''Parnassus'']] and [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']]. Her poem ''Question'' was also published in [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s book [[The Host (novel)|''The Host'']].

She received much recognition for her work. Some of which include:
*American Introductions Prize in 1955; 
*William Rose Benet Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1959; 
*Longview Foundation Award in 1959;

==Style, imagery and eroticism==
Swenson created poems in "[[iconograph]]" style, first published in her 1970 book ''Iconographs'', in which Swenson shaped lines of her poetry to create images relating to the poem's content.  Her work "The Lowering", for instance, a memorial poem for [[Robert F. Kennedy]], explored the late Kennedy's military funeral, with lines arranged in the shape of a folded flag. Swenson is known for her heavy use of natural imagery, mixed with religious and philosophical themes. Her poem "By Morning", which was published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' compares a snowfall to the biblical fall of [[manna]]. 
Swenson's sense of imagery also lends itself to erotic poems, as she describes human bodies, breasts and limbs and the "pelvic heave of mountains."<ref>https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/blue</ref> Author Jean Gould describes Swenson's work as "sensual as well as sexual."<ref name=Gould2>{{cite book|last1=Gould|first1=Jean|title=Modern American Women Poets|date=1984|publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company|location=New York|isbn=0-396-08443-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00goul/page/85 85–92]|url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00goul/page/85}}</ref>

==Legacy==

Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, houses most of Swenson's documents and original manuscripts. This is the primary location for all scholarly materials on Swenson.

Utah State University also has two collections of her work, and an addendum in their Special Collections and Archives.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archives West: May Swenson papers, 1932-1998|url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv48208/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=may+swenson|access-date=2021-06-14|website=archiveswest.orbiscascade.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Archives West: The May Swenson photograph collection, 1938-1991|url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv03918/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=may+swenson|access-date=2021-06-14|website=archiveswest.orbiscascade.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Archives West: May Swenson addendum, 1932-1997|url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv85885/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=may+swenson|access-date=2021-06-14|website=archiveswest.orbiscascade.org}}</ref> The University has created the "May Swenson Project." Supported by students and teachers, it has publicized Swenson's work at USU, as well as her influence across the nation. In her name, USU has dedicated a May Swenson room in the English Department and another in the USU [[Merrill-Cazier Library]]. Funds are being sought to establish an endowed chair in Swenson's name.

The May Swenson Poetry Award, sponsored by Utah State University Press, is a competitive prize granted annually to an outstanding collection of poetry in English. Open to published and unpublished writers, with no limitation on subject, the competition honors May Swenson as one of America's most vital and provocative poets of the twentieth century. Judges for the competition have included [[Mary Oliver]], [[Maxine Kumin]], [[John Hollander]], [[Mark Doty]], [[Alice Quinn]], [[Harold Bloom]], [[Garrison Keillor]], [[Edward Field (poet)|Edward Field]] and others from the first tier of American letters.
