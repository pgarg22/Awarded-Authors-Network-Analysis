His father died five years after. He was raised in [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]] and attended Lookout Mountain Elementary School in [[Lookout Mountain, Tennessee]].

Golden spent his middle and high school years at the [[Baylor School]] (then a boys-only school for day and boarding students) in Chattanooga, graduating in 1974 before attending [[Harvard University]] and receiving a degree in art history, specializing in Japanese art. In 1980, he earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Japanese history at [[Columbia University]], and also learned [[Mandarin Chinese]]. After a summer at [[Peking University]] in [[Beijing]], China, Golden worked in [[Tokyo]], before returning to the United States, where he earned an M.A. in English at [[Boston University]].

==Career==
Golden's most well-known novel, ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', was written over a 6-year period. The novel was re-written in its entirety three times during its development. Golden changed the point of view with each re-write, eventually settling on Sayuri's perspective.

During research for the novel, Golden conducted interviews with a number of geisha, including famous ex-geisha {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Mineko Iwasaki]]|italic=no}}. After the Japanese edition of the novel was published, Golden was sued by {{lang|ja-Latn|Iwasaki|italic=no}} for breach of contract and defamation of character, with {{lang|ja-Latn|Iwasaki|italic=no}} alleging that Golden had agreed to protect her anonymity if she was interviewed about her life as a geisha, due to the traditional code of silence held between geisha in regards to their clients. The lawsuit was settled out of court in February 2003.<ref>{{cite news | title=Tokyo Premiere of 'Memoirs of a Geisha' Nets Mixed Reaction, Criticism | date=November 29, 2005 | url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2005/11/29/geisha-premiere-051129.html | work =CBC News | access-date = 2008-01-14 }}</ref>
