'''Rebecca Bradley''' is a Canadian novelist and archaeologist, with a doctorate in [[archaeology]] from the [[University of Cambridge]]. She was selected for the gift-child [[Berg Science Seminars]] program while living in Vancouver, B.C. She is best known for her fantasy trilogy consisting of ''The Lady in Gil'' (1996) and its two sequels ''Scion's Lady'' (1997) and ''Lady Pain'' (1998, all published by Gollancz).

While previously living in Hong Kong, Bradley wrote two books of short stories, ''Hong Kong Macabre'' and ''Hong Kong Grotesque'' (both published by Hong Kong Horrors), and co-wrote ''Temutma'' (Asia 2000, 1998) with [[Stewart Sloan]].  Both ''Temutma'' and the ''Gil'' trilogy have also been published in German translations.

In 2007 Bradley published a collection of short stories entitled ''The Lateral Truth: An Apostate's Bible Stories'' (Scroll Press).

More recently, ''The Lateral Truth: An Apostate's Bible Stories'' was picked up and re-released by Onus Books, with a foreword by Benjamin Blake Speed Watkins. In 2015, she released ''Cadon, Hunter'' and ''From Hades with love'' (as a collection of her Hong Kong horror stories) through Loom, with her Gil series also re-released by Loom in ebook format.
