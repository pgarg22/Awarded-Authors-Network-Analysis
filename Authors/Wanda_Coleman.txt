==Biography==
Wanda Evans was born in the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], where she grew up during the 1950s and 1960s. She is the eldest of four children. Her parents were George and Lewana (Scott) Evans, who were introduced to one another at church by his aunt. In 1931, her father had relocated to Los Angeles from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], after the lynching of a young man who was hung from a church steeple. He was an ex-boxer and long-time friend and sparring partner of Light Heavyweight Champion [[Archie Moore]]. In Los Angeles, he ran a sign shop during the day and worked the graveyard shift as a janitor at [[RCA Victor Records]]. Her mother worked as a seamstress and as a housekeeper for [[Ronald Reagan]], among other celebrities.<ref name="riot">{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Wanda|title=The Riot Inside Me: More Trials & Tremors|publisher=David R. Godine Publisher|year= 2005|isbn=9781574232004}}</ref>

After graduating from [[John C. Fremont High School]] in Los Angeles, Wanda Evans enrolled at [[Los Angeles Valley College]] in [[Van Nuys, California]]. She transferred to [[California State University at Los Angeles]], but did not complete a degree.<ref name="riot"/>

Shortly after finishing high school, she married white Southerner Charles Coleman, a troubleshooter for the [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in the 1960s. Their union produced two children, Luanda and Anthony. She went on to marry two more times. Her third husband was poet Austin Straus, whom she married in 1981.<ref name="riot"/>

After divorcing her first husband, Coleman worked a variety of jobs to make ends meet as a single mother, including waiting, typing, and editing a soft-core pornography magazine.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = McInnis| first1 = Jarvis| title = Writing Around the Edges: A Praise Song for Wanda Coleman| journal = Callaloo| date = 2014| volume = 37| issue = 2| pages = 190–193| doi = 10.1353/cal.2014.0040| s2cid = 162968074| url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/544902| access-date = March 8, 2018}}</ref>

She and Straus hosted a radio show, [[Pacifica Radio]]'s "Poetry Connexion", from 1981 to 1996. On the show they interviewed both local and internationally known writers.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Ryan-Bryant| first1 = Jennifer| title = Biography of Wanda Coleman| journal = Hecate| date = 2014| volume = 40| issue = 1| pages = 56–57| id = {{ProQuest|1695231357}}}}</ref>

Within her writing, whether it be fiction, essays, or poetry, Coleman introduces and develops characters whose lives bring to light social inequalities.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Ryan| first1 = Jennifer| title = "Come.

Coleman received fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and the [[California Arts Council]] (in fiction and in poetry). She was the first C.O.L.A. Literary Fellow (Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, 2003). Her honors included an [[Emmy]] in Daytime Drama writing, the 1999 [[Lenore Marshall Prize]] (for ''Bathwater Wine''), and a finalist for the 2001 [[National Book Awards]] (for ''Mercurochrome''). She was a finalist for California poet laureate (2005).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aaregistry.org/story/wanda-coleman-born/|title=Wanda Coleman born|website=African American Registry|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>

In 2020, [[Black Sparrow Press]], Coleman's longtime publisher, released ''Wicked Enchantment: Selected Poems'', Edited & Introduced by [[Terrance Hayes]]. The collection draws work from all of Coleman's Black Sparrow Press books, which spanned from 1983 to 2005. ''New York Times'' bestselling author [[Mary Karr]] wrote "''Wicked Enchantment'' has words to crack you open and heal you where it counts—hateful and hilarious, heartbroken and hellbent."

''Wicked Enchantment: Selected Poems'' quickly received critical acclaim upon publication. In a piece for the ''New Yorker'' entitled "[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/the-fearless-invention-of-one-of-las-greatest-poets The Fearless Invention of One of L.A.'s Greatest Poets]," critic Dan Chiasson wrote "One of the greatest poets ever to come out of L.A., she shaped the city's literary scene like few before her. . . . Rarely does a poet seem to want to take an already brutally brief form and speed it up. But Coleman's sonnets are sprints, which is what makes their improvisations, modelled on American blues and jazz, so compelling."

Writing online for ''Poetry'' in a piece entitled "Heart First Into This Ruin",<ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/153468/heart-first-into-this-ruin Heart First Into This Ruin]</ref> Lizzy LeRud wrote: "Today, Coleman's significance is unquestioned.... In ''Wicked Enchantment'', Coleman's fans, new and old, will find some of her most vital challenges to American racism and its market-driven culture, rendered in her uniquely unsettling lyric voice. Her work pushes us to confront injustice with as much candor as she did—and with as much care."

==Controversy==
While critically acclaimed for her creative writing, Coleman's brush with notoriety came as a result of an unfavorable review she wrote in the April 14, 2002, issue of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Book Review''  of [[Maya Angelou]]'s book ''[[A Song Flung Up to Heaven]]''.  Coleman found the book to be "small and inauthentic, without ideas wisdom or vision".  Coleman's review provoked positive and negative responses, including the cancellation of events and the rescinding of invitations.<ref name="review">{{cite web|title=Book Reviewing, African-American Style|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/book-reviewing-african-american-style#|publisher=[[The Nation]]|date=September 16, 2002|access-date=May 30, 2015}}</ref>  Her account of this incident appears in the September 16, 2002, edition of ''[[The Nation]]''.

{{quote|"In our post-[[9/11]] America, where unwarranted suspicions and the fear of terrorism threaten to overwhelm long-coveted individual freedoms, a book review seems rather insignificant—until the twin specters of censorship and oppression are raised. What has made our nation great, despite its tortuous history steeped in slavery, are those who have persisted in honoring those freedoms, starting with the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and its amendments. It is this striving toward making those freedoms available to every citizen, regardless of race, creed, color, gender or origin, that makes the rest of the insanity tolerable. It is what allows me to voice my opinion, be it praise song or dissent, no matter who disagrees.".<ref name="review"/>}}
