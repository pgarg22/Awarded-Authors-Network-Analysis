'''Sir Stephen Harold Spender''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (28 February 1909 – 16 July 1995) was an English poet, novelist and essayist whose work concentrated on themes of [[social injustice]] and the [[class struggle]]. He was appointed [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] to the [[Library of Congress|United States Library of Congress]] in 1965.

==Early life==
Spender was born in [[Kensington]], London, to journalist [[Harold Spender]] and Violet Hilda Schuster, a painter and poet, of [[German Jewish]] heritage.<ref name="Sutherland2005a">{{cite book|author=John Sutherland|title=Stephen Spender: A Literary Life|url=https://archive.org/details/stephenspenderli00suth|url-access=registration|date=6 January 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-517816-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stephenspenderli00suth/page/16 16]}}</ref><ref name="Leeming2011">{{cite book|author=David Leeming|title=Stephen Spender: A Life in Modernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgMRDqgIbqEC&pg=PT19|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-4299-3974-4|pages=19}}</ref> He went first to [[Hall School (Hampstead)|Hall School]] in [[Hampstead]] and then at 13 to [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] and later Charlecote School in [[Worthing]], but he was unhappy there. On the death of his mother, he was transferred to [[University College School]] (Hampstead), which he later described as "that gentlest of schools".<ref name="Sutherland2005b">{{cite book|author=John Sutherland|title=Stephen Spender: A Literary Life|url=https://archive.org/details/stephenspenderli00suth|url-access=registration|date=6 January 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-517816-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stephenspenderli00suth/page/44 44]}}</ref> Spender left for [[Nantes]] and [[Lausanne]] and then went up to [[University College, Oxford]] (much later, in 1973, he was made an [[honorary fellow]]). Spender said at various times throughout his life that he never passed any exam. Perhaps his closest friend and the man who had the biggest influence on him was [[W. H. Auden]], who introduced him to [[Christopher Isherwood]]. Spender handprinted the earliest version of Auden's ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]''. He left Oxford without taking a degree and in 1929 moved to [[Hamburg]]. Isherwood invited him to Berlin. Every six months, Spender went back to England.

Spender was acquainted with fellow [[Auden Group]] members [[Louis MacNeice]], [[Edward Upward]] and [[Cecil Day-Lewis]]. He was friendly with [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] and later came to know [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Ted Hughes]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[F. T. Prince]] and [[T. S. Eliot]], as well as members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], particularly [[Virginia Woolf]].

==Career==
Spender began work on a novel in 1929, which was not published until 1988, under the title ''[[The Temple (novel)|The Temple]]''. The novel is about a young man who travels to Germany and finds a culture at once more open than England's, particularly about relationships between men, and shows frightening harbingers of Nazism that are confusingly related to the very openness the man admires. Spender wrote in his 1988 introduction:

<blockquote>In the late Twenties young English writers were more concerned with censorship than with politics.... 1929 was the last year of that strange Indian Summer—the Weimar Republic. For many of my friends and for myself, Germany seemed a paradise where there was no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom in their lives<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bozorth | first=Richard R. | title=But Who Would Get It?

Spender was discovered by [[T.S. Eliot]], an editor at [[Faber & Faber]], in 1933.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/faber-faber-by-toby-faber-review-the-inside-story-of-britains-most-illustrious-publishing-house-hlhk9chlb|title=Faber & Faber by Toby Faber review — the inside story of Britain's most illustrious publishing house|last=Walsh|first=Review by John|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=2019-05-05|access-date=2019-08-04|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

His early poetry, notably ''Poems'' (1933), was often inspired by social protest. Living in [[Vienna]], he further expressed his convictions in ''Forward from Liberalism''; in ''Vienna'' (1934), a long poem in praise of the [[July Putsch|1934 uprising]] of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austrian socialists]]; and in ''Trial of a Judge''<ref name="questia.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=28562871|title=Trial of a Judge: A Tragedy in Five Acts}}{{dl|date=July 2021}}</ref> (1938), an [[antifascist]] [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|drama in verse]].

At the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, which published the first edition of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', historic figures made rare appearances to read their work: [[Paul Valéry]], [[André Gide]] and Eliot. Hemingway even broke his rule of not reading in public if Spender would read with him. Since Spender agreed, Hemingway appeared for a rare reading in public with him.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEmg2ZGajiYC&q=Spender|title=Shakespeare and Company|last=Beach|first=Sylvia|date=1991|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803260979|pages=211|language=en}}</ref>

In 1936, Spender became a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. [[Harry Pollitt]], its head, invited him to write for the ''[[Daily Worker (UK)|Daily Worker]]'' on the [[Moscow Trials]]. In late 1936, Spender married [[Inez Pearn]], whom he had recently met at an Aid to Spain meeting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christopher and His Kind|last=Isherwood|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Isherwood|publisher=Vintage|year=2012|isbn=9780099561071}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/18/obituaries/stephen-spender-poet-of-melancholic-vision-and-social-conscience-dies-at-86.html|title=Stephen Spender, Poet of Melancholic Vision and Social Conscience, Dies at 86|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=18 July 1995|work=The New York Times|access-date=8 October 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> She is described as 'small and rather ironic' and 'strikingly good-looking'. In 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the ''Daily Worker'' sent him to Spain on a mission to observe and report on the Soviet ship ''Komsomol'', which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Spender travelled to [[Tangier]] and tried to enter Spain via [[Cadiz]], but was sent back. He then travelled to [[Valencia]], where he met Hemingway and [[Manuel Altolaguirre]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} (Tony Hyndman, alias Jimmy Younger, had joined the [[International Brigades]], which were fighting against [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Guadalajara]].) In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war, held in [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] and attended by many writers, including Hemingway, [[André Malraux]], and [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-141-01161-5 |page=678 |edition=50th Anniversary}}</ref> Pollitt told Spender "to go and get killed; we need a [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] in the movement".{{citation needed|date=May 2007}} Spender was imprisoned for a while in [[Albacete]]. In Madrid, he met Malraux; they discussed Gide's ''Retour de l'U.R.S.S.''. Because of medical problems, he went back to England and bought a house in [[Lavenham]]. In 1939, he divorced.

His 1938 translations of works by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Miguel Hernández]] appeared in [[John Lehmann]]'s ''New Writing''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XdWHPDGHkNcC&dq=%22john+lehmann%22+%22new+writing%22&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=7Yb_8GnoTG&sig=UOW_zfsg8oNLOZ8K9UPFiHUdv3k#PPR5,M1 ''New Writing'' at Google Books]. Retrieved 21 March 2009</ref>

He felt close to the Jewish people; his mother, Violet Hilda Schuster, was half-Jewish (her father's family were German Jews who converted to Christianity, and her mother came from an upper-class family of [[Catholic]] German, [[Lutheran]] Danish and distant Italian descent). Spender's second wife, [[Natasha Spender|Natasha]], whom he married in 1941, was also Jewish. In 1942, he joined the fire brigade of [[Cricklewood]] and Maresfield Gardens as a volunteer. Spender met several times with the poet [[Edwin Muir]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

After he was no longer left-wing, he was one of those who wrote of their disillusionment with communism in the essay collection ''[[The God that Failed]]'' (1949), along with [[Arthur Koestler]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7522|title=Stephen Spender|work=poetryarchive.org}}</ref> It is thought that one of the big areas of disappointment was the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the Soviet Union, which many leftists saw as a betrayal. Like Auden, Isherwood and several other outspoken opponents of fascism in the 1930s, Spender did not see active military service in [[World War II]]. He was initially graded "C" upon examination because of his earlier [[colitis]], poor eyesight, [[varicose veins]] and the long-term effects of a [[tapeworm]] in 1934. But he pulled strings to be re-examined and was upgraded to "B", which meant that he could serve in the London [[Auxiliary Fire Service]]. Spender spent the winter of 1940 teaching at [[Blundell's School]], taking a position that had been vacated by [[Manning Clark]], who returned to [[Australia]] as a consequence of the war to teach at [[Geelong Grammar]].<ref>Stephen Holt, ''Manning Clark and Australian History, 1915–1963'', St Lucia: UQP, 1982, p 60.</ref>

After the war, Spender was a member of the [[Allied Control Commission]], restoring civil authority in Germany.<ref name=odnb>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sutherland | first=John | encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title=Spender, Sir Stephen Harold (1909–1995) | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57986 | edition=online |date=September 2004 | publisher=Oxford University Press | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/57986 | access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref>

With [[Cyril Connolly]] and [[Peter Watson (arts benefactor)|Peter Watson]], Spender co-founded ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine and served as its editor from 1939 to 1941. From 1947 to 1949, he went to the US several times and saw Auden and Isherwood. He was the editor of ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine from 1953 to 1966 but resigned after it emerged that the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which published it, was covertly funded by the [[CIA]].<ref name="New Statesman">{{cite web | author=Frances Stonor Saunders | title=How the CIA plotted against us | work= New Statesman | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/199907120022 | date=12 July 1999 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111094740/http://www.newstatesman.com/199907120022 | access-date=21 December 2008| archive-date=11 November 2010 }}</ref> Spender insisted that he was unaware of the ultimate source of the magazine's funds. He taught at various American institutions and accepted the Elliston Chair of Poetry<ref>http://asweb.artsci.uc.edu/english/cw/elliston.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1954. In 1961, he became professor of [[rhetoric]] at [[Gresham College]], London.

Spender helped found the magazine ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', was involved in the founding of the [[Poetry Book Society]] and did work for [[UNESCO]].<ref>Warwick McFadyen, review of John Sutherland's biography ''Stephen Spender'', ''[[The Age]]'', p. 3 {{date missing|date=April 2018}}</ref> He was appointed the 17th [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1961–1970 | url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1961-1970.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | access-date=19 December 2008}}</ref> During the late 1960s, Spender frequently visited the [[University of Connecticut]], which he declared had the "most congenial teaching faculty" he had encountered in the United States.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|last=Sutherland|first=John|date=2004|title=Spender, Sir Stephen Harold (1909–1995), poet|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-57986|url-status=live|access-date=2021-02-21|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/57986|isbn=9780198614128}}</ref>

Spender was Professor of English at [[University College London]] from 1970 to 1977 and then became [[Professor Emeritus]]. He was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) at the 1962 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=42683 |supp=y|pages=4316–4317|date=25 May 1962}}</ref> and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=49375 |supp=y|pages=1–2|date=10 June 1983}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=49575|page=16802|date=20 December 1983}}</ref> At a ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of the [[Normandy Invasion]] on 6 June 1984, US President [[Ronald Reagan]] quoted from Spender's poem "The Truly Great" in his remarks:

<blockquote>Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's poem. You are men who in your "lives fought for life... and left the vivid air signed with your honor".</blockquote>

== World of art ==
Spender also had profound intellectual workings with the world of art, including [[Picasso]]. The artist [[Henry Moore]] did etchings and lithographs conceived to accompany the work of writers, including [[Charles Baudelaire]] and Spender. Moore's work in that regard also included illustrations of the literature of [[Dante]], Gide and Shakespeare. The exhibition was held at The Henry Moore Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.henry-moore.org/hmi/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2011/prints-and-portfolios|title=- Henry Moore: Prints and Portfolios|website=webarchive.henry-moore.org|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>

Spender "collected and befriended artists such as [[Jean Arp|Arp]], [[Frank Auerbach|Auerbach]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Bacon]], [[Lucian Freud|Freud]], [[Alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]], [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]], [[Philip Guston|Guston]], [[David Hockney|Hockney]], [[Henry Moore|Moore]], [[Giorgio Morandi|Morandi]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and others". In ''The Worlds of Stephen Spender'', the artist [[Frank Auerbach]] selected art work by those masters to accompany Spender's poems.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.artbook.com/9783906915197.html|title=The Worlds of Stephen Spender ARTBOOK {{!}} D.A.P. 2018 Catalog Hauser & Wirth Publishers Books Exhibition Catalogues 9783906915197}}</ref>

Spender wrote ''China Diary'' with [[David Hockney]] in 1982, published by [[Thames & Hudson|Thames and Hudson]] art publishers in London.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China diary: with 158 watercolours, drawings and photographs, 84 in colour|last1=Spender|first1=Stephen|last2=Hockney|first2=David|date=1982|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=9780500012901|location=London|language=en|oclc=490550105}}</ref>

The Soviet artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]] created an etching for Spender, ''Fraternity'', in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/s/ge/collection_ge/artist/artist_id-2981_role-1_sov_page-142.html|title=Vasily Kandinsky.

==Personal life==
In 1933, Spender fell in love with Tony Hyndman, and they lived together from 1935 to 1936.<ref name=odnb /> In 1934, Spender had an affair with [[Muriel Gardiner]]. In a letter to [[Christopher Isherwood]] in September 1934, he wrote, "I find boys much more attractive, in fact I am rather more than usually susceptible, but actually I find the actual sexual act with women more satisfactory, more terrible, more disgusting, and, in fact, more everything".<ref name=odnb /> In December 1936, shortly after the end of his relationship with Hyndman, Spender fell in love with and married [[Inez Pearn]] after an engagement of only three weeks.<ref name="Vicky Randall, Afterword">{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Lake|title=Spanish Portrait|publisher=[[The Clapton Press]], London|isbn=978-1-9996543-2-0|page=226|year=2019}}</ref> The marriage broke down in 1939.<ref name=odnb /> In 1941, Spender married [[Natasha Spender|Natasha Litvin]], a concert pianist. The marriage lasted until his death. Their daughter, [[Elizabeth Spender|Elizabeth "Lizzie" Spender]], previously an actor, is married to the Australian actor and satirist [[Barry Humphries]], and their son, [[Matthew Spender]], is married to the daughter of the Armenian artist [[Arshile Gorky]].

Spender's sexuality has been the subject of debate. Spender's seemingly changing attitudes have caused him to be labelled bisexual, repressed, latently homophobic or simply something complex that resists easy labelling.<ref name="glbtq">{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/spender_s.html|title=glbtq >> literature >> Spender, Sir Stephen|work=glbtq.com|access-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009223250/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/spender_s.html|archive-date=9 October 2014}}</ref> Many of his friends in his earlier years were gay. Spender had many affairs with men in his earlier years, most notably with Hyndman, who was called "Jimmy Younger" in his memoir ''World Within World''. After his affair with Muriel Gardiner, he shifted his focus to [[heterosexuality]],<ref name=odnb/> but his relationship with Hyndman complicated both that relationship and his short-lived marriage to Inez Pearn. His marriage to Natasha Litvin in 1941 seemed to have marked the end of his romantic relationships with men but not the end of all homosexual activity, as his unexpurgated diaries have revealed.<ref>[[Paul Kildea]], ''[[Benjamin Britten: A Life in the Twentieth Century]]'', p. 216</ref> Subsequently, he toned down homosexual allusions in later editions of his poetry. The following line was revised in a republished edition: "Whatever happens, I shall never be alone. I shall always have a boy, a railway fare, or a revolution" to "Whatever happens, I shall never be alone. I shall always have an affair, a railway fare, or a revolution". Nevertheless, he was a founding member of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], which lobbied for the repeal of British [[sodomy laws]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Twitchell |first1=Neville |title=The Politics of the Rope: The Campaign to Abolish Capital Punishment in Britain, 1955-1969 |date=2012 |publisher=Arena books |isbn=9781906791988 |page=311 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMkjUerXEsYC&q=Stephen+Spender+HLRS&pg=PA311 |access-date=4 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Spender sued author [[David Leavitt]] for allegedly using his relationship with "Jimmy Younger" in Leavitt's ''While England Sleeps'' in 1994. The case was settled out of court with Leavitt removing certain portions from his text.

==Death==
On 16 July 1995, Spender died of a heart attack in [[Westminster]], London, aged 86.<ref>Stephen Spender: A Literary Life</ref> He was buried in the graveyard of [[St Mary on Paddington Green Church]], in London.

==Stephen Spender Trust==
The Stephen Spender Trust is a registered charity that was founded to widen the knowledge of 20th-century literature, with a particular focus on Spender's circle of writers, and to promote literary translation. The trust's activities include poetry readings; academic conferences; a seminar series in partnership with the Institute of English Studies; an archive programme in conjunction with the British Library and the Bodleian; work with schools via Translation Nation; the Guardian Stephen Spender Prize, an annual poetry translation prize established in 2004; and the Joseph Brodsky/Stephen Spender Prize, a worldwide Russian–English translation competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephen-spender.org|title=The Stephen Spender Trust|work=stephen-spender.org}}</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Spender was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |access-date=3 December 2012}}</ref>
