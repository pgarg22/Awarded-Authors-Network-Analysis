==Life and career==
Osiecka was born in [[Warsaw]], the only child of Wiktor Osiecki, a pianist and composer of Serbian, Romanian-[[Vlachs|Vlach]] and Hungarian descent, and a scholar Maria Sztechman. She spent her early years in [[Zakopane]] where her father played the piano at the Watra Restaurant. After World War II the Osiecki family moved to Warsaw and settled in the [[Saska Kępa]] borough. The small flat soon became Osiecka’s favourite place to work. She lived there almost her entire life. After her death, the ''Okularnicy'' Foundation placed a commemorative plaque on the building.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/agnieszka-osiecka|title=Agnieszka Osiecka {{!}} Artist {{!}} Culture.pl|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}</ref>

Agnieszka was exceptionally gifted. She completed her coursework much more quickly than other students and graduated from Marie Skłodowska-Curie High School in 1952. She trained as a swimmer at Legia Sports Club and studied journalism at the [[University of Warsaw]] (1957–61) and film-directing at the prestigious [[National Film School in Łódź]] (1957–61) but dropped film-directing and started writing. Osiecka published essays and articles in the student press during her university years. She joined the famous [[Student Satirical Theatre]] (STS) in 1954 and wrote 166 political and lyrical songs for this company. She used to say "I am a journalist, that is why some of my songs are reports which rhyme." She served on the artistic board of the STS Theatre until it closed in 1972.<ref name=":0" />

1962 marked her debut on [[Polskie Radio|Polish National Radio]]. Renown Polish actress [[Kalina Jędrusik]] sang Osiecka's lyrics to a hit song by Franciszka Leszczyńska called "My First Ball" (''Mój pierwszy bal''). One year later at the first [[National Festival of Polish Song in Opole]] in 1963 Agnieszka achieved a major success winning the main prize and six other prizes for her lyrics: "Piosenka o Okularnikach“ (music by Jarosław Abram), as well as "Białe małżeństwo,“ "Czerwony kapturek,“ "Kochankowie z ulicy Kamiennej,“ "Solo na kontrabasie“ and "Ulice wielkich miast.“<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl/dlibra/text?id=about-archive|title=dLibra Digital Library|last=Center|first=PSNC, Poznan Supercomputer and Networking|website=www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>

She was now recognised as a prominent young poet and the Polish National Radio offered her a job to create and lead a team to broadcast ''The Radio Song Studio''. She also worked on theatre and television productions. Together with composer Adam Sławiński she wrote a series called "Listy śpiewające“ ("Singing Letters“). Her first major theatre show "Niech no tylko zakwitną jabłonie“ ("Let the Apple-trees Bloom") was staged at the [[Ateneum Theatre]].<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1985|title=Theatre in Poland 1984|journal=London Theatre Record|publisher=I. Herbert|volume=5|issue=1-13|pages=s.589}}</ref>

Her lyrics were set to music by such composers as [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Seweryn Krajewski]], [[Adam Sławiński]], [[Zygmunt Konieczny]], and others.

==Personal life==
Osiecka and her partner, the prominent journalist [[Daniel Passent]], had their only child, a daughter, [[Agata Passent|Agata]], in 1973.<ref name=":0" />

The [[Masurian Lake District]] was among Osiecka's favorite places in Poland. She liked to vacation there in the 1960s/70s with Polish intellectuals and artists. As a student she worked there for one of the local newspapers and in the autumn of her life she wrote for the [[Atelier Theatre]] in [[Sopot]]. She was a frequent visitor to the Halama writers' retreat house in [[Zakopane]], in the Tatra Mountains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl/dlibra/text?id=about-archive|title=dLibra Digital Library|last=Center|first=PSNC, Poznan Supercomputer and Networking|website=www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Osiecka published numerous books and released many records (see the full list at www.okularnicy.org.pl). She is considered one of the most important, prolific and gifted persons in postwar Polish culture and history. Osiecka died on 7 March 1997 after a battle of several years with  [[colon cancer]]. She is buried at the [[Powązki Cemetery]] in Warsaw.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13541404/agnieszka-osiecka|title=Agnieszka Osiecka (1936-1997) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>
