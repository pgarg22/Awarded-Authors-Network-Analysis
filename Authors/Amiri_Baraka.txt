'''Amiri Baraka''' (born '''Everett Leroy Jones'''; October 7, 1934 – January 9, 2014), previously known as '''LeRoi Jones''' and '''Imamu Amear Baraka''',<ref name="ShawAmearName2013" /> was an American writer of poetry, drama, fiction, essays and music criticism. He was the author of numerous books of poetry and taught at several universities, including the [[University at Buffalo]] and [[Stony Brook University]]. He received the [[PEN/Beyond Margins Award]] in 2008 for ''Tales of the Out and the Gone''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Book/Beyond Margins Award Winners |url=http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/929 |publisher=[[PEN American Center]] |access-date=July 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626212832/https://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/929 |archive-date=June 26, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Baraka's career spanned nearly 52 years, and his themes range from black liberation to white racism. Some poems that are always associated with him are "The Music: Reflection on Jazz and Blues", "The Book of Monk", and "New Music, New Poetry", works that draw on topics from the worlds of society, music, and literature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amiri Baraka |url=http://www.amiribaraka.com/ |department=AmiriBaraka.com |publisher=Celeste Bateman and Associates|access-date=November 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123181237/http://www.amiribaraka.com/ |archive-date=November 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Baraka's poetry and writing have attracted both high praise and condemnation. In the African-American community, some compare Baraka to [[James Baldwin]] and recognize him as one of the most respected and most widely published black writers of his generation.<ref name="Salaam, Kaluma 1997">Salaam, Kaluma.

Baraka's brief tenure as [[Poet Laureate of New Jersey]] (in 2002 and 2003) involved controversy over a public reading of his poem "Somebody Blew Up America?", which resulted in accusations of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and negative attention from critics and politicians.<ref name="yaledailynews.com">{{cite web|first=Katherine |last=Stevens |title=Baraka refutes criticism.

==Biographical information==

===Early life (1934–1965)===
Baraka was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Barringer High School]]. His father Coyt Leroy Jones worked as a postal supervisor and lift operator. His mother Anna Lois ([[married and maiden names|née]] Russ) was a social worker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2014/01/hold_hold_hold_amiri_baraka_dead_at_79.html#incart_maj-story-1 |title=Amiri Baraka, legendary poet who never abandoned Newark, dead at 79 |work=NJ.com |date=January 9, 2014 |access-date=January 10, 2014}}</ref> Jazz was something Baraka became interested in as a kid. He wanted to be just like [[Miles Davis]]. "I wanted to look like that too — that green shirt and rolled up sleeves on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]''...always wanted to look like that. And be able to play "[[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|On Green Dolphin Street]]" or "[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]" ... That gorgeous chilling sweet sound. That's the music you wanted playing when you was coming into a joint, or just looking up at the sky with your baby by your side, that mixture of America and them changes, them blue African magic chants." The influence of jazz can be seen throughout his work later in life.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/01/09/261101520/amiri-baraka-poet-and-co-founder-of-black-arts-movement-dies-at-79|title=Amiri Baraka's Legacy Both Controversial And Achingly Beautiful|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|date=January 9, 2014|website=NPR|access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref>

He won a scholarship to [[Rutgers University]] in 1951 but transferred in 1952 to [[Howard University]]. His classes in [[philosophy]] and [[religious studies]] helped lay a foundation for his later writings. He subsequently studied at [[Columbia University]] and [[The New School]] without taking a degree.

In 1954, he joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a gunner, reaching the rank of [[senior airman|sergeant]]. This was a decision he would come to regret. He once explained: "I found out what it was like to be under the direct jurisdiction of people who hated black people. I had never known that directly." This experience was yet another that influenced Baraka's later work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/arts/amiri-baraka-polarizing-poet-and-playwright-dies-at-79.html|title=Amiri Baraka, Polarizing Poet and Playwright, Dies at 79|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel|date=January 10, 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> His commanding officer received an anonymous letter accusing Baraka of being a [[communist]].<ref name="Black History in America">{{cite web

W. Norton & Company|year = 2014|location = New York|pages = 661}}</ref> While he was stationed in [[Puerto Rico]], he worked at the base library, which allowed him ample reading time, and it was here that, inspired by [[Beat Generation|Beat poets]] back in America, he began to write poetry.

The same year, he moved to [[Greenwich Village]], working initially in a warehouse of music records. His interest in [[jazz]] evolved during this period. It was also during this time that he came in contact with the avant-garde [[Black Mountain poets]] and [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets. In 1958 he married [[Hettie Jones|Hettie Cohen]], with whom he had two daughters, [[Kellie Jones]] (b. 1959) and [[Lisa Jones]] (b.1961). He and Hettie founded Totem Press, which published such Beat poets as [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref>Baraka himself said he was inspired by [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''Howl'', stating, "I had been moved by Howl because it talked about a world I could identify with and relate to... I thought ''Howl'' was something special.  It was a breakthrough for me.  I now knew poetry could be about things that I could relate to."{{Quote without source|date=April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 40547807|title = The Case of Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka|journal = Salmagundi|issue = 70/71|pages = 343–352|last1 = Early|first1 = Gerald|year = 1986}}</ref> In cooperation with Corinth, Totem published books by LeRoi Jones and [[Diane di Prima]], [[Ron Loewinsohn]], [[Michael McClure]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Paul Blackburn (U.S. poet)|Paul Blackburn]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]], [[Ed Dorn]], [[Joel Oppenheimer]] and [[Gilbert Sorrentino]] and an anthology of four young female poets, [[Carol Berge]], [[Barbara Moraff]], [[Rochelle Owens]], and [[Diane Wakoski]].

Baraka also worked as editor and critic for the literary and arts journal ''[[Kulchur]]'' (1960–65). With [[Diane di Prima]] he edited the first twenty-five issues (1961–63) of their small magazine ''The Floating Bear''.<ref name=Cary /> In October 1961, the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|U.S. Postal Service]] seized ''The Floating Bear #9''; the FBI charged them for obscenity over [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]]' piece "Roosevelt after the Inauguration".<ref name="Harrison 2014 357–374"/> In the autumn of 1961 he co-founded the [[New York Poets Theatre]] with di Prima, the choreographers [[Fred Herko]] and [[James Waring]], and the actor Alan S. Marlowe. He had an extramarital affair with di Prima for several years; their daughter, Dominique di Prima, was born in June 1962.

Baraka visited Cuba in July 1960 with a [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]] delegation and reported his impressions in his essay "Cuba Libre".<ref>The Fair Play for Cuba Committee was brought to nationwide attention through an April 1960 advertisement in ''[[The New York Times]]'' funded by Castro. FPCC's founder and first leader was [[CBS]] newsman [[Robert Taber (author)|Robert Taber]]. The FPCC fast had 7,000 members in 25 "adult chapters" and 40 "student councils". The July trip included the writers [[Julian Mayfield]] and [[Harold Cruse]], the historian [[John Henrik Clarke]] and the militant [[NAACP]] leader [[Robert F. Williams]]. In December 1960, a delegation of 326 members of the FPCC visited the island. "Cuba Libre" was first published in the ''[[Evergreen Review]]'', Vol. 4, No. 15, November–December 1960.</ref> There he encountered openly rebellious artists who declared him to be a "cowardly bourgeois individualist"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|last = Gates|year = 2014|pages = 662}}</ref> more focused on building his reputation than trying to help those who were enduring oppression. This encounter led to a dramatic change in his writing and goals, causing him to become emphatic about supporting black nationalism.

In 1961 Baraka co-authored a "Declaration of Conscience" in support of [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime.<ref>The "Declaration of Conscience" was written and signed by [[Margaret Randall]], [[Abdallah Schleifer|Marc Schleifer]] (now a Jewish convert to Islam), [[Elaine de Kooning]], LeRoi Jones, Diane di Prima, [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], and [[Norman Mailer]] and published in the ''[[Monthly Review]]''.</ref> Baraka also was a member of the [[Umbra poets|Umbra Poets Workshop]] of emerging Black Nationalist writers ([[Ishmael Reed]] and [[Lorenzo Thomas (poet)|Lorenzo Thomas]], among others) on the [[Lower East Side]] (1962–65).

His first book of poems, ''Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note,'' was published in 1961. Baraka's article "The Myth of a 'Negro Literature'" (1962) stated that "a Negro literature, to be a legitimate product of the Negro experience in America, must get at that experience in exactly the terms America has proposed for it in its most ruthless identity". He also stated in the same work that as an element of American culture, the Negro was entirely misunderstood by Americans. The reason for this misunderstanding and for the lack of black literature of merit was, according to Jones:

{{quote|In most cases the Negroes who found themselves in a position to pursue some art, especially the art of literature, have been members of the Negro middle class, a group that has always gone out of its way to cultivate any mediocrity, as long as that mediocrity was guaranteed to prove to America, and recently to the world at large, that they were not really who they were, i.e., Negroes.}}

As long as black writers were obsessed with being an accepted middle class, Baraka wrote, they would never be able to speak their mind, and that would always lead to failure.  Baraka felt that America only made room for white obfuscators, not black ones.<ref name="Martin, Reginald 1995">Martin, Reginald (1995).

(2002).''Modern American Poetry: An Online Journal and Multimedia Companion to Anthology of Modern American Poetry''. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</ref>

In 1963 Baraka (under the name LeRoi Jones) published ''[[Blues People|Blues People: Negro Music in White America]]'', his account of the development of black music from slavery to contemporary jazz.<ref name="Amiri Baraka 1934-2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/amiri-baraka|title=Amiri Baraka 1934-2014|website=poetryfoundation.org|publisher=Poetry Foundation|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> When the work was re-issued in 1999, Baraka wrote in the Introduction that he wished to show that "The music was the score, the actually expressed creative orchestration, reflection of Afro-American life ... That the music was explaining the history as the history was explaining the music. And that both were expressions of and reflections of the people."<ref>Jones, LeRoi (2002). ''Blues People: Negro Music in White America''. Harper Perennial. pp. ix–x.</ref> He argued that though the slaves had brought their musical traditions from Africa, the blues were an expression of what black people became in America: "The way I have come to think about it, blues could not exist if the African captives had not become American captives."<ref>Jones, LeRoi (2002). ''Blues People''. p. 17.</ref>

Baraka (under the name LeRoi Jones) wrote an acclaimed, controversial play titled ''[[Dutchman (play)|Dutchman]]'', in which a white woman accosts a black man on the [[New York City Subway]]. The play premiered in 1964 and received the [[Obie Award]] for Best American Play in the same year.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/8382/dutchman| title = Dutchman| access-date = January 11, 2014| publisher = SamuelFrench.com}}</ref> A film of the play, directed by [[Anthony Harvey]], was released in 1967.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060358/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1| title = Dutchman| date = February 1968| access-date = January 11, 2014| publisher = IMDb.com}}</ref> The play has been revived several times, including a 2013 production staged in the Russian and Turkish Bathhouse in the [[East Village, Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/theater/barakas-dutchman-to-be-staged-in-a-bathhouse.html?hpw&_r=0| title = A Play That's Sure to Make You Sweat| author = Kennedy, Randy| date = October 31, 2013| access-date = January 11, 2014| newspaper = The New York Times}}</ref>

After the assassination of [[Malcolm X]] in 1965, Baraka changed his name from LeRoi Jones to Amiri Baraka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/amiri-baraka-9198235#political-activism|title=Amiri Baraka|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>  At this time, he also left his wife and their two children and moved to [[Harlem]], where he founded the Black Arts Repertory/Theater School (BARTS) since the [[Black Arts Movement]] created a new visual representation of art. However, the Black Arts Repertory Theater School remained open for less than a year. In its short time BARTS attracted many well-known artists, including [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Sun Ra]] and [[Albert Ayler]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackpower.web.unc.edu/2017/04/black-arts-repertory-theatre-and-school-barts-and-the-black-arts-movement/|title=Black Arts Repertory Theatre and School (BARTS) and the Black Arts Movement – Black Power in American Memory|website=blackpower.web.unc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> The Black Arts Repertory Theater School's closure prompted conversation with many other black artists who wanted to create similar institutions. Consequently, there was a surge in the establishment of these institutions in many places across the United States. In December 1965<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/blackarts/historical.htm|title=Historical Overviews of the Black Arts Movement|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> Baraka moved back to Newark after allegations surfaced that he was using federal antipoverty welfare funds for his theater.<ref name="amiri 1"/>

Baraka became a leading advocate and theorist for the burgeoning black art during this time.<ref name="Amiri Baraka 1934-2014"/> Now a "black cultural nationalist", he broke away from the predominantly white Beats and became critical of the pacifist and integrationist [[Civil Rights Movement]]. His revolutionary poetry became more controversial.<ref name=Cary /> A poem such as "Black Art" (1965), according to [[Werner Sollors]] of [[Harvard University]], expressed Baraka's need to commit the violence required to "establish a Black World".<ref>Sollors, Werner (1978). ''Amiri Baraka / LeRoi Jones: The Quest for a "Populist Modernism".'' Columbia University Press.</ref>

Baraka even uses [[onomatopoeia]] in "Black Art" to express that need for violence: "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ... tuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuht{{nbsp}}..." More specifically, lines in "Black Art" such as "Let there be no love poems written / until love can exist freely and cleanly", juxtaposed with "We want a black poem. / And a Black World", demonstrate Baraka's cry for political justice during a time when racial injustice was rampant, despite the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|title=Anthology of Modern American Poetry|date=2000|pages=998–999}}</ref>

"Black Art" quickly became the major poetic manifesto of the Black Arts Literary Movement, and in it, Jones declaimed, "we want poems that kill", which coincided with the rise of armed self-defense and slogans such as "Arm yourself or harm yourself" that promoted confrontation with the white power structure.<ref name="Salaam, Kaluma 1997"/> Rather than use poetry as an escapist mechanism, Baraka saw poetry as a weapon of action.<ref name="Harris, William J 1985">Harris, William J. (1985). ''The Poetry and Poetics of Amiri Baraka: The Jazz Aesthetic''. University of Missouri Press.</ref>

In April 1965, Baraka's "A Poem for Black Hearts" was published as a direct response to Malcolm X's assassination, and it further exemplifies the poet's uses of poetry to generate anger and endorse rage against oppression.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Poem for Black Hearts|url=https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2013.124.3|website=National Museum of African American History and Culture|publisher=Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> Like many of his poems, it showed no remorse in its use of raw emotion to convey its message.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sommers|first1=Ephraim Scott|title=The Poem of Anger: Amiri Baraka, Tory Dent, and Adrian C. Louis|journal=Cream City Review|date=2016|volume=20|issue=2 |pages=40–63|doi=10.1353/ccr.2016.0054}}</ref> It was published in the September issue of ''[[Negro Digest]]'' and was one of the first responses to Malcolm's death to be exposed to the public.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rambsy|first1=H|title=An early poem for Malcolm X|url=http://www.culturalfront.org/2015/09/an-early-poem-for-malcolm-x.html|website=Cultural Front|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> The poem is directed particularly at black men, and it scoldingly labels them "faggots" in order to challenge them to act and continue the fallen activist's fight against the white establishment.

Baraka also promoted theatre as a training for the "real revolution" yet to come, with the arts being a way to forecast the future as he saw it. In "The Revolutionary Theatre", Baraka wrote, "We will scream and cry, murder, run through the streets in agony, if it means some soul will be moved."<ref name=Norton542>{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|last = Gates|year = 2014|pages = 542}}</ref> In opposition to the peaceful protests inspired by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Baraka believed that a physical uprising must follow the literary one.

Baraka's decision to leave Greenwich Village in 1965 was an outgrowth of his response to the debate about the future of black liberation.<ref name="Miller 1986" />

===1966–1980===
In 1966, Baraka married his second wife, Sylvia Robinson, who later adopted the name Amina Baraka.<ref>See back cover of his book ''Funk Lore''.</ref> The two would open a facility in Newark known as Spirit House, a combination playhouse and artists' residence.<ref name="amiri 1">{{cite web|title=Amiri Baraka, legendary poet who never abandoned Newark, dead at 79|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2014/01/hold_hold_hold_amiri_baraka_dead_at_79.html|website=nj.com|access-date=18 June 2016|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> In 1967, he lectured at [[San Francisco State University]]. The year after, he was arrested in Newark for having allegedly carried an illegal weapon and resisting arrest during the [[1967 Newark riots]]. He was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison.  His poem "Black People", published in the ''[[Evergreen Review]]'' in December 1967, was read by the judge in court,<ref>Watts, Jerry, "Amiri Baraka: The Politics and Art of a Black Intellectual", p. 299.</ref> including the memorable phrase: ''"All the stores will open if you say the magic words. The magic words are: "Up against the wall motherfucker this is a stick up!"''<ref>A phrase co-opted by the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and used as a slogan by other radical groups.</ref> Shortly afterward an appeals court reversed the sentence based on his defense by attorney [[Raymond A. Brown]].<ref>Berger, Joseph, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/nyregion/12brown.html "Raymond A. Brown, Civil Rights Lawyer, Dies at 94"], ''The New York Times'', October 11, 2009. Accessed October 12, 2009.</ref> He later joked that he was charged with holding "two revolvers and two poems".<ref name=Norton542 />

Not long after the 1967 riots, Baraka generated controversy when he went on the radio with a Newark police captain and [[Anthony Imperiale]], a politician and private business owner, and the three of them blamed the riots on "white-led, so-called radical groups" and "Communists and the [[Trotskyite]] persons".<ref>Ronald Porambo, ''No Cause for Indictment; An Autopsy of Newark'', New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971.</ref> That same year his second book of jazz criticism, ''Black Music'', came out. It was a collection of previously published [[music journalism]], including the seminal ''Apple Cores'' columns from ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine. Around this time he also formed a record label called Jihad, which produced and issued only three LPs, all released in 1968:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birkajazz.com/archive/variousUS_2.htm|title=Various US labels (2) - jazz album covers|publisher=Birkajazz.com|access-date=December 14, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Sonny's Time Now]]'' with [[Sunny Murray]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], [[Lewis Worrell]], [[Henry Grimes]], and Baraka; ''[[A Black Mass]]'', featuring [[Sun Ra]]; and ''Black & Beautiful – Soul & Madness'' by the Spirit House Movers, on which Baraka reads his poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustygroove.com/item/500409|title=Spirit House Movers (Jihad) : Black & Beautiful – Soul & Madness (CD)|author=Spirit House Movers (Jihad)|work=Dusty Groove|access-date=December 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://ajbenjamin2beta.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/jihad-records.html "Jihad Records"], Nothing Is V2.0, November 24, 2008.</ref>

In 1967, Baraka (still LeRoi Jones) visited [[Maulana Karenga]] in Los Angeles and became an advocate of his philosophy of [[Kawaida]], a multifaceted, categorized activist philosophy that produced the "Nguzo Saba", [[Kwanzaa]], and an emphasis on African names.<ref name="Salaam, Kaluma 1997"/> It was at this time that he adopted the name ''Imamu Amear Baraka''.<ref name="ShawAmearName2013" /> ''Imamu'' is a [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] title for "spiritual leader", derived from the Arabic word ''[[Imam]]'' (إمام). According to Shaw, he dropped the honorific ''Imamu'' and eventually changed ''Amear'' (which means "Prince") to ''Amiri''.<ref name="ShawAmearName2013" /> 
''[[Barakah|Baraka]]'' means "blessing, in the sense of divine favor".<ref name="ShawAmearName2013" />

In 1970 he strongly supported [[Kenneth A. Gibson]]'s candidacy for mayor of Newark; Gibson was elected as the city's first African-American mayor.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Baraka courted controversy by penning some strongly [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Jewish]] poems and articles with a stance similar to the stance at that time of the [[Nation of Islam]]. Historian Melani McAlister points to an example of this writing: "In the case of Baraka, and in many of the pronouncements of the NOI [Nation of Islam], there is a profound difference, both qualitative and quantitative, in the ways that white ethnicities were targeted. For example, in one well-known poem, ''Black Arts'' [originally published in ''The Liberator'' January 1966], Baraka made offhand remarks about several groups, commenting in the violent rhetoric that was often typical of him, that ideal poems would 'knockoff ... dope selling wops' and suggesting that cops should be killed and have their 'tongues pulled out and sent to Ireland.' But as Baraka himself later admitted [in his piece ''I was an AntiSemite'' published by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' on December 20, 1980, vol. 1], he held a specific animosity for Jews, as was apparent in the different intensity and viciousness of his call in the same poem for 'dagger poems' to stab the 'slimy bellies of the ownerjews' and for poems that crack 'steel knuckles in a jewlady's mouth.'"<ref>{{cite journal|title=One Black Allah: The Middle East in the Cultural Politics of African American Liberation, 1955-1970|author=Melani McAlister|journal=American Quarterly|volume=51| number=3|page=646|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=September 1999}}</ref>

Prior to this time, Baraka prided himself on being a forceful advocate of black cultural nationalism; however, by the mid-1970s, he began finding its racial individuality confining.<ref name=Cary /> Baraka's separation from the Black Arts Movement began because he saw certain black writers – capitulationists, as he called them – countering the Black Arts Movement that he created.  He believed that the groundbreakers in the Black Arts Movement were doing something that was new, needed, useful, and black, and those who did not want to see a promotion of black expression were "appointed" to the scene to damage the movement.<ref name="Martin, Reginald 1995"/>

In 1974, Baraka distanced himself from [[Black nationalism]], embracing [[Marxism-Leninism]] in the context of [[Maoism|Maoist third-world liberation movements]].<ref name="Miller 1986">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=James A.|title="I Investigate the Sun": Amiri Baraka in the 1980s|journal=Callaloo|date=1986|issue=26|pages=184–192|doi=10.2307/2931086|jstor=2931086}}</ref>

In 1979, he became a lecturer in the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]]'s Africana Studies Department in the College of Arts and Sciences at the behest of faculty member Leslie Owens. Articles about Baraka appeared in the University's print media from ''Stony Brook Press'', ''Blackworld'', and other student campus publications. These articles included a page-one exposé of his positions in the inaugural issue of ''Stony Brook Press'' on October 25, 1979, discussing his protests "against what he perceived as racism in the Africana Studies Department, as evidenced by a dearth of tenured professors". Shortly thereafter, Baraka took a [[tenure-track]] assistant professorship at Stony Brook in 1980 to assist "the struggling Africana Studies Department"; in 1983, he was promoted to [[associate professor]] and earned tenure.<ref name=Stony>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/features-baraka.html#.VfbhwxFVhHw|title=Poet, Playwright and Political Activist Amiri Baraka (1934-2014) Taught at Stony Brook|publisher=Stony Brook University|access-date=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081719/http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/features-baraka.html#.VfbhwxFVhHw#.VfbhwxFVhHw|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In June 1979 Baraka was arrested and jailed at Eighth Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Different accounts emerged around the arrest, yet all sides agree that Baraka and his wife, Amina, were in their car arguing over the cost of their children's shoes. The police version of events holds that they were called to the scene after a report of an assault in progress. They maintain that Baraka was striking his wife, and when they moved to intervene, he attacked them as well, whereupon they used the necessary force to subdue him. Amina's account contrasted with that of the police; she held a news conference the day after the arrest accusing the police of lying. A grand jury dismissed the assault charge, but the resisting arrest charge moved forward.<ref name=Delays>{{cite news|title=Judge Delays Ruling for a Month on Sentencing of Imamu Baraka|date=February 24, 1981|publisher=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/24/nyregion/judge-delays-ruling-for-a-month-on-sentencing-of-imamu-baraka.html}}</ref> In November 1979 after a seven-day trial, a criminal court jury found Baraka guilty of resisting arrest. A month later he was sentenced to 90 days at [[Rikers Island]] (the maximum he could have been sentenced to was one year). Amina declared that her husband was "a political prisoner". Baraka was released after a day in custody pending his appeal. At the time it was noted that if he was kept in prison, "he would be unable to attend a reception at the [[White House]] in honor of American poets." Baraka's appeal continued up to the State Supreme Court. During the process his lawyer [[William M. Kunstler]] told the press Baraka "feels it's the responsibility of the writers of America to support him across the board". Backing for his attempts to have the sentence cancelled or reduced came from "letters of support from elected officials, artists and teachers around the country".<ref name=Delays/> Amina Baraka continued to advocate for her husband and at one press conference stated, "Fascism is coming and soon the secret police will shoot our children down in the streets."<ref>{{cite news|title=TV: Documentary Film Examines Amiri Baraka|author=John Corry|date=June 28, 1983|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/movies/tv-documentary-film-examines-amiri-baraka.html|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In December 1981 Judge Benrard Fried ruled against Baraka and ordered him to report to Rikers Island to serve his sentence on weekends occurring between January 9, 1982, and November 6, 1982.

===1980–2014===
In 1980 Baraka published an essay in the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' that was titled ''Confessions of a Former Anti-Semite''. Baraka insisted that a ''Village Voice'' editor titled it and not himself. In the essay Baraka went over his life history, including his marriage to Hettie Cohen, who was Jewish. He stated that after the assassination of Malcolm X he found himself thinking, "As a Black man married to a white woman, I began to feel estranged from her ... How could someone be married to the enemy?"  He eventually divorced Hettie and left her with their two bi-racial daughters. In the essay Baraka went on to say

<blockquote>We also know that much of the vaunted Jewish support of Black civil rights organizations was in order to use them. Jews, finally, are white, and suffer from the same kind of white chauvinism that separates a great many whites from Black struggle. ... these Jewish intellectuals have been able to pass over into the Promised Land of American privilege.</blockquote>

In the essay he also defended his position against Israel, saying, "Zionism is a form of racism." Near the end of the essay Baraka stated the following:

<blockquote>Anti-Semitism is as ugly an idea and as deadly as white racism and Zionism ...As for my personal trek through the wasteland of anti-Semitism, it was momentary and never completely real. ... I have written only one poem that has definite aspects of anti-Semitism...and I have repudiated it as thoroughly as I can.<ref name=Hansen>{{cite news|date=October 17, 2002|title=Amiri Baraka stands by his words|author=Suzy Hansen|url=http://www.salon.com/2002/10/17/baraka_2/|work=Salon}}</ref></blockquote>

The poem Baraka referenced was "For Tom Postell, Dead Black Poet", which contained lines including

<blockquote>...Smile jew. Dance, jew. Tell me you love me, jew. I got something for you ... I got the extermination blues, jewboys. I got the [[Adolf Hitler|hitler]] syndrome figured ... So come for the rent, jewboys ... one day, jewboys, we all, even my wig wearing mother gonna put it on you all at once.<ref name="Watts" /><ref name=Hansen/></blockquote>

During the 1982–83 academic year, Baraka returned to Columbia University as a visiting professor, teaching a course entitled "Black Women and Their Fictions". After becoming a full professor of African Studies at Stony Brook in 1985, Baraka took an indefinite visiting appointment in Rutgers University's English department in 1988; over the next two years, he taught a number of courses in African American literature and music. Although Baraka sought a permanent, tenured appointment at the rank of full professor in early 1990 (in part due to the proximity between the University's campus in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] and his home in Newark), he did not attain the requisite two-thirds majority of the senior faculty in a contentious 9–8 vote that favored his appointment. Baraka would go on to collectively liken the committee to an "[[Ivy League]] [[Goebbels]]" while also characterizing the senior faculty as "powerful [[Klansmen]]", leading to a condemnation from department chair Barry Qualls.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hanley, Robert |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/11/nyregion/rutgers-students-sit-in-turns-mellow.html |title=Rutgers Students' Sit-In Turns Mellow |work=The New York Times |date=May 11, 1990 |access-date=January 10, 2014}}</ref> Thereafter, Baraka was nominally affiliated with Stony Brook as [[professor emeritus]] of Africana Studies until his death. In 1987, together with [[Maya Angelou]] and [[Toni Morrison]], he was a speaker at the commemoration ceremony for [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]].

In 1989 Baraka won an [[American Book Award]] for his works as well as a Langston Hughes Award. In 1990 he co-authored the autobiography of [[Quincy Jones]], and in 1998 he was a supporting actor in [[Warren Beatty]]'s film ''[[Bulworth]]''. In 1996, Baraka contributed to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

In July 2002, Baraka was named [[Poet Laureate of New Jersey]] by Governor [[Jim McGreevey]]. The position was to be for two years and came with a $10,000 stipend.<ref name=Sutherland>{{cite news|title=How the governor of New Jersey appointed a radical poet laureate - and immediately wished he hadn't|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=January 27, 2003|author=John Sutherland}}</ref> Baraka held the post for a year, during which time he was mired in controversy, including substantial political pressure and public outrage demanding his resignation. During the [[Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival]] in [[Stanhope, New Jersey]], Baraka read his 2001 poem on the [[September 11th attacks]] "Somebody Blew Up America?", which was criticized for anti-Semitism and attacks on public figures. Because there was no mechanism in the law to remove Baraka from the post, and he refused to step down, the position of state poet laureate was officially abolished by the State Legislature and Governor McGreevey.<ref>[http://startouch.thestar.com/screens/7e829725-1f15-450c-b640-aaf0c0342443%7C_0.html "The bizzaro history of the poet laureate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105180041/http://startouch.thestar.com/screens/7e829725-1f15-450c-b640-aaf0c0342443%7C_0.html |date=November 5, 2016 }}.

==Controversies==

=== White people ===

The following is from a 1965 essay:

<blockquote>Most American white men are trained to be fags. For this reason it is no wonder their faces are weak and blank ... The average ofay [white person] thinks of the black man as potentially raping every white lady in sight. Which is true, in the sense that the black man should want to rob the white man of everything he has. But for most whites the guilt of the robbery is the guilt of rape. That is, they know in their deepest hearts that they should be robbed, and the white woman understands that only in the rape sequence is she likely to get cleanly, viciously popped.<ref>Watts (2001), ''Amiri Baraka: The Politics and Art of a Black Intellectual'', p. 332.</ref></blockquote>

In 2009, he was again asked about the quote, and placed it in a personal and political perspective:

<blockquote>Those quotes are from the essays in ''Home'', a book written almost fifty years ago. The anger was part of the mindset created by, first, the [[assassination of John Kennedy]], followed by the assassination of [[Patrice Lumumba]], followed by the assassination of [[Malcolm X]] amidst the lynching, and national oppression. A few years later, the [[assassination of Martin Luther King]] and [[Assassination of Robert Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]]. What changed my mind was that I became a Marxist, after recognizing classes within the Black community and the class struggle even after we had worked and struggled to elect the first Black Mayor of Newark, [[Kenneth A. Gibson|Kenneth Gibson]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/art-is-a-weapon-in-the-struggle-of-ideas-an-interview-with-amiri-baraka/ |title=Art is a Weapon in the Struggle of Ideas: Interviewing Amiri Baraka |first=Sophie |last= Erskine |date=June 4, 2009 |journal=[[3:AM Magazine]] |access-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

=== September 11 attacks ===
In July 2002, ten months after the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], Baraka wrote a poem entitled "Somebody Blew Up America?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiribaraka.com/blew.html |title=Amiri Baraka-Bio |publisher=Amiribaraka.com |access-date=December 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929214214/http://www.amiribaraka.com/blew.html |archive-date=September 29, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> that was accused of antisemitism and met with harsh criticism. The poem is highly critical of [[racism]] in America, and includes humorous depictions of public figures such as [[Trent Lott]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. It also contains lines claiming Israel's knowledge of the World Trade Center attacks:

{{poemquote|
Who know why Five Israelis was filming the explosion
And cracking they sides at the notion
...
Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed
Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers
To stay home that day
Why did Sharon stay away?}}

Baraka said that he believed Israelis and President [[George W. Bush]] had advance knowledge of the September 11 attacks,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBprLf8o9Tk |title=Amiri Baraka vs Connie Chung – CNN, October 2002 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=April 28, 2011 |access-date=January 10, 2014}}</ref> citing what he described as information that had been reported in the American and Israeli press and on Jordanian television.  Baraka himself denied that the poem is antisemitic due to the use of word Israeli rather than Jewish.<ref name="Salon911">{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Suzy |title=Amiri Baraka stands by his words |url=https://www.salon.com/2002/10/17/baraka_2/ |access-date=12 August 2021 |work=Salon |date=17 October 2002}}</ref><ref name="yaledailynews.com"/><ref name="query.nytimes.com"/> 

However, antisemitism watchdog organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) denounced the poem as antisemitic. The ADL noted that the "4000 workers" conspiracy theory had initially referred to Jews writ large<ref>{{cite news |last1=Grant |first1=Linda |title=The hate that will not die |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/18/september11.israel |work=The Guardian |date=18 December 2011}}</ref> and that Baraka was using a [[Anti-Zionism#Conspiracy_theories|common antisemitic tactic]] of replacing references to Jews writ large with references to Israel and then claiming a comment is merely anti-Zionist. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/anti_semitism/baraka_words.asp|title=Amiri Baraka: a long history of hostility to Jews and Jewish concerns|publisher=Adl.org|access-date=December 14, 2014}}</ref>

After the poem's publication, then-governor [[Jim McGreevey]] tried to remove Baraka from the post of Poet Laureate of New Jersey, to which he had been appointed following [[Gerald Stern]] in July 2002. McGreevey learned that there was no legal way, according to the law authorizing and defining the position, to remove Baraka. On October 17, 2002, legislation to abolish the post was introduced in the State Senate and subsequently signed by Governor McGreevey, becoming effective July 2, 2003.<ref>New Jersey State Legislature, Laws of the State of New Jersey, P.L.2003, c.123.</ref>

Baraka ceased being poet laureate when the law became effective. In response to legal action filed by Baraka, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] ruled that state officials were immune from such suits, and in November 2007 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to hear an appeal of the case.<ref>Via [[Associated Press]].

==Honors and awards==
Baraka served as the second [[Poet Laureate of New Jersey]] from July 2002 until the position was abolished on July 2, 2003.  In response to the attempts to remove Baraka as the state's Poet Laureate, a nine-member advisory board named him the poet laureate of the [[Newark Public Schools]] in December 2002.<ref>Jacobs, Andrew.

== Legacy and influence ==
Despite numerous controversies and polarizing content of his work, Baraka's literary influence is undeniable. His co-founding of the Black Arts Movement in the 1960s promoted a uniquely black nationalist perspective and influenced an entire literary generation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6761684|title=Author Amiri Baraka: 'Tales of the Out & Gone'|last=Chideya|first=Farai|date=January 9, 2007|website=NPR|access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref> Critic Naila Keleta-Mae argues that Baraka's legacy is one of "saying the unsayable", a course that likely damaged his own literary reputation and canonization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keleta-Mae|first=Naila|date=2016|title=Amiri Baraka: A Lifetime of Saying the Unsayable|journal=Canadian Review of American Studies|volume=46|issue=2|pages=265–279|doi=10.3138/cras.2015.005|s2cid=163879105}}</ref> For example, Baraka was left out of the 2013 anthology ''Angles of Ascent'', a collection of contemporary African American poetry published by Norton. In a review of the anthology, Baraka, himself, criticized editor Charles H. Rowell's hostility towards the Black Arts Movement, calling Rowell's "attempt to analyze and even compartmentalize" contemporary African American poetry as "flawed".<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Rutter|first=Emily Ruth|date=Winter 2016|title=Contested Lineages: Fred Moten, Terrance Hayes, and the Legacy of Amiri Baraka|journal=African American Review|volume=49|issue=4|pages=329–342|doi=10.1353/afa.2016.0050|s2cid=164811231}}</ref> Indeed, Rowell's introduction to ''Angles of Ascent'' references the "fetters of narrow political and social demands that have nothing to do with the production of artistic texts", evincing a political/apolitical dichotomy where the editor considers overly political works of lesser artistic value. Critic Emily Ruth Rutter recognizes the contribution to African American literary studies of ''Angles of Ascent'' yet also proposes adding Baraka and others to ensure students do not "unknowingly accept" the notion that Baraka and writers like him were somehow absent from influencing twenty-first century poetry.<ref name=":2" /> 

In ''[[Rain Taxi]]'', Richard Oyama criticized Baraka's militant aesthetic, writing that Baraka's "career came to represent a cautionary tale of the worst 'tendencies' of the 1960s—the alienating rejections, the fanatical self-righteousness, the impulse toward separatism and Stalinist repression versus multi-racial/class coalition-building ... In the end, Baraka's work suffered because he preferred ideology over art, forgetting the latter outlasts us all."<ref>Oyama, Richard, [http://www.raintaxi.com/on-amiri-baraka-who-was-that-masked-man/ "On Amiri Bakara: Who Was That Masked Man?"] ''Rain Taxi'', Summer 2014.</ref>

Baraka's participation in a diverse array of artistic genres combined with his own social activism allowed him to have a wide range of influence. When discussing his influence in an interview with NPR, Baraka stressed that he had influenced numerous people. When asked what he would write for his own epitaph, he quipped, "We don't know if he ever died",<ref name=":1" /> evincing the personal importance of his own legacy to him. NPR's obituary for Baraka describes the depths of his influence simply: "...throughout his life – the Black Arts Movement never stopped".<ref name=":0" /> Baraka's influence also extends to the publishing world, where some writers credit him with opening doors to white publishing houses which African American writers previously had been unable to access.<ref name="Amiri Baraka 1934-2014" />
