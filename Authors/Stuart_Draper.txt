==Career==
===As playwright===
Works include the 2006 performance at the [[South London Theatre]] in March and then the [[Greenwich Playhouse]] of which ''Indie London'' wrote, "This follows its success, not only with audiences but also with critics, when it was performed by the South London Youth Theatre in March this year",<ref>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/stay-with-me-greenwich-playhouse Indie London], "Stay With Me - Greenwich Playhouse", accessed 23 February 2009</ref>

An adaptation of ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'',<ref name=GDN/><ref name=guide/> of which ''Gaydar Nation'' wrote, "Adapted by director, Stuart Draper this colourful new version of William Shakespeare's ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona|Gentlemen of Verona]]'' sees a brace of clowns, a dog, a troupe of gay bandits and four star-crossed, mismatched lovers battling for love and honour under the Mediterranean sun."<ref name=GDN/>

''[[To W.H.]]'',<ref name=guide/><ref>[http://www.dynamiclisting.com/dl/page.php?page=greenroom&story=E8821145616034 UK Theatre Web] (21 April 2006), UKTW Review of Stuart Draper and ''[[To W.H.]]'', accessed 22 January 2009</ref> of which ''Indie London'' wrote, "''To W.H.'' combines the soul and passion of Shakespeare’s sonnets (the majority of which were written to a Mr W.H.) with the exuberance and bawdiness that characterise his most exciting comedies",<ref>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/to-wh-the-hobgoblin Indie London], "To W.H. - The Hobgoblin", accessed 23 January 2009</ref> ''[[The Stage]]'' wrote, "Stuart Draper’s new play, in which he also stars, runs with the theory that the initials were those of William Herbert, future Earl of Pembroke", and " his Bard is besotted with the young nobleman when they first meet and, though Herbert is 20 years his junior, they go on to have a full blown affair",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/12359/to-wh |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612034855/http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/12359/to-wh |archive-date=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and ''UK Theatre Web'' wrote, "Stuart Draper has written a pacy romp which interlaces a large amount of Shakespeare’s writing. There are weaknesses: the opening of each half is slow, the sung sonnets drag, the Dark Lady is under-developed. The time shift is not thoroughly worked through, but allows knowing nods to the present. However, the whole conceit has more to like than condemn."<ref>[http://www.dynamiclisting.com/dl/page.php?page=greenroom&story=E8821145616034 UK Theatre Web], ''To W.H.'', accessed 23 January 2009</ref>

Of his August 2008 presentation of his play ''Paper Moons'', Tamara Gausi wrote, "Draper neither stands over nor sentimentalises any of his characters, allowing this heartfelt depiction of teenage angst to entertain, but also to touch".<ref name=TO1/>

===As actor===
He was well received for his role in the play ''[[Hot Mikado]]'' by the ''Bexley Times'' which wrote, "In a good cast, Stuart Draper shone brightest as the Lord High Executioner Ko-Ko, a blustering, avaricious coward in a pink suit who would have given [[Rik Mayall]] or [[Alexi Sayle]] a run for their money in the comedy stakes.".<ref>[http://www.bexleytimes.co.uk/content/bromley/times/whatson/story.aspx?brand=BMLYTOnline&category=whatsontheatre&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatsonbmlyt&itemid=WeED18%20Jul%202007%2016%3A32%3A32%3A297 Bexley Times] (18 July 2007), "Get into swing of popular operetta", accessed 22 January 2009</ref> Jonathan Gibbs of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' said, "...This (includes) a largely amusing pub quiz skit by Matthew Wilkie featuring Stuart Draper as sad-sack George, who has unwisely bet a grand that his team win on the very night it disintegrates all together"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewwilkie.co.uk/reviews.html|title=Matthew Wilkie playwright and author of stage plays|website=Matthewwilkie.co.uk|access-date=30 October 2017}}</ref>
