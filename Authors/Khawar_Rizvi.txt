He was ever respected as a thinker and scholar throughout his life though it was so short in years but too big in deeds. Khawar Rizvi’s thought was progressive. He never compromised on any subjugation. Though he was at high position in Social Security department yet he always defended the rights of the workers. All his life he loved youth and children. He never liked disappointment and negative thinking. He was too full of life that death didn’t dare to enter his home but caught him in the middle of way far from his home in the morning and mourning hours of 15th November 1981 when he was only 43. After so many years of his death he still lives in the hearts and the memories of those who love his personality and his poetry.
