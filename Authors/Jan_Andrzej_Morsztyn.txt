'''Jan Andrzej Morsztyn''' (1621–93) was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, member of the landed [[szlachta|nobility]], and official in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He was ''[[starosta]]'' of [[Zawichost]], [[Tymbark]] and [[Kowal (town)|Kowal]]. He was also [[Stolnik|pantler]] of [[Sandomierz]] (1647–58), Royal Secretary (from 1656), a secular [[referendary]] (1658–68), and [[podskarbi|Deputy Crown Treasurer]] from 1668. Apart from his career at the Polish court, Morsztyn is famous as a leading poet of the [[baroque in Poland|Polish Baroque]] and a prominent representative of [[marinism|Marinist]] style in [[Polish literature]]. Over his lifetime he accumulated considerable wealth. In 1683 he was accused of treason and was forced to emigrate to [[France]].

==Biography==
Morsztyn was born 24 July 1621 at [[Wiśnicz]], near [[Kraków]], into a wealthy [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] family of [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] ''[[Leliwa]]''. He studied at [[Leiden University]] and, with his brother, traveled extensively in Italy and France. After returning to Poland, he became a retainer of the [[magnate]] [[Lubomirski]] family, and through them became attached to the [[royal court]]. He was a deputy to the [[Sejm]]s of 1648, 1650, 1653, 1658 and 1659. He served on numerous Sejm commissions for diplomatic, legal and fiscal matters. He took part in diplomatic missions to Hungary (1653), Sweden (1655) and Austria (1656).

He was named Royal Secretary in 1656, Crown Referendary in 1658, and [[podskarbi|Deputy Crown Treasurer]] in 1668. During those years he took part in many [[diplomatic mission]]s and negotiations; he was part of the mission that negotiated the [[Treaty of Oliwa]] (1660). He fought in [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] and in the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]].

In politics he represented the pro-French faction, promoting the French candidate in the [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1668, and become a vocal supporter of French policies in the Commonwealth. He accepted French pension and citizenship. When king [[John III Sobieski]] distanced himself from France, and allied with [[Austria]], he was accused of treason and emigrated to France in 1683, where he assumed the title of ''[[Count|comte]] de [[Châteauvillain]]'' and spent the last years of his life as a royal secretary. The Sejm of 1686 stripped him of all offices and titles and banned him from the country.

Jan Morsztyn died 8 January 1693 in [[Paris]].

In 1659 he married Catherine Gordon of Huntly (1635–1691), the youngest daughter of [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly]] (1589–1649) and Lady Anne Campbell, eldest daughter of the seventh [[Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]]. She went to Poland with her older brother [[Scottish people|Scots]]-born [[colonel]] Lord [[Henry Gordon de Huntly]], who served the king of Poland for several years. Lord Gordon returned to Scotland, and died at Strathbogie. Catherine (Katarzyna) was a [[lady-in-waiting]] at the Court of Queen [[Ludwika Maria Gonzaga|Marie Louise de Gonzaga]]. They had a son and three daughters, who all married members of high European [[aristocracy]], except one daughter who became a [[nun]].

They became Prince [[Kazimierz Czartoryski]]'s parents-in-law, by their younger daughter [[Izabela Elżbieta Morsztyn|Isabella Morsztynowna]]. Through the Czartoryski family, they are :
* great-grandparents of '''[[Stanisław II Augustus]], the King of Poland''' (1732–1796). The king's mother, Princess [[Konstancja Czartoryska (1700-1759)|Konstancja Czartoryska]], is Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski's daughter.

** explanation : Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski's great-granddaughter [[Zofia Czartoryska]] and her husband [[Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski]] are [[Leon Sapieha|Prince Leon Sapieha-Kodenski]]'s parents-in-law. Prince Leon's great-great-granddaughter, Princess Zofia Sapieha-Kodenska, is Queen Mathilde's maternal grandmother, who died in a car accident with the princess's sister, Marie-Alix d'Udekem d'Acoz.

Jan Andrzej Morsztyn was one of the leading poets of the [[baroque in Poland|Polish Baroque]]. His language was marked by the extravagant style of 16th-century Italian [[Marinism]]. He had written most of his works before becoming Deputy Crown Treasurer in 1668. Morsztyn, a courtier and political intriguer, considered his writing a hobby and let most of his works circulate in [[manuscript]], afraid that wider publication could prove damaging to his career.<ref name="gla"/><ref name=bar/> Thus most of his works first appeared in print only in the 19th century.

A master of poetic form, he wrote the collections of verses ''Kanikuła'' (Dog Days, 1647) and ''Lutnia'' (Lute, 1661). He was concerned less with the "worldly happiness" but rather, with its inherent self-contradictions, such as paradoxes of love, full both of frivolity and metaphysical fear.<ref name="bar"/> Nonetheless some of his other works had political subtones, like ''[[Pospolite ruszenie]]'' or ''Pieśń w obozie pod Żwańcem'' (Song in the camp near Żwaniec), which criticized [[szlachta]] unwillingness to react to potential dangers (from [[Tatars]] or [[Cossacks]]). Unlike his cousin, [[Zbigniew Morsztyn]], few of his works can be counted as [[religious poetry]], the notable exception being the ''Pokuta w kwartanie''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jan Andrzej Morsztyn - biografia, wiersze, utwory|url=https://poezja.org/wz/Morsztyn_Andrzej_Jan/|access-date=2021-06-01|website=poezja.org|language=pl}}</ref>

He was also a known translator (of [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Giambattista Marino]] and [[Pierre Corneille]]). His translation of Corneiile's ''[[Le Cid]]'' was the first translation of this work into Polish and has remained the standard Polish version even today.

In 1660 he coauthored a proposal for the reform of the Sejm.
