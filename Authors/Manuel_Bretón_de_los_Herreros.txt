'''Manuel Bretón de los Herreros''' (19 December 1796{{snd}}8 November 1873) was a Spanish [[dramatist]].

He was born in [[Quel, La Rioja|Quel]] ([[Logroño (province)|Logrono]]), and was educated at [[Madrid]]. Enlisting on 24 May 1812, he served against the [[France|French]] in [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] and [[Catalonia]], and retired with the rank of corporal on 8 March 1822. He obtained a minor post in the civil service under the liberal government, and on his discharge determined to earn his living by writing for the stage.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bretón de los Herreros, Manuel|volume=4|page=502|last=Fitzmaurice-Kelly|first=James|authorlink=James Fitzmaurice-Kelly}} This cites:

* ''Obras de Bretón de Herreros'' (5 vols., Madrid, 1883)
* E. Piñeyro, ''El Romanticismo en España'' (Paris, 1904)</ref>

His first piece, ''Á la vejez viruelas'', was produced on 4 October 1824, and proved the writer to be the legitimate successor of the younger [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín|Moratín]]. His industry was astonishing: between October 1824 and November 1828, he composed thirty-nine plays, six of them original, the rest being translations or recasts of classic masterpieces. In 1831, he published a translation of [[Tibullus]], and acquired by it an unmerited reputation for scholarship which secured for him an appointment as sub-librarian at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España|national library]]. But the theatre claimed him for its own, and with the exception of ''Elena'' and a few other pieces in the fashionable romantic vein, his plays were a long series of successes. His only serious check occurred in 1840; the formerly more liberal government had grown conservative, and when in ''La Ponchada'' the author ridiculed the National Guard.<ref name="EB1911"/>

He was dismissed from the national library, and for a short time was so unpopular that he seriously thought of emigrating to [[United States|America]]; but the storm blew over, and within two years Bretón de los Herreros had regained his supremacy on the stage. He became secretary to the [[Spanish Academy]], quarrelled with his fellow-members, and died at Madrid. He is the author of some 360 original plays, twenty-three of which are in prose.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Legacy==
According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', "[n]o Spanish dramatist of the nineteenth century approaches him in comic power, in festive invention, and in the humorous presentation of character, while his metrical dexterity is unique. that ''Marcela, o ¿a cuál de los tres?'' (1831), ''Muérete y verás!'' (1837) and ''La Escuela del matrimonio'' (1852) still hold the stage [as of 1911], and are likely to hold it so long as Spanish is spoken".<ref name="EB1911"/>

The [[Theatre of Bretón de los Herreros]] in [[Logroño]] is named after him.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
