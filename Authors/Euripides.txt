'''Euripides''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ʊəˈr|ɪ|p|ɪ|d|iː|z}};<ref>Jones, Daniel; Roach, Peter, James Hartman and Jane Setter, eds. ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary''. 17th edition. Cambridge UP, 2006.</ref> {{lang-grc|Εὐριπίδης}} ''Eurīpídēs'', {{IPA-el|eu̯.riː.pí.dɛːs|pron}}; {{c.|480|406 BC}}) was a [[tragedy|tragedian]] of [[classical Athens]]. Along with [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], he is one of the three ancient Greek tragedians for whom any plays have survived in full. Some ancient scholars attributed ninety-five plays to him, but the ''[[Suda]]'' says it was ninety-two at most. Of these, eighteen or nineteen have survived more or less complete (''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]'' is suspect).<ref>Walton (1997, viii, xix)</ref> There are many fragments (some substantial) of most of his other plays. More of his plays have survived intact than those of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] together, partly because his popularity grew as theirs declined<ref>B. Knox,'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B.

Euripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to [[New Comedy|comedy]], some of which are characteristic of [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]. He also became "the most tragic of poets",<ref group="nb">The epithet "the most tragic of poets" was mastered{{what|date=August 2020}} by Aristotle, probably in reference to a perceived preference for unhappy endings, but it has wider relevance: "For in his representation of human suffering Euripides pushes to the limits of what an audience can stand; some of his scenes are almost unbearable."{{emdash}}B. Knox,'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 339</ref> focusing on the inner lives and motives of his characters in a way previously unknown.<ref name="HM xviii-xix">Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, pp. xviii–xix</ref><ref>A.S. Owen, ''Euripides: Ion'', Bristol Classical Press (1990), Introduction p. vii</ref> He was "the creator of ... that cage which is the theatre of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'', Racine's ''[[Phèdre]]'', of [[Ibsen]] and [[Strindberg]]," in which "imprisoned men and women destroy each other by the intensity of their loves and hates".<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 329</ref> But he was also the literary ancestor of comic dramatists as diverse as Menander and [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, pp. viii–ix</ref>

His contemporaries associated him with [[Socrates]] as a leader of a decadent intellectualism. Both were frequently lampooned by comic poets such as [[Aristophanes]]. Socrates was eventually put on trial and executed as a corrupting influence. Ancient biographies hold that Euripides chose a voluntary exile in old age, dying in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]],<ref name="Denys L. Page 1976">Denys L. Page, ''Euripides: Medea'', Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction pp. ix–xii</ref> but recent scholarship casts doubt on these sources.

==Life==
Traditional accounts of the author's life are found in many commentaries, and include details such as these: He was born on [[Salamis Island]] around 480 BC, with parents Cleito (mother) and Mnesarchus (father), a retailer who lived in a village near Athens. On receiving an oracle that his son was fated to win "crowns of victory", Mnesarchus insisted that the boy should train for a career in athletics. But the boy was destined for a career on the stage (where he was to win only five victories, one of these posthumously). He served for a short time as both dancer and torch-bearer at the rites of [[Apollo]] Zosterius. His education was not confined to athletics, studying also painting and philosophy under the masters [[Prodicus]] and [[Anaxagoras]]. He had two disastrous marriages, and both his wives{{emdash}}Melite and Choerine (the latter bearing him three sons){{emdash}}were unfaithful. He became a recluse, making a home for himself in a cave on Salamis ([[the Cave of Euripides]], where a cult of the playwright developed after his death). "There he built an impressive library and pursued daily communion with the sea and sky".{{cn|date=August 2020}} The details of his death are uncertain. It was traditionally held that he retired to the "rustic court" of King Archelaus in Macedonia, where he died in 406 BC,<ref>Mary Ellen Snodgrass, ''Cliff Notes on Greek Classics'', Wiley Publishing Inc. (1998), pp. 147–48</ref> but modern scholarship is sceptical of these claims. It is possible that in reality he never visited Macedonia at all,<ref>Robin Mitchell-Boyask, ''Euripides: Medea'', Diane Svarlien (trans.), Hackett Publishing Company (2008), Introduction, p. xii</ref> or if he did, he might have been drawn there by King [[Archelaus of Macedonia|Archelaus]] with incentives that were also offered to other artists.<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 253</ref>

Such biographical details derive almost entirely from three unreliable sources:<ref name="GJ 252">Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 252</ref>

* folklore, employed by the ancients to lend colour to the lives of celebrated authors;
* parody, employed by the comic poets to ridicule the tragic poets; and
* 'autobiographical' clues gleaned from his extant plays (a mere fraction of his total output).

The next three sections expand on the claims of each of these sources, respectively.

===A fabled life===
Euripides was the youngest in a group of three great tragedians, who were almost contemporaries: his first play was staged thirteen years after Sophocles' debut, and three years after Aeschylus's ''[[Oresteia]]''. The identity of the trio is neatly underscored{{what|date=August 2020}} by a patriotic account of their roles during Greece's great victory over [[Ancient Persia|Persia]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]]{{emdash}}Aeschylus fought there, Sophocles was just old enough to celebrate the victory in a boys' chorus, and Euripides was born on the very day of the battle.<ref name="GJ 252"/> The apocryphal account, that he composed his works in a cave on Salamis island, was a late tradition, probably symbolizing the isolation of an intellectual ahead of his time.<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 317</ref> Much of his life, and his whole career, coincided with the struggle between Athens and Sparta for hegemony in Greece, but he didn't live to see the final defeat of his city. It is said that he died in Macedonia after being attacked by the [[Molossus (dog)|Molossian hounds]] of King Archelaus, and that his cenotaph near [[Piraeus]] was struck by lightning{{emdash}}signs of his unique powers, whether for good or ill (according to one modern scholar, his death might have been caused instead by the harsh Macedonian winter).{{what|reason=parenthesis seems out of place|date=August 2020}}<ref>Richard Rutherford, ''Medea and Other Plays''. By Euripides, Introduction. Rev ed. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-044929-9}}.</ref> In an account by [[Plutarch]], the catastrophic failure of the [[Sicilian expedition]] led Athenians to trade renditions of Euripides' lyrics to their enemies in return for food and drink (''Life of Nicias'' 29). Plutarch also provides the story that the victorious Spartan generals, having planned the demolition of Athens and the enslavement of its people, grew merciful after being entertained at a banquet by lyrics from Euripides' play ''Electra'': "they felt that it would be a barbarous act to annihilate a city which produced such men" (''Life of Lysander'').<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Lysander'', cited and translated by B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P.

===A comic life===
Tragic poets were often mocked by comic poets during the dramatic festivals [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]], and Euripides was travestied more than most. Aristophanes scripted him as a character in at least three plays: ''[[The Acharnians]]'', ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' and ''[[The Frogs]]''. But Aristophanes also borrowed, rather than merely satirized, some of the tragedian's methods; he was himself ridiculed by a colleague,{{what|date=August 2020}} [[Cratinus]], as: {{quote|ὑπολεπτολόγος, γνωμιδιώτης,<br />εὐριπιδαριστοφανίζων.<ref>{{cite book

In ''The Frogs'', written when Euripides and Aeschylus were dead, Aristophanes has the god [[Dionysus]] venturing down to [[Hades]] in search of a good poet to bring back to Athens. After a debate between the two deceased bards,{{what|date=August 2020}} the god brings Aeschylus back to life, as more useful to Athens, for his wisdom, rejecting Euripides as merely clever{{what|date=August 2020}}. Such comic 'evidence' suggests that Athenians admired Euripides even while they mistrusted his intellectualism, at least during the long war with Sparta. Aeschylus had written his own epitaph commemorating his life as a warrior fighting for Athens against Persia, without any mention of his success as a playwright; and Sophocles was celebrated by his contemporaries for his social gifts, and contributions to public life as a state official; but there are no records of Euripides' public life except as a dramatist{{emdash}}he could well have been "a brooding and bookish recluse".<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, p. viii</ref> He is presented as such in ''The Acharnians'', where Aristophanes shows him to be living morosely in a precarious house, surrounded by the tattered costumes of his disreputable characters (and yet [[Agathon]], another tragic poet, is discovered in a later play, ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'', to be living in circumstances almost as bizarre). Euripides' mother was a humble vendor of vegetables, according to the comic tradition, yet his plays indicate that he had a liberal education and hence a privileged background.<ref name="GJ 252" />

===A tragedian's life===
Euripides first competed in the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]], the famous Athenian dramatic festival, in 455 BC, one year after the death of [[Aeschylus]]; and did not win first prize until 441 BC. His final competition in Athens was in 408 BC. ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' were performed in 405 BC, and first prize was awarded posthumously. He won first prize only five times.

His plays, and those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, indicate a difference in outlook between the three{{emdash}}a generation gap probably due to the [[Sophism|Sophistic enlightenment]] in the middle decades of the 5th century: Aeschylus still looked back to the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], Sophocles was in transition between periods, and Euripides was fully imbued with the new spirit of the [[Classical Greece|classical age]].<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), pp. 316–17</ref> When Euripides' plays are sequenced in time, they also reveal that his outlook might have changed, providing a "spiritual biography", along these lines:
* an early period of high tragedy (''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'')
* a patriotic period at the outset of the Peloponnesian War (''[[Children of Heracles]]'', ''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]]'')
* a middle period of disillusionment at the senselessness of war (''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[The Trojan Women]]'')
* an escapist period with a focus on romantic intrigue (''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'')
* a final period of tragic despair (''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'', ''[[Phoenician Women]]'', ''[[The Bacchae]]'')
However, about 80% of his plays have been lost, and even the extant plays do not present a fully consistent picture of his 'spiritual' development (for example, ''Iphigenia in Aulis'' is dated with the 'despairing' ''Bacchae'', yet it contains elements that became typical of New Comedy).<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 318</ref> In the ''Bacchae'', he restores the chorus and messenger speech to their traditional role in the tragic plot, and the play appears to be the culmination of a regressive or archaizing tendency in his later works (for which see [[Euripides#Chronology|Chronology]] below). Believed to have been composed in the wilds of Macedonia, ''Bacchae'' also dramatizes a primitive side to Greek religion, and some modern scholars have interpreted this particular play biographically, therefore, as:
* a kind of death-bed conversion or renunciation of atheism;
* the poet's attempt to ward off the charge of impiety that was later to overtake his friend Socrates;
* evidence of a new belief that religion cannot be analysed rationally.<ref>E.R.Dodds, ''Euripides: Bacchae'', Oxford University Press (1960), Introduction p. xl</ref>
One of his earliest extant plays, ''Medea'', includes a speech that he seems to have written in defence of himself as an intellectual ahead of his time (spoken by Medea):<ref name="Denys L. Page 1976"/>

==Work==
Athenian tragedy in performance during Euripides' lifetime was a public contest between playwrights. The state funded it and awarded prizes. The language was metrical, spoken and sung. The performance area included a circular floor (called [[orchestra]]) where the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] could dance, a space for actors (three speaking actors in Euripides' time), a backdrop or [[skene (theatre)|skene]], and some special effects: an [[ekkyklema]] (used to bring the skene's "indoors" outdoors) and a [[mechane]] (used to lift actors in the air, as in [[deus ex machina]]).

}}</ref> acting also began to be regarded as a skill worth prizes, requiring a long apprenticeship in the chorus.{{cn|date=August 2020}} Euripides and other playwrights accordingly composed more and more arias for accomplished actors to sing, and this tendency became more marked in his later plays:<ref>John Gould, 'Tragedy in performance', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), pp. 265–67</ref> tragedy was a "living and ever-changing genre"<ref>D.J. Mastronade, 'European Tragedy and Genre', in ''Euripides and Tragic Theatre in the Late Fifth Century'', M.Cropp, K.Lee and D. Sansone (eds), Champaign, Ill. (1999–2000), p. 27</ref> (cf. previous section, and [[Euripides#Chronology|Chronology]]; a list of his plays is [[Euripides#Extant plays|below]]).

The comic poet Aristophanes is the earliest known critic to characterize Euripides as a spokesman for destructive, new ideas associated with declining standards in both society and tragedy (see [[Euripides#Reception|Reception]] for more). But fifth-century tragedy was a social gathering for "carrying out quite publicly the maintenance and development of mental infrastructure", and it offered spectators a "platform for an utterly unique form of institutionalized discussion".<ref>C. Meier, ''The Political Art of Greek Tragedy'', Trans. A. Webber, Baltimore (1993), pp. 4, 42</ref> The dramatist's role was not only to entertain but also educate fellow citizens{{emdash}}he was expected to have a message.<ref name="VP 10">Philip Vellacott, ''Euripides: The Bacchae and Other Plays'', Penguin Classics (1954), Introduction p. 10</ref> Traditional myth provided the subject matter, but the dramatist was meant to be innovative, which led to novel characterizations of heroic figures<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 260</ref> and use of the mythical past as a tool for discussing present issues.<ref>Neil Croally, 'Tragedy's Teaching', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 66</ref> The difference between Euripides and his older colleagues was one of degree: his characters talked about the present more controversially and pointedly than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, sometimes even challenging the democratic order. Thus, for example, [[Odysseus]] is represented in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'' (lines 131–32) as "agile-minded, sweet-talking, demos-pleasing", i.e. similar to the war-time demagogues that were active in Athens during the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>Justina Gregory, "Euripidean Tragedy", in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.) Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 264</ref> Speakers in the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles sometimes distinguish between slaves who are servile by nature and those servile by circumstance, but Euripides' speakers go further, positing an individual's mental, rather than social or physical, state as a true indication of worth.<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 264</ref> For example, in ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', a love-sick queen rationalizes her position and, reflecting on adultery, arrives at this comment on intrinsic merit:

Euripides' characters resembled contemporary Athenians rather than heroic figures of myth.
{{quote|For achieving his end Euripides' regular strategy is a very simple one: retaining the old stories and the great names, as his theatre required, he imagines his people as contemporaries subjected to contemporary kinds of pressures, and examines their motivations, conduct and fate in the light of contemporary problems, usages and ideals.|Moses Hadas<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, p. x</ref>}}

Easterling and B.

Athenian citizens were familiar with rhetoric in the assembly and law courts, and some scholars believe that Euripides was more interested in his characters as speakers with cases to argue than as characters with lifelike personalities.<ref name="B.M.Knox, 1985 pages 327">B.&nbsp;M.

Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 327</ref> They are self-conscious about speaking formally, and their rhetoric is shown to be flawed, as if Euripides were exploring the problematical nature of language and communication: "For speech points in three different directions at once, to the speaker, to the person addressed, to the features in the world it describes, and each of these directions can be felt as skewed".<ref>Christopher Pelling, "Tragedy, Rhetoric and Performance Culture", in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 85</ref> For example, in the quotation above, Hecuba presents herself as a sophisticated intellectual describing a rationalized cosmos, but the speech is ill-suited to her audience, the unsophisticated listener Menelaus, and is found to not suit the cosmos either (her grandson is murdered by the Greeks).

Like Euripides, both Aeschylus and Sophocles created comic effects, contrasting the heroic with the mundane, but they employed minor supporting characters for that purpose. Euripides was more insistent, using major characters as well. His comic touches can be thought to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism: "The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic statement".<ref>Bernd Seidensticker, "Dithyramb, Comedy and Satyr-Play', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), pp. 52–33</ref> Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so suddenly that inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics,<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 326</ref> such as Aristotle, who cited ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' as an example (''Poetics'' 1454a32). For others, psychological inconsistency is not a stumbling block to good drama: "Euripides is in pursuit of a larger insight: he aims to set forth the two modes, emotional and rational, with which human beings confront their own mortality."<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 261</ref> Some think unpredictable behaviour realistic in tragedy: "everywhere in Euripides a preoccupation with individual psychology and its irrational aspects is evident....In his hands tragedy for the first time probed the inner recesses of the human soul and let ''passions spin the plot''."<ref name="B.M.Knox, 1985 pages 327"/> The tension between reason and passion is symbolized by his characters' relationship with the gods:<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 325</ref> For example, Hecuba's prayer is answered not by Zeus, nor by the law of reason, but by Menelaus, as if speaking for the old gods. And the perhaps most famous example is in ''Bacchae'' where the god Dionysus savages his own converts.{{what|date=August 2020}} When the gods do appear (in eight of the extant plays), they appear "lifeless and mechanical".<ref>B.&nbsp;M. Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 324</ref> Sometimes condemned by critics as an unimaginative way to end a story, the spectacle of a "god" making a judgement or announcement from a theatrical crane might actually have been intended to provoke scepticism about the religious and heroic dimension of his plays.<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), pp. xvi–xviii</ref><ref>B.&nbsp;M. Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 332</ref> Similarly, his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines theatrical illusion.{{cn|date=August 2020}} Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a monologue in which a divinity or human character simply tells the audience all it needs to know to understand what follows.<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), p. xvi</ref>

Aeschylus and Sophocles were innovative, but Euripides had arrived at a position in the "ever-changing genre" where he could easily move between tragic, comic, romantic, and political effects. This versatility appears in individual plays and also over the course of his career. Potential for comedy lay in his use of 'contemporary' characters, in his sophisticated tone, his relatively informal Greek (see [[Euripides#In Greek|In Greek]] below), and in his ingenious use of plots centred on motifs that later became standard in Menander's New Comedy (for example the 'recognition scene'). Other tragedians also used recognition scenes, but they were heroic in emphasis, as in Aeschylus's ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'', which Euripides parodied in ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'' (Euripides was unique among the tragedians in incorporating theatrical criticism in his plays).<ref>Justina Gregory, ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 267</ref> Traditional myth with its exotic settings, heroic adventures, and epic battles offered potential for romantic melodrama as well as for political comments on a war theme,<ref>B.&nbsp;M. Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature&nbsp;I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), pp. 332–66</ref> so that his plays are an extraordinary mix of elements.{{cn|date=August 2020}} ''The Trojan Women'', for example, is a powerfully disturbing play on the theme of war's horrors, apparently critical of Athenian imperialism (it was composed in the aftermath of the [[Melos#Conflict with Athens|Melian massacre]] and during the preparations for the [[Sicilian Expedition]]),<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), p. 195</ref> yet it features the comic exchange between Menelaus and Hecuba quoted above, and the chorus considers Athens, the "blessed land of Theus", to be a desirable refuge{{emdash}}such complexity and ambiguity are typical both of his "patriotic" and "anti-war" plays.<ref>B.&nbsp;M. Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), pp. 334–35</ref>

Tragic poets in the fifth century competed against one another at the [[City Dionysia]], each with a [[tetralogy]] of three tragedies and a [[satyr play]]. The few extant fragments of satyr plays attributed to Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate that these were a loosely structured, simple, and jovial form of entertainment. But in ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' (the only complete satyr-play that survives), Euripides structured the entertainment more like a tragedy and introduced a note of critical irony typical of his other work. His genre-bending inventiveness{{cn|date=August 2020}} is shown above all in ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', a blend of tragic and satyric elements. This fourth play in his tetralogy for 438 BC (i.e., it occupied the position conventionally reserved for satyr plays) is a "tragedy", featuring [[Heracles]] as a satyric hero in conventional satyr-play scenes: an arrival, a banquet, a victory over an [[ogre]] (in this case, death), a happy ending, a feast, and a departure for new adventures.<ref>Bernd Seidensticker, "Dithyramb, Comedy and Satyr-Play', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 50</ref> Most of the big innovations in tragedy were made by Aeschylus and Sophocles, but "Euripides made innovations on a smaller scale that have impressed some critics as cumulatively leading to a radical change of direction".<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 269</ref>

Euripides is also known for his use of irony. Many Greek tragedians make use of dramatic irony to bring out the emotion and realism of their characters or plays, but Euripides uses irony to foreshadow events and occasionally amuse his audience.{{cn|date=August 2020}} For example, in his play ''Heracles'', Heracles comments that all men love their children and wish to see them grow. The irony here is that Heracles will be driven into madness by Hera and will kill his children. Similarly, in ''Helen'', Theoclymenus remarks how happy he is that his sister has the gift of prophecy and will warn him of any plots or tricks against him (the audience already knows that she has betrayed him). In this instance, Euripides uses irony not only for foreshadowing but also for comic effect—which few tragedians did. Likewise, in the ''Bacchae'', Pentheus’s first threat to the god Dionysus is that if Pentheus catches him in his city, he will 'chop off his head', whereas it is Pentheus who is beheaded at the end of the play.

The spoken language of the plays is not fundamentally different in style from that of Aeschylus or Sophocles{{emdash}}it employs [[poetic meter]]s, a rarefied vocabulary, fullness of expression, complex syntax, and ornamental figures, all aimed at representing an elevated style.<ref>Justina Gregory, "Euripidean Tragedy", in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 256</ref> But its rhythms are somewhat freer, and more natural, than that of his predecessors, and the vocabulary has been expanded to allow for intellectual and psychological subtleties. Euripides was also a great lyric poet.{{cn|date=August 2020}} In ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', for example, he composed for his city, Athens, "the noblest of her songs of praise".<ref>''Medea'' 824 sqq.; Denys L. Page, ''Euripides: Medea'', Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction page vii</ref> His lyrical skills are not just confined to individual poems: "A play of Euripides is a musical whole...one song echoes motifs from the preceding song, while introducing new ones."<ref>L. P. E. Parker, ''Euripides: Alcestis'', Oxford University Press (2007), Introduction p. lxxii</ref> For some critics, the lyrics often seem dislocated from the action, but the extent and significance of this is "a matter of scholarly debate".<ref>B. M. Knox, "Euripides" in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 338</ref> See [[Euripides#Chronology|Chronology]] for details about his style.

==Reception==
Euripides has aroused, and continues to arouse, strong opinions for and against his work:

{{quotation|He was a problem to his contemporaries and he is one still; over the course of centuries since his plays were first produced he has been hailed or indicted under a bewildering variety of labels. He has been described as 'the poet of the Greek enlightenment' and also as 'Euripides the irrationalist';<ref group="nb">'The poet of the Greek enlightenment' is taken from W. Nestle, ''Euripides'', Stuttgart (1901); 'Euripides the irrationalist' is from E. Dodds, ''C.R'' '''43''' (1929), pp. 97–104</ref> as a religious sceptic if not an atheist, but on the other hand, as a believer in divine providence and the ultimate justice of divine dispensation. He has been seen as a profound explorer of human psychology and also a rhetorical poet who subordinated consistency of character to verbal effect; as a misogynist and a feminist; as a realist who brought tragic action down to the level of everyday life and as a romantic poet who chose unusual myths and exotic settings. He wrote plays which have been widely understood as patriotic pieces supporting Athens' war against Sparta and others which many have taken as the work of the anti-war dramatist ''par excellence,'' even as attacks on Athenian imperialism. He has been recognized as the precursor of New Comedy and also what Aristotle called him: 'the most tragic of poets' (''Poetics'' 1453a30). And not one of these descriptions is entirely false. {{emdash}} [[Bernard Knox]]<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P.

Aeschylus gained thirteen victories as a dramatist; Sophocles at least twenty; Euripides only four in his lifetime; and this has often been taken as indication of the latter's unpopularity. But a first place might not have been the main criterion for success (the system of selecting judges appears to have been flawed), and merely being chosen to compete was a mark of distinction.<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), pp. 252–53</ref> Moreover, to have been singled out by Aristophanes for so much comic attention is proof of popular interest in his work.<ref>David Barrett, ''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'', Penguin Books (1964), p. 98</ref> Sophocles was appreciative enough of the younger poet to be influenced by him, as is evident in his later plays ''[[Philoctetes (play)|Philoctetes]]'' and ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''.<ref>Robin Mitchel-Boyask, ''Euripides: Medea'', Hackett Publishing Co.

In the seventeenth century, [[Jean Racine|Racine]] expressed admiration for Sophocles, but was more influenced by Euripides (''Iphigenia in Aulis'' and ''Hippolytus'' were the models for his plays ''Iphigénie'' and ''Phèdre'').<ref>S. Philippo, ''Silent Witness: Racine's Non-Verbal Annotations of Euripides'', Oxford University Press (2003), p. 22</ref> Euripides' reputation was to take a beating in the early 19th century, when [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and his brother [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political, and artistic degeneration of Athens.<ref name="L.P.E.Parker, 2007">L.P.E.Parker, ''Euripides: Alcestis'', Oxford University Press (2007), Introduction p. xlii</ref> August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846; and, in them, he opined that Euripides "not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning".

==Texts==

===Transmission===
The textual transmission of the plays, from the 5th century BC, when they were first written, until the era of the printing press, was a largely haphazard process. Much of Euripides' work was lost and corrupted; but the period also included triumphs by scholars and copyists, thanks to whom much was recovered and preserved. Summaries of the transmission are often found in modern editions of the plays, three of which are used as sources for this summary.<ref group="nb">This summary of the transmission is adapted from a) Denys L. Page, ''Euripides: Medea'', Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction pp. xxxvii–xliv; b) L.P.E. Parker, ''Euripides: Alcestis'', Oxford University Press (2007), Introduction pp. lvii–lxv; c) E.R. Dodds, ''Euripides: Bacchae'', Oxford University Press (1960), Introduction pp. li–lvi</ref>

The plays of Euripides, like those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, circulated in written form. But literary conventions that we take for granted today had not been invented{{emdash}}there was no spacing between words; no consistency in punctuation, nor elisions; no marks for breathings and accents (guides to pronunciation, and word recognition); no convention to denote change of speaker; no stage directions; and verse was written straight across the page, like prose. Possibly, those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as equivalents of the modern dash, colon, and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions (which aid comprehension), was an early and persistent source of errors, affecting transmission. Errors were also introduced when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403–402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by [[Lycurgus of Athens]] in 330 BC "that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal."<ref>Plutarch ''Vit.Dec.Orat.'' 851e, cited by Denys L. Page, ''Euripides: Medea'', Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction pp. xxxix–xl</ref> The law was soon disregarded, and actors continued to make changes until about 200 BC, after which the habit ceased. It was about then that [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was "published" separately. This became the "standard edition" for the future, and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expect: there was still no spacing between words; little or no punctuation; and no stage directions; but abbreviated names denoted changes of speaker; lyrics were broken into "cola" and "strophai", or lines and stanzas; and a system of accentuation was introduced.

After this creation of a standard edition, the text was fairly safe from errors, besides slight and gradual corruption introduced with tedious copying. Many of these trivial errors occurred in the Byzantine period, following a change in script (from [[uncial]] to [[Minuscule Greek|minuscule]]), and many were "homophonic" errors{{emdash}}equivalent, in English, to substituting "right" for "write"; except that there were more opportunities for Byzantine scribes to make these errors, because η, ι, οι and ει, were pronounced similarly in the Byzantine period.

Around 200 AD, ten of the plays of Euripides began to be circulated in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or [[scholia]] recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophocles{{emdash}}the only plays of theirs that survive today.<ref>Denys L. Page, ''Euripides: Medea'', Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction p. xlii</ref> Euripides, however, was more fortunate than the other tragedians,{{what|date=August 2020}} with a second edition of his work surviving, compiled in alphabetical order as if from a set of his collect works; but without scholia attached. This "Alphabetical" edition was combined with the "Select" edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that survive today. The "Select" plays are found in many medieval manuscripts, but only two manuscripts preserve the "Alphabetical" plays{{emdash}}often denoted L and P, after the [[Laurentian Library]] at Florence, and the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of L, but the remainder is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is missing ''The Trojan Women'' and latter part of ''The Bacchae''.

In addition to L, P, and many other medieval manuscripts, there are fragments of plays on papyrus. These papyrus fragments are often recovered only with modern technology. In June 2005, for example, classicists at the [[University of Oxford]] worked on a joint project with [[Brigham Young University]], using multi-spectral imaging technology to retrieve previously illegible writing (see References). Some of this work employed [[infrared]] technology—previously used for [[satellite]] imaging—to detect previously unknown material by Euripides, in fragments of the [[Oxyrhynchus papyri]], a collection of ancient manuscripts held by the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/news/independent.html |title=POxy Oxyrhynchus Online |publisher=Papyrology.ox.ac.uk |date=17 April 2005 |access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Papyrology Websites |publisher=Papyrology.ox.ac.uk |access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref>

It is from such materials that modern scholars try to piece together copies of the original plays. Sometimes the picture is almost lost. Thus, for example, two extant plays, ''The Phoenician Women'' and ''Iphigenia in Aulis'', are significantly corrupted by interpolations<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 259</ref> (the latter possibly being completed post mortem by the poet's son); and the very authorship of ''Rhesus'' is a matter of dispute.<ref>William Ritchie, ''The Authenticity of the Rhesus of Euripides'', Cambridge University Press (1964)</ref> In fact, the very existence of the Alphabet plays, or rather the absence of an equivalent edition for Sophocles and Aeschylus, could distort our notions of distinctive Euripidean qualities{{emdash}}most of his least "tragic" plays are in the Alphabet edition; and, possibly, the other two tragedians would appear just as genre-bending as this "restless experimenter", if we possessed more than their "select" editions.<ref name="Justina Gregory 2005 page 254">Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 254</ref>

===Chronology===
Original production dates for some of Euripides' plays are known from ancient records, such as lists of prize-winners at the [[Dionysia]]; and approximations are obtained for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were travestied by comic poets such as [[Aristophanes]], the known dates of whose own plays can serve as a [[terminus ad quem]] for those of Euripides (though the gap can be considerable: twenty-seven years separate ''Telephus'', known to have been produced in 438 BC, from its parody in ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' in 411 BC.). References in Euripides' plays to contemporary events provide a [[terminus ad quem|terminus a quo]], though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g. lines 1074–89 in ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' describe a procession to [[Eleusis]], which was probably written before the Spartans occupied it during the [[Peloponnesian War]]).<ref>A.S. Owen, ''Euripides: Ion'', Bristol Classical Press, Introduction pp. xl–xli</ref> Other indications of dating are obtained by [[stylometry]].

Greek tragedy comprised lyric and dialogue, the latter mostly in [[iambic trimeter]] (three pairs of [[iamb (foot)|iambic feet]] per line). Euripides sometimes 'resolved' the two syllables of the iamb (˘¯) into three syllables (˘˘˘), and this tendency increased so steadily over time that the number of resolved feet in a play can indicate an approximate date of composition (see [[Euripides#Extant plays|Extant plays]] below for one scholar's list of resolutions per hundred trimeters). Associated with this increase in resolutions was an increasing vocabulary, often involving prefixes to refine meanings, allowing the language to assume a more natural rhythm, while also becoming ever more capable of psychological and philosophical subtlety.<ref>B. Knox,'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 337</ref>

The trochaic tetrameter catalectic{{emdash}}four pairs of [[trochee]]s per line, with the final syllable omitted{{emdash}}was identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (''Poetics'' 1449a21). Euripides employs it here and there in his later plays,<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 257</ref> but seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, with ''The Trojan Women'' being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play—it is symptomatic of an archaizing tendency in his later works.<ref>M. Platnauer, ''Iphigenia in Tauris'', Oxford University Press (1938), Introduction page 14</ref><ref>E.R.Dodds, ''Euripides: Bacchae'', Oxford University Press (1960), Introduction p. xxxvi</ref>

The later plays also feature extensive use of [[stichomythia]] (i.e. a series of one-liners).<ref>John Gould, 'Tragedy in performance' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 281</ref> The longest such scene comprises one hundred and five lines in ''Ion'' (lines 264–369). In contrast, Aeschylus never exceeded twenty lines of stichomythia; Sophocles' longest such scene was fifty lines, and that is interrupted several times by αντιλαβή <ref group="nb">i.e. lines are split between speakers</ref> (''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', lines 1176–1226).<ref>A.S. Owen, ''Euripides: Ion'', Bristol Classical Press (1990), Introduction p. 91</ref>

Euripides' use of lyrics in sung parts shows the influence of [[Timotheus of Miletus]] in the later plays{{emdash}}the individual singer gained prominence, and was given additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets, as well as replacing some of the chorus's functions with monodies. At the same time, choral odes began to take on something of the form of [[dithyrambs]] reminiscent of the poetry of [[Bacchylides]], featuring elaborate treatment of myths.<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 258</ref> Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The ''Bacchae'', however, shows a reversion to old forms,<ref>B. Knox,'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 338</ref> possibly as a deliberate archaic effect, or because there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia (where it is said to have been written).<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, p. xvi</ref>

===Lost and fragmentary plays===
The following plays have come down to us in fragmentary form, if at all. They are known through quotations in other works (sometimes as little as a single line); pieces of papyrus; partial copies in manuscript; part of a collection of hypotheses (or summaries); and through being parodied in the works of Aristophanes. Some of the fragments, such as those of ''[[Hypsipyle (play)|Hypsipyle]]'', are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions to be proposed.

A two-volume selection from the fragments, with facing-page translation, introductions, and notes, was published by Collard, Cropp, Lee, and Gibert;<ref>{{cite book|last=Euripides|title=Selected Fragmentary Plays: Volume I|year=1995|editor1-last=Collard|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Cropp|editor2-first=M.J.|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=K.H.|publisher=Aris & Phillips|isbn=0-85668-619-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Euripides|title=Selected Fragmentary Plays: Volume II|year=2005|editor1-last=Collard|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Cropp|editor2-first=M.J.|editor3-last=Gibert|editor3-first=J.|publisher=Aris & Phillips|isbn=0-85668-621-2}}</ref> as were two [[Loeb Classical Library]] volumes derived from them;<ref>{{cite book|last=Euripides|title=Fragments: Aegeus-Meleager (Loeb Classical Library No. 504)|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-99625-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Euripides|title=Oedipus-Chrysippus & Other Fragments|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-99631-1}}</ref> and there are critical studies in T. B. L. Webster's older ''The Tragedies of Euripides'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Webster|first=T. B. L.|title=The Tragedies of Euripides|year=1967|publisher=Methuen|location=London|pages=316|oclc=000310026}}</ref> based on what were then believed to be the most likely reconstructions of the plays.
