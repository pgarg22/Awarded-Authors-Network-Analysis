== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
[[File:G.K. Chesterton at the age of 17.jpg|thumb|right|upright|G. K. Chesterton at the age of 17]]

Chesterton was born in [[Campden Hill]] in [[Kensington]], London, the son of Marie Louise, née Grosjean, and Edward Chesterton (1841&ndash;1922).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Simkin |first=John |title=G. K.

The Slade is a department of [[University College London]], where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but did not complete a degree in either subject. He married [[Frances Blogg]] in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to [[Anglicanism]], though he later considered Anglicanism to be a "pale imitation". He entered full communion with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1922.{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=265–266}}  The couple were unable to have children.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://chestertonaustralia.com/downloads/conferences/chesterton_conference_papers_2018.pdf |title=Chesterton and the child - A Collection of Papers presented at a conference of the Australian Chesterton Society on October 20, 2018, at Campion College Australia, Sydney |date=2018 |publisher=Australian Chesterton Society |location=Sidney, Australia |page=41 |access-date=13 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801202931/http://chestertonaustralia.com/downloads/conferences/chesterton_conference_papers_2018.pdf |archive-date=1 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=162–163}}

A friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]]. Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form. He became godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.

===Career===

In September 1895, Chesterton began working for the London publisher George Redway, where he remained for just over a year.{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} In October 1896 he moved to the publishing house [[T. Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.

Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story "The Flying Stars", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: "There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime."<ref>{{Citation |last=Chesterton |first=G.

[[File:Caricature of Chesterton, by Beerbohm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Caricature]] by [[Max Beerbohm]]]]

Chesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as [[George Bernard Shaw]],<ref>{{Citation |title=Do We agree? A Debate between G. K.

Chesterton was a large man, standing {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} and weighing around {{convert|20|st|6|lb|kg lb}}. His girth gave rise to an anecdote during the First World War, when a lady in London asked why he was not "out at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Front]]"; he replied, "If you go round to the side, you will see that I am."<ref>{{Citation |last=Wilson |first=A. N. |title=Hilaire Belloc |page=219 |year=1984 |place=London |publisher=Hamish Hamilton}}</ref> On another occasion he remarked to his friend [[George Bernard Shaw]], "To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England."

Wodehouse}}</ref> Chesterton usually wore a cape and a crumpled hat, with a [[swordstick]] in hand, and a cigar hanging out of his mouth. He had a tendency to forget where he was supposed to be going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a telegram to his wife Frances from an incorrect location, writing such things as "Am in [[Market Harborough]]. Where ought I to be?" to which she would reply, "Home".{{Sfn|Ward | 1944|loc=chapter XV}} Chesterton himself told this story, omitting, however, his wife's alleged reply, in his autobiography.{{sfn|Chesterton|1936|loc=Chapter 16}}

In 1931, the BBC invited Chesterton to give a series of radio talks. He accepted, tentatively at first. However, from 1932 until his death, Chesterton delivered over 40 talks per year. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}{{page needed|date=March 2021}} The talks were very popular. A BBC official remarked, after Chesterton's death, that "in another year or so, he would have become the dominating voice from Broadcasting House."<ref name="catholicauthors">{{Cite web |title=Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874–1936) |url=http://www.catholicauthors.com/chesterton.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511001442/http://www.catholicauthors.com/chesterton.html |archive-date=11 May 2011 |access-date=23 March 2011 |website=Catholic Authors}}</ref>

Chesterton was part of the [[Detection Club]], a society of British mystery authors founded by [[Anthony Berkeley Cox|Anthony Berkeley]] in 1928. He was elected as the first president and served from 1930 to 1936 till he was succeeded by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]].<ref>"Detection Club, The".

==Writing==

Chesterton wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4,000 essays (mostly newspaper columns), and several plays. He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up "G. K. Chesterton as Theologian"]. In: ''Ethical Addresses''. Philadelphia: The American Ethical Union, pp. 21–44.</ref><ref>Caldecott, Stratford (1999). "Was G.K.

He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name="Father Brown on Chesterton" /> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.

Of his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845–1961'', 2003), "In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time. The biography was largely responsible for creating a popular revival for Dickens's work as well as a serious reconsideration of Dickens by scholars.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ahlquist |first=Dale |title=Common Sense 101: Lessons from G.K. Chesterton |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2006 |page=286}}</ref>

Chesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html "G.K.

[[T.S. Eliot]] summed up his work as follows: 

{{quote|He was importantly and consistently on the side of the angels. Behind the [[Samuel Johnson|Johnsonian]] fancy-dress, so reassuring to the British public, he concealed the most serious and revolutionary designs—concealing them by exposure ... Chesterton's social and economic ideas...were fundamentally Christian and Catholic. He did more, I think, than any man of his time—and was able to do more than anyone else, because of his particular background, development and abilities as a public performer—to maintain the existence of the important minority in the modern world. He leaves behind a permanent claim upon our loyalty, to see that the work that he did in his time is continued in ours.<ref name="Gilbert Chesterton by T. S. Eliot" />}}

Eliot commented further that "His poetry was first-rate journalistic balladry, and I do not suppose that he took it more seriously than it deserved. He reached a high imaginative level with ''[[The Napoleon of Notting Hill]]'', and higher with ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'', romances in which he turned the [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Stevensonian]] fantasy to more serious purpose. His book on [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] seems to me the best essay on that author that has ever been written. Some of his essays can be read again and again; though of his essay-writing as a whole, one can only say that it is remarkable to have maintained such a high average with so large an output."<ref name="Gilbert Chesterton by T.

==Views and contemporaries==
[[File:Three acres and a cow.JPG|thumb|upright|Self-portrait based on the [[Distributism|distributist]] slogan "[[Three acres and a cow]]"]]

=== Wilde and Shaw ===
{{original research section|date=October 2021}}
In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of [[Oscar Wilde]]: "The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw."{{Sfn|Chesterton|1905|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}} More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in his 1908 book ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: "Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde."

Chesterton and [[George Bernard Shaw]] were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other.{{cn|date=October 2021}} However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:

{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn|Chesterton|1905|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}

Shaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''Orthodoxy'' he writes: "The worship of will is the negation of will ... If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular."{{Sfn|Chesterton|1905|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}

This style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' – that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': "Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'."{{Sfn|Chesterton|1908b|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':

{{quote|The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil.

Chesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, "The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected."<ref>{{Citation |title=The Blunders of Our Parties |date=19 April 1924 |work=Illustrated London News}}</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Holroyd |first=Michael |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |isbn=978-0701133504 |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214]}}</ref>

The author James Parker, in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', gives a modern appraisal:

{{quote|In his vastness and mobility, Chesterton continues to elude definition: He was a Catholic convert and an oracular man of letters, a pneumatic cultural presence, an aphorist with the production rate of a pulp novelist. Poetry, criticism, fiction, biography, columns, public debate...Chesterton was a journalist; he was a metaphysician. He was a reactionary; he was a radical. He was a modernist, acutely alive to the rupture in consciousness that produced Eliot’s “The Hollow Men”; he was an anti-modernist...a parochial Englishman and a post-Victorian gasbag; he was a mystic wedded to eternity. All of these cheerfully contradictory things are true...for the final, resolving fact that he was a genius. Touched once by the live wire of his thought, you don’t forget it ... His prose...[is] supremely entertaining, the stately outlines of an older, heavier rhetoric punctually convulsed by what he once called (in reference to the Book of Job) "earthquake irony". He fulminates wittily; he cracks jokes like thunder. His message, a steady illumination beaming and clanging through every lens and facet of his creativity, was really very straightforward: get on your knees, modern man, and praise God.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Parker |first=James |date=April 2015 |title=A Most Unlikely Saint: The case for canonizing G.

=== Advocacy of Catholicism ===

Chesterton's ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' contributed to [[C. S. Lewis]]'s conversion to Christianity. In a letter to [[Sheldon Vanauken]] (14 December 1950),<ref>{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=Clive Staples |title=A Severe Mercy}}</ref>{{Rp | needed=yes|date=November 2012}} Lewis calls the book "the best popular apologetic I know",<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/cslewis/articles/writingspblcdmn/letters.php ''Letter to Sheldon Vanauken''], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303112207/http://www.discovery.org/cslewis/articles/writingspblcdmn/letters.php |date=3 March 2013 }} 14 December 1950.</ref> and to Rhonda Bodle he wrote (31 December 1947)<ref>{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=Clive Staples |title=The Collected Letters |volume=2 |page=823}}</ref> "the [very] best popular defence of the full Christian position I know is G.

The book was also cited in a list of 10 books that "most shaped his vocational attitude and philosophy of life".<ref>{{Citation |title=The Christian Century |date=6 June 1962}}</ref>

Chesterton's hymn "O God of Earth and Altar" was printed in ''[[Christian Social Union (Church of England)#Development|The Commonwealth]]'' and then included in the ''[[English Hymnal]]'' in 1906.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Routley |first=Erik |title=An English-speaking Hymnal Guide |publisher=GIA publications |year=2005 |page=129}}</ref> Several lines of the hymn are sung in the beginning of the song "Revelations" by the British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] on their 1983 album ''[[Piece of Mind]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture |publisher=Greenwood |year=2013 |editor-last=Edmondson |first=Jacqueline |location=Santa Barbara, CA |page=39}}</ref> Lead singer [[Bruce Dickinson]] in an interview stated "I have a fondness for hymns.

[[Étienne Gilson]] praised Chesterton's book on [[St Thomas Aquinas]]: "I consider it as being, without possible comparison, the best book ever written on Saint Thomas ... the few readers who have spent twenty or thirty years in studying St. Thomas Aquinas, and who, perhaps, have themselves published two or three volumes on the subject, cannot fail to perceive that the so-called 'wit' of Chesterton has put their scholarship to shame."<ref>{{Citation |last=Gilson |first=Etienne |title=Guide to Thomas Aquinas |pages=6–7 |year=1987 |editor-last=Pieper |editor-first=Josef |contribution=Letter to Chesterton's editor |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press}}</ref>

Archbishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]], the author of seventy books, identified Chesterton as the stylist who had the greatest impact on his own writing, stating in his autobiography ''Treasure in Clay'', "the greatest influence in writing was G. K. Chesterton who never used a useless word, who saw the value of a paradox, and avoided what was trite."<ref>Sheen, Fulton J. (2008). ''Treasure in Clay''.

===Charges of antisemitism===
Chesterton faced accusations of [[antisemitism]] during his lifetime, saying in his 1920 book ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' that it was something "for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled".<ref>Chesterton, G.

In a work of 1917, titled ''A Short History of England'', Chesterton considers the royal decree of 1290 by which Edward I [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled Jews from England]], a policy that remained in place until 1655. Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a "tender father of his people" for "breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth". He felt that Jews, "a sensitive and highly civilized people" who "were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use", might legitimately complain that "Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor".<ref>{{Citation |last=Julius |first=Anthony |title=Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England |page=422 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author-link=Anthony Julius |title-link=Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Chesterton |first=G. K. |title=A Short History of England |pages=108–109 |year=1917 |publisher=Chatto and Windus}}</ref>

In ''The New Jerusalem'' Chesterton dedicated a chapter to his views on the [[Jewish question]]: the sense that Jews were a distinct people without a homeland of their own, living as foreigners in countries where they were always a minority.{{Sfn|Chesterton|1920|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/New_Jerusalem.txt Chapter 13]}} He wrote that in the past, his position:

{{quote|was always called Anti-Semitism; but it was always much more true to call it Zionism. ... my friends and I had in some general sense a policy in the matter; and it was in substance the desire to give Jews the dignity and status of a separate nation. We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.{{Sfn|Chesterton|1920|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/New_Jerusalem.txt Chapter 13]}}}}

In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as "a parable" and "a flippant fancy") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that "The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land."{{Sfn|Chesterton|1920|loc=[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/New_Jerusalem.txt Chapter 13]}}

Chesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name="Pearce2005">{{Cite book |last=Pearce |first=Joseph |title=Literary Giants, Literary Catholics |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-58617-077-6 |location=San Francisco |page=95 |author-link=Joseph Pearce}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937:

{{quote|When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit. Blessing to his memory!{{Sfn|Ward|1944|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/gilbertkeithches001579mbp#page/n301/mode/2up p. 265]}}}}

In ''The Truth about the Tribes'' Chesterton blasted German race theories, writing: "the essence of Nazi Nationalism is to preserve the purity of a race in a continent where all races are impure."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XsWrlo7P-5cC&lpg=PA593 ''The Collected Works of G.K.

The historian Simon Mayers points out that Chesterton wrote in works such as ''The Crank'', ''The Heresy of Race'', and ''The Barbarian as Bore'' against the concept of racial superiority and critiqued pseudo-scientific race theories, saying they were akin to a new religion.<ref name="Mayers85-7" /> In ''The Truth About the Tribes'' Chesterton wrote, "the curse of race religion is that it makes each separate man the sacred image which he worships. His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the [[Januarius#Blood|blood of St. Januarius]]."<ref name="Mayers85-7">{{Cite book |last=Mayers |first=Simon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbmWBAAAQBAJ&q=Chesterton%E2%80%99s%20Jews%3A%20Stereotypes%20and%20Caricatures%20in%20the%20Literature%20and%20Journalism%20of%20G.K.%20Chesterton&pg=PA85 |title=Chesterton's Jews: Stereotypes and Caricatures in the Literature and Journalism of G.K.

Mayers also shows that Chesterton portrayed Jews not only as culturally and religiously distinct, but racially as well. In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew "is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race."<ref name="Mayers85-7" />

In ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about [[Blood libel|Jews killing children]] might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote:

<blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name="Mayers85-7" /><ref name="Everlasting">{{Cite book |last=Chesterton |first=G.

===Opposition to eugenics===
In ''Eugenics and Other Evils'', Chesterton attacked [[eugenics]] as Parliament was moving towards passage of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]]. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed "mentally defective"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, "It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children."<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including "Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point ... we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion."<ref name="Eugenics">{{Cite book |last=Chesterton |first=Gilbert Keith |title=Eugenics and Other Evils |publisher=Cassell and Company |year=1922 |location=London, UK}}</ref> He derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, "as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment".<ref name=Eugenics/> Chesterton mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: "[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies ... The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: 'a dustbin of individual accidents,' of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility."<ref name=Eugenics/><ref>[http://www.secondspring.co.uk/articles/sparkes.htm "The Enemy of Eugenics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323214803/http://www.secondspring.co.uk/articles/sparkes.htm |date=23 March 2017 }}, by Russell Sparkes.</ref>

===Chesterton's fence===
'''Chesterton's fence''' is the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton's 1929 book, ''The Thing: Why I Am a Catholic'', in the chapter, "The Drift from Domesticity":

{{quote|In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'<ref>Chesterton, G. K. (1929).

The Ditchling group developed a journal called ''The Game'', in which they expressed many Chestertonian principles, particularly anti-industrialism and an advocacy of religious family life.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} His novel ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' inspired the Irish Republican leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] with the idea that "If you didn't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out."<ref>Forester, Margery (2006). ''Michael Collins – The Lost Leader'', Gill & MacMillan, p. 35.</ref> Collins's favourite work of Chesterton was ''[[The Napoleon of Notting Hill]]'', and he was "almost fanatically attached to it", according to his friend Sir William Darling.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mackay |first=James |title=Michael Collins: A Life |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=1996 |location=London, England |page=Chapter 2}}</ref> His [[Wikisource:Page:1909 sep 18 gk chesterton002.jpg|column]] in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' on 18 September 1909 had a profound effect on [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gandhi |first=Rajmohan |title=Gandhi: The Man, His People, and the Empire |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |location=Los Angeles |pages=139–141}}</ref> [[P.
