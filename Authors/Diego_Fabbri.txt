'''Diego Fabbri''' (July 2, 1911 – August 14, 1980) was an [[Italy|Italian]] playwright whose plays centered on religious ([[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]) themes.

==Early career==
Fabbri graduated from the [[University of Bologna]] in 1936 with a degree in economics and business. But his writing career had begun well before that. His first play, ''The Flowers of Pain'', was published in 1928. He followed it with ''The Node'', which was banned by the fascist government.

In 1938, he collaborated with Guido Chiesa to write the play ''Absent''. In 1939 Fabbri received an invitation to Rome, to become director of the Publisher Avenue. Then, in 1940, he was appointed secretary of the Catholic Film Center. He held the post until 1959. During this time, Fabbri began work on ''The Literary Fair''. His co-director on this project was the poet [[Vincenzo Cardarelli]]. The project could not be completed until 1966, and Vincenzo Cardarelli did not live to see it.

Fabbri was particularly prolific in 1940. In that year, he wrote three plays: “Marshes”, “Meadow”, and “Fun”. The following year he came out with “Orbits”, which was staged at the [[Teatro Quirino]] in Rome. “Marshes” was staged in the same theater in 1942.<ref name="Diego Fabbri">{{cite web|title=Diego Fabbri: The playwright|url=http://www.teatrodiegofabbri.it/il-teatro-diego-fabbri/diego-fabbri-la-storia/|publisher=Diego Fabbri Theatre|accessdate=14 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116091802/http://www.teatrodiegofabbri.it/il-teatro-diego-fabbri/diego-fabbri-la-storia/|archivedate=16 January 2014}}</ref>

==Films==
One of Fabbri's best known works is ''Inquisition'', which was written in 1946.

In 1968 he became President of ETI (Italian Theatre). His term there was marked by a policy of expansion and inculcating a theater culture throughout the country.<ref name="Diego Fabbri"/>

Fabbri commitment to creating a national theater is reflected in the declaration of the manifesto for a theater of the people, which he signed in 1943, along with other prominent literati such as Pandolfi and [[Tullio Pinelli|Pinelli]]. Fabbri was one of the founders of the National Union of Drama Writers in 1945.<ref name="Diego Fabbri"/>
