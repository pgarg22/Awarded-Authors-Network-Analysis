According to Sudanese literary critic [[Lemya Shammat]], <blockquote>"This won him a prominent seat among Sudanese poets, especially those who write in the [[Sudanese Arabic|Sudanese dialect]] and have enthralling oral poetic performances, such as [[Mahjoub Sharif]], Himmaid, and Azhari. Al-Gaddal went on to make an enormous contribution to Sudanese poetry, helping shape a poetic tradition that keenly digs into the challenges and sufferings of everyday life and gives voice to the neglected, disadvantaged, and downtrodden."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shammat|first=Lemya|date=2021-07-15|title=Sudan Says Farewell to Two Greats: Poet Mohammed Taha al-Gaddal and Short-story Writer Eisa Al-Hilo|url=https://arablit.org/2021/07/15/sudan-says-farewell-to-two-greats-poet-taha-al-gaddal-and-short-story-writer-eisa-al-hilo/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-01|website=ArabLit & ArabLit Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>Al-Qaddal died on July 4, 2021, at the age of seventy from symptoms of [[cancer]], in Al-Amal Hospital in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-07-05|title=السودان يودع "القدال" ثالث شعرائه الملهمين|url=https://www.skynewsarabia.com/varieties/1449176-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA-%D9%8A%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-01|website=سكاي نيوز عربية|language=ar}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
On 22 October 2021, the 16th Khartoum International Book Fair was launched, but came to a premature end a few days later, due to the [[October 2021 Sudanese coup d'état|October 2021 Sudanese coup d'etat]]. The organisers had prepared a commemoration of Al-Qaddal's work "for his influential poetic mastery, startling images, wordsmithery, and verbal elegance."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shammat|first=Lemya|date=2021-11-11|title=On the Suspended 2021 Khartoum International Book Fair|url=https://arablit.org/2021/11/11/on-the-suspended-2021-khartoum-international-book-fair/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-11|website=ARABLIT & ARABLIT QUARTERLY|language=en-US}}</ref>
