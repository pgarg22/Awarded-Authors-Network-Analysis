'''Mark Doty''' (born August 10, 1953) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[poet]] and [[memoir]]ist best known for his work ''My Alexandria.'' He was the winner of the [[National Book Award]] for Poetry in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mark-doty|title=Mark Doty|last=Doty|first=Mark|date=2014-02-05|website=Mark Doty|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>

==Early life==
Mark Doty was born in [[Maryville, Tennessee]]<ref name="thescotsmanstanzafestivalmarkdoty">{{cite news|last1=Mansfield|first1=Susan|title=StAnza festival: Mark Doty talks Walt Whitman|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/stanza-festival-mark-doty-talks-walt-whitman-1-2818025|access-date=April 9, 2018|work=The Scotsman|date=March 2, 2013}}</ref> to Lawrence and Ruth Doty, with an older sister, Sarah Alice Doty. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], and received his [[Master of Fine Arts]] in [[creative writing]] from [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.goddard.edu/event/mark-doty-poetry-reading/ |title=Biography on Goddard College webpage |access-date=2016-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230545/https://www.goddard.edu/event/mark-doty-poetry-reading/ |archive-date=July 29, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==
Doty's first collection of poems, ''Turtle, Swan'', was published by [[David R. Godine, Publisher|David R. Godine]] in 1987; a second collection, ''Bethlehem in Broad Daylight'', appeared from the same publisher in 1991. ''Booklist'' described his verse as "quiet, intimate" and praised its original style in turning powerful young urban experience into "an example of how we live, how we suffer and transcend suffering".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mark-doty |title=Biography|access-date=2016-02-26 |work=Poetry Foundation }}</ref>

Doty's "Tiara" was printed in 1990 in an anthology called Poets for Life: Seventy-Six Poets Respond to AIDS. This poem critiques the way society perceived and treated homosexual AIDS sufferers. The 1980s marked the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The Reagan administration's delayed action to fight AIDS resulted in thousands of deaths, especially among young gay men.<ref>Shilts, Randy. And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic. New York: St. Martin's, 1987.</ref> Some believe the initial reluctance to mobilize was due to homophobia—society was, at the time, uncomfortable with gay sexuality. This poem criticizes the idea that gay men "invite[d] their own oppression as a consequence of pleasure."<ref name="Landau, Deborah 1996">Landau, Deborah. "How to Live. What to Do: The Poetics and Politics of AIDS." American Literature 68.1 (1996): 193-225. JSTOR. Web. 19 Mar. 2016.</ref> The poem's phrase "he asked for it" represents this common, unsympathetic opinion about gay men with AIDS. Imagery like "perfect stasis" and "body's paradise" is used by Doty to paint a future beyond brutality and discrimination for AIDS sufferers. According to Landau, Doty's poems were "humane and comforting narratives" that offered hope to people living with HIV and stood in contrast to the hostile climate of the United States.<ref name="Landau, Deborah 1996"/>

His third book of poetry, ''My Alexandria'' (University of Illinois Press, 1993), reflects the grief, perceptions and new awareness gained in the face of great and painful loss. In 1989, Doty's partner Wally Roberts tested positive for [[HIV]].<ref name="toibin">{{citation |title=Love in a Dark Time: And Other Explorations of Gay Lives and Literature |first=Colm |last=Toibin |author-link=Colm Toibin |year=2002 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-7432-4467-2 |page=241}}</ref> The collection, written while Roberts had not yet become ill, contemplates the prospect of mortality, desperately attempting to find some way of making the prospect of loss even momentarily bearable. ''My Alexandria'' was chosen for the National Poetry Series by [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], and won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]]. When the book was published in the [[United Kingdom|U.K]]. by Jonathan Cape, Doty became the first American poet to win the [[T.S. Eliot Prize]], Britain's most significant annual award for poetry.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sutherland |first= Amy |date=2013-01-06 |title=Mark Doty: Poet and biography buff

Doty had begun the poems collected in ''Atlantis'' (HarperCollins, 1995) when Roberts died in 1994. The book won the Bingham Poetry Prize and the Ambassador Book Award. ''Heaven's Coast: A Memoir'' (HarperCollins, 1996), is a meditative account of losing a loved one, and a study in grief. The book received the PEN Martha Albrand Award First Nonfiction.<ref>h//www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/896</ref>

Doty is the author of nine books of poetry, most recently ''Deep Lane'' (W.W. Norton, 2015), a book of descents: into the earth beneath the garden, into the dark substrata of a life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.goddard.edu/event/mark-doty-poetry-reading/ |title=Mark Doty Poetry Reading |access-date=2016-02-26 |work=Notes on Goddard College Lecture series 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230545/https://www.goddard.edu/event/mark-doty-poetry-reading/ |archive-date=July 29, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He has also written essays on still life painting, objects and intimacy, and a handbook for writers.

Doty's three memoirs include ''Heaven's Coast'', described as "searing" by [[The New York Times]], is the excruciating journaling of his thoughts subsequent to hearing his lover's diagnosis with AIDS, a work "layered" with awarenesses like Dante's trip through hell<ref>{{cite news |last=Kirby |first= David |date=1996-03-10 |title=The Survivor (review of Heaven's Coast A Memoir)
