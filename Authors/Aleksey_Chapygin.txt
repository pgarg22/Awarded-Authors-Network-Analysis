'''Aleksey Pavlovich Chapygin''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Па́влович Чапы́гин}}; {{OldStyleDate|17 October|1870|5 October}} - 21 October 1937) was a Russian writer, and one of the founders of the Soviet historical novel.<ref name="Dictionary">Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature, Bédé, Edgerton, Columbia University Press, 1980.</ref>

==Biography==
Chapygin was born in [[Kargopolsky Uyezd]], [[Olonets Governorate]]. His northern peasant origins are reflected in his works.<ref name="Dictionary"/> His first book of stories, ''Those Who Keep Aloof'', and his novel ''The White Hermitage'', describing northern life, were published before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].<ref>''25 Years of Soviet Russian Literature (1918-1943)'', Gleb Struve, Taylor & Francis, 1944.</ref>  He is best known for his two novels about peasant uprisings in the 17th century, ''Itinerant Folk'' (1934–37) and ''[[Stenka Razin|Stepan Razin]]'' (1926–27). ''Stepan Razin'' is considered a classic of Soviet literature.<ref name="Dictionary"/>

Chapygin drew upon Russian folklore for both the style of ''Stepan Razin'' and the positive and romanticized portrait of Razin himself. The Soviets excused this modernization of history as a justifiable polemic against the negative portrayal of Razin in 19th-century Russian literature.<ref name="Dictionary"/> ''Stepan Razin'' was published in the magazine ''Red Virgin Soil''.<ref>Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920s, Robert A. Maguire, Northwestern University Press, 2000.</ref>
