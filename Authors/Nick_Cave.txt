'''Nicholas Edward Cave''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|AO}} (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian singer, songwriter, author, screenwriter, composer and occasional actor. Known for his baritone voice and for fronting the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], Cave's music is generally characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences and lyrical obsessions with death, religion, love and violence.<ref name="erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Steve Huey, [[AllMusic]], [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3854|pure_url=yes}} (((Nick Cave > Biography)))]. Retrieved 30 September 2009.</ref>

Born and raised in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Cave studied art in [[Melbourne]] before fronting [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], one of the city's leading [[post-punk]] bands, in the late 1970s. They relocated to [[London]] in 1980, but, disillusioned by life there, evolved towards a darker, more challenging sound that helped inspire [[gothic rock]], and acquired a reputation as "the most violent live band in the world".<ref>Grice, Sarah (1 October 2014). [https://www.varsity.co.uk/reviews/7469 "Film: 20,000 Days on Earth"], ''Varsity''. Retrieved 1 September 2017.</ref> Cave became recognised for his confrontational performances, his shock of black hair and pale, emaciated look. The band broke up soon after moving to [[Berlin]] in 1982, and Cave formed Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds the year after, later described as one of rock's "most redoubtable, enduring" bands.<ref>Berman, Stuart (6 May 2009). [https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12949-from-her-to-eternity-the-first-born-is-dead-kicking-against-the-pricks-your-funeral-my-trial/ "From Her to Eternity"], ''Pitchfork''. Retrieved 13 September 2020.</ref> Much of their early material is set in a mythic American [[Deep South]], drawing on [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and [[Delta blues]], while Cave's preoccupation with [[Old Testament]] notions of good versus evil culminated in what has been called his [[list of signature songs|signature song]], "[[The Mercy Seat (song)|The Mercy Seat]]" (1988), and in his [[debut novel]], ''[[And the Ass Saw the Angel]]'' (1989). Also in 1988, he starred in ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'', an Australian prison film which he co-wrote and scored.

The 1990s saw Cave move between [[São Paulo]] and England, and find inspiration in the [[New Testament]]. He went on to achieve mainstream success with quieter, piano-driven ballads, notably the [[Kylie Minogue]] duet "[[Where the Wild Roses Grow]]" (1996), and "[[Into My Arms]]" (1997). Turning increasingly to film in the 2000s, Cave wrote the Australian Western ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005), composing its soundtrack with frequent collaborator [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]]. The pair's film score credits include ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[The Road (2009 film)|The Road]]'' (2009) and ''[[Lawless (film)|Lawless]]'' (2012), and their [[garage rock]] side project [[Grinderman]] has released two LPs since 2006. In 2009, he released his second novel ''[[The Death of Bunny Munro]]'', and starred in the semi-fictional "[[day in the life]]" film ''[[20,000 Days on Earth]]'' (2014). His more recent musical work features [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] elements, as well as increasingly abstract lyrics, informed in part by grief over his son Arthur's 2015 death, which is explored in the documentary ''[[One More Time with Feeling]]'' (2016) and the Bad Seeds' 17th and latest LP, ''[[Ghosteen]]'' (2019).

Cave maintains The Red Hand Files, a newsletter he uses to respond to questions from fans. His work is the subject of academic study, and his songs have been [[cover version|covered]] by a wide range of artists, including [[Johnny Cash]] ("The Mercy Seat"), [[Metallica]] ("[[Loverman]]") and [[Snoop Dogg]] ("[[Red Right Hand]]"). He was inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] in 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22606485-1702,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005174755/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22606485-1702,00.html|url-status=dead|title=Nick Cave to enter ARIA Hall of Fame|archive-date=5 October 2009}}</ref> and named an [[Order of Australia|Officer of the Order of Australia]] in 2017.
In 2020, Nick Cave launched Cave Things, a store that sells things conceived, sourced, shaped and designed by Nick Cave.

==Music career==

===Early years and the Birthday Party (1973–1983)===
{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}

In 1973, Cave met [[Mick Harvey]] (guitar), [[Phill Calvert]] (drums), John Cochivera (guitar), Brett Purcell (bass), and Chris Coyne (saxophone); fellow students at Caulfield Grammar. They founded a band with Cave as singer. Their repertoire consisted of rudimentary [[cover versions]] of songs by [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Roxy Music]] and [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]], among others. Later, the line-up slimmed down to four members including Cave's friend [[Tracy Pew]] on bass. In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name The Boys Next Door and began playing predominantly original material. Guitarist and songwriter [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978.

They were a leader of Melbourne's post-punk scene in the late 1970s, playing hundreds of live shows in Australia before changing their name to the Birthday Party in 1980 and moving to London, then [[West Berlin]]. Cave's Australian girlfriend and muse [[Anita Lane]] accompanied them to London. The band were notorious for their provocative live performances which featured Cave shrieking, bellowing and throwing himself about the stage, backed up by harsh pounding rock music laced with guitar [[Audio feedback|feedback]]. Cave utilised [[Old Testament]] imagery with lyrics about sin, debauchery and damnation.<ref name=rey>{{cite book |author=Reynolds, Simon |title=Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984 |year=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyn/page/429 429–431] |publisher=London: Faber and Faber, 2005 |isbn=0-571-21569-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyn/page/429 }}</ref> Cave's droll sense of humour and penchant for parody is evident in many of the band's songs, including "Nick the Stripper" and "[[King Ink]]". "[[Release the Bats]]", one of the band's most famous songs, was intended as an over-the-top "[[taking the piss|piss-take]]" on [[gothic rock]], and a "direct attack" on the "stock gothic associations that less informed critics were wont to make". Ironically, it became highly influential on the genre, giving rise to a new generation of bands.<ref>Welberry, Karren (ed.) (2016). ''Cultural Seeds: Essays on the Work of Nick Cave''. Routledge. p. 87-88</ref>

After establishing a cult following in Europe and Australia, the Birthday Party disbanded in 1983.

===Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (1984–present)===

{{Main|Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds}}
The band with Cave as their leader and frontman has released seventeen studio albums. [[Pitchfork Media]] calls the group one of rock's "most enduring, redoubtable" bands, with an accomplished discography.<ref>Stuart Berman, [[Pitchfork Media]], [https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12949-from-her-to-eternity-the-first-born-is-dead-kicking-against-the-pricks-your-funeral-my-trial/ "Album reviews: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds: From Her to Eternity / The First Born is Dead / Kicking Against the Pricks / Your Funeral&nbsp;... My Trial"], 6 May 2009. Retrieved 30 September 2009.</ref> Though their sound tends to change considerably from one album to another, the one constant of the band is an unpolished blending of disparate genres, and song structures which provide a vehicle for Cave's virtuosic, frequently histrionic theatrics. Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Steve Huey wrote: "With the Bad Seeds, Cave continued to explore his obsessions with religion, death, love, America, and violence with a bizarre, sometimes self-consciously eclectic hybrid of blues, gospel, rock, and arty post-punk."<ref name="erlewine" />
[[File:Nick Cave- Hamburg 2001.jpg|thumb|Hamburg/Germany July 2001]]
Reviewing 2008's ''[[Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!]]'' album, ''[[NME]]'' used the phrase "[[gothic rock|gothic]] psycho-sexual apocalypse" to describe the "menace" present in the lyrics of the title track.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds/9484 |title= Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Dig!!!

In September 2013 interview, Cave explained that he returned to using a typewriter for songwriting after his experience with the ''Nocturama'' album, as he "could walk in on a bad day and hit 'delete' and that was the end of it". Cave believes that he lost valuable work due to a "bad day".<ref name="Big" />

===Grinderman (2006–present)===
{{Main|Grinderman}}
[[File:Grinderman 2008.jpg|thumb|Cave and Ellis performing as Grinderman in 2008]]
In 2006 Cave formed Grinderman – himself on vocals, guitar, organ & piano, [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]] (tenor guitar, electric mandolin, violin, viola, guitar, backing vocals), [[Martyn P. Casey]] (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and [[Jim Sclavunos]] (drums, percussion, backing vocals).

The alternative rock outfit was formed as "a way to escape the weight of The Bad Seeds."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cave|first1=Nick|year=2010|title=And Now It's Cave's ''Other'' Deranged Blues Band!|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|issue=September 2010|page=55}}</ref> The band's name was inspired by a [[Memphis Slim]] song, "Grinder Man Blues," which Cave is noted to have started singing during one of the band's early rehearsal sessions. The band's eponymous debut studio album, ''[[Grinderman (album)|Grinderman]]'', was released in 2007 to extremely positive reviews and the band's second and final studio album, ''[[Grinderman 2]]'', was released in 2010 to a similar reception.

Grinderman's first public performance was at [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] in April 2007 where [[Bobby Gillespie]] from [[Primal Scream]] accompanied Grinderman on backing vocals and percussion.

In December 2011, after performing at [[Meredith Music Festival]], Cave announced that Grinderman was over.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Cave announces that Grinderman are "over" – News &#124; thevine.com.au |url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/news/nick-cave-announces-that-grinderman-was-%27over%2720111211.aspx |work=The Vine |author=Marcus |date=11 December 2011 |access-date=11 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831203148/http://www.thevine.com.au/music/news/nick-cave-announces-that-grinderman-was-%27over%2720111211.aspx |archive-date=31 August 2013 }}</ref> Two years later, Grinderman performed both weekends at the 2013 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], as did Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-nick-cave-on-his-coachella-sets-and-denying-himself-sacred-moments-100399/ |author=Fricke, David |title=Q&A: Nick Cave on His Coachella Sets and Denying Himself 'Sacred Moments' |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611153248/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-nick-cave-on-his-coachella-sets-and-denying-himself-sacred-moments-100399/ |archive-date=11 June 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

===Music in film and television drama===
Cave's work was featured in a scene in the 1986 film, ''[[Dogs in Space]]'' by Richard Lowenstein.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/dbase/1997/pascho.htm|title=''Dogs in Space''|website=Murdoch.edu.au|access-date=22 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321234247/http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/dbase/1997/pascho.htm|archive-date=21 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Cave performed parts of the Boys Next Door song "[[Shivers (The Boys Next Door song)|Shivers]]" twice during the film, once on video and once live.

Two more songs were included in Wenders' 1993 sequel ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'', including the title track. The soundtrack for Wenders' 1991 film ''[[Until the End of the World]]'' features Cave's "(I'll Love You) Till the End of the World." His most recent production, ''[[Palermo Shooting]]'', also contains a Nick Cave song, as does his 2003 documentary ''[[The Soul of a Man]]''.<ref>"[https://www.pbs.org/theblues/aboutfilms/wenders.html The Blues: The Soul of a Man]", [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].

In ''[[Scream 3]]'', the song was given a reworking with Cave writing new lyrics and adding an orchestra to the arrangement of the track.  "People Ain't No Good" was featured in the animated movie ''[[Shrek 2]]'' and the song "O Children" was featured in the 2010 movie ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1]].''

In 2000 [[Andrew Dominik]] used "Release the Bats" in his film ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]''. Numerous other movies use Cave's songs including ''[[Box of Moonlight]]'' (1996), ''[[Mr In-Between]]'' (2001), ''[[Romance & Cigarettes]]'' (2005), ''[[Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant]]'' (2009), ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'', ''[[Gas Food Lodging]]'', ''[[Kevin & Perry Go Large]]'', ''[[About Time (2013 film)|About Time]]''

===Collaborations===
During the 1982 recording sessions for the Birthday Party's ''[[Junkyard (album)|Junkyard]]'' LP, Cave, together with band-mates Harvey and Howard, joined members of [[the Go-Betweens]] to form [[Tuff Monks]]. The short-lived band released one single, "After the Fireworks", and played live only once. Later that year, Cave contributed to the ''[[Honeymoon in Red]]'' concept album. Intended as a collaboration between the Birthday Party and [[Lydia Lunch]], the album was not released until 1987, by which time Lunch had fallen out with Cave, who she credits on the release as "Anonymous", "Her Dead Twin" and "A Drunk Cowboy Junkie". During the Birthday Party's Berlin period, Cave collaborated with local post-punk group [[Die Haut]] on their album ''[[Burnin' the Ice]]'', released in 1983. In the immediate aftermath of the Birthday Party's breakup, Cave performed several shows in the United States as part of [[The Immaculate Consumptive]], a short-lived "[[supergroup (music)|super-group]]" with Lunch, [[Marc Almond]] and [[JG Thirlwell|Clint Ruin]].<ref>Walker, Clinton (1984).

[[File:JohnnyCash1969.jpg|thumb|left|After covering one another's songs, Cave and [[Johnny Cash]] (pictured) recorded duets together for what would be the latter's final album.]]
A lifelong fan of [[Johnny Cash]], Cave covered his song "The Singer" (originally "[[The Folk Singer]]") for the 1986 album ''Kicking Against the Pricks'', which Cash seemingly repaid by covering "The Mercy Seat" on ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' (2000). Cave was then invited to contribute to the liner notes of the retrospective ''[[The Essential Johnny Cash]]'' CD, released to coincide with Cash's 70th birthday. Subsequently, Cave recorded a duet with Cash, a version of [[Hank Williams]]' "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]", for what would be Cash's final album, ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' (2002). Another duet between the two artists, the American folk song "[[Cindy (folk song)|Cindy]]", was released posthumously on ''[[Unearthed (Johnny Cash album)|Unearthed]]'', a boxset of outtakes. Cave's song "Let the Bells Ring", released on the 2004 album ''Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus'', is a posthumous tribute to Cash.

Cave played with [[Shane MacGowan]] on [[cover version]]s of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "Death is Not the End" and [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]". Cave also performed "What a Wonderful World" live with [[the Flaming Lips]]. Cave recorded a cover version of the Pogues song "[[Rainy Night in Soho]]", written by MacGowan. MacGowan also sings a version of "Lucy", released on ''B-Sides and Rarities''. On 3 May 2008, during the ''Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!'' tour, MacGowan joined Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on stage to perform "Lucy" at Dublin Castle in Ireland. [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s single "[[Bad Cover Version]]" includes on its B-side a cover version by Cave of that band's song "[[Disco 2000 (song)|Disco 2000]]". On the Deluxe Edition of Pulp's ''[[Different Class]]'' another take of this cover can be found.

In 2004, Cave gave a hand to [[Marianne Faithfull]] on the album, ''Before the Poison''. He co-wrote and produced three songs ("Crazy Love", "There is a Ghost" and "Desperanto"), and the Bad Seeds are featured on all of them. He is also featured on "The Crane Wife" (originally by [[the Decemberists]]), on Faithfull's 2008 album, ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (Marianne Faithfull album)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]''.

[[File:PJ Harvey at the O2 Apollo4.jpg|thumb|upright|Cave's ex-partner, [[PJ Harvey]], appears on his ''Murder Ballads'' LP, notably the single "[[Young Hunting#Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds version|Henry Lee]]".]]
Cave provided guest vocals on the title track of [[Current 93]]'s 1996 album ''[[All the Pretty Little Horses (album)|All the Pretty Little Horses]]'', as well as the closer "Patripassian". For his 1996 album ''[[Murder Ballads]]'', Cave recorded "[[Where the Wild Roses Grow]]" with [[Kylie Minogue]], and "[[Young Hunting#Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds version|Henry Lee]]" with [[PJ Harvey]].

Cave also took part in the "X-Files" compilation CD with some other artists, where he reads parts from the Bible combined with own texts, like "Time Jesum&nbsp;...", he outed himself as a fan of the series some years ago, but since he does not watch much TV, it was one of the only things he watched. He collaborated on the 2003 single "Bring It On", with [[Chris Bailey (musician)|Chris Bailey]], formerly of the Australian punk group, The Saints. Cave contributed vocals to the song "Sweet Rosyanne", on the 2006 album ''Catch That Train!'' from Dan Zanes & Friends, a children's music group.

In 2010 Nick Cave began a series of duets with [[Debbie Harry]] for [[Jeffrey Lee Pierce|The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project – We Are Only Riders|url=http://label.glitterhouse.com/releases.php?show=13|website=Glitterhouse Records|access-date=11 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project – The Journey is Long|url=http://label.glitterhouse.com/releases.php?show=152|website=Glitterhouse Records|access-date=30 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project – Axels & Sockets|url=http://label.glitterhouse.com/releases.php?show=190|website=Glitterhouse Records|access-date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, Cave recorded a cover of the Zombies' "[[She's Not There]]" with [[Neko Case]], which was used at the end of the first episode of the fourth season of ''[[True Blood]]''.

==Writing==
Cave released his first book, ''King Ink'', in 1988. It is a collection of lyrics and plays, including collaborations with [[Lydia Lunch]]. In 1997, he followed up with ''King Ink II'', containing lyrics, poems, and the transcript of a radio essay he did for the [[BBC]] in July 1996, "The Flesh Made Word," discussing in biographical format his relationship with Christianity.
[[File:Nick Cave in New York City 2009 portrait 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cave reading from ''[[The Death of Bunny Munro]]'' in New York City, 2009.]]
While he was based in [[West Berlin]], Cave started working on what was to become his debut novel, ''[[And the Ass Saw the Angel]]'' (1989). Significant crossover is evident between the [[Theme (literature)|theme]]s in the book and the lyrics Cave wrote in the late stages of the Birthday Party and the early stage of his solo career. "Swampland", from ''Mutiny'', in particular, uses the same linguistic stylings ('mah' for 'my', for instance) and some of the same themes (the narrator being haunted by the memory of a girl called Lucy, being hunted like an animal, approaching death and execution). On 21 January 2008, a special edition of Cave's novel ''And the Ass Saw the Angel'' was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=28460_0_2_1_C |title=Nick Cave sees debut novel 'And The Ass Saw the Angel' re-released as collectors edition |website=Side-line.com |date=15 January 2008 |access-date=2 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520133047/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=28460_0_2_1_C |archive-date=20 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cave's second novel ''[[The Death of Bunny Munro]]'' was published on 8 September 2009 by Harper Collins books.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/nme/46636|title=Nick Cave announces release date for new novel – News|date=11 August 2009|website=Nmr.com|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/9781554685400/The_Death_of_Bunny_Munro/index.aspx|title=The Death of Bunny Munro: A Novel By Nick Cave|website=Harpercollins.ca|access-date=22 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120150632/http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/9781554685400/The_Death_of_Bunny_Munro/index.aspx|archive-date=20 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Telling the story of a sex-addicted salesman, it was also released as a [[binaural recording|binaural]] audio-book produced by British Artists [[Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard]] and an iPhone app.<ref>Breihan, Tom [https://pitchfork.com/news/36434-nick-caves-new-novel-ibunny-munroi-gets-its-own-iphone-app-tour/ "Nick Cave's New Novel Bunny Munro Gets its Own iPhone App, Tour"] September 2009.</ref> The book originally started as a screenplay Cave was going to write for [[John Hillcoat]].<ref>Khanna, Vish [http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=137&csid2=946&fid1=41546 "Conversations: Nick Cave"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209151414/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=137&csid2=946&fid1=41546 |date=9 December 2009 }} at ''[[Exclaim!]]'' October 2009.</ref>

Aside from movie soundtracks, Cave also wrote the screenplays for [[John Hillcoat]]'s [[The Proposition (2005 film)|''The Proposition'']] (2005) and [[Lawless (film)|''Lawless'']] (2012).

As proof of his interest in scripture, so evident in his lyrics and his prose writing, Cave wrote the foreword to a [[Canongate Books|Canongate]] publication of the ''[[Gospel according to Mark]]'', published in the UK in 1998. The American edition of the same book (published by [[Grove Press]]) contains a foreword by the noted American writer [[Barry Hannah]].

==Acting==
Cave's first film appearance was in [[Wim Wenders]]' 1987 film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', in which he and the Bad Seeds are shown performing at a concert in Berlin.

Cave has made occasional appearances as an actor. He appears alongside [[Blixa Bargeld]] in the 1988 [[Peter Sempel]] film ''Dandy'', playing dice, singing and speaking from his Berlin apartment. He is most prominently featured in the 1989 film ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'', written and directed by [[John Hillcoat]], and in the 1991 film ''[[Johnny Suede]]'' with [[Brad Pitt]].

Cave appeared in the 2005 homage to [[Leonard Cohen]], ''[[Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man]]'', in which he performed "[[I'm Your Man (Leonard Cohen song)|I'm Your Man]]" solo, and "[[Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)|Suzanne]]" with [[Julie Christensen]] and [[Perla Batalla]]. He also appeared in the 2007 film adaptation of Ron Hansen's novel ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'', where he sings "[[The Ballad of Jesse James]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.screendaily.com/the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford/4034289.article |title=The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford |first=Lee |last=Marshall |date=3 September 2007 |access-date=14 August 2019 |magazine=[[Screen Daily]] |publisher=Media Business Insight Limited}}</ref> Cave and Warren Ellis are credited for the film's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rose |first=Kara |url=http://www.harpmagazine.com/news/detail.cfm?article=12010 |title=Cave and Ellis For Jesse James Soundtrack |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070812014745/http://www.harpmagazine.com/news/detail.cfm?article=12010 |archive-date=12 August 2007 |journal=[[HARP (magazine)|HARP]] |date=6 December 2007 |access-date=10 February 2019 |publisher=Guthrie, Inc.}}</ref> Nick Cave and his son Luke performed one of the songs on the soundtrack together.

==Screenwriting==
[[File:Nick Cave Cannes 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Cave at the 2012 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Cave wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'', a film about [[bushranger]]s in the Australian [[outback]] during the late 19th century. Directed by John Hillcoat and filmed in [[Queensland]] in 2004, it premiered in October 2005 and was later released worldwide to critical acclaim.<ref>Brett McCracken, [http://www.relevantmagazine.com/pc_article.php?id=7190 Film Review of ''The Proposition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018124700/http://www.relevantmagazine.com/pc_article.php?id=7190 |date=18 October 2006 }}, ''[[Relevant Magazine]]''. Retrieved 25 November 2008.</ref> Cave explained his personal background in relation to writing the film's screenplay in a 2013 interview:

<blockquote>
I had written long-form before but it is pure story-telling in script writing and that goes back as far as I can remember for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say "tell me a story" so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.<ref name="Big" /></blockquote>

The film critic for British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' called ''The Proposition'' "peerless," "a star-studded and uncompromisingly violent outlaw film."<ref>Will Self, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090520163055/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-proposition-bringing-the-revisionist-western-to-the-australian-outback-468212.html The Proposition: Bringing the revisionist Western to the Australian outback]," The Independent.

==Blogging==
Cave currently maintains a personal blog and an online correspondence page with his fans called ''The Red Hand Files'' which is seen as a continuation of ''In Conversation,'' a series of live personal talks Cave had held in which the audience were free to ask questions. On the page, Cave discusses various issues ranging from art, religion, current affairs and music, as well as using it as a free platform in which fans are encouraged to ask personal questions on any topic of their choosing.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/nick-cave-says-hes-repelled-woke-cultures-self-righteous-belief-lack-humility-2557386|title= Nick Cave says he's "repelled" by 'woke' culture's "self-righteous belief" and "lack of humility" |work= NME |first=Patrick |last=Clarke |date= 15 October 2019| access-date=28 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="Cunningham">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/27/nick-cave-red-hand-files|title= Nick Cave is showing us a new, gentler way to use the internet|work= The Guardian |first=Russell |last=Cunningham |date= 27 November 2018| access-date=28 May 2020}}</ref> Cave's intimate approach to the Question & Answer format on ''The Red Hand Files'' was praised by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "a shelter from the online storm free of discord and conspiracies, and in harmony with the internet vision of [[Tim Berners-Lee]]."<ref name="Cunningham"/>

==Personal life==

Cave left Australia in 1980. After stints living in London, Berlin, and São Paulo, he moved to [[Brighton]], England in the early 2000s. A film about Cave's life, titled ''[[20,000 Days on Earth]]'' and directed by artists [[Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard]], was released in mid-2014, shortly before his 57th birthday.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/27/day-in-the-life-nick-cave?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Interview: A Day in the Life of Nick Cave |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 July 2013 |access-date=22 October 2013}}</ref>

Cave also appears in a 2020 short documentary by [[Paul Szynol]], titled ''I Want Everything'', about [[Larry Sloman]], who records a tribute to Cave's son Arthur.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/nick-cave-ratso-i-want-everything-trailer-1003742/ |title=See Nick Cave Praise Rock Writer 'Ratso' in Trailer for Short Film |newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=30 June 2020}}</ref>

In 2017, Cave reportedly told ''[[GQ]]'' magazine that he and his family were considering moving from Brighton to [[Los Angeles]] as, after the death of his 15-year-old son, Arthur, they "just find it too difficult to live here."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-love-and-terror-of-nick-cave|title=The Love and Terror of Nick Cave|last=Heath|first=Chris|date=27 April 2017|work=GQ|access-date=1 October 2018|language=en}}</ref> In late 2020, local articles told of his activity and residence in the Brighton area, indicating he had not moved.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2020/11/09/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-donate-rare-items-to-support-brighton-homeless-charity/|title=Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds donate rare items to support Brighton homeless charity|last=Le Duc|first=Frank|date=9 November 2020|work=Brighton & Hove News|access-date=3 March 2021|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18696228.brightons-nick-cave-delights-fans-new-film-live-album/|title=Brighton's Nick Cave delights fans with new film and live album|last=Mayo|first=Kim|date=5 September 2020|work=The Argus|access-date=3 March 2021|language=en}}</ref>

===Partners and children===
Cave dated [[Anita Lane]] from the late 1970s to mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/anita-lane-mn0000572953/biography|title=Anita Lane {{!}} Biography & History|last=Hage|first=Erik|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref> Cave and Lane recorded together on a few occasions.

Cave then moved to [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], Brazil, in 1990, where he met and married his first wife, Brazilian journalist Viviane Carneiro. She gave birth to their son Luke in 1991. Nick and Viviane were married for six years and divorced in 1996.<ref name="Nick Cave Interviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-cave.com/interviews/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1051742708&archive=&cnshow=headlines&start_from=|title=Nick Cave Interviews|website=Nick-cave.com|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-date=8 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108234357/http://www.nick-cave.com/interviews/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1051742708&archive=&cnshow=headlines&start_from=|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Cave's second son, Jethro, was also born in 1991 and grew up with his mother, Beau Lazenby, in Melbourne, Australia.

In 1997, Cave met British model Susie Bick. Bick was the cover model on the [[The Damned (band)|Damned]]'s 1985 album ''[[Phantasmagoria (The Damned album)|Phantasmagoria]]'' and a [[Vivienne Westwood]] model.

Cave's son Arthur, 15, fell from a cliff at [[Ovingdean]], near Brighton, and died from his injuries on 14 July 2015.

Cave is the godfather to [[Michael Hutchence]]'s daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Cave: Fan Factoids|url=http://everguide.com.au/music/gigs-and-festivals/news/nick-cave-fan-factoids-.aspx|work=Everguide|publisher=Lifelounge Pty Ltd|access-date=19 October 2013|first=Lauren|last=Bertacchini|date=26 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019053643/http://everguide.com.au/music/gigs-and-festivals/news/nick-cave-fan-factoids-.aspx|archive-date=19 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Cave performed "Into My Arms" at the televised funeral of [[Michael Hutchence]], but insisted that the cameras cease rolling during his performance.

===Religion===
Cave is an avid reader of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, Cave said that any true love song is a song for [[God]], and ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the [[Old Testament]] to the [[New Testament|New]]. When asked if he had interest in religions outside of Christianity, Cave quipped that he had a passing, sceptical interest but was a "hammer-and-nails kind of guy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartlett |first= Thomas |url= http://www.salon.com/2004/11/18/cave_4/ |title=The Resurrection of Nick Cave |website=Salon |date=18 November 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831022512/http://www.salon.com/2004/11/18/cave_4/ |archive-date=31 August 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

Despite that, Cave has also said he is critical of organized religion. When interviewed by [[Jarvis Cocker]] on 12{{nbsp}}September 2010, for his BBC Radio{{nbsp}}6 show ''Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service'', Cave said, "I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tqjr4|work=BBC 6|publisher=BBC|access-date=13 December 2013|first=Jarvis|last= Cocker|date=12 September 2010}}</ref> Moreover, Cave has always been open about his doubts.  When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal God, Cave's reply was "No".<ref>{{cite news| quote=Do I personally believe in a personal God? No.| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2009/sep/10/nick-cave-bunny-munro | newspaper=The Guardian | title= Nick Cave on The Death of Bunny Munro|date=11 September 2009|access-date=14 December 2013}}</ref> The following year, he stated, "I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It's kind of defending the indefensible, though; I'm critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they're becoming. But I think as an artist, particularly, it's a necessary part of what I do, that there is some divine element going on within my songs."<ref>{{Cite news|first=John|last= Payne |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title= Nick Cave's master plan |url= https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-nick-cave-20101129,0,4557691.story |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101130142313/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-nick-cave-20101129,0,4557691.story |archive-date=30 November 2010 |url-status=dead |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

These doubts were once a source of discomfort to Cave, but he eventually concluded:
{{Quote | Although I've never been an atheist, there are periods when I struggled with the whole thing.  As someone who uses words, you need to be able to justify your belief with language, I'd have arguments and the atheist always won because he'd go back to logic. Belief in God is illogical, it's absurd. There's no debate. I feel it intuitively, it comes from the heart, a magical place. But I still I fluctuate from day to day. Sometimes I feel very close to the notion of God, other times I don't.  I used to see that as a failure. Now I see it as a strength, especially compared to the more fanatical notions of what God is. I think doubt is an essential part of belief.<ref>{{cite book |last= Snow |first= Mat |date=21 January 2011 |title= Nick Cave: Sinner Saint: The True Confessions, Thirty Years of Essential Interviews |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yh9iDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT241 |publisher=Plexus |isbn= 978-0-85965448-7}}</ref>}}

In 2019, Cave expressed his personal disagreement with both organized religion and atheism (in particular [[New Atheism]]) when questioned about his beliefs by a fan during a Question and Answer session on his ''Red Hand Files'' blog.<ref name="Clarke"/> On the same blog, Cave confirmed he believed in God in June 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theredhandfiles.com/struggling-getting-old/|title=Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #153|date=June 2021|website=www.theredhandfiles.com|access-date=20 June 2021}}</ref>

===Politics===
In November 2017, Cave resisted demands from musicians [[Brian Eno]] and [[Roger Waters]] to cancel two concerts in [[Tel Aviv]] after Eno and Waters published a letter asking Cave to avoid performing in Israel while "apartheid remains". Cave went on to describe the [[Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement as "cowardly and shameful", and that calls to boycott the country are "partly the reason I am playing Israel – not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians." He furthermore responded with an open letter to Eno to defend his position.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Cave Defends Israel Concert in Open Letter to Brian Eno|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/nick-cave-defend-israel-concert-open-letter-brian-eno-767744/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=31 July 2019|first=Jon|last=Blistein|date=11 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nick Cave: cultural boycott of Israel is 'cowardly and shameful'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/11/nick-cave-cultural-boycott-israel-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=31 July 2019|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|date=11 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NICK CAVE: BOYCOTTING ISRAEL IS 'COWARDLY AND SHAMEFUL'|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Nick-Cave-Boycotting-Israel-is-cowardly-and-shameful-574121|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|access-date=31 July 2019|first=Amy|last=Spiro|date=12 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, Cave wrote in defense of singer [[Morrissey]] after the latter expressed a series of controversial political statements during the release of his ''[[California Son]]'' album which led to some record stores refusing to stock it. Cave argued that Morrissey should have that right to freedom of speech to state his opinions while everyone should be able to "challenge them when and wherever possible, but allow his music to live on, bearing in mind we are all conflicted individuals." He also added it would be "dangerous" to censor Morrissey from expressing his beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://pitchfork.com/news/nick-cave-questions-morrisseys-politics-defends-his-music-and-free-speech-in-open-letter/|title= Nick Cave Questions Morrissey's Politics, Defends His Music and Free Speech in Open Letter |work= Pitchfork |first=Noah |last=Yoo |date=28 June 2019 | access-date=27 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="Clarke"/>

In response to a fan asking about his political beliefs, Cave expressed a disdain for "atheism, organised religion, radical bi-partisan politics and [[woke]] culture" on his ''Red Hand Files'' blog. He in particular singled out [[woke]] politics and culture for criticism, describing it as "finding energy in self-righteous belief and the suppression of contrary systems of thought" and "regardless of the virtuous intentions of many woke issues, it is its lack of humility and the paternalistic and doctrinal sureness of its claims that repel me."<ref name="Clarke"/> In 2020, Cave also expressed opposition to [[cancel culture]] and misguided political correctness, describing both as "bad religion run amuck" and their "refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/12/nick-cave-political-correctness-bad-religion-run-amuck-cancel-culture|title=Nick Cave: 'cancel culture is bad religion run amuck'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 August 2020|access-date=11 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-is-mercy-for-you/|title=Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #109|date=August 2020|website=www.theredhandfiles.com|access-date=11 August 2021}}</ref>
