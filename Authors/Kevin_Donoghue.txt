The '''Portland, Maine City Council''' is the legislative branch of government for the city of [[Portland, Maine]]. It is a nine seat council, composed of representatives from the city's five districts, three councilors elected citywide and the full-time elected [[List of mayors of Portland, Maine|Mayor of Portland]]. The eight councilors are elected for three-year terms, while the Mayor is elected for a four-year term. 

The Council is officially non-partisan, though councilors are often known for their political party affiliation.

In 1923, the system was changed from a strong mayor system to a weak, largely ceremonial mayor position due to the influence of the [[Ku Klux Klan in Maine#The Klan and the Portland Referendum of 1923|Maine Ku Klux Klan]], which resented the perceived growing political power of ethnic and religious minorities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/opinion/why-portland-doesnt-have-an-elected-mayor_2010-09-27.html|title=Maine Voices: Why Portland doesn't have an elected mayor|last=Peck|first=Abraham|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref> In 2011 the city charter was changed to allow an election for mayor again in [[2011 Portland, Maine mayoral election|2011]]. Subsequent elections were held in [[2015 Portland, Maine mayoral election|2015]] and [[2019 Portland, Maine mayoral election|2019]].

In 2020, voters approved a proposal to switch elections for City Council and school board to [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice elections]]. 

The Portland City Council meets at [[Portland City Hall (Maine)|Portland City Hall]], an historic 1909 building on [[Congress Street (Portland, Maine)|Congress Street]].
