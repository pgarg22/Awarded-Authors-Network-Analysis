'''Tobias George Smollett''' (baptised 19 March 1721 – 17 September 1771) was a Scottish poet and author. He was best known for [[picaresque novel]]s such as ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]]'' (1748), ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'' (1751) and ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' (1771),<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=MacPherson |first=Hamish |date=14 March 2021 |title=Back in the Day - Pioneering novelist who turned to writing after falling on hard times |page=11 |work=The National - Seven Days |url=https://www.thenational.scot/ |url-status=live |access-date=14 March 2021}}</ref> which influenced later novelists, including [[Charles Dickens]]. His novels were liberally altered by contemporary printers; an authoritative edition of each was edited by Dr O. M. Brack Jr and others.

==Early life and family==
Smollett was born at Dalquhurn, now part of [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]] in present-day [[West Dunbartonshire]], Scotland, and baptised on 19 March 1721 (his birth date is estimated as 3 days previously).<ref name=":0"/> He was the fourth son of Archibald Smollett of [[Bonhill]], a judge and landowner, laird of [[Bonhill]], living at Dalquhurn<ref>{{Cite web |title=Renton, Old Dalquhurn House {{!}} Canmore|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/42375/renton-old-dalquhurn-house |access-date=2021-03-14 |website=canmore.org.uk |language=en}}</ref> on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]], who died about 1726, when Smollett was just five years old. His mother Barbara Smollett née Cunningham brought the family up there, until she died about 1766. He had a brother, Captain James Smollett, and a sister, Jean Smollett, who married Alexander Telfair of Symington, Ayrshire. Jean succeeded to Bonhill after the death of her [[wikt:cousin-german|cousin-german]], Mr Commissary Smollett, and resumed her maiden name of Smollett in 1780. They lived in St John Street off Canongate, Edinburgh, and had a son who was in the military.

==Education and career==
Smollett attended Dumbarton Grammar School then was educated at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he studied medicine and eventually qualified as a surgeon.<ref name=":0"/> Some biographers assert that he then proceeded to the [[University of Edinburgh]], but left without earning a degree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} Others state that his career in medicine came second to his literary ambitions at the age of 18,<ref name=":0"/> and it was not until 1750, that Smollett was granted his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree at the [[University of Aberdeen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In 1739 he went to [[London]] having written a play ''The Regicide'', about the murder of [[James I of Scotland|King James I]] of Scotland. Unsuccessful at getting this on stage, he obtained a commission as a [[naval surgeon]] on {{HMS|Chichester|1695|6}} and travelled to [[Jamaica]], where he settled down for several years. In 1742 he served as a surgeon during the disastrous campaign to [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|capture Cartagena]]. These experiences was later included in the narrative of his novels.<ref name=":0"/>

He married a wealthy Jamaican heiress, Anne "Nancy" Lascelles (1721–1791). She was a daughter of William Lascelles, but was unable to access her inheritance as it was invested in land and slaves. On their return to Britain, at the end of his Navy commission, Smollett established a practice in [[Downing Street]]  but his wife did not join him until 1747;<ref name=":0"/> they had a daughter Elizabeth, who died aged 15 years about 1762. His two native languages were [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. He translated famous works of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] from other European languages.

==Written works==
Smollett's first published work in 1746,<ref name=":0"/> was a poem about the [[Battle of Culloden]] entitled "''The Tears of Scotland''",<ref name=":0"/> but it was ''The Adventures of Roderick Random'', a semi-autobiogaphical story of a' north Britain on the make'<ref name=":0"/> which made his name. His poetry was described as "delicate, sweet and murmurs as a stream."<ref>George Gilfillan's dissertation in ''The Poetical Works of Johnson, Parnell, Gray and Smollett'' 1855, kindle ebook 1855 ASIN B004TQHGGE</ref> ''The Adventures of Roderick Random'' was modelled on [[Alain-René Le Sage|Le Sage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' and despite its scandalous content covering 'snobbery, prostitution, debt and hinting at homosexuality', it was published<ref name=":0"/> in 1748. After that, Smollett finally had his [[tragedy]] ''The Regicide'' published, although it was never performed. 

In 1750, he travelled to [[France]], where he obtained material for his second novel, ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'', another success. Having lived for a brief time in [[Bath, England|Bath]], he returned to London and published ''[[The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom]]'' in 1753, but this did not sell well and he went into debt. His novels were published by the well-known London bookseller [[Andrew Millar]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/ |title=Andrew Millar Project, University of Edinburgh |website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-03}}</ref> Smollett became considered as a 'man of letters'<ref name=":0"/> and associated with such figures as [[David Garrick]], [[Laurence Sterne]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]],<ref name=":0"/> and [[Samuel Johnson]], <ref name=":0"/> whom he famously nicknamed "that Great [[Khan (title)|Cham]] of literature".<ref>Bartleby [http://www.bartleby.com/81/7533.html].</ref> 

In 1755 he published an English translation of [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'', which he revised in 1761. In 1756, he became briefly editor of the 58-volume ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History]],'' and editor of ''[[The Critical Review]],'' from which later he had  a successful libel case brought against him by Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], and a three month prison sentence, and fine of £100.<ref name=":0"/>

[[File:Tobias Smollet (Nathaniel Dance-Holland).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Tobias Smollett by [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]], ca. 1764]]
Smollett then began what he regarded as his major work, ''A Complete History of England'' (1757–1765) which helped recoup his finances,<ref name=":0" /> along with profits from his only performed play, a farce, ''The Reprisal of the Tars of Old England.'' After his imprisonment, he used the experience in producing another novel, ''[[The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves]]'' (1760).<ref name=":0"/> 

In 1763, Smollett was ill, perhaps with tuberculosis, and suffered the loss of his only child at the age of 15. He gave up his editorships and with his wife Nancy went to Europe, which led to the publication of ''[[Travels Through France and Italy]]'' (1766).<ref name=":0"/> He also published ''[[The History and Adventures of an Atom]]'' (1769), which gave his opinion of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|British politics during the Seven Years' War]] in the guise of a tale from ancient Japan. In 1768, the year he moved to Italy, Smollett entrusted [[Robert Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore]] with selling off the slaves he still owned in Jamaica.<ref>Michael Morris (2017), Don Roberto on Doughty Deeds; or, Slavery and Family History in the Scottish Renaissance'', in Carla Sassi and Silke Stroh (2017), ''Empires and Revolutions: Cunninghame Graham & His Contemporaries'', Scottish Literature International, p. 57.''</ref>

A further visit to Scotland helped to inspire his last novel, ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' (1771), published in the year of his death. He had for some time been suffering from an intestinal disorder. Having sought a cure at Bath,{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} he retired to Italy, where he died in September 1771 and was buried in the [[Old English Cemetery, Livorno]].<ref name=":0"/>

==Monuments==
There is a monument to his memory beside Renton Primary School, [[Dunbartonshire]], Scotland, on which there is a Latin inscription. The area around the monument was improved in 2002, with an explanatory plaque. After his death in Italy in 1771, his cousin Jane Smollett had the Renton monument built in 1774. It comprises a tall [[Tuscan order|Tuscan column]] topped by an urn. On the plinth is a Latin inscription written by Professor [[George Stuart (classicist)|George Stuart]] of Edinburgh, [[John Ramsay of Ochtertyre]] and [[Dr Samuel Johnson]]. It is a [[listed building|category A listed building]].<ref>{{Historic Environment Scotland |num=LB1168 |desc=Renton, Main Street, Smollett Monument |access-date=22 June 2020}}</ref>
[[File:Smollett Monument, Renton.jpg|thumb|Tobias Smollett Monument in [[Renton, West Dunbartonshire]]]]

There is also a plaque at his temporary residence in [[Edinburgh]], just off the [[Royal Mile]] at the head of St John's Street, where his wife lived after his death until at least 1785.<ref>Williamsons Edinburgh Directory 1785.</ref> This states that he resided there in the house of his sister, Mrs. Telfer, for the summer of 1766. A second plaque (dating the building at 1758, making it relatively new at that time) states that he "stayed here occasionally," implying more than one visit.

Smollett is one of the 16 Scottish writers and poets depicted on the lower section of the [[Scott Monument]] in [[Princes Street]], Edinburgh. He appears on the far left side of the east face.<ref name=":0"/> There are streets named after him in [[Nice]], France and in Livorno, Italy, where he is buried.<ref>[https://www.livornonow.com/english-cemetery-verdi-livorno Livorno now. Retrieved 8 April 2021.]</ref>

==References in literature==
[[Laurence Sterne]], in his ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'', refers to Smollett under the nickname of ''Smelfungus'', due to the snarling abuse Smollett heaped on the institutions and customs of the countries he visited and described in his ''[[Travels Through France and Italy]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |edition=3rd |pages=1124 |editor=Head, Dominic |work=Travels through France and Italy}}</ref>

Mr Brooke in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]'' says to Mr Casaubon: "Or get Dorothea to read you light things, Smollett – ''Roderick Random,'' ''Humphry Clinker''. They are a little broad, but she may read anything now she's married, you know. I remember they made me laugh uncommonly – there's a droll bit about a postillion's breeches."

In [[William Makepeace Thackeray|W. M. Thackeray]]'s novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', Rebecca Sharp and Miss Rose Crawley read ''Humphry Clinker'': "Once, when Mr. Crawley asked what the young people were reading, the governess replied 'Smollett'. 'Oh, Smollett,' said Mr. Crawley, quite satisfied. 'His history is more dull, but by no means so dangerous as [[The History of England (Hume)|that of Mr. Hume]]. It is history you are reading?' 'Yes,' said Miss Rose; without, however, adding that it was the history of Mr. Humphry Clinker."

[[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[David Copperfield]]'' mentions that his young protagonist counted Smollett's works among his favourites as a child.

[[John Bellairs]] referenced Smollett's works in his ''Johnny Dixon'' series, where Professor Roderick Random Childermass reveals that his late father Marcus, an English professor, had named all his sons after characters in Smollett's works: Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphry Clinker, and even "Ferdinand Count Fathom", who usually signed his name F. C. F. Childermass.

[[George Orwell]] praised him as "Scotland's best novelist".

In [[Hugh Walpole]]'s fifth novel ''Fortitude'', the protagonist Peter refers to ''Peregrine Pickle'' as a text that inspired him to document his own memoirs.
