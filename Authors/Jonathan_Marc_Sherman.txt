'''Jonathan Marc Sherman''' (born October 10, 1968) is a contemporary American [[playwright]] and occasional actor. He submitted plays for several years to [[Young Playwrights Inc.]]'s National Playwrights Competition before they did a staged reading of his one-act, ''Serendipity and Serenity'' in 1987, followed by a full production of his next play, ''Women and Wallace'' (1988).

===Sons and Fathers===
The short play is about a family of two brothers, Toby and Max, and their father, fifteen years after the mother committed suicide. Toby, an idealist who has never quite recovered from his mother's death, still wears diapers at the age of 21 and hardly leaves the house.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} His older brother Max often lectures him on the ways of life and love. Joanna, a new representative for the diaper company responsible for Toby's deliveries, makes a delivery and Toby instantly falls in love.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}  The play ends with Toby leaving the house, and more symbolically, his dependence on his mother's memory, to be with Joanna.

The play was written in 1991, and was performed by [[Ethan Hawke]]'s Malaparte Theater Company in [[New York City]]. [[Calista Flockhart]] played Joanna, [[Josh Hamilton (actor)]] played Toby and Ethan Hawke played Max. In the play's earlier incarnation as a workshop reading, Sherman himself played the part of Toby.

In the play's foreword, Sherman stresses the significance of Toby in the play; that his character is the nucleus of the play.
