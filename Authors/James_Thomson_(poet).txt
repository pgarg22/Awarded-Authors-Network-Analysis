'''James Thomson''' (c. 11 September 1700 – 27 August 1748) was a British poet and playwright, known for his poems ''[[The Seasons (Thomson)|The Seasons]]'' and ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]'', and for the lyrics of "[[Rule, Britannia!]]".

== Scotland, 1700–1725 ==
James Thomson was born in [[Ednam]] in Roxburghshire around 11 September 1700 and baptised on 15 September.<ref>11 September is the date of birth given in Murdoch, Patrick, 'An Account of the Life and Writings of Mr. James Thomson', in ''The Works of James Thomson'' (1762), vol. i, p.i.</ref><ref name="NSRW" /> He was the fourth of nine children of Thomas Thomson and Beatrix Thomson (née Trotter).<ref>Sambrook, James, ''James Thomson 1700–1748; A Life'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991)</ref> Beatrix Thomson was born in [[Fogo, Scottish Borders|Fogo]], Berwickshire and was a distant relation of the house of [[Hume Castle|Hume]]. Thomas Thomson was the Presbyterian minister of Ednam until eight weeks after Thomson's birth, when he was admitted as minister of [[Southdean]], where Thomson spent most of his early years.<ref name="accessed 2 May 2008" />

Thomson may have attended the parish school of Southdean before going to the [[Jedburgh Grammar School|grammar school]] in [[Jedburgh]] in 1712. He failed to distinguish himself there. Shiels, his earliest biographer, writes: 'far from appearing to possess a sprightly genius, [Thomson] was considered by his schoolmaster, and those which directed his education, as being really without a common share of parts'.<ref>[[Robert Sheilds]], 'Mr James Thomson' in [[Theophilus Cibber]], ''Lives of the Poets of Great-Britain and Ireland'' (1753), vol. v, p.190.</ref> He was, however, encouraged to write poetry by [[s:Riccaltoun, Robert (DNB00)|Robert Riccaltoun]] (1691–1769), a farmer, poet and Presbyterian minister; and Sir William Bennet (d. 1729), a [[Whig (British political faction)|whig]] [[laird]] who was a patron of [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]].<ref name="accessed 2 May 2008">Sambrook, 2004</ref> While some early poems by Thomson survive, he burned most of them on New Year's Day each year.<ref>Murdoch, p.iii..</ref>

Thomson entered the [[University of Edinburgh|College of Edinburgh]] in autumn 1715, destined for the Presbyterian ministry. At Edinburgh he studied [[metaphysics]], [[Logic]], Ethics, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]] and Natural Philosophy.  He completed his arts course in 1719 but chose not to graduate, instead entering Divinity Hall to become a minister.<ref>Drennon, Herbert, 'James Thomson's Contact with Newtonianism and his interest in Natural Philosophy', ''PMLA'', vol. 49, no. 1 (1934) p.72.</ref> In 1716 Thomas Thomson died, with local legend saying that he was killed whilst performing an [[exorcism]].<ref name="accessed 2 May 2008" /> At Edinburgh Thomson became a member of the [[Grotesque Club]], a literary group, and he met his lifelong friend [[David Mallet (writer)|David Mallet]]. After the successful publication of some of his poems in the "Edinburgh Miscellany" Thomson followed Mallet to London in February 1725 in an effort to publish his verse.<ref name="accessed 2 May 2008" />

== London, 1725–1727 ==
[[File:James Thomson, from Samuel Johnson's Lives of the English Poets.gif|thumb|right|James Thomson, from [[Samuel Johnson]]'s Lives of the English Poets (c.1779)]]
In London, Thomson became a tutor to the son of Charles Hamilton, [[Lord Binning]], through connections on his mother's side of the family. Through [[David Mallet (writer)|David Mallet]], by 1724 a published poet, Thomson met the great English poets of the day including [[Richard Savage (poet)|Richard Savage]], [[Aaron Hill (writer)|Aaron Hill]] and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name="accessed 2 May 2008" /> Thomson's mother died on 12 May 1725, around the time of his writing ‘Winter’, the first poem of ‘‘The Seasons’’. ‘Winter’ was first published in 1726 by [[John Millian]], with a second edition being released (with revisions, additions and a preface) later the same year.

By 1727, Thomson was working on ''Summer'', published in February, and was working at [[Watt's Academy]], a school for young gentlemen and a bastion of Newtonian science. In the same year Millian published a poem by Thomson titled ‘A Poem to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton’ (who had died in March). Leaving Watt's academy, Thomson hoped to earn a living through his poetry, helped by his acquiring several wealthy patrons including Thomas Rundle, the countess of Hertford and [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot]].{{sfn|Tovey|1911}}

== Later life, 1728–1748 ==

He wrote ''Spring'' in 1728 and finally ''Autumn'' in 1730, when the set of four was published together as ''The Seasons''. During this period he also wrote other poems, such as ''to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton'', and his first play, ''[[Sophonisba (Thomson play)|Sophonisba]]'' (1730). The latter is best known today for its mention in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[Lives of the English Poets]]'', where Johnson records that one 'feeble' line of the poem – "O, Sophonisba, Sophonisba, O!" was parodied by the wags of the theatre as, "O, Jemmy Thomson, Jemmy Thomson, O!".<ref>Johnson, Samuel. ''Lives of the English Poets''.

In 1730, he became tutor to the son of [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot|Sir Charles Talbot]], then [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]], and spent nearly two years in the company of the young man on a tour of Europe.
On his return Talbot arranged for him to become a secretary in [[Court of Chancery|chancery]], which gave him financial security until Talbot's death in 1737. Meanwhile, there appeared his next major work, ''Liberty'' (1734).{{sfn|Tovey|1911}}  This is a lengthy [[monologue]] by the "Goddess of Liberty", describing her travels through the ancient world, and then English and British history, before the resolution of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xw4UAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA7 text of ''Liberty'' online]</ref> In 1738 his tragedy ''[[Agamemnon (Thomson play)|Agamemnon]]'' was played at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and the following year he wrote a prologue when Mallet's ''[[Mustapha (play)|Mustapha]]'' was performed there.

In 1740, he collaborated with Mallet on the [[masque]] ''[[Alfred (Arne opera)|Alfred]]'' which was first performed at [[Cliveden]], the country home of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. Thomson's words for "[[Rule, Britannia!|Rule Britannia]]", written as part of that masque and set to music by [[Thomas Arne]], became one of the best-known British patriotic songs – quite apart from the masque which is now virtually forgotten. The Prince gave him a pension of £100 per annum. He had also introduced him to [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]], who became his friend and patron.{{sfn|Tovey|1911}}

In later years, Thomson lived in [[Richmond, London|Richmond upon Thames]], and it was there that he wrote his final work ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]'', which was published just before his untimely death on 27 August 1748. Johnson writes about Thomson's death, "by taking cold on the water between London and Kew, he caught a disorder, which, with some careless exasperation, ended in a fever that put end to his life".<ref>Johnson, op.cit., p. 323.</ref><ref name="NSRW">{{Cite NSRW|wstitle=Thomson, James}}</ref> He is buried in [[St. Mary Magdalene]] church in Richmond.{{sfn|Tovey|1911}}

A dispute over the publishing rights to one of his works, ''The Seasons'', gave rise to two important legal decisions (''[[Millar v. Taylor]]''; ''[[Donaldson v. Beckett]]'') in the [[history of copyright]].

Thomson's ''The Seasons'' was translated into German by [[Barthold Heinrich Brockes]] (1745). This translation formed the basis for a work with the same title by [[Gottfried van Swieten]], which became the libretto for [[Haydn]]'s oratorio ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]''.
