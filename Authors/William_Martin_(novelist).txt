== Biography ==
William Martin grew up in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] and [[Roslindale, Boston|Roslindale]], [[Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1972 where he majored in English. He worked as an historical research assistant and directed theater in the evening.

He went into construction to raise money to move to [[Hollywood]] and then studied motion pictures at the [[University of Southern California]].

Martin wrote two screenplays in an effort to get into the writing business. Producers and his agent suggested that, to best take advantage of his writing style, Martin should write a novel. Based on the outline of his first novel, Martin obtained a $7,500 publishing deal. The book, ''Back Bay'', was published in 1979 and reached the [[New York Times bestseller list]].

William Martin has continued to write historical novels and currently lives in [[Weston, Massachusetts]] (near [[Boston]]) with his wife, two sons and a daughter.
