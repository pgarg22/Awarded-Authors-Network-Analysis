'''Felicia Dorothea Hemans''' (25 September 1793 – 16 May 1835) was an English poet (who identified as Welsh by adoption).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/f0cc4ee5-8a28-3b39-b214-dbbe9e2bcb2a|title=The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck|date=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref>Hendon, S. & Byrne, A. & Singer, R., (2018) “Reviews”, International Journal of Welsh Writing in English 5(1), p.1-11. doi: https://doi.org/10.16995/ijwwe.5.4</ref> Two of her opening lines, "The boy stood on the burning deck" and "The stately homes of England", have acquired classic status.

==Early life and education==
[[File:118 Duke Street, Liverpool 2018.jpg|right|thumb|118 Duke Street, Liverpool, birthplace of Felicia Hemans]]
Felicia Dorothea Browne was the daughter of George Browne, who worked for his father-in-law's wine importing business and succeeded him as [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan and imperial consul]] in Liverpool, and Felicity, daughter of Benedict Paul Wagner (1718–1806), wine importer at 9 Wolstenholme Square, [[Liverpool]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Consulate general|consul]] for that city.<ref name=oxforddnb>{{cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-12888|title=Felicia Hemans|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12888|isbn=978-0-19-861412-8|access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref> Hemans was the fourth of six children (three boys and three girls) to survive infancy. Her sister Harriett collaborated musically with Hemans and later edited her complete works (7 vols. with memoir, 1839).<ref name=oxforddnb /> George Browne's business soon brought the family to [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] in [[North Wales]], where she spent her youth. They lived in a cottage within the grounds of [[Gwrych_Castle|Gwrych Castle]] near [[Abergele]]<ref>Liverpool Evening Express - Friday 15 September 1944 [Page 2]</ref> and later moved to Bronwylfa, [[St. Asaph]] ([[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]); she later called Wales "Land of my childhood, my home and my dead". [[Lydia Sigourney]] says of her education: 
<blockquote>
"The nature of the education of Mrs. Hemans, was favourable to the development of her genius. A wide range of classical and poetical studies, with the acquisition of several languages, supplied both pleasant aliment and needful discipline. She required not the excitement of a more public system of culture,—for the never-resting love of knowledge was her school master."<ref>Essay on the Genius and Writings of Mrs. Hemans, by Mrs Sigourney, New York, 1845.</ref>
</blockquote>
Hemans was proficient in Welsh, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Her sister Harriet remarked that "One of her earliest tastes was a passion for Shakspeare, which she read, as her choicest recreation, at six years old."<ref>Memoir of the Life and Writings of Felicia Hemans by her Sister, New York, 1845.</ref>

==Career==
Hemans’ first poems, dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was fourteen, arousing the interest of poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who briefly corresponded with her. She quickly followed them up with "England and Spain" (1808) and "The domestic affections" (1812).

From "Casabianca" (1826)

The boy stood on the burning deck,
 Whence all but he had fled;
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
 Shone round him o'er the dead.

Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
 As born to rule the storm;
A creature of heroic blood,
 A proud though childlike form.

Hemans‘ major collections, including ''The Forest Sanctuary'' (1825), ''Records of Woman'' and ''Songs of the Affections'' (1830) were popular, especially with female readers. Her last books, sacred and profane, were ''Scenes and Hymns of Life'' and ''National Lyrics, and Songs for Music''. She was by now a well-known literary figure, highly regarded by contemporaries such as [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]], and with a popular following in the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Personal life==
In 1812, she married Captain Alfred Hemans, an Irish army officer some years older than herself. The marriage took her away from Wales, to [[Daventry]] in [[Northamptonshire]] until 1814. During their first six years of marriage, Hemans gave birth to five sons, including [[G. W. Hemans]] and [[Charles Isidore Hemans]], and then the couple separated. Marriage had not, however, prevented her from continuing her literary career, with several volumes of poetry being published by the respected firm of [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]] in the period after 1816, beginning with ''The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy'' (1816) and ''Modern Greece'' (1817). ''Tales and Historic Scenes'' was the collection which came out in 1819, the year of their separation.

From 1831, Hemans lived in [[Dublin]]. At her death of [[dropsy]], Wordsworth, [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] and [[Walter Savage Landor]] composed memorial verses in her honour. She is buried in [[St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street]].

==Legacy==
[[File:Felicia Hemans 2.jpg|thumb|left|Felicia Hemans]]
Hemans's works appeared in nineteen individual books during her lifetime. After her death in 1835, they were republished widely, usually as collections of individual lyrics and not the longer, annotated works and integrated series that made up her books. For surviving female poets, such as [[Caroline Norton]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], [[Lydia Sigourney]] and [[Frances Harper]], the French [[Amable Tastu]] and German [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]], she was a valued model. To many readers she offered a woman's voice confiding a woman's trials; to others, a lyricism consonant with Victorian sentimentality. Among the works, she valued most were the unfinished "Superstition and Revelation" and the pamphlet "The Sceptic," which sought an Anglicanism more attuned to world religions and women's experiences. In her most successful book, ''Records of Woman'' (1828), she chronicles the lives of women, both famous and anonymous.

Hemans' poem "The Homes of England" (1827) is the origin of the phrase "[[Stately home#Origin of the term|stately home]]", referring to an [[English country house]].

From "The Homes of England"

The stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand!
Amidst their tall ancestral trees,
O’er all the pleasant land;
The deer across their greensward bound
Through shade and sunny gleam,
And the swan glides past them with the sound
Of some rejoicing stream.

The free, fair Homes of England!
Long, long in hut and hall,
May hearts of native proof be reared
To guard each hallowed wall!
And green forever be the groves,
And bright the flowery sod,
Where first the child's glad spirit loves
Its country and its God.

Despite her illustrious admirers her stature as a serious poet gradually declined, partly due to her success in the literary marketplace. Her poetry was considered morally exemplary, and was often assigned to schoolchildren; as a result, Hemans came to be seen as more a poet for children rather than on the basis of her entire body of work. Schoolchildren in the U.S. were still being taught "The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in New England"  in the middle of the 20th century. But by the 21st century, "The Stately Homes of England" refers to [[Noël Coward]]'s parody, not to the once-famous poem it parodied.

However, her critical reputation has been re-examined in recent years. Her work has resumed a role in standard anthologies and in classrooms and seminars and literary studies, especially in the US.  Other anthologised poems include "The Image in Lava," "Evening Prayer at a Girls' School," "I Dream of All Things Free," "Night-Blowing Flowers," "Properzia Rossi," "A Spirit's Return," "The Bride of the Greek Isle," "The Wife of Asdrubal," "The Widow of Crescentius," "The Last Song of Sappho" and "Corinne at the Capitol".

==''Casabianca''==
[[File:Portrait of Felicia Dorothea Hemans (4670849).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Felicia Dorothea Hemans c.1820]]
{{main article|Casabianca (poem)}}
First published in August 1826 the poem ''[[Casabianca (poem)|Casabianca]]'' (also known as ''The Boy stood on the Burning Deck'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://readytogoebooks.com/FH-casabianca.jpg|format=JPG|title=Casablanca : Image|website=Readytogoebooks.com|access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref> by Hemans depicts Captain [[Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca]] and his 12-year-old son, Giocante, who both perished aboard the ship ''[[French ship Orient (1791)|Orient]]'' during the [[Battle of the Nile]]. The poem was very popular from the 1850s on and was memorized in elementary schools for literary practice. Other poetic figures such as [[Elizabeth Bishop]] and [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] allude to the poem in their own works.

"'Speak, Father!' once again he cried / 'If I may yet be gone! / And'—but the booming shots replied / And fast the flames rolled on."{{ws|[[s:Felicia Hemans in The Monthly Magazine Volume 2 1826/Casabianca|'Casabianca' by Felicia Hemans]]}}

The poem is sung in ballad form (abab) and consists of a boy asking his father whether he had fulfilled his duties, as the ship continues to burn until the magazine catches fire.
Hemans adds the following note to the poem: 'Young Casabianca, a boy about thirteen years old, son to the Admiral of the Orient, remained at his post (in the Battle of the Nile) after the ship had taken fire, and all the guns had been abandoned, and perished in the explosion of the vessel, when the flames had reached the powder.'

[[Martin Gardner]], Michael R. Turner, and others wrote modern day parodies that were much more upbeat and consisted of boys stuffing their faces with peanuts and bread. This contrasted sharply with the dramatic image created in Casabianca as Hemans wrote it.

==''England and Spain, or, Valour and Patriotism''==
Her second book, ''England and Spain, or, Valour and Patriotism'', was published in 1808 and was a [[narrative poem]] honoring her brother and his military service in the [[Peninsular War]]. The poem called for an end to the tyranny of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and for a long-lasting peace. Multiple references to [[Albion]], an older name for Great Britain, emphasize Hemans's patriotism.

"For this thy noble sons have spread alarms, and bade the zones resound with BRITAIN's arms!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.ucdavis.edu/projects/bwrp/Works/HemaFEngla.htm|title=British Women Romantic Poets Project|website=Digital.lib.ucdavis.edu|access-date=21 January 2016}}</ref>

==Female suicide in Hemans' works==
{{See also|Suicide in literature}}
Several of Hemans's characters take their own lives rather than suffer the social, political and personal consequences of their compromised situations. At Hemans's time, [[women's writing (literary category)|women writers]] were often torn between a choice of home or the pursuit of a literary career.<ref name=jstor>{{cite journal|jstor=463119|title=Hemans and Home: Victorianism, Feminine "Internal Enemies," and the Domestication of National Identity|last1=Lootens|first1=Tricia|journal=PMLA|year=1994|volume=109|issue=2|pages=238–253|doi=10.2307/463119}}</ref> Hemans herself was able to balance both roles without much public ridicule, but left hints of discontent through the themes of feminine death in her writing.<ref name=erudit>{{cite journal|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/2003/v/n29-30/007715ar.html|title=The Poetics of Expiration: Felicia Hemans|first=Jeffrey C.|last=Robinson|date=3 September 2017|journal=Romanticism on the Net|issue=29–30|doi=10.7202/007715ar}}</ref> The suicides of women in Hemans's poetry dwell on the same social issue that was confronted both culturally and personally during her life: the choice of caged domestication or freedom of thought and expression.<ref name=jstor />

"The Bride of the Greek Isle", "The Sicilian Captive", "The Last Song of Sappho" and "Indian Woman's Death Song" are some of the most notable of Hemans' works involving women's suicides. Each poem portrays a heroine who is untimely torn from her home by a masculine force – such as pirates, Vikings, and unrequited lovers – and forced to make the decision to accept her new confines or command control over the situation. None of the heroines are complacent with the tragedies that befall them, and the women ultimately take their own lives in either a final grasp for power and expression or a means to escape victimisation.<ref name=erudit/>
