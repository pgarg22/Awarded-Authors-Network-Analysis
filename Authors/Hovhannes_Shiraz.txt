'''Hovhannes Shiraz''' ({{lang-hy|Հովհաննես Շիրազ}}) (April 27, 1914 – March 14, 1984) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[poet]].

== Biography ==
Shiraz was born '''Onik Tadevosi Karapetyan''' in the city of [[Alexandropol]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Gyumri]], [[Armenia]]). His mother, Astghik, was widowed by the [[Armenian genocide]] shortly before his birth.
<ref>Armenia: with Nagorno Karabagh, Nicholas Holding, 2006, p. 40</ref> Shiraz grew up in a considerable poverty. His first work called ''Beginning of Spring'' was published in 1935. Novelist [[Atrpet]] gave the talented poet the epithet "[[Shiraz]]", because "this youth's poems have the fragrance of roses, fresh and covered with dew, like the roses of Shiraz" (Shiraz being one of [[Iran]]'s major cities, famous for its roses and poets). Another version of his pen name is "Shirak azn"&mdash;a child of Shirak, the region he was from.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orientalistica.it/?p=3203 |title=Hovhannes Shiraz, Orientalistica |access-date=2013-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226150610/http://www.orientalistica.it/?p=3203 |archive-date=2016-12-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1937 Hovhannes Shiraz entered the Armenian Literature Department of [[Yerevan State University|Yerevan's State University]], where he studied until 1941. He also studied at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute|Moscow Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]]. In 1958, he published the first volume of his anthology ''Knar Hayastani'' (Lyre of Armenia).<ref>Razmik Panossian, ''The Armenians: From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars'' (Columbia University Press, 2006), 335.</ref> The second and third volumes were published in 1965 and 1974. These collections include the best examples of Shiraz's poetry.<ref name=Golosarmenii>[http://www.golosarmenii.am/ru/20072/culture/7933/ "МОЯ БИОГРАФИЯ – ЭТО МОИ СТИХИ", 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232503/http://www.golosarmenii.am/ru/20072/culture/7933/ |date=2012-04-25 }}</ref>

Shiraz mostly wrote and published poetry. He is an author of very popular patriotic and love poems included "Ani", "My Mother", "May my love remain a secret", "Siamanto and Khjezare", "Expromptu", "Like the Pagan Love", "My Holy Homeland", "The Fate of Armenians", "To Andranik", etc. He wrote "The Armenian Dante-esque" about the [[Armenian genocide]], a subject that was banned in [[Soviet Union]]. The first version of this masterpiece was written in 1941.<ref>The Armenian genocide: cultural and ethical legacies, By Richard G. Hovannisian, p. 103</ref> Only short passages from this work were published in [[Soviet Armenia]] during his lifetime, and some chapters were published in [[Beirut]] and [[Tehran]]. The entire poem (over 8000 lines) was published in 1990 in [[Yerevan]].

He was buried at [[Komitas Pantheon]],<ref>[http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&grave_id=hush73a916cfe7fcdf5&gcemetery=Komitas+Pantheon&page=czz9W5p2ZEyLvKm6%2BfAa3Kmu5S0jtdse8cvifCD6nRI%3D Shiraz's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon]</ref> in [[Yerevan]], along with other distinguished Armenians.

He first married famous Armenian poet [[Silva Kaputikyan]]. His son with Kaputikyan, [[Ara Shiraz]], was a sculptor. Shiraz had seven children with his second wife, Shushanik Shiraz (''Aristakesyan'', 1937–2006),<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=113139040&PIpi=83477532 Shushanik Shiraz]</ref> one of whom was [[Sipan Shiraz]], a poet.

[[Yerevan]] school #169 and a street in [[New Julfa|Julfa]], [[Isfahan]] are named after him. The [[Hovhannes Shiraz House-Museum]] is located in a nineteenth-century building in [[Gyumri]].<ref>[http://www.yerevan2012.org/house-museums-of-writers/ House-Museums of Writers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416111110/http://www.yerevan2012.org/house-museums-of-writers/ |date=2013-04-16 }}</ref>

==Personality==
Shiraz was known for his good [[sense of humour]]. In 1963 [[John Steinbeck]] visited poet's apartment in Yerevan, and then wrote in a letter: "...men are closest together when they laugh together. And I remember that in Yerevan we laughed together a great deal."<ref>[http://groong.org/orig/rb-20061205.html The Fragrance of the Roses Lingers On ... Hovhannes Shiraz]</ref>

Что было, то было: Записки счастливого человека. – Вологда, 2001]</ref> dedicated poems to Shiraz.

Shiraz was an anti-establishment poet who was very popular with the people of Soviet Armenia but fought against its corrupt Soviet leadership all his life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hyeetch.nareg.com.au/armenians/poetry_p18.html |title=Hovhannes Shiraz, by Shant Norashkharian |access-date=2012-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326061238/http://www.hyeetch.nareg.com.au/armenians/poetry_p18.html |archive-date=2017-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When in 1974 the known critic [[Suren Aghababyan]] brought to Shiraz the news about awarding of the [[Order of Lenin]], his answer followed: "And what they [the Soviet government] want in exchange? To buy my silence?"<ref name=Golosarmenii />

==Poetry==
Shiraz is an author of about forty poetry books and translations. His rich vocabulary and sensitive style, enhanced by folk and colloquial elements,<ref>Calendar of literary facts: a daily and yearly guide, by Samuel J. Rogal – 1991</ref> made his poetry one of the highest achievements of [[Armenian literature]]. Critics consider many of his works masterpieces. According to [[Paruyr Sevak]], "The modern Armenian poetry has risen on the ridge of Shiraz".<ref name=Golosarmenii /> "Shiraz is a great talent, we should be proud and consider as a great honor that we personally know him", wrote [[William Saroyan]]. Shiraz built his poems with Armenian "[[tuff]] of emotions", added [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]].<ref>Е. Евтушенко, Талант есть чудо неслучайное, 1980, с. 216</ref>

<poem style="margin-left: 4em; font-style: italic;">
In my dreams my door was knocked at,
"Who is it?" I asked from inside.
Some elderly lady from the outside
Answered and said, "I'd sacrifice myself for you."

"I've come to ask for a piece of bread as charity
I'm a poor orphan woman with no one to support me."
At this point I opened my door immediately,
Only to find a miracle; it was my deceased mother indeed!

I was shocked but fell into her arms;
And my mother said, "It's me, it's me,
I've come to try you and to check on you.
I hope life hasn't changed your spirit and also you?!"

I came in the form of a beggar
So that the whole world can be a witness
To see if your conscience, my dear son,
If your conscience also died along with me?!"
</poem>
(Translated from Armenian by Daniel Janoyan)

Poems of Shiraz are known throughout the former [[USSR]] (his works were translated by [[Arseny Tarkovsky]] and [[Nikolay Aseev]]) and abroad. As [[Andrey Dementyev (poet)|Andrey Dementyev]] writes, Hovhannes Shiraz, like [[Sergey Yesenin]], uses many [[metaphor]]s, so it's very hard to translate his poems.<ref>[http://www.bulvar.com.ua/arch/2011/34/4e55203603e73/ Поэт Андрей ДЕМЕНТЬЕВ, Bulvar Gordona, № 34 (329) 2011]</ref>

During a meeting with Soviet writers, to demonstrate what kind of poetry he liked best, [[Hindi]] writer [[Bhisham Sahni]], showed a journal containing poems by Hovhannes Shiraz.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=97BHAQAAIAAJ&q=ovanes+shiraz&dq=ovanes+shiraz&hl=en&ei=j-HZTsLzJce3hQet0uDFDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ Soviet literature, journal, 1987, p. 156]</ref>

==House-Museum==
[[File:Museum of Hovhannes Shiraz 27-08-2019.jpg|thumb|[[Hovhannes Shiraz House Museum|Hovhannes Shiraz House-Museum]] in [[Gyumri]]|234x234px]]
The [[Hovhannes Shiraz House Museum|Hovhannes Shiraz House-Museum]] is located on Varpetats Street, Gyumri. The house was presented to Shiraz by Soviet Armenian officials in July 1983. The house was built in 1886 and belonged to a millionaire. During the Soviet Union it was used as a storehouse. Due to the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], the museum's refurbishment was interrupted, and 8 homeless families found shelter in the house. In 2003 it became a house-museum by the resolution of the Armenian government.
