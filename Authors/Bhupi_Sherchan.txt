==Biography==
Sherchan was the most successful poet to popularize free verse. He has analyzed humans and human life in different ways but his biggest contribution to Nepalese society is that he has tried to show the way to the new generation through his numerous poems. His Himalayan nationalism can be seen in his poem "Hami" ("Us"), where he claimed that Nepalese are brave, but foolish (because they are brave). Sherchan produced several odes to the martyrs of Nepal, including "Sahid Ko Samjhana," "Main Batti Ko Sikha," and "Ghantaghar"."Ghumne Mechmathi Andho Manchhe," or "Blind Man on a Revolving Chair," has undergone its 10th edition.<ref name="hutt">''[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft729007x1;brand=ucpress Himalayan Voices: An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature]'' (Voices from Asia), edited and translated by [[Michael Hutt (orientalist)|Michael J.
