==Biography==
Born to a lower-middle-class family in [[Warsaw]], Gałczyński was evacuated with his parents at the outbreak of [[World War I]], and from 1914 to 1918 he lived in [[Moscow]], where he attended a Polish school. Returning to Poland in 1918, he studied classics and English language at the [[University of Warsaw]], submitting a dissertation on a non-existent nineteenth-century English poet, Morris Gordon Cheats.

His literary debut came in 1923 and was a member of the [[Kwadryga]] group of poets, and he was linked to [[Satire|satirical]] and political publications. In 1930 he married Natalia Avalov. From 1931-33, he held the post of [[cultural attaché]] in [[Berlin]]. From 1934-36 he was in [[Vilnius]]. He settled there at 2 Młynowa Street. There, in 1936, the couple's daughter Kira was born. Through his works, Gałczyński refers to the atmosphere of Vilnius, and that which [[Adam Mickiewicz]] left behind.

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Gałczyński received a draft card from the army. He took part in the Polish [[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]] of 1939. On 17 September, he became a [[Russia]]n [[prisoner of war]] and was later captured by the [[Germany|Germans]]. He spent the duration of the occupation in the [[Stalag XI-A]] prisoner-of-war camp in [[Altengrabow]], his poems printed secretly in [[Anthology|anthologies]]. After the war he travelled to [[Brussels]] and [[Paris]], returning to Poland in 1946. He established The 13 Muses Club in [[Szczecin]] in 1948 before moving back to Warsaw, and produced work for numerous weekly magazines.

Many of his postwar pieces, including "A Poem for the Traitor" ("Poemat dla zdrajcy"), an attack on [[Czesław Miłosz]], "Chryzostom Bulwieć’s Trip to Ciemnogród" ("Podróż Chryzostoma Bulwiecia do Ciemnogrodu") and the [[panegyric]] "Stalin is Dead" ("Umarł Stalin") (1953), were written according to [[Socialist realism|socialist realist]] conventions. In 1950, he became the object of an ideological battle, his artistic work denounced by [[Adam Ważyk]] at the Reunion of Polish Writers as [[Petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeois]].

In the later years of his life, he wrote several greater poetic forms:
* "Jan Sebastian Bach's Easter" (1950) ("Wielkanoc Jana Sebastiana Bacha")
* "[[Niobe]]" (1951)
* "Wit Stwosz" (1952)
* "Olsztyn Chronicle" (1952) ("Kronika Olsztyńska")

From 1950 to 1953, he was associated with the forester’s lodge at Lake Nidzkie, where he wrote numerous works, including "Olsztyn Chronicle". It is there that his [[museum]] is currently located. He published the volumes of poetry ''Enchanted Droshky'' (1948) ("Zaczarowana dorożka"), ''Wedding Rings'' (1949) ("Ślubne obrączki") and ''Songs'' (1953) ("Pieśni"). He also produced [[translation]]s, or [[paraphrase]]s, of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1952) and ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' by [[Friedrich Schiller]].

He is portrayed, under the name of 'Delta,' in Miłosz's ''[[The Captive Mind]]'' (1953).

==Death==
He died on 6 December 1953, aged 48, following a third [[heart attack]].<ref>[http://www.lasy.gov.pl/pl/informacje/publikacje/do-poczytania/warto-zobaczyc-w-lasach-panstwowych/mazury-i-suwalszczyzna/warto_zobaczyc_mazury_i_suwalszczyzna.pdf LEŚNICZÓWKA PRANIE p. 133]</ref>

==Artistic legacy==

==Commemoration==
Since 1998 a biennial poetry competition has been organised in Szczecin, named ''Gałczynalie'' in honour of the poet. A ''Green Goose'' foundation was formed in Warsaw in September 2007.

Gałczyński was portrayed in the book ''[[The Captive Mind]]'' (''Zniewolony umysł'') by [[Czesław Miłosz]]; he is Delta.

There is Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński Street in Warsaw.

===Institutions named after Gałczyński===
Approximately 30 schools in Poland are named after Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński, among them Secondary School No 1 in [[Otwock]], Secondary School No 2 in [[Olsztyn]], Gymnasium No 7 in [[Częstochowa]], Primary School No 7 in [[Legnica]], Gymnasium No 2 in [[Stargard Szczeciński]] and in [[Poznań]] Secondary School No 20 and, until 2000, the former Primary School No 37. Gałczyński is also the [[patron]] of libraries, one [[community centre]] and the Happy Islands Foundation for Friends of Children with Cancer.

==The Green Goose Theatre==
Among Gałczyński's best known works are the satirical mini-pieces of the ''Green Goose Theatre'' ("Teatrzyk Zielona Gęś"). Several hundred of these ostensible dramas, usually only a few lines long, appeared in the Kraków literary journal ''Przekrój''.<ref>Gerould, Daniel (ed.), ''Twentieth-Century Polish Avant-Garde Drama: Plays, Scenarios, Critical Documents'' (Cornell University Press 1977), p.61</ref> They frequently parody serious drama and cultural icons – in ''Hamlet and the Waitress'', [[Hamlet]] is unable to choose between coffee and tea in a café and expires from indecision to be buried in a coffin marked HAMLET IDIOT, while in ''Greedy Eve'' [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] fails to get a bite of the apple, causing the entire Bible to be "a total loss".<ref>Gerould, Daniel (ed.), ''Twentieth-Century Polish Avant-Garde Drama: Plays, Scenarios, Critical Documents'' (Cornell University Press 1977), pp.231, 237</ref> The final curtain is frequently brought into the action, being variously scripted as falling "optimistically", as coming down accidentally and then going up again, or as being lowered by an anteater.
