==Biography==
He was born at Northern [[Herøy, Nordland|Herøy]] ([[Dønna]]), [[Nordland]], [[Norway]]. His father was a merchant originally from [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], [[Peter Dundas]] who had established himself as a trader along the northern Norwegian coast. His mother was [[Maren Falch]] (1629–1709<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Maren-Pernille-Falch/6000000003645712977|title = Maren Pernille Pedersdatter Falch, Nord-Herøy}}</ref>) whose father had been the local [[bailiff]], a large land owner in  [[Helgeland]] and manager for the Dønnes estate of [[Henrik Rantzau]]. His father died in 1653, when Petter was 6, and the children were cared for by relatives and friends. His mother remarried, but Petter remained with his mother's sister, Anna Falck, who was married to the priest at [[Nærøy]].

At 13, Petter  began  attending school in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], and later studied theology at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He was lonely during his years in Copenhagen, but intellectually stimulated. After his years in Copenhagen, he returned to Norway and became a tutor in [[Vefsn]]. He fathered a child out of wedlock, and had to travel to Copenhagen and seek pardon from the Danish king. In 1689, he was appointed [[parish]] priest at [[Alstahaug Church]].  His parish was quite large covering an area which included the villages of  [[Hattfjelldal]], [[Vevelstad]], [[Leirfjord]], [[Vefsn]], [[Herøy, Nordland|Herøy]], [[Dønna]], [[Nesna]], [[Hemnes]] and [[Rana, Norway|Rana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=    http://www.petterdass-museet.no/?page_id=1568|title= Alstahaug church

He was also a writer of texts and hymns. Most of his writings were not published until after his death.  His most famous work is the versified topographical description of northern Norway, ''[[Nordlands Trompet]]'' ("The Trumpet of Nordland"), and some psalms still in use, most prominently ''Herre Gud, ditt dyre navn og ære'' ("Good Lord, thy precious name and glory").

The only existing portrait of Petter Dass is traditionally believed to be one found in the [[Melhus church]] in Norway. However, the claim is hotly disputed, with some historians who studied the painting concluding that Dass is most likely not the subject. Several modern statues and bust of Petter Dass have been erected in Norway, including a bas-relief by Norwegian sculptor [[Ambrosia Theodora Tønnesen]] (1859-1948) at the [[Bergen Cathedral]]. The community of [[Sandnessjøen]] has a modern statue of Petter Dass located prominently in the town centre.<ref name=ikkeDass>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpk.no/index.cgi?art=1657|title=Dette er ikke Petter Dass|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Kristelig Pressekontor|date=20 December 2004|language=Norwegian|first=Helge Johan|last=Stautland|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608121841/http://www.kpk.no/index.cgi?art=1657|archivedate=8 June 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.travelsignposts.com/Norway/sightseeing/petter-dass-museum-alstahaug ''Petter Dass – a Poet and a Priest'' (Archives for sandnessjøen)]</ref>

Petter Dass was deeply mourned after his death, and many fishing vessels of Northern Norway carried a black cloth in their sail for 100 years after his death, as a sign of mourning.  He is still the subject of [[folklore]] of Nordland. There is, for example, a legend of how he fooled the devil to carry him to Copenhagen to preach for the king.
