==Biography==

===Early years===
Wasserstein was born to a Jewish family in [[Brooklyn]], the daughter of Morris Wasserstein, a wealthy textile executive, and his wife, Lola (née Liska) Schleifer, who moved to the United States from [[Poland]] when her father was accused of being a spy.<ref name=bio>[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/wasserstein-wendy "Wendy Wasserstein"] jwa.org, accessed June 29, 2014</ref> Wasserstein "once described her mother as being like '[[Auntie Mame]]'".<ref>[[Simonson, Robert]]. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/96859-Wendy-Wasserstein-Playwright-Who-Dramatized-the-Progress-of-a-Generation-of-Women-Is-Dead-at-55 "Wendy Wasserstein, Playwright Who Dramatized the Progress of a Generation of Women, Is Dead at 55"] playbill.com, January 30, 2006</ref> Lola Wasserstein reportedly inspired some of her daughter's characters. Wendy was the youngest of five siblings, including brother [[Bruce Wasserstein]], a well-known investment banker.<ref name=nytimes/>

Her maternal grandfather was Simon Schleifer, a [[yeshiva]] teacher in [[Włocławek]], Poland, who moved to [[Paterson, New Jersey]] and became a high school principal.<ref name=bio/> Claims that Schleifer was a playwright are probably apocryphal, as contemporaries did not recall this and the assertion only appeared once Wasserstein had won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.<ref name="Salamon">{{cite book |author=Julie Salamon |year=2011 |title=Wendy and the Lost Boys: The Uncommon Life of Wendy Wasserstein |publisher=Penguin Press |isbn=978-1-59420-298-8 |oclc=713567430 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wendylostboysunc0000sala }}</ref>

===Career===
Wasserstein's first production of note was ''[[Uncommon Women and Others]]'' (her graduate thesis at [[Yale School of Drama|Yale]]), a play which reflected her experiences as a student at, and an alumna of, [[Mount Holyoke College]]. The play was workshopped at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center in 1977,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2010/06/03/at-the-eugene-oneill-theater-centers-critics-institute-5q4-dan-sullivan/ |work=The Faster Times |title=At the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's Critics Institute 5Q4 Dan Sullivan |first=Davi |last=Napoleon |date=June 3, 2010 |access-date=June 4, 2010 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607063149/http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2010/06/03/at-the-eugene-oneill-theater-centers-critics-institute-5q4-dan-sullivan/ |archive-date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref> 
and a full version of the play was produced in 1977 Off-Broadway with [[Glenn Close]], [[Jill Eikenberry]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] playing the lead roles. The play was subsequently produced for [[PBS]] with [[Meryl Streep]] replacing Close. While at Yale, she co-wrote a musical with fellow student [[Christopher Durang]], ''When [[Dinah Shore]] Ruled the Earth''.<ref name=bio/>

In 1989, she won the [[Tony Award]], the [[Susan Smith Blackburn Prize]], and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for her play ''[[The Heidi Chronicles]]''.

Her plays, which explore topics ranging from feminism to family to ethnicity to pop culture, include ''[[The Sisters Rosensweig]]'', ''[[Isn't It Romantic (play)|Isn't It Romantic]]'', ''[[An American Daughter]]'', ''[[Old Money (play)|Old Money]]'', and her last work, which opened in 2005, ''[[Third (play)|Third]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Staff writers | title=Was Wendy Wasserstein's ''Third'' Number One with Critics? | url=http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Story.aspx?ci=519931 | work=Broadway World | date=November 25, 2005 | access-date=February 12, 2009}}</ref>

During her career, which spanned nearly four decades, Wasserstein wrote eleven plays, winning a Tony Award, a Pulitzer Prize, a New York Drama Critics Circle Award, a Drama Desk Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award.

In addition, she wrote the screenplay for the 1998 film ''[[The Object of My Affection]]'', which starred [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Paul Rudd]].

Wasserstein is described as an author of women's identity crises.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | author=Charles Isherwood | title=Wendy Wasserstein Dies at 55; Her Plays Spoke to a Generation  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/theater/31wasserstein.html | work=The New York Times | date=January 31, 2006 | access-date=December 21, 2008}}</ref> "Her heroines—intelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt—sought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they did not always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women's lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man."<ref name=nytimes/> In a conversation with novelist [[A. M. Homes]], Wasserstein said that these heroines are the starting points for her plays: "I write from character, so it begins with people talking, which is why I like writing plays."<ref>Homes, A. M. [http://bombsite.com/issues/75/articles/2399 "Wendy Wasserstein"]. ''[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]]''. Spring 2001. Retrieved July 22, 2011.</ref>

Wasserstein commented that her parents allowed her to go to Yale only because they were certain she would meet an eligible lawyer there, get married, and lead a conventional life as a wife and mother. Although appreciative of the critical acclaim for her comedic streak, she described her work as "a political act", wherein sassy dialogue and farcical situations mask deep, resonant truths about intelligent, independent women living in a world still ingrained with traditional roles and expectations.

In 2007 she was featured in the film ''Making Trouble'', a tribute to female Jewish comedians, produced by the [[Jewish Women's Archive]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Deming |first=Mark |title=Making Trouble: Three Generations of Funny Jewish Women |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/400302/Making-Trouble-Three-Generations-of-Funny-Jewish-Women/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826033126/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/400302/Making-Trouble-Three-Generations-of-Funny-Jewish-Women/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 26, 2012 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |access-date=April 14, 2012 }}</ref>

Wasserstein also wrote the books to two musicals. ''Miami'', written in collaboration with [[Jack Feldman (songwriter)|Jack Feldman]] and [[Bruce Sussman]], was presented at Playwrights Horizons in 1985–1986, and starred among others, [[Marcia Lewis]], [[Phyllis Newman]], [[Jane Krakowski]], and [[Fisher Stevens]].<ref  name="Miami">''Playbill: Playwrights Horizons: Miami'', Playbill Inc. New York, December 1985</ref> ''Pamela's First Musical'', written with [[Cy Coleman]] and [[David Zippel]], based on Wasserstein's children's book, received its world premiere in a concert staging at Town Hall in New York City on May 18, 2008.<ref>Blank, Matthew.[https://archive.today/20120907135104/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/117897.html {{"'}}Pamela's First Musical' Premieres at Town Hall"], playbill.com, May 19, 2008</ref>

She wrote the libretto for the opera ''Best Friends'', based on [[Clare Boothe Luce]]'s play ''[[The Women (play)|The Women]]'', but it was uncompleted when she died.  It was subsequently completed by Christopher Durang, set by [[Deborah Drattell]], and is in development with [[Lauren Flanigan]].{{when|date=November 2018}}

In 1996 she appeared as the guest caller "Linda" on the ''Frasier'' episode [[Frasier (season 4)|"Head Game"]].

Wasserstein was named the President's Council of Cornell Women Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large in 2005.<ref>Aloi, Daniel.[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2007/02/symposium-honor-late-playwright-wendy-wasserstein "Playwright Wendy Wasserstein to be remembered in Schwartz Center symposium"]. news.cornell.edu, February 20, 2007</ref>

=== Personal life and death ===
Wasserstein gave birth to a daughter in 1999<ref>"Wendy Wasserstein: Her premature baby goes home", ''Wilmington Morning Star'' 2A, December 24, 1999; accessed via Google News search February 4, 2011.</ref> when she was 48 years old.<ref name=baby>Smith, Dinita.

Wasserstein, who was not married, never publicly identified her daughter's father.<ref name=baby/><ref>Rothstein, Mervyn.

Wasserstein was hospitalized with [[lymphoma]] in December 2005 and died at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] on January 30, 2006 at the age of 55.<ref name = nytimes/> The news of Wasserstein's death was unexpected because her illness had not been widely publicized outside the theater community.{{citation needed|date = June 2020}} The night after she died, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s lights were dimmed in her honor. In addition to her daughter, Wasserstein was survived by her mother and three siblings—Abner Wasserstein, businessman [[Bruce Wasserstein]] (died in 2009) and [[Wilburton Inn]] owner Georgette Wasserstein Levis (died in 2014).<ref name=nytimes/>
