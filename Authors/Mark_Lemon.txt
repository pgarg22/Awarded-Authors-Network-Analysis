'''Mark Lemon''' (30 November 1809, in London &ndash; 23 May 1870, in [[Crawley]]) was the founding editor of both ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]''. He was also a writer of [[Play (theatre)|play]]s and verses.

==Biography==
[[File:Mark Lemon.jpg|thumb|From [[Marion Spielmann|M. H. Spielmann's]] ''The History of "Punch"'', 1895]]
Lemon was born in London on 30 November 1809.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=413}} He was the son of Martin Lemon, a hop merchant, and Alice Collis. His parents married on 26 December 1808 at St Mary, Marylebone, London. Between 1817 and 1823, after the death of his father, Lemon lived at [[Church Farmhouse Museum|Church Farmhouse]] in [[Hendon]], where a [[blue plaques|blue plaque]] commemorates him.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Commemorative Plaque for Mark Lemon at Church Farmhouse Museum |url=http://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s2520/Culture%20Commemorative%20Plaque%20for%20Mark%20Lemon.pdf |website=Blue Plaque Places |accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref> At 15, Lemon was sent to live in [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], with his mother's brother Thomas Collis.

Mark had a natural talent for journalism and the stage, and at 26 retired from less congenial business to devote himself to the writing of plays. More than sixty of his [[melodrama]]s, operettas and comedies were produced in London, whilst at the same time he was contributing to a wide variety of magazines and newspapers.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=413}}

He married Helen (Nelly) Romer, on 28 September 1839 in Kensington, London and had eight children – sons Mark, Frank and Henry, and daughters Alice, Betty, Helen, Mary and Kate. Frank died shortly after he was born. Betty married Sir [[Robert Romer]] and their son was [[Mark Romer, Baron Romer|Mark Lemon Romer]].

In 1841 Lemon and [[Henry Mayhew]] conceived the idea of a humorous weekly paper to be called ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', and when the first number was issued, in July 1841, were joint editors and with the printer and engraver equal owners. The paper was for some time unsuccessful, Lemon keeping it alive out of the profits of his plays. On the sale of ''Punch'', Lemon became sole editor for the new proprietors. It remained under his control until his death, achieving remarkable popularity and influence.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=413}}

Two other long-running magazines in which Lemon played a significant part were the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', the first publication to make use of pictures as well as text in reporting, which was founded by his friend [[Herbert Ingram]], and ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'', of which he was founder editor (1853–57).{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=413}}

Lemon was an actor of ability, a pleasing lecturer and a successful impersonator of [[Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] characters. He played in the 1851 production of ''[[Not So Bad as We Seem, Or, Many Sides to a Character: A Comedy in Five Acts|Not So Bad As We Seem]]'', a play written by [[Edward Bulwer]] featuring many notable Victorians, including [[Charles Dickens]]. He also wrote novelettes and lyrics,<ref>Jarndyce [http://www.jarndyce.co.uk] ''XIX Century Fiction, Part II, L–Z'', 2021, Item 12: ''Prose & Verse'', 1852.</ref> over a hundred songs, a few [[three-volume novel]]s, several Christmas fairy tales and a volume of jests.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=413}} He was a stalwart of the London gentlemen's [[Savage Club]].

Lemon died in his adopted home town [[Crawley]], [[Sussex|West Sussex]] on 23 May 1870 and was buried in [[St Margaret's Church, Ifield]]. A [[blue plaque]] commemorates him outside [[The George Hotel, Crawley]].
