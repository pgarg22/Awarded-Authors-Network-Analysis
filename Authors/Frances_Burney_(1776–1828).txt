'''Frances Burney''' (1776–1828) was an English playwright and [[governess]].

==Family and life==
Frances Burney was a niece of the novelists [[Frances Burney]] and [[Sarah Burney]], and granddaughter of the musicologist [[Charles Burney]]. One of eight children of musicians Esther "Hetty" Burney (1749–1832) and Charles Rousseau Burney (1747–1819), Frances became a governess at the age of 18, and worked in various such posts for the rest of her life. This included periods in the households of Sir [[Thomas Plumer]] and [[Sir Henry Russell, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Russell]].

In 1818, she published ''Tragic dramas; chiefly intended for representation in private families: to which is added, ''Aristodemus'', a tragedy, from the Italian of [[Vincenzo Monti]]''. These are too bombastic for modern taste. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  It has been speculated by the author of her ODNB entry that Burney was affected by "the concerns of her grandfather [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814) about the potential impropriety of the stage, particularly for female dramatists." She appears not to have had a close relationship with her aunt, Frances Burney, Madame D'Arblay, who claimed in a letter to Esther, "I once thought I had caught a bit of her heart—& I tried for it, 3 or 4 years ago—but I see, & am sorry to see, my mistake."<ref>''The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney'' (Madame D'Arblay) 1791-1840, Vol. 11, ed. Joyce Hemlow et al. (Oxford: Oxford  UP, 1984), p. 566. Quoted in ODNB entry.</ref>

Having suffered attacks of [[jaundice]] throughout her life, Frances Burney died in 1828, in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].
