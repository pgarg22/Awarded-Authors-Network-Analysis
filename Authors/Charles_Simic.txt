==Biography==
===Early years===
Dušan Simić was born in [[Belgrade]]. In his early childhood, during World War II, he and his family were forced to evacuate their home several times to escape indiscriminate bombing of Belgrade. Growing up as a child in war-torn Europe shaped much of his world-view, Simic states. In an interview from the ''Cortland Review'' he said, "Being one of the millions of displaced persons made an impression on me. In addition to my own little story of bad luck, I heard plenty of others. I'm still amazed by all the vileness and stupidity I witnessed in my life."<ref>[http://www.cortlandreview.com/issuefour/interview4.htm Charles Simic profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408193340/http://www.cortlandreview.com/issuefour/interview4.htm |date=April 8, 2017 }}, CortlandReview.com; accessed April 21, 2017.</ref>

Simic immigrated to the United States with his brother and mother in order to join his father in 1954 when he was sixteen. He grew up in [[Chicago]]. In 1961 he was drafted into the U.S. Army, and in 1966 he earned his [[Bachelors of Arts|B.A.]] from [[New York University]] while working at night to cover the costs of tuition. He is [[professor emeritus]] of American literature and creative writing at [[University of New Hampshire]], where he has taught since 1973<ref>[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/charles-simic Poet Charles Simic]</ref> and lives in [[Strafford, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/more_simic.html|title=More about Charles Simic from Library of Congress}}</ref>

===Career===
He began to make a name for himself in the early to mid-1970s as a literary minimalist, writing terse, imagistic poems.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rodriguez|first=J. Matos|title=Unmothered Americas: Poetry and Universality (On Charles Simic, Alejandra Pizarnik, and Giannina Braschi|publisher=Columbia University Academic Commons|year=2005|location=New York}}</ref> Critics have referred to Simic's poems as "tightly constructed Chinese puzzle boxes". He himself stated: "Words make love on the page like flies in the summer heat and the poet is merely the bemused spectator."<ref>Simic, Charles (ed.) (1992) ''The Best American Poetry 1992'', Charles Scribner's Sons p xv {{ISBN|978-0-684-19501-8}}</ref>

Simic writes on such diverse topics as jazz, art, and philosophy.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chinen|first=Nate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/arts/music/10poet.html|title=A Breezy Exchange Between Old Friends (Jazz and Poetry)|date=January 10, 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 19, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He was influenced by Emily Dickinson, Pablo Neruda, and Fats Waller.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artfuldodge.spaces.wooster.edu/interviews/charles-simic/|title=A Conversation with Charles Simic|last=Williams|first=Eric}}</ref> He is a translator, essayist and philosopher, opining on the current state of contemporary American poetry. He held the position of poetry editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' and was replaced by [[Dan Chiasson]]. He was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1995, received the Academy Fellowship in 1998, and was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/charles-simic|title=Charles Simic|last=Simic|first=Charles|date=February 4, 2014|website=Charles Simic|language=en|access-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref>

Simic was one of the judges for the 2007 [[Griffin Poetry Prize]] and continues to contribute poetry and prose to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. He received the US$100,000 [[Wallace Stevens Award]] in 2007 from the [[Academy of American Poets]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Charles Simic Receives The Wallace Stevens Award|url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/386|publisher=Academy of American Poets|date=August 2, 2007|access-date=January 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625050713/http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/386|archive-date=June 25, 2008}}</ref>

Simic was selected by [[James H. Billington|James Billington]], [[Librarian of Congress]], to be the fifteenth [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]], succeeding [[Donald Hall]]. In choosing Simic as the poet laureate, Billington cited "the rather stunning and original quality of his poetry".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/books/02poet.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=Charles Simic, Surrealist With Dark View, Is Named Poet Laureate|author=Motoko Rich|date=August 2, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 22, 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, Simic was the recipient of the Frost Medal, presented annually for "lifetime achievement in poetry".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poetrysociety.org/about/news/announcing-the-2011-frost-medalist-charles-simic|title=Announcing the 2011 Frost Medalist, Charles Simic|website=Poetry Society of America|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>
