'''James Thomson''' (23 November 1834 – 3 June 1882), who wrote under the [[pseudonym]] '''Bysshe Vanolis''', was a Scottish [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] poet famous primarily for the long poem ''[[The City of Dreadful Night]]'' (1874), an expression of bleak [[Philosophical pessimism|pessimism]] in a dehumanized, uncaring urban environment. Thomson's pseudonym derives from the names of the poets [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Novalis]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=James Thomson ('B.V.')|url=https://www.henrysalt.co.uk/critic/james-thomson-bv/|website=Henry S.

Thomson's poems rarely appear in modern anthologies, although the autobiographical "Insomnia" and "Mater Tenebrarum" are well-regarded and contain some striking passages. He admired and translated the works of the pessimistic Italian poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]] (1798–1837),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Byron|first=Kenneth Hugh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIsbDgAAQBAJ|title=The Pessimism of James Thomson (B.

==Life==
[[File:Grave of Victorian poet James Thompson in Highgate Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Thomson's grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]
Thomson was born in [[Port Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], and, at the age of eight (after his sister died and his father suffered a stroke), he was sent to London where he was raised in an orphanage, the [[Royal Caledonian Asylum]] on Chalk (later Caledonian after the asylum) Road near Holloway. Soon after this his mother died. He spoke with a London accent. He trained as an [[Corps of Army Schoolmasters|army schoolmaster]] at the [[Royal Military Asylum]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and served in [[Ireland]], where in 1851, at the age of 17, he made the acquaintance of the 18-year-old [[Charles Bradlaugh]], who was already notorious as a [[Freethought|freethinker]], having published his first [[atheist]] pamphlet a year earlier.<ref>{{cite book

More than a decade later, Thomson left the military and moved to [[London]], where he worked as a clerk. He remained in contact with Bradlaugh, who was by now issuing his own weekly ''National Reformer'', a "publication for the working man". For the remaining 19 years of his life, starting in 1863, Thomson submitted stories, essays and poems to various publications, including the ''[[National Reformer]]'', which published the sombre poem which remains his most famous work.

''The City of Dreadful Night'' came about from the struggle with insomnia, alcoholism and chronic depression which plagued Thomson's final decade. Increasingly isolated from friends and society in general, he even became hostile towards Bradlaugh. In 1880, nineteen months before his death, the publication of his volume of poetry ''The City of Dreadful Night and Other Poems'' elicited encouraging and complimentary reviews from a number of critics, but came too late to prevent Thomson's downward slide.

Thomson died, in London, at the age of 47, from a broken blood vessel in his bowel,<ref>{{Cite web|title=BOOK REVIEW / Sad days in the City of Dreadful Night: 'Places of the Mind: The Life and Work of James Thomson ('B V') - Tom Leonard: Cape, 25 pounds|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/book-review-sad-days-in-the-city-of-dreadful-night-places-of-the-mind-the-life-and-work-of-james-1473030.html|last=Imlah|first=Mick|date=1993-02-14|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Saintsbury|first=George|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31698|title=A History of Nineteenth Century Literature (1780-1895)|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1906|location=London|pages=297|language=en}}</ref> and was buried in the east side of [[Highgate Cemetery]]. The inscription on his grave states that he was born in 1831, not 1834.

==Legacy==
