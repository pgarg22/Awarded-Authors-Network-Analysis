'''John Henry Noyes Collier''' (3 May 1901 – 6 April 1980) was a British-born author and screenwriter best known for his [[Short story|short stories]], many of which appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' from the 1930s to the 1950s. Most were collected in ''The John Collier Reader'' (Knopf, 1972); earlier collections include a 1951 volume, ''[[Fancies and Goodnights]]'', which won the [[International Fantasy Award]] and remains in print. Individual stories are frequently anthologized in fantasy collections. John Collier's writing has been praised by authors such as [[Anthony Burgess]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Michael Chabon]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], and [[Paul Theroux]]. He appears to have given few interviews in his life; those include conversations with biographer Betty Richardson, [[Tom Milne]], and [[Max Wilk]].

==Life==

Born in London in 1901, John Collier was the son of John George and Emily Mary Noyes Collier. He had one sister, Kathleen Mars Collier. His father, John George Collier, was one of seventeen children, and could not afford formal education; he worked as a clerk. Nor could John George afford schooling for his son beyond [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]]; John Collier and Kathleen were educated at home.<ref name= "Richardson">{{cite book |last= Richardson |first= Betty |chapter= John Collier |title= British Fantasy and Science-Fiction Writers, 1918-1960 |editor= Darren Harris-Fain |location= Detroit |publisher=Gale Group |year= 2002 |pages= 30–36 |series= Dictionary of Literary Biography ; vol. 255}}</ref> He was privately educated by his uncle Vincent Collier, a novelist.<ref name=The>The Editors of Time Life: "Editors' Preface", ''Fancies and Goodnights'', pages viv-xii. Time Life Books, 1965.</ref> Biographer Betty Richardson wrote:

{{quote|He began reading [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fairy tales at three; these began a lifelong interest in myth and legend that was further stimulated when, in his teens, he discovered [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890-1915). An uncle, Vincent Collier, himself a minor novelist, introduced the boy to 17th and 18th century literature. Collier particularly admired [[Jonathan Swift]], and an 18th-century satirist's view of life became his own. From his first work to his version of ''Paradise Lost'', Collier saw humans, flawed but with potential, everywhere contaminated by narrow creeds, institutions, coteries, vanities, and careers.<ref name= "Richardson" />}}

When, at the age of 18 or 19, Collier was asked by his father what he had chosen as a vocation, his reply was, "I want to be a poet." His father indulged him; over the course of the next ten years Collier lived on an allowance of two pounds a week plus whatever he could pick up by writing book reviews and acting as a cultural correspondent for a Japanese newspaper.<ref name=The/> During this time, being not overly burdened by any financial responsibilities, he developed a penchant for games of chance, conversation in cafes and visits to picture galleries.<ref name=Editor>Editor: jacket blurb, ''Defy the Foul Fiend'', back cover. Penguin Books UK, 1948.</ref> He never attended university.<ref name=Hoyle>Hoyle, Fred: "Time ''Reading Program Introduction''", ''Fancies and Goodnights'', page xv-xix. Time Life Books, 1965</ref>

He was married to early [[silent films|silent film]] [[film actress|actress]] [[Shirley Palmer (actress)|Shirley Palmer]] in 1936; they were divorced. His second marriage in 1945 was to New York actress Beth Kay (Margaret Elizabeth Eke). They divorced a decade later. His third wife was Harriet Hess Collier, who survived him; they had one son, John G. S. Collier, born in [[Nice]], [[France]], on May 18, 1958.<ref name= "Richardson" />

==Career==

===Poetry===
He began writing poetry at age nineteen, and was first published in 1920.<ref name= "Ransom">{{cite web |url= http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00025.xml |author= Sauter, Dale |year= 1999 |title= John Collier: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |publisher= Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref>

For ten years Collier attempted to reconcile intensely visual experience opened to him by [[the Sitwells]] and the modern painters with the more austere preoccupations of those classical authors who were fashionable in the 1920s.<ref name=Editor/> He felt that his poetry was unsuccessful, however; he was not able to make his two selves (whom he oddly described as the "archaic, uncouth, and even barbarous" Olsen and the "hysterically self-conscious dandy" Valentine) speak with one voice.<ref name=Hoyle/>

Being an admirer of [[James Joyce]], Collier found a solution in Joyce's [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']]. "On going for my next lesson to [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']], that city of modern prose," he wrote, "I was struck by the great number of magnificent passages in which words are used as they are used in poetry, and in which the emotion which is originally aesthetic, and the emotion which has its origin in intellect, are fused in higher proportions of extreme forms than I had believed was possible."<ref name=Hoyle/> The few poems he wrote during this time were afterwards published in a volume under the title ''Gemini''.<ref name=Editor/>

===Fiction===
While he had written some short stories during the period in which he was trying to find success as a poet, his career did not take shape until the publication of ''His Monkey Wife'' in 1930. It enjoyed a certain small popularity and critical approval that helped to sell his short stories.<ref name=The/> Biographer Richardson explained the literary context for the book:

{{quote|''His Monkey Wife'' is the last among light early-twentieth-century fantasies that include [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' (1908), [[Max Beerbohm]]'s ''[[Zuleika Dobson]]'' (1911), and [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' (1928). Collier's book, however, appeared immediately after the economic crash and the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] in 1929, when the tone of the literary and intellectual world darkened. While his novel was well received, it did not achieve the fame of the earlier fantasies. ... Much in this novel echoes, without Swift's bitterness, the contrast between [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] and the rational [[Houyhnhnm]]s in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726). Collier's style, however, is playful; he borrows heavily from [[Joseph Conrad]], parodies the style of [[Thomas De Quincey]] ... and otherwise sustains the light and artificial tone by literary borrowings throughout.<ref name= "Richardson" />}}

As a private joke, Collier wrote a decidedly cool four-page review of ''His Monkey Wife'', describing it as an attempt "to combine the qualities of the thriller with those of what might be called the decorative novel," and concluding with the following appraisal of the talents of its author: "From the classical standpoint his consciousness is too crammed for harmony, too [[Neurasthenia|neurasthenic]] for proportion, and his humor is too hysterical, too greedy, and too crude."<ref name=Theroux>[[Paul Theroux]], ''Sunrise with Seamonsters''. Houghton Mifflin Books (1986): 303.</ref> Author [[Peter Straub]] has done the same with fake, negative reviews, in admiration of Collier.

His second novel, ''Tom's A-Cold: A Tale'' (1933) was grim, depicting a barbaric and dystopian future England; it is mentioned in [[Joshua Glenn]]'s essay "The 10 Best Apocalypse Novels of Pre-[[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age SF]] (1904-33)."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://io9.com/5098861/the-10-best-apocalypse-novels-of-pre+golden-age-sf-1904+33 |author= Glenn, Joshua |title= The 10 Best Apocalypse Novels of Pre-Golden Age SF (1904-33) |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref> Richardson calls it "part of a tradition of [[apocalyptic literature]] that began in the 1870s" including ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'': "Usually, this literature shows an England destroyed by alien forces, but in Collier's novel, set in [[Hampshire]] in 1995, England has been destroyed by its own vices&mdash;greed, laziness, and an overwhelming bureaucracy crippled by its own committees and red tape."<ref name= "Richardson" /> [[John Clute]] wrote,

{{quote|Radically dissimilar to his most familiar work is ''Tom's A-Cold'' ... a remarkably effective [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-HOLOCAUST novel]] set in the 1990s, long after an unexplained disaster has decimated England's (and presumably the world's) population and thrust mankind back into rural barbarism, a condition out of which the eldest survivors, who remember civilization, are trying to educate the young third generation. The simple plot plays no tricks on the reader... Throughout the novel, very movingly, [Collier] renders the reborn, circumambient natural world with a hallucinatory visual intensity found nowhere else in his work. Along with Alun Llewelyn's ''The Strange Invaders'' (1934), ''Tom's A-Cold'' can be seen, in its atmosphere of almost loving conviction, as a genuine successor to [[Richard Jefferies]]'s ''After London'' (1885); and it contrasts markedly with [Collier's] earlier ''No Traveller Returns'' (1931) ... a harsh dystopian novella set in a deadened world."<ref name= "Clute">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |last1=Clute |first1=John |author-link1=John Clute |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |author-link2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |year=1993 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St Martin's Griffin]] |location=New York |page= 243 |isbn=0-312-13486-X |title= Collier, John}}</ref>}}

The title refers to a line spoken by Edgar in ''[[King Lear]]''; the outcast Edgar (the son of a fictional [[Earl of Gloucester|Gloucester]]) pretends to be a madman named [[Tom o' Bedlam]] and says to the deranged King, who is wandering on the windy [[heath]], "Tom's a-cold."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://shakespeare.mit.edu/lear/lear.3.4.html |author= Shakespeare, William |author-link= William Shakespeare |title= King Lear |publisher= [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref>

His last novel, ''Defy the Foul Fiend; or, The Misadventures of a Heart'', another title taken from the same speech in ''King Lear'' as ''Tom's A-Cold'', was published in 1934.

He received the [[Edgar Award]] in 1952 for the short story collection ''Fancies and Goodnights'', which also won the [[International Fantasy Award]] in 1952.

===Writing style===
[[David Langford]] described Collier as "best known for his highly polished, often bitterly flippant magazine stories... [His] best stories are touched with poetry and real wit, sometimes reminiscent of Saki's. There are moments of outrageous [[Grand Guignol]]; the occasional sexual naughtiness is far beyond [[Thorne Smith]] in [[sophistication]]." Langford praises Collier's "smiling [[misanthropy]]."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |last1= Langford |first1= David |author-link1= David Langford |editor= John Clute |editor-link= John Clute |year=1993 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St Martin's Griffin]] |location=New York |page=1268 |isbn=0-312-13486-X |title= Collier, John (Henry Noyes)}}</ref> Similarly, [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'', "His simple, sharp style brought his tales colourfully to life" and described Collier's fiction as "sardonic."<ref name= "Fowler">{{cite news |last= Fowler |first= Christopher |author-link= Christopher Fowler |title= Forgotten authors No. 34: John Collier |work= [[The Independent]] |publisher= Independent Print Limited |date= 24 May 2009 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/forgotten-authors-no-34-john-collier-1689028.html |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref> John Clute wrote, "He was known mainly for his sophisticated though sometimes rather precious short stories, generally featuring acerbic snap endings; many of these stories have strong elements of fantasy..."<ref name= "Clute" /> [[E. F. Bleiler]] also admired Collier's writing, describing Collier as ""One of the modern masters of the short story and certainly the preeminent writer of short fantasies." and stating that ''The Devil and All'' was "one of the great fantasy  collections".<ref>E. F. Bleiler, ''The Guide To Supernatural Fiction''. Kent, Ohio : Kent State University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0873382889}} (p. 117)</ref>

==Other media==

In the succeeding years, Collier traveled between England, France and [[Hollywood]].<ref name=The/> He continued to write short stories, but as time went on, he would turn his attention more and more towards writing screenplays.

[[Max Wilk]], who interviewed Collier for his book ''Schmucks with Underwoods'', tells how, during the 1930s, Collier left the home he owned in England, Wilcote Manor, and traveled to France, where he lived briefly at [[Antibes]] and [[Cassis]]. The story of how Collier wound up going to Hollywood has been mistold sometimes, but Collier told Wilk that in Cassis,

{{quote|"I saw a fishing boat I rather liked, and I wanted to buy it. They wanted 7000 francs. And I wondered where on earth I could find that much money. And would you believe, right then, some little girl came riding up on a bicycle to hand me a telegram....[sic] It was my London agent wanting to know, would I go to Hollywood to work for eight weeks, at $500 per week?... And I went out to California, and they were waiting for me. Delightful experience. A picture called ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'', at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. [[George Cukor]] was the director. I'd scarcely seen a motion picture in my life; I didn't know a thing about screenwriting. In point of fact, it was something of a [[Error|mistake]]. [[Hugh Walpole]] had told George I'd be right for the job. George thought Hugh was talking about Evelyn Waugh."<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OXMiODCuQYC&q=%22Hugh+Walpole%22+%22john+collier%22+boat+hollywood&pg=PA129 |author= Wilk, Max |author-link= Max Wilk |title= Schmucks with Underwoods: Conversations with Hollywood's Classic Screenwriters |location= New York |publisher= Applause Theatre & Cinema Books |year= 2004 |pages= 128–129 |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref>}}

The film ''Sylvia Scarlett'' starred [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Brian Aherne]], and [[Edmund Gwenn]]; it was the comic story of a widower, his daughter Sylvia who disguises herself as a boy, and a con man; Collier's collaborators on the script were [[Gladys Unger]] and [[Mortimer Offner]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027067/ |title= Sylvia Scarlett |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref> Wilk writes that the film was considered bizarre at the time, but decades later, it enjoys a cult following.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OXMiODCuQYC&q=%22Hugh+Walpole%22+%22john+collier%22+boat+hollywood&pg=PA129 |author= Wilk, Max |author-link= Max Wilk |title= Schmucks with Underwoods: Conversations with Hollywood's Classic Screenwriters |location= New York |publisher= Applause Theatre & Cinema Books |year= 2004 |page= 129 |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref>

Collier landed in Hollywood on May 16, 1935, but, he told Wilk, after ''Sylvia Scarlett'' he returned to England. There, he spent a year working on ''[[Elephant Boy (film)|Elephant Boy]]'' for director [[Zoltan Korda]].

{{quote|"Korda took me into a projection room, and we sat there watching hours of film that had been shot in [[Burma]]...[sic] without the advantage of any script! Just a director with his crew, shooting film of [[elephant]]s. So we saw elephants coming this way, elephants going that way, charging, retreating...[sic] Endless elephants! And there were some shots of a little boy, about three feet tall, a charming little creature. That would be [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]].... Korda and I saw all this huge amount of film, and after about three hours of it, he began to utter hideous cries! What could he possibly do with all this goddamned film?"<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OXMiODCuQYC&q=%22Hugh+Walpole%22+%22john+collier%22+boat+hollywood&pg=PA129 |author= Wilk, Max |author-link= Max Wilk |title= Schmucks with Underwoods: Conversations with Hollywood's Classic Screenwriters |location= New York |publisher= Applause Theatre & Cinema Books |year= 2004 |page= 130 |access-date= September 7, 2012}}</ref>}}

Collier suggested a way to make the footage cohere into a story and to make "a star out of that little boy, Sabu." After these two unorthodox starts to screenwriting, Collier was on his way to a new writing career.

===Screenplays===

Collier returned to Hollywood, where he wrote prolifically for film and television. He contributed notably to the screenplays of ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' along with [[James Agee]] and [[John Huston]], ''[[The War Lord]]'', ''[[I Am a Camera (film)|I Am A Camera]]'' (adapted from ''[[The Berlin Stories]]'' and remade later as ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]''), ''[[Her Cardboard Lover]]'', ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'' and ''[[Roseanna McCoy]]''.

* '''Evening Primrose''' &mdash; Probably his most famous; about people who live in a department store, hiding during the day and coming out at night.

The primary duty of the latter is to suppress any rebellion against this materialistic society."<ref name= "Richardson" /> The story was read by [[Vincent Price]] and recorded on an [[LP record]] by [[Caedmon Audio]] in 1980. The story also served as the inspiration for the 1984 music video "Prime Time" by the British progressive rock band [[The Alan Parsons Project]].
* '''Interpretation of a Dream''' &mdash; A man experiences disturbing and serial dreams of falling from the thirty-ninth story of the skyscraper in which he works, passing one story every night.

The episode was actually directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] himself. It was also later adapted for [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]].''
* '''Youth from Vienna''' &mdash; A couple, whose careers (tennis player and actress) depend on youth, are forced to deal with a gift of a single dose of rejuvenating medicine that cannot be divided or shared.
