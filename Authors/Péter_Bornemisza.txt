'''Péter Bornemisza''' (c. 1535 – 1584) was a Hungarian Lutheran bishop of noble birth. His father was killed by the Turks around the time he was six years old. A scholar from England, at the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Cracow]], first interested him in Protestantism and later [[Philipp Melanchthon]] had a strong impact on him. He later preached and printed Protestant works in his native land.<ref name="Old2004">{{cite book|author=Hughes Oliphant Old|title=The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 5: Moderatism, Pietism, and Awakening|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWXDCJ1AeDgC&pg=PA310|date=23 July 2004|publisher=Wm.
