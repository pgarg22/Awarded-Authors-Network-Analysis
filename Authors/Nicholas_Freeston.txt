He published five books of poetry, occasionally writing in [[Lancashire dialect]], and won fifteen awards including a gold medal presented by the president of the United Poets' Laureate International.

== Early life ==

Nicholas Freeston was born in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]] in August 1907 and moved with his family to [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Lancashire]], at the age of 8. One of ten children he started work in a cotton mill aged 12.<ref name="mirror" /> According to a ''Daily Mirror'' profile of the poet from 1963, the first verse of one of his poems captured the challenges of his early life:

:''"A silver spoon was never mine. I cut my teeth on tears. And all the things that men call fine have passed me down the years."''

He took a correspondence course in English during the economic depression of the 1930s when he was out of work for six years, but it was 1947 before his first poem was published.<ref name="mirror" /> The ''[[Lancashire Evening Telegraph]]'' described how he bolstered his learning by taking evening classes with the [[Workers' Educational Association]] and reading immense amounts of poetry.<ref name="LETobit" />

== Poetry ==

Nicholas Freeston published his first book of poetry, ''Christmas Bells and Other Poems'', in 1950, followed by ''The House of the Croft'' in 1952 and ''The First Christmas'' in 1953.<ref name="NDT1955">''Northern Daily Telegraph'' (Blackburn). 1955.</ref> He was able to publish the books thanks to the generosity of local patrons.<ref>"Weaver-poet's second book". ''Northern Daily Telegraph'' (Blackburn). 1952</ref> A profile of the poet in the ''Northern Daily Telegraph'', a local newspaper, told how Freeston had the 'unusual hobby' of writing poetry after working by day as a weaver at Messrs. Hindle and Warburton's Oakenshaw Mill [in [[Clayton-le-Moors]]]. Asked if his job was a barrier to writing poetry, he told the newspaper: "Not a bit of it. It is an asset. I get a lot of my ideas at the [[loom]]".<ref>"Weaver-poet gets ideas as he works". ''Northern Daily Telegraph'' (Blackburn). 1951.</ref>

In 1955 the [[BBC]] radio presenter [[Wilfred Pickles]] selected two of Nicholas Freeston's poems for inclusion in an anthology of poetry and prose of the 'north counties' of England. The book, ''My North Countrie'', featured Freeston's [[Lancashire dialect]] verses, 'Th' Art Lookin' Sackless' and 'A Bird Song Away'.<ref>[[Wilfred Pickles|Pickles, Wilfred]]. ''My North Countrie''. [[Allen & Unwin|George, Allen & Unwin Ltd]]. 1955</ref>

:''"That he sung to his mate Ah wor never in deawt, Nobbut luv could inspire sich a cry. An' ut th'end uv his song Coom her answerin' sheawt, Fro' a stately owd Cherry nearby."''

In the same year as the publication of Pickles' anthology, Freeston published his fourth book, a collection of his own poems priced two [[shillings]]. He donated proceeds from the book's sale to Nazareth House, a charity in Blackburn, Lancashire.<ref name="NDT1955"/>

Freeston's final book, a collection of 65 poems, was published in 1966, in response to numerous requests for his work.<ref name="poems1966">[http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt=1&tab=local_tab&dstmp=1388489335335&vl(freeText0)=nicholas%20freeston&fn=search&vid=BLVU1&mode=Basic&fromLogin=true Freeston, Nicholas. "Author's Notes". Poems. ''1966'']</ref> The book featured 'The Blackbird in Delph Road', a reference to Birtwistle and Fielding's Delph Road Mill, [[Great Harwood]], where he worked the night-shift in the weaving shed. The poem 'Paddy' was dedicated to an Irish man he worked with, who was, according to the Accrington Observer,  "a great walker and bird-watcher until he died at the age of 93":<ref name="Dobson">Dobson, Bob. "Mill worker Nicholas wove a beautiful poem". ''Accrington Observer''. 19 December 1997.</ref>

:''"Ah'm gradely fain that Fate decreed That he should pass my way."''

The book also included the semi-autobiographical verse, 'Above the Din', which was brought to a much wider audience a year earlier in a profile of the poet in the ''Daily Mail'' newspaper. The profile described how Freeston found inspiration for his poetry in the loneliness of 'the deafening clash of the looms' in a weaving shed where he worked the night-shift:<ref name="DailyMail">Windsor, John. "A man - who won poets' gold medal - alone." ''[[Daily Mail]]'' (London). 11 September 1965</ref>
:''"Above the din of the looms I heard the splendid song of a happy bird. And the message there was plain to me of the things to come, of the joys to be."''

Freeston described being completely alone in the noise of the weaving shed, "I could never lip-read so I composed 200 poems and committed them to paper during my supper break".<ref name="DailyMail" /> When he was interviewed about his poetry by the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in 1970, he was working as a weaver in a cotton mill in [[Oswaldtwistle]],<ref name="broadhurst">Broadhurst, Terry. "Nick finds poetry on the shop-floor". ''[[Lancashire Evening Telegraph]]'' (Blackburn). 9 February 1970</ref> the Lancashire town where [[James Hargreaves]], the inventor of the revolutionary textile machine the [[spinning jenny]], was born in the early 18th century.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica. James Hargreaves. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255264/James-Hargreaves. Extracted 9 February 2014.</ref> Freeston told the Telegraph, "I find beauty in the world about me. You have to look for beauty in ugly surroundings. This is what I do and it gives me great solace". Freeston explained how he could only write when he could feel and see the words in pictures. "I'm not one of those commercial poets who can write to order", he said, explaining how he thought of his poems at the loom or walking along the street: "I recall something that has struck me during a day in the countryside or something remembered from my childhood."

:''"They laid it low my tree, And why, I never knew, One said - 'twas for its ugliness, And some - it spoiled the view."''

== Awards and recognition ==

Nicholas Freeston won fifteen awards for his [[Lancashire dialect]] and [[lyric poetry]], and by the time of his death in 1978, was listed in the third edition of ''[[Who's Who in the World]]''.<ref name="LETobit" /> The ''[[Accrington Observer]]'', the weekly newspaper for Accrington and the surrounding area, known as [[Hyndburn]], called him the borough's "Premier Poet" for his "pure-as-crystal poetry".<ref name="Dobson"/> Despite the recognition, he insisted: "The weaving shed is really as far as I expected to be known".<ref name="DailyMail" />
