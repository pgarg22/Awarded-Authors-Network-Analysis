}}'''Ernest Carpenter Elmore''' (4 November, 1901 – 8 November, 1957) was an English theatre producer and director,<ref name="ucp" /> and writer of crime and fantasy novels. He wrote his crime novels under the pseudonym '''John Bude'''.<ref>SFE Encyclopedia of Science Fiction [http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/elmore_ernest Retrieved 8 March 2014]; ISFDB site [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?196639 Retrieved 8 March 2014.]</ref>

==Life==
Elmore was born in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]] in 1901. He attended [[Mill Hill School]] until 1919 as a boarder, and then studied at a secretarial college in [[Cheltenham]], before becoming a games master at [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]]. While there he also assisted with the school's dramatic activities. His interest in dramatics led him to join the [[Lena Ashwell]] Players as stage manager, touring the country with the company. Much of Elmore's early writing took place in dressing rooms during his spare time.

In 1931 he is known to have been living in the village of [[Loose, Kent]],<ref>''Catalog of Copyright Entries. New Series: 1931, Part 1'' (Washington, DC: Library of Congress), p. 2054.</ref> before returning to Maidstone, where he produced plays for the local dramatic society. There he also met his future wife Betty. They married in Maidstone in 1933 and moved to [[Beckley, Sussex]], where he became a full-time writer. Together Elmore and his wife had a daughter, Jennifer, and a son, Richard.

In December 2015, Elmore's photo appeared in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, along with a lengthy article detailing the success of reprints of his books.

==Writings==
Writing as John Bude, Elmore published thirty crime novels,<ref name="ucp">{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/B/J/au18048028.html |title=John Bude |publisher=University of Chicago Press |accessdate=2014-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308234830/http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/B/J/au18048028.html |archivedate=8 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> with Inspector William Meredith appearing in most of them. The first two, both of which were published in 1935, were ''The Lake District Murder'' and ''The Cornish Coast Murder'', followed the next year by ''The Sussex Downs Murder''. These three have since been reprinted by the [[British Library]].<ref>British Library Books [http://shop.bl.uk/mall/departmentpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/_87293/1/Books Retrieved 8 March 2014.]</ref> Elmore was a founder member of the [[Norfolk]]-based [[Crime Writers' Association]] in 1953.<ref name="ucp" />

Straddling the crime novels were several works of humorous fantasy written under his own name, the most well-known being: ''The Steel Grubs'' (1928), ''This Siren Song'' (1930) (which features some [[MacGuffin]]s), and ''The Lumpton Gobbelings'' (1954) (about an invasion of naked little people who scandalize the local villagers).<ref>SFE [http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/elmore_ernest Retrieved 8 March 2014]; ISFDB. [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?196639 Retrieved 8 March 2014.]</ref>  Including a children's book, ''Snuffly Snorty Dog'' (1946), Elmore wrote a total of seven books in his own name.<ref name="World Catalog">[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AElmore%2C+Ernest.&qt=hot_author World Catalog]</ref>

Fellow British crime author [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]] commented: "Bude writes both readably and entertainingly. His work may not have been stunning enough to belong with the greats, but there is a smoothness and accomplishment about even his first mystery, ''The Cornish Coast Murder'', which you don't find in many début mysteries."<ref>Martin Edwards's blog.

Elmore died in [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]] on 8 November 1957.<ref>SFE....</ref>
