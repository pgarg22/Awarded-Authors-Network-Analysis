'''Ernest Christopher Dowson''' (2 August 1867{{spaced ndash}}23 February 1900) was an English poet, novelist, and short-story writer who is often associated with the [[Decadent movement]].

==Biography==
Ernest Dowson was born in [[Lee, London|Lee]], then in Kent, in 1867. His great-uncle was [[Alfred Domett]], a [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]. Dowson attended [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], but left in March 1888 without obtaining a degree.{{sfn|Jad|2000|p=17}}

In November 1888, Dowson started work at Dowson and Son, his father's [[dry-docking]] business in [[Limehouse]], east London, Dawson led an active social life, carousing with medical students and law pupils, visiting [[music halls]] and taking the performers to dinner.

Dowson, was a member of the [[Rhymers' Club]] and a contributor to [[literary magazine]]s such as ''[[The Yellow Book]]'' and ''[[The Savoy (periodical)|The Savoy]]''.<ref>Richards, (n.d.)</ref> He collaborated on two unsuccessful novels with Arthur Moore, worked on a novel of his own, ''Madame de Viole'', and wrote reviews for ''[[The Critic]]''. Later in his career, Dowson was a translator of French fiction, including novels by [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] and the [[Goncourt brothers]], and ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' by Choderlos de Laclos.<ref>Richards, (n.d.)</ref>

In 1889, Dowson became infatuated with 11 year-old Adelaide "Missie" Foltinowicz, the daughter of a [[Poland|Polish]] restaurant owner. In 1892, Dowson converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1893, he proposed to Foltinowicz, then age 15.<ref>Anon (1968), pp. 61-2.</ref> However, his proposal was refused and she later married a tailor.<ref>Richards, (n.d.)</ref>

In August 1894, Dowson's father, suffering from [[tuberculosis]], died of an overdose of [[chloral hydrate]]. In February 1895, his mother, who also had tuberculosis, hanged herself. Soon after her death, Dowson's health began to decline rapidly.<ref>Anon (1968), p. 62.</ref> Soon afterwards, [[Leonard Smithers]] gave Dowson an allowance to live in France and write translations for him.<ref>Richards, (n.d.)</ref> However, in 1897, Dowson returned to London to live with the Foltinowicz family.<ref>Anon (1968), p. 63.</ref>
 
In 1899, [[Robert Sherard]] found Dowson almost penniless in a wine bar. Sherard brought him to his cottage in [[Catford]], where Dowson spent his last six weeks.

On 23 February 1900, Dowson died in Catford at age 32. He was interred in the Roman Catholic section of [[Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries]] in London.<ref>Richards, (n.d.)</ref>

==Works==

Dowson is best remembered for three phrases from his poems:

* "Days of Wine and Roses", from the poem "Vitae Summa Brevis"
* "Gone with the wind", from the poem <nowiki>''</nowiki>Non Sum Qualis eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae"
* "I have been faithful..in my fashion", from "Cynarae"

The phrase "Days of Wine and Roses" was used by [[JP Miller]] as the title of his 1958 television drama [[Days of Wine and Roses (Playhouse 90)|''Days of Wine and Roses'']] and the [[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|1962 film adaptation]]''.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Days of Wine and Roses, a CurtainUp London review|url=http://www.curtainup.com/daysofwineandroses.html|access-date=2021-09-28|website=www.curtainup.com}}</ref> The phrase also inspired the title of the song "[[Days of Wine and Roses (song)|Days of Wine and Roses]]".

 |source = – Ernest Dowson, from ''Non Sum Qualis eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae'',{{efn|name=Horace Odes Book IV,1}} third stanza (1894).
 |align  = left
}}[[Margaret Mitchell]], touched by the "far away, faintly sad sound I wanted" of the third stanza's first line in "Cynarae", chose that line as the title of her novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.<ref>https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/SOURCE-of-the-TITLE-GWTW-Margaret-Mitchell-Gone-with-the-Wind</ref>

"Cynarae" is also the source of the phrase 'I have been faithful..in my fashion'. That phrase was used in the title of the 1946 film, ''[[Faithful in My Fashion]]''. [[Cole Porter]] paraphrased Dowson in the song "[[Always True to You in My Fashion]]" from the musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]''. [[Morrissey]] used the lines, "In my own strange way,/I've always been true to you./In my own sick way,/I'll always stay true to you," in the song "Speedway," on the album ''[[Vauxhall & I]]''.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Dowson provides the earliest use of the word [[soccer]] in written language (although he spells it ''socca'', presumably because it did not yet have a standard written form).{{efn|name=n2}}

Dowson's prose works include the [[Short story|short stories]] collected as ''Dilemmas'' (1895), and the two novels ''A Comedy of Masks'' (1893) and ''Adrian Rome'' (each co-written with Arthur Moore).

"Cynarae" was first published in ''The Second Book of the Rhymer's Club'' in 1894,{{sfn|Mathews|Lane|1894|pp=60–61}} and was noticed by [[Richard Le Gallienne]] in his "Wanderings in Bookland" column in ''[[The Idler (1892–1911)|The Idler]]'', volume 9.{{sfn|The Idler Volume 9|p=889}}

==Legacy==

* In a letter to [[Leonard Smithers]], [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote of the death of Dowson: "Poor wounded wonderful fellow that he was, a tragic reproduction of all tragic poetry, like a symbol, or a scene. I hope bay leaves will be laid on his tomb and rue and myrtle too for he knew what love is."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3FygQsGAzY8C&pg=PA421 Ernest Christopher Dowson, ed., ''The Letters of Ernest Dowson'', Epilogue, p. 421]; retrieved 10 August 2013</ref>
* Arthur Moore wrote several comic novels about the young adult duo of Anthony 'Tony' Wilder and Paul Morrow. Tony is based on Dowson, while Paul is based on Moore. The Moore novel ''The Eyes of Light'' is mentioned by [[E. Nesbit]] in her book ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]''.

* In the ''Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson'', a 1919 memoir, [[Arthur Symons]], Symons describes Dowson as: "... a man who was undoubtedly a man of genius ... There never was a poet to whom verse came more naturally ... He had the pure lyric gift, unweighed or unballasted by any other quality of mind or emotion..."{{sfn|Dowson|2007|loc=Memoir from 1990 edition}}
