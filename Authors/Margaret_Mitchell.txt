'''Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell''' (November 8, 1900 – August 16, 1949)<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Margaret-Mitchell|title=Margaret Mitchell {{!}} American novelist|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=October 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref> was an American novelist and journalist. Mitchell wrote only one novel, published during her lifetime, the [[American Civil War]]-era novel ''[[Gone With the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', for which she won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for Most Distinguished Novel of 1936<ref name=nyt1937>{{cite news |title=5 Honors Awarded on the Year's Books: ... |work=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1937 |page=23 }}</ref> and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1937. In recent years long after her death, a collection of Mitchell's girlhood writings and a novella she wrote as a teenager, titled ''[[Lost Laysen]]'', have been published. A collection of newspaper articles written by Mitchell for [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|''The Atlanta Journal'']] was republished in book form.

==Family history==
Margaret Mitchell was a Southerner, a native and lifelong resident of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She was born in 1900 into a wealthy and politically prominent family. Her father, Eugene Muse Mitchell, was an attorney, and her mother, [[Maybelle Stephens Mitchell|Mary Isabel "Maybelle" Stephens]], was a [[suffragist]]. She had two brothers, Russell Stephens Mitchell, who died in infancy in 1894, and Alexander Stephens Mitchell, born in 1896.<ref name=cyclopedia /><ref name="seven sisters" />

[[File:Eugene Muse Mitchell.jpg|thumb|left|Eugene Muse Mitchell, the father of Margaret Mitchell]]

Mitchell's family on her father's side were descendants of Thomas Mitchell, originally of [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, who settled in [[Wilkes County, Georgia]] in 1777, and served in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Thomas Mitchell was a surveyor by profession. He was on a surveying trip in [[Henry County, Georgia]], at the home of Mr. John Lowe, about 6 miles from [[McDonough, Georgia]], when he died in 1835 and is buried in that location.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Stephens|title=Margaret Mitchell and Her People in the Atlanta Area|journal=The Atlanta Historical Bulletin}}</ref>  William Mitchell, born December 8, 1777, in Lisborn, Edgefield County, South Carolina, moved between 1834 and 1835, to a farm along the South River in the [[Flat Rock, Georgia|Flat Rock Community]] in Georgia.<ref name=":0" /> William Mitchell died February 24, 1859, at the age of 81 and is buried in the family graveyard near [[Panola Mountain|Panola Mountain State Park]].<ref name=":0" /> Her great-grandfather Issac Green Mitchell moved to farm along the Flat Shoals Road located in the [[Flat Rock, Georgia|Flat Rock community]] in 1839. Four years later he sold this farm to [[Ira O. McDaniel]] and purchased a farm 3 miles farther down the road on the north side of the [[South River (Ocmulgee River tributary)|South River]] in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]].<ref name=":0" />

Her grandfather, Russell Crawford Mitchell, of Atlanta, enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]] on June 24, 1861, and served in [[Texas Brigade|Hood's Texas Brigade]]. He was severely wounded at the [[Battle of Antietam|Battle of Sharpsburg]], demoted for "inefficiency," and detailed as a nurse in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=Harold B.|title=Hood's Texas Brigade: A Compendium|date=1977|publisher=Hill Jr. College Press|location=Hillsboro, TX|isbn=0912172223|page=69}}</ref> After the Civil War, he made a large fortune supplying lumber for the rapid rebuilding of Atlanta.

Mitchell's maternal great-grandfather, Philip Fitzgerald, emigrated from [[Ireland]] and eventually settled on a slaveholding plantation, [[Rural Home]], near [[Jonesboro, Georgia]], where he had one son and seven daughters with his wife, Elenor. Mitchell's grandparents, married in 1863, were [[Annie Fitzgerald Stephens|Annie Fitzgerald]] and John Stephens; he had also emigrated from Ireland and became a captain in the Confederate States Army. John Stephens was a prosperous real estate developer after the Civil War and one of the founders of the [[Gate City Street Railroad]] (1881), a mule-drawn [[Streetcars in Atlanta|Atlanta trolley system]]. John and Annie Stephens had twelve children together; the seventh child was May Belle Stephens, who married Eugene Mitchell.<ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite book |last=Ruppersburg |first=Hugh |title=The New Georgia Encyclopedia Companion to Georgia Literature |location=Athens, Georgia |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=2007 |page=326 |isbn=9780820328768 }}</ref><ref>Historical Jonesboro/Clayton County Inc.

The ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Constitution]]'' reported that May Belle Stephens and Eugene Mitchell were married at the Jackson Street mansion of the bride's parents on November 8, 1892:

<blockquote>the maid of honor, Miss Annie Stephens, was as pretty as a French pastel, in a directoire costume of yellow satin with a long coat of green velvet sleeves, and a vest of gold brocade...The bride was a fair vision of youthful loveliness in her robe of exquisite ivory white and [[satin]]...her slippers were white satin wrought with [[pearl]]s...an elegant supper was served. The dining room was decked in white and green, illuminated with numberless candles in silver candlelabras...The bride's gift from her father was an elegant house and lot...At 11 o'clock Mrs. Mitchell donned a pretty going-away gown of green English cloth with its jaunty velvet hat to match and bid goodbye to her friends.<ref>''The Chi Phi Chakett'': Graduate Personals.

==Early influences==
Margaret Mitchell spent her early childhood on Jackson Hill, east of downtown Atlanta.<ref name=autogenerated14>{{cite book |last=Hobson |first=Fred C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8kdTSjGliAC&pg=PA19 |title=South to the future: an American region in the twenty-first century |location=Athens, GA |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=2002 |page=19 |isbn=0-8203-2411-6 }}</ref>  Her family lived near her maternal grandmother, Annie Stephens, in a [[Victorian house]] painted bright red with yellow trim.<ref name="daughter">{{cite book |last=Pyron |first=Darden Asbury |title=Southern Daughter: the life of Margaret Mitchell |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |page=37 |isbn=978-0-19-505276-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yNbAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> Mrs. Stephens had been a widow for several years prior to Margaret's birth; Captain John Stephens died in 1896.

Grandmother Annie Stephens was quite a character, both vulgar and a tyrant. After gaining control of her father Philip Fitzgerald's money after he died, she splurged on her younger daughters, including Margaret's mother, and sent them to [[finishing school]] in the north. There they learned that [[Irish American]]s were not treated as equal to other immigrants, and that it was awesome to be a daughter of an Irishman.<ref name="daughter"/>{{rp|325}} Margaret's relationship with her grandmother would become quarrelsome in later years as she entered adulthood. However, for Margaret, her grandmother was a great source of "eye-witness information" about the Civil War and Reconstruction in Atlanta prior to her death in 1934.<ref>Farr, Finis.

===Girlhood on Jackson Hill===
[[File:Little Jimmy-He Keeps Clean 1905.jpg|thumb|''Little Jimmy'' (1905) by [[Jimmy Swinnerton]]]]
In an accident that was traumatic for her mother although she was unharmed, when Mitchell was about three years old, her dress caught fire on an iron grate. Fearing it would happen again, her mother began dressing her in boys' pants, and she was nicknamed "Jimmy", the name of a character in the comic strip, ''[[Little Jimmy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated41>Jones, Anne Goodwyn.

Stephens Mitchell said his sister was a [[tomboy]] who would happily play with dolls occasionally, and she liked to ride her Texas plains pony.<ref name=autogenerated305 />  As a little girl, Mitchell went riding every afternoon with a Confederate veteran and a young lady of "beau-age".<ref>Jones, A. G., ''Tomorrow is Another Day: the woman writer in the South 1859–1936'', p. 321.</ref> She was raised in an era when children were "seen and not heard" and was not allowed to express her personality by running and screaming on Sunday afternoons while her family was visiting relatives.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/margaret-mitchell-american-rebel/interview-with-margaret-mitchell-from-1936/2011/ Radio interview with Medora Perkerson on radio station WSB in Atlanta on July 3, 1936]  Retrieved June 9, 2012.</ref> 
Mitchell learned the gritty details of specific battles from these visits with aging Confederate soldiers. But she didn't learn that the South had actually lost the war until she was 10 years of age: "I heard everything in the world except that the Confederates lost the war. When I was ten years old, it was a violent shock to learn that General Lee had been defeated. I didn't believe it when I first heard it and I was indignant. I still find it hard to believe, so strong are childhood impressions."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perkeson|first1=Medora|title=Margaret Mitchell: American Rebel Interview with Margaret Mitchell from 1936|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/margaret-mitchell-american-rebel-interview-with-margaret-mitchell-from-1936/2011/|website=PBS.org|date=March 12, 2012}}</ref> Her mother would swat her with a hairbrush or a slipper as a form of discipline.<ref name=autogenerated305>Farr, Finis, ''Margaret Mitchell of Atlanta: the author of Gone With the Wind'', p. 14.</ref><ref name="daughter"/>{{rp|413}}

May Belle Mitchell was "hissing blood-curdling threats" to her daughter to make her behave the evening she took her to a [[women's suffrage]] rally led by [[Carrie Chapman Catt]].<ref name="daughter"/>{{rp|56}} Her daughter sat on a platform wearing a [[Votes for Women (speech)|Votes-for-Women]] banner, blowing kisses to the gentlemen, while her mother gave an impassioned speech.<ref name=autogenerated13 /><ref>Jones, A.

May Belle Mitchell was president of the Atlanta Woman's Suffrage League (1915), chairwoman of press publicity for the Georgia Mothers' Congress and Parent Teacher Association, a member of the Pioneer Society, the [[Atlanta Woman's Club]], and several church and literary societies.<ref>[http://athnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu/athnewspapers/view?docId=news/ahd1915/ahd1915-0420.xml&query=Atlanta%20Woman's%20Suffrage%20League&brand=athnewspapers-brand "Georgia Suffrage News"] (March 3, 1915) ''Athens Daily Herald'', p. 4.

Jackson Hill was an old, affluent part of the city.<ref name=autogenerated13>Bartley, Numen V. ''The Evolution of Southern Culture'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1988. p. 89. {{ISBN|0-8203-0993-1}}</ref>  At the bottom of Jackson Hill was an area of [[African American]] homes and businesses called "[[Darktown]]". The mayhem of the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] occurred over four days in September 1906 when Mitchell was five years old.<ref name=Hobson /> Local white newspapers printed unfounded rumors that several white women had been assaulted by black men,<ref>Godshalk, David Fort.

Eugene Mitchell went to bed early the night the rioting began, but was awakened by the sounds of gunshots. The following morning, as he later wrote, to his wife, he learned "16 negroes had been killed and a multitude had been injured" and that rioters "killed or tried to kill every Negro they saw."

Though the rumors proved untrue and no attack arrived, Mitchell recalled twenty years later the terror she felt during the riot.<ref name="daughter"/>{{rp|41}} Mitchell grew up in a Southern culture where the fear of black on white rape incited mob violence, and in this world, white Georgians lived in fear of the "black beast rapist".<ref>Bartley, N.

===The South of ''Gone with the Wind''===
While "the South" exists as a geographical region of the United States, it is also said to exist as "a place of the imagination" of writers.<ref>Cassuto, Leonard, Claire Virginia Eby and Benjamin Reiss. ''The Cambridge History of the American Novel''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 236. {{ISBN|978-0-521-89907-9}}</ref> An image of "the South" was fixed in Mitchell's imagination when at six years old her mother took her on a buggy tour through ruined plantations and "Sherman's sentinels",<ref name=autogenerated8 /> the brick and stone chimneys that remained after [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March]] and torch" through Georgia.<ref>Caudill, Edward and Paul Ashdown.

Lanaham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2008. p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5027-8}}</ref> Mitchell would later recall what her mother had said to her:

<blockquote>She talked about the world those people had lived in, such a secure world, and how it had exploded beneath them. And she told me that my world was going to explode under me, someday, and God help me if I didn't have some weapon to meet the new world.<ref name=autogenerated8>Felder, Deborah G. ''A Century of Women: the most influential events in twentieth-century women's history''. New York, NY: Citadel Press, 1999. p. 158. {{ISBN|0-8065-2526-6}}</ref></blockquote>

From an imagination cultivated in her youth, Margaret Mitchell's defensive weapon would become her writing.<ref name=autogenerated8 />

Mitchell said she heard Civil War stories from her relatives when she was growing up:

<blockquote>On Sunday afternoons when we went calling on the older generation of relatives, those who had been active in the Sixties, I sat on the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.<ref>Martin, Sara Hines.

===An avid reader===
An avid reader, young Margaret read "boys' stories" by [[G.A.

==Young storyteller==
An imaginative and precocious writer, Margaret Mitchell began with stories about animals, then progressed to fairy tales and adventure stories. She fashioned book covers for her stories, bound the tablet paper pages together and added her own artwork. At age eleven she gave a name to her publishing enterprise: "Urchin Publishing Co." Later her stories were written in notebooks.<ref name="before"/>{{rp|x, 14–15}} Mary Belle Mitchell kept her daughter's stories in white enamel bread boxes and several boxes of her stories were stored in the house by the time Margaret went off to college.<ref name=marsh/>{{rp|32}}

Romantic love and honor emerged as themes of abiding interest for Mitchell in ''The Knight and the Lady'' (ca. 1909), in which a "good [[knight]]" and a "bad knight" duel for the hand of the lady. In ''The Arrow Brave and the Deer Maiden'' (ca. 1913), a half-white Indian brave, Jack, must withstand the pain inflicted upon him to uphold his honor and win the girl.<ref name="before"/>{{rp|9 & 106–112}} The same themes were treated with increasing artistry  in ''Lost Laysen'', the novella Mitchell wrote as a teenager in 1916,<ref name="lost">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_0684837684 |url-access=registration |title = Lost Laysen|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn = 9780684837680|last1 = Mitchell|first1 = Margaret|date = May 6, 1997}}</ref>{{rp|7}} and, with much greater sophistication, in Mitchell's last known novel, ''Gone with the Wind'', which she began in 1926.<ref>Mitchell, Margaret.

==School life==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''''Fancy Dress Masquerade'''''

Seventy girls and boys were the guests of Miss Margaret Mitchell at a fancy dress masquerade yesterday afternoon at the home of her parents Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Mitchell on Peachtree street and the occasion was beautiful and enjoyable.

There was a prize for guessing the greatest number of identities under the masks, and another for the guest who best concealed his or her identity.

The pretty young hostess was a demure Martha Washington in flowered crepe gown over a pink silk petticoat and her powdered hair was worn high.

Mrs. Mitchell wore a ruby velvet gown.

Mitchell was, in her own words, an "unscrupulous flirt".

==Novelist==

===Early works===

====''Lost Laysen''====
Mitchell wrote a romance  [[novella]], ''[[Lost Laysen]]'', when she was fifteen years old (1916). She gave ''Lost Laysen'', which she had written in two notebooks, to a boyfriend, Henry Love Angel. He died in 1945 and the novella remained undiscovered among some letters she had written to him until 1994.<ref name="lost"/>{{rp|7–8}} The novella was published in 1996, eighty years after it was written, and became a [[New York Times Best Seller|''New York Times'' Best Seller]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/02/books/best-sellers-june-2-1996.html BEST SELLERS: June 2, 1996.] Retrieved August 27, 2012.</ref>

In ''Lost Laysen'', Mitchell explores the dynamics of three male characters and their relationship to the only female character, Courtenay Ross, a strong-willed American missionary to the South Pacific island of Laysen. The narrator of the tale is Billy Duncan, "a rough, hardened soldier of fortune",<ref name="lost"/>{{rp|97}} who is frequently involved in fights that leave him near death. Courtenay quickly observes Duncan's hard-muscled body as he works shirtless aboard a ship called ''Caliban''. Courtenay's suitor is Douglas Steele, an athletic man who apparently believes Courtenay is helpless without him. He follows Courtenay to Laysen to protect her from perceived foreign savages. The third male character is the rich, powerful yet villainous Juan Mardo. He leers at Courtenay and makes rude comments of a sexual nature, in Japanese nonetheless. Mardo provokes Duncan and Steele, and each feels he must defend Courtenay's honor. Ultimately Courtenay defends her own honor rather than submit to shame.

Mitchell's half-breed<ref name="lost"/>{{rp|92}}
antagonist, Juan Mardo, lurks in the shadows of the story and has no dialogue. The reader learns of Mardo's evil intentions through Duncan:

<blockquote>They were saying that Juan Mardo had his eye on you—and intended to have you—any way he could get you!<ref name="lost"/>{{rp|99}}</blockquote>

Mardo's desires are similar to those of Rhett Butler in his ardent pursuit of Scarlett O'Hara in Mitchell's epic novel, ''Gone with the Wind''. Rhett tells Scarlett:

<blockquote>I always intended having you, one way or another.<ref>Mitchell, M., ''Gone with the Wind'', Part 4, chapter 47.</ref></blockquote>

The "other way" is rape. In ''Lost Laysen'' the male seducer is replaced with the male rapist.<ref name=autogenerated27>Young, E., ''Disarming the Nation: women's writing and the American Civil War'', p. 241.</ref>

====''The Big Four''====
In Mitchell's teenage years, she is known to have written a 400-page novel about girls in a boarding school, ''The Big Four''.<ref name="before"/>{{rp|xxii}} The novel is thought to be lost; Mitchell destroyed some of her manuscripts herself and others were destroyed after her death.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

====''Ropa Carmagin''====
In the 1920s Mitchell completed a [[Novella|novelette]], ''Ropa Carmagin'', about a Southern white girl who loves a biracial man.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Mitchell submitted the manuscript to [[Macmillan Publishers]] in 1935 along with her manuscript for ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. The novelette was rejected; Macmillan thought the story was too short for book form.<ref>Brown, Ellen F., and John Wiley.
