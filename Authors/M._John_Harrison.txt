'''Michael John Harrison''' (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as '''M.&nbsp;John Harrison''', is an English author and literary critic.<ref name="gk">Kelley, George. "Harrison, M(ichael) John" in Jay P. Pederson (.ed) ''St. James guide to science fiction writers''. New York: St. James Press., 1996. {{ISBN|9781558621794}} (pp. 422-3).</ref> His work includes the [[Viriconium]] sequence of novels and short stories (1971–1984), ''[[Climbers (novel)|Climbers]]'' (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of ''[[Light (novel)|Light]]'' (2002), ''[[Nova Swing]]'' (2006) and ''Empty Space'' (2012).  He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]], and a "genre contrarian".<ref name=lea/> [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]] has said: "Harrison is best known as one of the restless fathers of modern SF, but to my mind he is among the most brilliant novelists writing today, with regard to whom the question of genre is an irrelevance."<ref name=macfarlane>{{cite web|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Robert|title=Robert Macfarlane: rereading Climbers by M.

== Life and career == 
===Early years===

Harrison was born in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], in 1945 to an engineering family.<ref name=lea>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/20/m-john-harrison-life-in-writing |title=M John Harrison: a life in writing |author=Richard Lea |date=20 July 2012 |access-date=20 July 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> His father died when he was a teenager and he found himself "bored, alienated, resentful and entrapped", playing truant from Dunsmore School (now [[Ashlawn School]]).<ref name=lea/> An English teacher introduced him to [[George Bernard Shaw]] which resulted in an interest in polemic.<ref name=lea/> He ended school during 1963 at age 18; he worked at various times as a groom (for the [[Atherstone Hunt]]), a student teacher (1963–65), and a clerk for the Royal Masonic Charity Institute, London (1966). His hobbies included [[electric guitar]]s and writing pastiches of [[H. H. Munro]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Jacket blurb, M. John Harrison, ''The Committed Men''. London: New Authors Limited, 1971</ref>

His first short story was published during 1966 by [[Kyril Bonfiglioli]] at ''Science Fantasy'' magazine, on the strength of which he relocated to London. He there met [[Michael Moorcock]], who was editing ''New Worlds'' magazine.<ref name=lea/> He began writing reviews and short fiction for ''New Worlds'', and by 1968 he was appointed books editor.<ref name=lea/> Harrison was critical of what he perceived as the complacency of much genre fiction of the time. During 1970, Harrison scripted comic stories illustrated by R.G. Jones for such forums as ''[[Cyclops (magazine)|Cyclops]]'' and ''Finger''.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> An illustration by Jones appears in the first edition of Harrison's ''The Committed Men'' (1971).

In an interview with ''Zone'' magazine, Harrison says "I liked anything bizarre, from being about four years old. I started on [[Dan Dare]] and worked up to the Absurdists. At 15 you could catch me with a pile of books that contained an [[Alfred Bester]], a [[Samuel Beckett]], a [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], the two or three available [[J. G. Ballard]]'s, ''On the Road'' by [[Jack Kerouac]], some [[Keats]], some [[Allen Ginsberg]], maybe a [[Thorne Smith]]. I've always been pick 'n' mix: now it's a philosophy."<ref>[http://www.zone-sf.com/mjharrison.html "Disillusioned by the Actual: An Interview with M. John Harrison"] by Patrick Hudson</ref>

===1968–1975: ''New Worlds'', ''The Committed Men'', ''The Pastel City'', and ''The Centauri Device''===

From 1968 to 1975 he was literary editor of the [[New Wave science fiction]] magazine ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'', regularly contributing criticism. He was important to the New Wave style which also included writers such as [[Norman Spinrad]], [[Barrington Bayley]], Langdon Jones and [[Thomas M. Disch]]. As reviewer for ''New Worlds'' he often used the pseudonym "Joyce Churchill" and was critical of many works and writers published using the rubric of [[science fiction]]. One of his critical pieces, "By Tennyson Out of Disney" was initially written for ''Sword and Sorcery Magazine'', a publication planned by [[Kenneth Bulmer]] but which was never published; the piece was printed in ''New Worlds'' 2.

Amongst his works of that period are three stories utilising the [[Jerry Cornelius]] character invented by [[Michael Moorcock]]. These stories do not appear in any of Harrison's own collections but do appear in the ''Nature of the Catastrophe'' and ''New Nature of the Catastrophe.''  Other early stories published from 1966, featured in anthologies such as ''New Writings in SF'' edited by [[John Carnell]], and in magazines such as ''[[Transatlantic Review (1959)|Transatlantic Review]]'',  ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', ''New Worlds'' and ''Quark''.

A number of Harrison's short stories of this early period remain uncollected, gathered neither in his first collection ''The Machine in Shaft Ten'', nor in his later collections.

The novel ''The Committed Men'' (1971) (dedicated to [[Michael Moorcock]] and his wife [[Hilary Bailey]]) is an archetypal British New-Wave vision of a crumbling future with obvious debts to the work of Michael Moorcock and [[J. G. Ballard]]. It is set in England after the apocalypse. Social organisation has collapsed, and the survivors, riddled with skin cancers, eke out a precarious scavenging existence in the ruins of the Great Society. A few bizarre communities try to maintain their structure in a chromium wilderness linked by crumbling motorways. But their rituals are meaningless clichés mouthed against the devastation. Only the roaming bands of hippie-style "situationalists" (presumably a reference to the then contemporaneous [[situationist]] group) have grasped that the old order, with its logic, its pseudo-liberalism and its immutable laws of cause and effect, has now been superseded. Among the mutants are a group of reptilian humans – alien, cancer-free but persecuted by the 'smoothskins'. When one of them is born of a human mother in Tinhouse, a group of humans sets off to deliver it to its own kind – a search of the committed men for the tribes of mutants. David Pringle called the novel "brief, bleak, derivative – but stylishly written."<ref>David Pringle. ''The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction''. Grafton, 1990, p. 67</ref>

Harrison's first novel of the [[Viriconium]] sequence, ''The Pastel City'' was also published during 1971. Harrison would continue adding to this series until 1984. During 1972, the story "Lamia Mutable" appeared in [[Harlan Ellison]]'s anthology ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]''; while this tale forms part of the Viriconium sequence, it has been omitted from omnibus editions of the Viriconium tales to date.

During 1974 Harrison's third novel was published, the [[space opera]] ''[[The Centauri Device]]'' (described prior to its publication, by ''New Worlds'' magazine, as "a sort of hippie space opera in the baroque tradition of [[Alfred Bester]] and [[Charles Harness]]). An extract was published in ''New Worlds'' in advance of the novel's publication, with the title "The Wolf That Follows". The novel's protagonist, space tramp John Truck, is the last of the Centaurans, victims of a genocide. Rival groups need him to arm the most powerful weapon in the galaxy: the Centauri Device, which will respond only to the genetic code of a true Centauran.

Harrison himself has said of this book:
<blockquote>
I never liked that book much but at least it took the piss out of sf’s three main tenets: (1) The reader-identification character always drives the action; (2) The universe is knowable; (3) the universe is anthropocentrically structured & its riches are an appropriate prize for <s>the colonialist</s> people like us. TCD tried to out space opera as a kind of counterfeit pulp which had carefully cleaned itself of Saturday night appetite, vacuuming out all the concerns of real pulp fiction to keep it under the radar of the Mothers of America or whatever they called themselves. Pulp’s lust for life was replaced, if you were lucky, by a jaunty shanty & a comedy brawl. Otherwise it was lebensraum & a cadetship in the Space Police (these days it’s primarily low-bourgeois freedom motifs & nice friendly sexual release).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=M. John|title=the centauri device|url=https://ambientehotel.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/the-centauri-device/|website=The M John Harrison Blog|date=2 April 2012|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Harrison's first short story collection ''The Machine in Shaft Ten'' (1975) collects many (but not all) of his early short tales, from such sources as ''New Worlds Quarterly'', ''New Worlds Monthly'', ''New Writings in SF'', ''Transatlantic Review'' and others. "The Lamia and Lord Cromis" is an early [[Viriconium]] tale. The moody "London Melancholy" features a ruined future London haunted by winged people. None of the stories, with the exception of "Running Down", (a psychological horror tale about a man who is literally a walking disaster area), have been reprinted in his subsequent short story collections. ''The Bringer with the Window'' features Dr Grishkin, a character also appearing in ''The Centauri Device''}.

His early novels ''The Committed Men'', ''The Pastel City'' and ''The Centauri Device'' have been reprinted several times. The latter was included in the [[SF Masterworks]] series.

===1978–1985: ''Manchester Review'', ''The Ice Monkey'', more Viriconium ===
{{Main article|Viriconium}}

Harrison later relocated to [[Manchester]] and was a regular contributor to ''New Manchester Review'' (1978–79). [[David Britton]] and [[Michael Butterworth (author)|Michael Butterworth]] of Savoy Books employed him to write in their basement (where he did so "amidst stacks of antique ''Eagles'', ''Freindz'', ''New Worlds'' and ''Styng''. A basement that reverberates with indecent exposures of stolen sound, bootlegs sucked from hidden mikes, stacked in neat piles.").<ref>''[[Savoy Dreams]]'', p. 14</ref><ref>Andrew Darlington, "Doin' That Savoy Shuffle", ''International Times''; online at [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/doin.html]</ref> The commissioned work, originally announced in Savoy publications as ''By Gas Mask and Fire Hydrant'', eventually became the novel ''[[In Viriconium]]''.

During the decade of 1976–1986, Harrison lived in the [[Peak District]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 1983, he published his second short story collection, ''The Ice Monkey and Other Stories'', containing seven tales which capture the pathos, humour, awe, despair, pain and black humour of the human condition. ''The Ice Monkey'' was praised by [[Ramsey Campbell]], who stated "M. John Harrison is the finest British writer now writing horror fiction and by far the most original".<ref name="jl">[[Joel Lane|Lane, Joel]]. "Harrison, M(ichael) John", in David Pringle, (ed.) ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost, and Gothic Writers''. Detroit: St. James Press/Gale, 1998, {{ISBN|1558622063}} (pp. 252-4)</ref> In "The Incalling", a story of seedy suburban magic which in some ways foreshadows his later novel ''The Course of the Heart'', an editor is haunted by an author's attempts to cure himself of cancer by faith healing.<ref name="jl" /> The "Incalling"  is one of the few of Harrison's tales (aside from "Running Down") in which a male character is physically ill; though many of his stories feature male characters who are psychologically unwell, in many of his fictions, it is women who are damaged - either physically or emotionally ill or both. "The New Rays" here exemplifies this tendency.

In 1980 Harrison contributed an introduction to Michael Moorcock's early allegorical fantasy (written by Moorcock at age 18) ''The Golden Barge'' (Savoy Books).

Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of [[Viriconium]] consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'.

The first book, ''The Pastel City'' (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is ''[[A Storm of Wings]]'' (1982). It is set eighty years later than ''The Pastel City.'' and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer.

The third novel, ''[[In Viriconium]]'' (1982) (US title: ''[[The Floating Gods]]''), was nominated for the [[Guardian Fiction Prize]] during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague.

The short story "A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium" (1985; later retitled "A Young Man's Journey to London") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a café in England.

===1985–1989: ''Climbers''===
{{Main article|Climbers (novel)}}

Harrison's interest in rock climbing resulted in his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Climbers (novel)|Climbers]]'' (1989), the first novel to receive the [[Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature]].  Harrison also [[ghostwriter|ghost-wrote]] the autobiography of one of Britain's best rock climbers, [[Ron Fawcett]] (''Fawcett on Rock'', 1987, as by Mike Harrison).<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VW1WAAAACAAJ |title = Fawcett on Rock|isbn = 9780044400769|last1 = Fawcett|first1 = Ron|last2 = Beatty|first2 = John|last3 = Harrison|first3 = Mike|year = 1987}}</ref> Harrison has repeatedly affirmed in print the importance of rock climbing for his writing as an attempt to grapple with reality and its implications, which he had largely neglected while writing fantasy. The difference in his approach pre- and post-''Climbers'', can be observed in the extreme stylistic differences between the first novel of the Viriconium sequence ''The Pastel City'' and the second, ''[[A Storm of Wings]]''. Around the time of writing ''Climbers'', he declared that he had abandoned science fiction forever.<ref>M. John Harrison News, ''Interzone'' 13 (Autumn 1985).</ref>

[[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]] wrote an introduction to the 2013 reissue of ''Climbers''. Writing about the book in ''The Guardian'', he said: "...it is surely the best novel about rock-climbing ever written – though such a description drastically limits its achievement".<ref name=macfarlane />

===1990s: ''The Course of the Heart'', ''Signs of Life'', and Gabriel King novels ===

Subsequent novels and short stories, such as ''The Course of the Heart'' (1991) and "Empty" (1993), were set between London and the [[Peak District]]. They have a lyrical style and a strong sense of place, and take their tension from characteristically conflicting veins of mysticism and realism.

''The Course of the Heart'' deals partly with a magical experiment gone wrong, and with an imaginary country which may exist at the heart of Europe, as well as [[Gnostic]] themes such as the [[Pleroma]]. It weaves together mythology, sexuality, and the troubled past and present of Eastern Europe. The origin of the narrative lies in the occasion when three Cambridge students perform a ritualistic act (never shown or fully described) that changes their lives. Years later, none of the participants can remember what exactly occurred; but their vague memories can't rid them of an overwhelming sense of dread. Pam Stuyvesant is an epileptic haunted by strange sensual visions. Her husband Lucas believes that a dwarfish creature is stalking him. Self-styled sorcerer Yaxley becomes obsessed with a terrifyingly transcendent reality. The narrator, the seemingly least affected participant in the ritual (who is haunted by the smell of roses) attempts to help his friends escape the torment that has engulfed their lives. Joel Lane has described ''The Course of the Heart'' as "a brilliant use of supernatural themes to explore humanity mortality and loss."<ref name="jl" /> The novel incorporates versions of several other Harrison stories including "The Great God Pan", "The Quarry" and "The Incalling".

The novel ''[[Signs of Life (novel)|Signs of Life]]'' (1996) is a romantic thriller which explores concerns about genetics and biotechnology amidst the turmoil of what might be termed a three-way love affair between its central characters.

Beginning with ''The Wild Road'' during 1996 and concluding with ''Nonesuch'' (2001), he co-wrote four associated fantasies about cats with [[Jane Johnson (writer)|Jane Johnson]], using the pseudonym "Gabriel King".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://lccn.loc.gov/n97106123 | title=Library of Congress LCCN Permalink n97106123}}</ref>

Harrison has collaborated on several short stories with [[Simon Ings]], and with [[Simon Pummel]] on the [[short film]] ''Ray Gun Fun'' (1998). His work has been classified by some as forming part of the style dubbed the [[New Weird]], along with writers such as [[China Miéville]], though Harrison himself resists being labelled as part of any literary style.

Harrison won the [[Richard Evans Award]] during 1999 (named after the near-legendary figure of UK publishing) given to the author who has contributed significantly to the SF genre without concomitant commercial success.

===2002–2012: The Kefahuchi Tract trilogy===

Harrison continued to publish short fiction in a wide variety of magazines through the late 1990s and early 21st century. Such tales were published in magazines as diverse as [[Conjunctions]] ("Entertaining Angels Unawares", Fall issue 2002), ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' ("Cicisbeo", 2003), the ''Times Literary Supplement'' ("Science and the Arts", 1999) and ''[[Women's Journal]]'' ("Old Women", 1982). They were collected in his major short story collections ''[[Travel Arrangements]]'' (2000) and ''[[Things That Never Happen]]'' (2002).

During 2007 Harrison provided material for performance by Barbara Campbell (''1001 Nights Cast'', 2007, 2008<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Barbara|title=1001 Nights Cast|url=http://1001.net.au/results.html?q=m%20john%20harrison|website=1001 Nights Cast|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>) and [[Kate McIntosh]] (''Loose Promise'', 2007<ref>{{cite web|title=Loose Promise|url=http://spinspin.be/proj.php?id=59&cat=14&title=Loose%20Promise|website=Spin|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>).

During 2002, his science fiction novel ''[[Light (novel)|Light]]'' (first of the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy) marked a return to science fiction for Harrison. ''Light'' was co-winner of the [[James Tiptree, Jr. Award]] in 2003. Its sequel, ''[[Nova Swing]]'' (2006), won the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] in 2007<ref>[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2071690,00.html] guardian.co.uk article</ref> and the [[Philip K. Dick Award]] in 2008.<ref>[http://news.ansible.co.uk/a249.html#03] ''Ansible'' newsletter</ref>

During 2006 Harrison published the second novel of the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, ''Nova Swing'', a knowing crossover between science fiction and [[Hardboiled|noir]] fiction. As with ''Light'', this novel brought him further acclaim and several awards.
 
The third novel, [[Empty Space (novel)|''Empty Space'']], was published in August 2012. 

===2012–present: ''You Should Come with Me Now'' and ''The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again''===

Harrison published two short stories on Kindle: ''Cave and Julia'' (2013) and ''The 4th Domain'' (2014).

In 2014, Rhys Williams and Mark Bould organised a conference on Harrison's work at the University of Warwick, UK, called "Irradiating the Object: M. John Harrison". The keynote speakers were Fred Botting (Kingston University) and Sara Wasson (Edinburgh-Napier University).<ref>{{cite web|title=Conferences|url=http://www.gylphi.co.uk/conferences/JohnHarrison|website=The University of Warwick|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> The conferences papers, including the keynote address by [[Tim Etchells]], is due to be published as ''Irradiating the Object: M.

==Reviewing, judging and teaching==

For Harrison's work in ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' magazine, see above. The bulk of his reviews were collected in the volume ''Parietal Games'' (2005; see below).

Since 1991, Harrison has reviewed fiction and nonfiction for ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''The [[Daily Telegraph]]'', the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' and ''The [[New York Times]]''.

During 2003 Harrison was on the jury of the Michael Powell Award at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]].

He has taught creative writing courses in Devon and Wales, focusing on landscape and autobiography, with [[Adam Lively]] and the travel writer [[Jim Perrin]].

During 2009, Harrison shared (with [[Sarah Hall (writer)|Sarah Hall]] and [[Nicholas Royle]]) the judging of the [[Manchester Fiction Prize]].

Many of Harrison's novels include expansions or reworkings of previously published short stories. For instance, "The Ice Monkey" (title story of the collection) provides the basis for the novel ''Climbers'' (1989); the novel ''The Course of the Heart'' (1992) is based on his short story "The Great God Pan". The story  "Isobel Avens Returns to Stepney in the Spring" is expanded as the novel ''Signs of Life'' (1996); the short story "Anima", first published in ''Interzone'' magazine, also forms one of the central thematic threads of ''Signs of Life''.

In interviews, Harrison has described himself as an anarchist,<ref>[http://www.anarchistfiction.net/m-john-harrison/ Spectrum SF interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127204926/http://www.anarchistfiction.net/m-john-harrison/ |date=27 January 2010 }}</ref> and Michael Moorcock wrote in an essay entitled "Starship Stormtroopers" that, "His books are full of anarchists &ndash; some of them very bizarre like the anarchist aesthetes of ''The Centauri Device''."<ref>{{cite web|last=Moorcock| first=Michael| url=http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/moorcock.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021224193414/http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/moorcock.html | archive-date=2002-12-24| title=Starship Stormtroopers| year=1977| access-date=2006-03-04}}</ref>

==Critical response==

[[China Miéville]] has written: "That M. John Harrison is not a Nobel laureate proves the bankruptcy of the literary establishment. Austere, unflinching and desperately moving, he is one of the very great writers alive today. And yes, he writes fantasy and sf, though of a form, scale and brilliance that it shames not only the rest of the field, but most modern fiction."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPI7XAxHP0QC&pg=PR1|title=Viriconium|last=Harrison|first=M.

[[David Wingrove]] has written of Harrison: "Making use of forms from [[sword-and-sorcery]], [[space opera]] and [[horror fiction]], Harrison pursues an idiosyncratic vision: often grim, but with a strong vein of sardonic humour and sensual detail. Typically, his characters make ill-assorted alliances to engage in manic and often ritualistic quests for obscure objectives. Out of the struggle, unacknowledged motives emerge, often to bring about a frightful conclusion, which, it is suggested, was secretly desired all along. Harrison's vivid, highly finished prose convinces the reader of everything."<ref>David Wingrove, ''[[The Science Fiction Sourcebook]]''. Prentice Hall Press, 1984, p. 162</ref>
