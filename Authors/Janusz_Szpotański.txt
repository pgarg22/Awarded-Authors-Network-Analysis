[[File:Janusz Szpotański.jpg|185px|thumb|Janusz Szpotański]]'''Janusz Szpotański''', (pen names Władysław Gnomacki, Aleksander Oniegow) (12 January 1929 in [[Warsaw]] &ndash; 13 October 2001 in Warsaw) was a [[Polish poet]], [[satirist]], critic, translator, [[literary theorist]] and [[chess|chess player]] (a three times chess champion of [[Warsaw]], he also held a nationwide title of [[Chess master|Master]]).

He was the creator of satirical [[Tragicomedy|tragi-comedic]] poems which ridiculed the communist government of Poland. These works were often written in an [[absurdism|absurdist]], grotesque style, and specifically lampooned prominent [[Władysław Gomułka|members of the Polish communist party]], as well as the general "low life" mentality of the average [[Polish United Workers' Party|Communist Party]] member.

He is best known for creating the character of "Towarzysz Szmaciak" (literally: ''Comrade Dishrag'', but [[idiom]]atically ''Comrade Cretin'' or ''Comrade [[Dysphemism|Scumbag]]'') - an uneducated, dull, cynical, sadistic, anti-semitic and stupid individual who supported the communist party out of opportunistic, not ideological motives. The metaphor of a "dishrag" alludes to the fact that individuals of this kind, while forming the support base of communism in Poland at the time, where considered useful by the party elite (much like a dishrag is necessary to clean up dirt) but at the same time despised by them (since the dishrag itself is dirty). For ridiculing [[Władysław Gomułka]] in his poem "Cisi i gęgacze" (''The Silent and the Blabbers'') he was arrested in 1967 and in 1968 sentenced to three years in prison on the charge of "spreading information harmful to the interests of state". During the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March events of 1968]], Gomułka referred to him in several of his official speeches, calling him "a man with a mentality of a pimp" and referring to his work as "reactionary doggerel" which "breathed with poisonous sadistic venom against our (communist) authority".<ref name="ipn">{{cite web | url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/ftp/wystawy/marzec68_w_krakowie/content/index_eng.html | title=March '68 in Krakow | publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) | accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref>

Szpotański was a member of the [[Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich]] (Union of Polish Writers).

On 23 September 2006 he was posthumously awarded the [[Polonia Restituta]] Commander's Cross by President of Poland, [[Lech Kaczyński]].
