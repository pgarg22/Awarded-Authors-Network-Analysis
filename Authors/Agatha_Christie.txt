'''Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}} ([[née]] '''Miller'''; 15&nbsp;September 1890&nbsp;– 12&nbsp;January 1976) was an English writer known for her 66 [[detective novels]] and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around fictional detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] and [[Miss Marple]]. She also wrote the world's longest-running play, ''[[The Mousetrap]]'', which was performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] from 1952 to 2020, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) for her contributions to literature. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.

Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'', featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was [[Archie Christie|Archibald Christie]]; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons which featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to [[archaeologist]] [[Max Mallowan]] in 1930, she spent several months each year on [[Excavation (archaeology)|digs]] in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of his profession in her fiction.

According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]]. Her novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is one of the [[List of best-selling books|top-selling books]] of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End of London on 25&nbsp;November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was closed down in March 2020 because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]] for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the "World's Favourite Christie" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Result of world's favourite Christie global vote|url=https://www.agathachristie.com/en/news/2015/worlds-favourite-christie|website=Agatha Christie|date=22 December 2015}}</ref> Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.

According to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by age four.<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{Rp|13}} Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive a home education. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing, and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|8, 20–21}}

Christie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were reading children's books by [[Mary Louisa Molesworth|Mrs Molesworth]] and [[Edith Nesbit]]. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of [[Edward Lear]] and [[Lewis Carroll]].<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|18–19}} As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by [[Anthony Hope]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Alexandre Dumas]].<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{rp|111, 136–37}} In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, "The Cow Slip".<ref name="film">{{cite AV media |title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie – A Trip With David Suchet (Directed by Claire Lewins) |publisher=[[Testimony Films]] (for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]])}}</ref>

By 1901, her father's health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|33}} Fred died in November 1901 from [[pneumonia]] and chronic [[kidney disease]].<ref>Death Certificate.

The family's financial situation had by this time worsened. Madge married the year after their father's death and moved to [[Cheadle Hulme|Cheadle]], Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.<ref name="thompson"/>{{rp|43, 49}} Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother.

=== Early literary attempts, marriage, literary success: 1907–1926 ===

After completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{rp|155–57}} They stayed for three months at the [[Gezirah Palace]] Hotel in [[Cairo]]. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], she did not exhibit the great interest in [[archaeology]] and [[Egyptology]] that developed in her later years.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|40–41}} Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatricals. She also helped put on a play called ''The Blue Beard of Unhappiness'' with female friends.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|45–47}}

At 18, Christie wrote her first short story, "The House of Beauty", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words on "madness and dreams", a subject of fascination for her. Her biographer, [[Janet Morgan, Lady Balfour of Burleigh|Janet Morgan]], has commented that, despite "infelicities of style", the story was "compelling".<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|48–49}} (The story became an early version of her story [[While the Light Lasts and Other Stories|"The House of Dreams"]].)<ref>{{cite web |title=The House of Dreams |url=http://www.agathachristie.com/christies-work/stories/the-house-of-dreams/377 |access-date=27 June 2020 |website=agathachristie.com |archive-date=25 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200925/http://www.agathachristie.com/christies-work/stories/the-house-of-dreams/377 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in [[spiritualism]] and the [[paranormal]]. These included "[[The Hound of Death#The Call of Wings|The Call of Wings]]" and "The Little Lonely God".

[[File:Agatha Christie as a young woman.jpg|thumb|upright|Christie as a young woman, 1910s]]
Around the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, ''Snow Upon the Desert''. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|50–51}}<ref name="curran">{{cite web |url=http://www.agathachristie.com/about-christie/christie-experts/john-curran-75-facts-about-christie |title=75 facts about Christie |last1=Curran |first1=John |website=The Home of Agatha Christie |publisher=Agatha Christie Limited |access-date=21 July 2017 |archive-date=29 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729055754/http://www.agathachristie.com/about-christie/christie-experts/john-curran-75-facts-about-christie |url-status=live }}</ref> Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist [[Eden Philpotts|Eden Phillpotts]], a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected ''Snow Upon the Desert'' but suggested a second novel.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|51–52}}

Christie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' and ''[[The Moonstone]]'', and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s early [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

In 1946, Christie said of herself: "My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, [[gramophone]]s and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I ''do'' like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery."<ref>{{cite news |date=30 April 1946 |title=The Real Agatha Christie |page=6 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/17978243 |access-date=9 November 2019 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308032612/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/17978243 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Christie's works of fiction contain some character [[stereotypes]] seen as objectionable in modern times, but in real life, many of her biases were positive. After four years of war-torn London, Christie hoped to return some day to Syria, which she described as a "gentle fertile country and its simple people, who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life; who are idle and gay, and who have dignity, good manners, and a great sense of humour, and to whom death is not terrible".<ref name="mallowan2">{{cite book |last=Christie Mallowan |first=Agatha |title=[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]] |date=1990 |publisher=[[HarperCollins|Fontana Books]] |isbn=0-00-637594-4 |location=London|orig-year=1946}}</ref>{{rp|167}}

Christie was a lifelong, "quietly devout"<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|183}} member of the [[Church of England]], attended church regularly, and kept her mother's copy of ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' by her bedside.<ref name="thompson"/>{{rp|30, 290}} After her divorce, she stopped taking the [[sacrament]] of [[Eucharist|communion]].<ref name="thompson"/>{{rp|263}}

Christie's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' notes that "she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television." Further,
<blockquote>Dame Agatha's private pleasures were gardening{{snd}}she won local prizes for horticulture{{snd}}and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances: but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding she belonged to the English upper middle-class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.<ref name=":5"/></blockquote>

Christie's first published book, ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'', was released in 1920 and introduced the detective [[Hercule Poirot]], who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.

Over the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Conan Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{Rp|230}} By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot "insufferable", and by the 1960s she felt he was "an egocentric creep".<ref name=":19">{{cite book |last=Gross |first=John |url=https://archive.org/details/newoxfordbooklit00gros_551 |title=The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0199543410 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newoxfordbooklit00gros_551/page/n281 267] |url-access=limited}}</ref> Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that "in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood."<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|282}} Unlike Conan Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{Rp|222}} She married off Poirot's "[[Dr. Watson|Watson]]", Captain [[Arthur Hastings]], in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{Rp|268}}

[[Miss Marple|Miss Jane Marple]] was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]''.<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|278}} Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|47, 74–76}} Christie said, "Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was," but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's step-grandmother Margaret Miller ("Auntie-Grannie"){{Refn|Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller née West was complex.

During the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'', featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]], and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.<ref name="thompson"/>{{rp|344}}<ref name=":16"/>{{rp|190}} Christie suffered a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|372}} Her daughter authorised the publication of ''Curtain'' in 1975,<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{rp|375}} and ''Sleeping Murder'' was published posthumously in 1976.<ref name=":16"/>{{rp|376}} These publications followed the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|1974 film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express''.<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/ |title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express |last=Vaughan |first=Susan |date=25 January 2018 |website=Maine Crime Writers |access-date=20 March 2019 |archive-date=13 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613072515/https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shortly before the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in ''The New York Times'', which was printed on page one on 6{{nbsp}}August 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php |title=Poirot's Obituary |last=Hobbs |first=JD |date=6 August 1975 |publisher=Poirot |access-date=11 April 2020 |place=US |archive-date=1 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200501223503/http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|375}} In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: "Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady.

In 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders |title=The Monogram Murders |publisher=Agatha Christie.com |access-date=11 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/ |archive-date=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'' in 2016, ''[[The Mystery of Three Quarters]]'' in 2018.,<ref name=":7">{{cite web |url=https://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah |title=An interview with Sophie Hannah |website=The Home of Agatha Christie |language=en-US |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-date=31 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831125357/https://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2020 |title=The Mystery of Three Quarters |url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062792341/the-mystery-of-three-quarters/ |access-date=29 April 2020 |website=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers |archive-date=13 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813045824/http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062792341/the-mystery-of-three-quarters/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and ''The Killings at Kingfisher Hill'' in 2020.

==== Formula and plot devices ====

Christie has been called the "Duchess of Death", the "Mistress of Mystery", and the "Queen of Crime".<ref name=":17"/>{{Rp|15}} Early in her career, a reporter noted that "her plots are possible, logical, and always new."<ref name=":6"/> According to Hannah, "At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened."<ref name=":7"/>

She developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction|"Golden Age"]] of detective fiction.<ref name=":20"/> Author Dilys Winn called Christie "the doyenne of Coziness", a sub-genre which "featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay".<ref>{{cite book |last=Winn |first=Dilys |title=Murder Ink: The Mystery Reader's Companion |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman Publishing]] |year=1977 |location=New York |page=3}}</ref> At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''And Then There Were None'' and [[Endless Night (novel)|''Endless Night'']]).<ref name="me">{{cite journal |last=Mezel |first=Kathy |s2cid=162411534 |date=2007 |title=Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll |journal=[[Journal of Modern Literature|The Journal of Modern Literature]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=103–20 |doi=10.2979/JML.2007.30.2.103 |jstor=4619330}}</ref><ref name="be">{{cite journal |last=Beehler |first=Sharon A. |date=1998 |title=Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues |journal=[[English Journal|The English Journal]] |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=39–43 |doi=10.2307/818612 |jstor=818612}}</ref>

Christie did not limit herself to quaint English villages{{snd}}the action might take place on a small island (''And Then There Were None''), an aeroplane (''[[Death in the Clouds]]''), a train (''Murder on the Orient Express''), a steamship (''[[Death on the Nile]]''), a smart London flat (''[[Cards on the Table]]''), a resort in the West Indies (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]''), or an archaeological dig (''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''){{snd}}but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.<ref name=":8"/>{{Rp|37}} Stereotyped characters abound (the {{Lang|fr|femme fatale}}, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.<ref name=":8">{{cite book |last=Curran |first=John |title=Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-06-200652-3 |location=London}}</ref>{{Rp|58}} There is always a motive{{snd}}most often, money: "There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake."<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|379, 396}}

According to crime writer [[P. D. James]], Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party.

On ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to "frame" that person.<ref name="Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method">{{cite web |last=Aldiss |first=Brian|author-link=Brian Aldiss |title=BBC Radio 4 – Factual – Desert Island Discs |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archive-date=11 February 2009 |access-date=22 February 2009 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.<ref name=":8"/> Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{Rp|241–45}}<ref name=":10"/>{{Rp|33}}

"''And Then There Were None'' carries the 'closed society' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths," according to author Charles Osborne.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|170}} It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, "Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious."<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{Rp|457}} Critics agreed she had succeeded: "The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity{{nbsp}}... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory."<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|170–71}}

==== Character stereotypes and perceived racism ====

{{About||information on Christie's book originally titled ''Ten Little Niggers''|And Then There Were None}}

Christie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name="Morgan1984"/>{{Rp|264–66}} For example, she described "men of [[Hebrews|Hebraic]] extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery" in the short story "The Soul of the Croupier" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]''. In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, [[Dodd, Mead and Company]], regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to "omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books."<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|386}}

In ''[[The Hollow]]'', published in 1946, one of the characters is "a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some "foreign" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story "How Does Your Garden Grow?"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation |last=Pendergast |first=Bruce |title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie |page=399 |year=2004 |location=Victoria, BC, Canada |publisher=[[Trafford Publishing|Trafford]] |isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>

==== Other detectives ====

In addition to Poirot and Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas Beresford and his wife, Prudence "Tuppence" ''née'' Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in ''The Secret Adversary'', and were allowed to age alongside their creator.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|19–20}} She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a "dash and verve" which was not universally admired by critics.<ref name=":17"/>{{Rp|63}} Their last adventure, ''Postern of Fate'', was Christie's last novel.<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|477}}

Harley Quin was "easily the most unorthodox" of Christie's fictional detectives.<ref name=":17"/>{{Rp|70}} Inspired by Christie's affection for the figures from the [[Harlequinade]], the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as ''The Mysterious Mr. Quin''.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|78, 80}} Mallowan described these tales as "detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha's peculiar imagination".<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|80}} Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, ''Three Act Tragedy'', and a short story, "[[Murder in the Mews|Dead Man's Mirror]]", both of which feature Poirot.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|81}}

Another of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|118–19}} The 12 short stories which introduced him, ''[[Parker Pyne Investigates]]'' (1934), are best remembered for "The Case of the Discontented Soldier", which features Ariadne Oliver, "an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|120}}

==== As Mary Westmacott ====

Christie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore "her most private and precious imaginative garden".<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|366–67}}<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|87–88}} These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|366}} Of the first, ''[[Giant's Bread]]'' published in 1930, a reviewer for ''The New York Times'' wrote, "...{{nbsp}}her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation."<ref>{{cite news |date=17 August 1930 |title=Book Review |page=7 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> After her authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.<ref name="thompson"/>{{Rp|366}}

The other Westmacott titles are: ''[[Unfinished Portrait (novel)|Unfinished Portrait]]'' (1934), ''Absent in the Spring'' (1944), ''The Rose and the Yew Tree'' (1948), ''[[A Daughter's a Daughter]]'' (1952), and ''The Burden'' (1956).

=== Non-fiction works ===

Christie published few non-fiction works. ''Come, Tell Me How You Live'', about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. ''The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery'' is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. ''[[Agatha Christie: An Autobiography]]'' was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical / Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.<ref name=":14">{{cite web |url=http://theedgars.com/awards/ |title=Edgars Database – Search the Edgars Database |website=The Edgars |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-date=28 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328055509/http://theedgars.com/awards/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Titles ===

Many of Christie's works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hopkins |first=Lisa |title=Shakespearean Allusion in Crime Fiction |publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] |year=2016 |isbn=978-1137538741|editor-last=Hopkins|editor-first=L. |location=Cham, Switzerland |pages=63–103 |chapter=Who Owns the Wood? Appropriating A Midsummer Night's Dream}}</ref>

The inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:
* [[William Shakespeare]]'s works: ''[[Sad Cypress]]'', ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'', ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide{{nbsp}}...]]'', ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'', and ''The Mousetrap'', for example. Osborne notes that "Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie";<ref name=":16"/>{{Rp|164}}
* The Bible: ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'', ''[[The Burden]]'', and ''The Pale Horse'';
* Other works of literature: ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (from [[Tennyson]]'s "[[The Lady of Shalott]]"), ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (from [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám]]''), ''[[The Rose and the Yew Tree]]'' (from [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Four Quartets]]''), ''Postern of Fate'' (from [[James Elroy Flecker]]'s "Gates of Damascus"), ''Endless Night'' (from [[William Blake]]'s "[[Auguries of Innocence]]"), ''N or M?'' (from the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').

Christie biographer Gillian Gill said, "Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed."<ref name=":10"/>{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from "[[And Then There Were None#19th-century original verses|Ten Little Niggers]]"),<ref>{{Cite book |last=McAllister |first=Pam |title=The Bedside, Bathtub & Armchair Companion to Agatha Christie |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-8264-1375-7 |editor-last=Riley |editor-first=Dick |edition=2nd |location=New York City; London |pages=144–45 |chapter=Ten Little Who? |editor-last2=McAllister |editor-first2=Pam |editor-last3=Cassiday |editor-first3=Bruce |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zd3yIaoBjrMC&pg=PA144 |access-date=21 August 2020 |archive-date=2 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902084912/https://books.google.com/books?id=zd3yIaoBjrMC&pg=PA144 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from "[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from "[[This Little Piggy]]"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from "[[There Was a Crooked Man]]"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from "[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from "[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from "[[Three Blind Mice]]").<ref name=":10"/>{{Rp|207–08}}

In 2015, in honor of the 125th anniversary of her birthday, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works.

In 2016, one hundred years after Christie wrote her first detective story, the [[Royal Mail]] released six stamps in her honour, featuring ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', ''Murder on the Orient Express'', ''And Then There Were None'', ''The Body in the Library'', and ''A Murder is Announced''. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that, "Each design incorporates [[Microprinting|microtext]], [[Invisible ink|UV ink]] and [[thermochromic ink]].

=== Adaptations ===

{{Main|Adaptations of Agatha Christie}}

Christie's works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film ''[[The Passing of Mr. Quin]]''. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in ''[[Alibi (1931 film)|Alibi]]'', which starred [[Austin Trevor]] as Christie's sleuth.<ref name=":13">{{cite book |last=Palmer |first=Scott |title=The Films of Agatha Christie |publisher=[[Pavilion Books|B.T.

== Interests and influences ==
=== Pharmacology ===

During the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.<ref name=":11"/>{{Rp|xi}} While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name="Auto1993"/>{{Rp|235, 470}}

As Michael C. Gerald puts it, her "activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons{{nbsp}}... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories."<ref name=":11"/>{{Rp|viii}} There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie's cast of characters; featuring in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among many others.<ref name=":11"/>

Gillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', "comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary".<ref name=":10"/>{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, "I don't like messy deaths{{nbsp}}... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why."<ref>{{cite news |date=8 March 1970 |title=Agatha Christie: 'Queen of Crime' Is a Gentlewoman |page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s "Ten Rules for Detective Fiction".<ref name=":12"/>{{Rp|58}} [[Arsenic trioxide|Arsenic]], [[aconitine|aconite]], [[strychnine]], [[digoxin toxicity|digitalis]], thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.<ref name=":11"/>

== In popular culture ==

[[BBC television]] released ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' in 2004, in which she is portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]] (at different stages in her life). [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s ''Perspectives'': "The Mystery of Agatha Christie" (2013) is hosted by David Suchet.

Some of Christie's fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979), with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution.<ref>{{cite web |author=Axmaker, Sean |title=Agatha |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html |access-date=17 June 2017 |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |archive-date=14 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114183823/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]" (17&nbsp;May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], portrays Christie in her early writing career and explains her disappearance as the result of having suffered a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]. The film ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018) sends her under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Musical Agatha |url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en |archive-date=16 April 2015 |access-date=10 April 2015 |website=Visit Seoul |publisher=[[Seoul Metropolitan Government]]}}</ref>

Other portrayals, such as the Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in [[Gaylord Larsen]]'s ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Larsen |first=Gaylord |url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars |title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel |publisher=[[E.

A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the [[alternative history]] television film ''[[Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar]]'' (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hogan |first=Michael |date=15 December 2019 |title=Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar review – A cut-price Christie for Christmas is still quite a treat |language=en-GB |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/12/15/agatha-curse-ishtar-review-a-cut-price-christie-christmas-still/ |access-date=29 April 2020 |issn=0307-1235 |archive-date=6 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106004751/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/12/15/agatha-curse-ishtar-review-a-cut-price-christie-christmas-still/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2019, [[Honeysuckle Weeks]] portrayed Christie in an episode, "No Friends Like Old Friends", in a Canadian drama, ''[[Frankie Drake Mysteries]].''

In June 2021, an episode of the internet series ''[[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]'' detailed the disappearance of Christie and possible theories.
