'''Thomas Moore Raworth''' (19 July 1938 – 8 February 2017) was an English-Irish poet, publisher, editor, and teacher who published over 40 books of poetry and prose during his life. His work has been translated and published in many countries. Raworth was a key figure in the [[British Poetry Revival]].

==Life and work==
===Early life===
Raworth was born on 19 July 1938<ref name="tomraworth.com">{{Cite web |url=http://tomraworth.com/cvweb.html |title=CV |last=Raworth |first=Tom |website=tomraworth.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110063408/http://tomraworth.com/cvweb.html |archivedate=2016-11-10 }}</ref> in [[Bexleyheath]], Kent, and grew up in [[Welling]], the neighbouring town.<ref name="EBW">{{cite book|last1=Krueger|first1=Christine L.|title=Encyclopaedia of British Writers, 19th and 20th centuries|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=312|isbn=9781438108704|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dnqi3gRxgvQC&pg=RA1-PA312&lpg=RA1-PA312&dq=tom+raworth+bexleyheath#v=onepage|accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref> His family maintained its strong [[Irish people|Irish]] connections while he was growing up, something which would leave an impression on Raworth's sense of himself as a poet. His mother's family lived in the same house in Dublin as [[Seán O'Casey]] at the time that the playwright was working on ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]''. When he was 52 years old, Raworth acquired an Irish passport.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/'The%20history%20of%20Ireland%20he%20knew%20before%20he%20went%20to%20school':%20The%20Irish...-a0453721619 |title='The history of Ireland he knew before he went to school': The Irish Tom Raworth.  |last=Cummins |first=James |website=The Free Library |series=Irish University Review: a journal of Irish Studies  |publisher=University of Edinburgh  |orig-year= |date=March 22, 2016}}</ref>

He was educated at St. Stephen's Primary School, Welling, Kent (1943–1949); [[St Joseph's Academy, Blackheath]], London S.E.3. (1949–1954); and at the [[University of Essex]] (1967–1970), where he earned a Master's degree in 1970.<ref name="poetryfoundation.org">{{Cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/tom-raworth |title=Tom Raworth: Biography, Publications, & On-line poems |publisher=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> He left school at the age of sixteen and worked at a variety of jobs. According to Raworth: {{cquote|Between leaving school in 1954 and going to the University of Essex in 1967 I had a variety of jobs, including insurance clerk, builders' labourer, packer, assistant transport manager, and continental telephonist. In 1959 I taught myself how to set type and to print, and between then and 1964 I produced three issues of a magazine (outburst) and a series of small books.<ref name="tomraworth.com"/>}}

Beginning in the early 1960s, with the magazine called ''Outburst'',<ref name="uconn.edu">{{Cite web |url=http://manage.archives.lib.uconn.edu/islandora/object/20002:860134562 |title=A Guide to the Tom Raworth Papers: An Inventory |publisher=University of Connecticut Libraries}}</ref> Raworth started his professional publishing career, when he published a number of [[British poetry|British]] and [[American poetry|American]] poets including [[Ed Dorn]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and [[LeRoi Jones]]. He also founded Matrix Press at this time,<ref name="poetryfoundation.org"/> publishing small books by Dorn, David Ball, [[Piero Heliczer]], and others.<ref name="uconn.edu"/> In 1965, while working as an operator at the international telephone exchange, Raworth and Barry Hall set up Goliard Press,<ref name="poetryfoundation.org"/> which published, amongst others, [[Charles Olson]]'s first British collection.<ref name="tomraworth.com"/> These ventures into publishing made an important contribution to a new found British interest in the [[New American Poetry]] movement of the 1960s.<ref name="3ammagazine.com"/><ref name="mhpbooks.com">{{Cite web |url=https://www.mhpbooks.com/british-poet-tom-raworth-is-dying/ |title=British poet Tom Raworth is dying |last=Dreiblatt |first=Ian |date=January 30, 2014 |publisher=Melville House}}</ref>

He was considered "a particularly transatlantic writer, living in the US for several years in the seventies".<ref name="mhpbooks.com"/><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2017/02/tom-raworth-1938-2017/|title=Tom Raworth, 1938–2017|first=|last=|publisher=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> Furthermore, Raworth's connection to American poetry through his work as an editor and publisher, established his American reputation in the U.S., often considered unequalled by any other British poet of that time period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://charlesolson.uconn.edu/Correspondence/correspondents.htm#Raworth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215232051/http://charlesolson.uconn.edu/Correspondence/correspondents.htm#Raworth |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-02-15 |title=Correspondents of Note: Tom Raworth |website=The Charles Olson Research Collection |publisher=University of Connecticut Libraries }}</ref>

===Poetry and publications===
Raworth's first book, ''The Relation Ship'' (1966), won the [[Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize]].<ref name="buffalo.edu">{{Cite web |url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/epc/authors/raworth/raworth.pub.html |title=Raworth—Bio |website=Electronic Poetry Center |publisher=SUNY-Buffalo}}</ref> Raworth attended the University of Essex from 1967–70, under the aegis of [[Donald Davie]] who ran the literature department there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidcaddy.blogspot.com/2008/03/letter-11.html|title=Letter 11|first=David|last=Caddy|date=14 March 2008|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jacketmagazine.com/38/waugh-dorn.shtml |title="You Are Sometimes in the Trance of What Is Beyond You": Upheaval, Incantation and Ed Dorn in the Summer of 1968 |last=Waugh |first=Kyle |year=2009 |website=Jacket Magazine |series=Jacket 38-Late 2009}}</ref> According to Raworth, he studied Spanish at the University of Essex, as he worked toward a B.A. in Latin American Literature.<ref name="tomraworth.com"/> But after the first year, he transferred to the Masters program and in 1970 was awarded an M.A. in the Theory and Practice of Literary Translation.<ref name="tomraworth.com"/>

In the 1970s, he worked in the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]],<ref name="buffalo.edu"/> first teaching in universities in Ohio, Chicago and Texas, and later living in San Francisco where he was involved with the Zephyrus Image press. After six years abroad he returned with his family to [[England]] in 1977 to take up the post of resident poet in [[King's College, Cambridge]] for a year.<ref name="buffalo.edu"/>

Raworth's early poetry showed the influences of the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets, particularly [[Robert Creeley]] and [[John Ashbery]], together with strands from [[Europe]]an poetry ([[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire]]), [[Dada]], and [[Surrealism]].<ref name="britishcouncil.org"/> His 1974 book ''Ace'' showed that Raworth had moved to a more disjunctive style in his work. This style was reflected in short, unpunctuated lines that lead the reader into following multiple syntactic possibilities, and where it is "increasingly impossible to keep track of the profusion of meanings on offer."<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Raworth's "poetic line" can knit together anything from observations of the everyday to self-reflexive commentary on the acts of thinking and writing, to lifts from pulp fiction and film noir, to political satire:{{cquote|Those looking for a sustained, linear narrative or argument are to be disappointed, but the themes interlock and repeat with an uncanny frequency that nonetheless gives the poem a grim feeling of progress – in the sense that tracing a finger along the side of a [[Möbius strip]] is progress.<ref name="britishcouncil.org">{{cite web|url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/tom-raworth|title=Tom Raworth – Literature|publisher=}}</ref>}}

What followed was a series of long poems in this particular mode —after ''Ace'' came ''Writing'' (composed 1975–77; published 1982), ''Catacoustics'' (composed 1978–81; published 1991) and ''West Wind'' (composed 1982–83; published 1984). Subsequent projects have extended this mode into a kaleidoscopic sequence of 14-line poems<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview13|title=Seeing through walls|date=21 March 2003|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref> (not exactly "sonnets")<ref name="britishcouncil.org"/> that extended through "Sentenced to Death" (in ''Visible Shivers'', 1987), ''Eternal Sections'' (1993) and ''Survival'' (1994).  Later collections include ''Clean & Well Lit'' (1996), ''Meadow'' (1999), ''Caller and Other Pieces'' (2007), and ''Let Baby Fall'' (2008).<ref name="buffalo.edu"/>

Raworth's 550-page ''Collected Poems'' was published in 2003.<ref name="theguardian.com"/><ref name="washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/features/the-lyrical-genius-of-tom-raworth |title=The Lyrical Gifts of Tom Raworth |last=Kaufmann |first=David  |date=July 18, 2015 |publisher=Washington Independent Review of Books}}</ref> Although a number of major poems still remained uncollected at the time, much of these uncollected works were, subsequently, published during the years since the ''Collected Poems'' appeared: beginning with ''Windmills in Flames'' (2010). Whatever didn’t make it into the latter publication, found its way into ''Structures from Motion'' and ''As When'', both published in 2015.<ref name="washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com"/><ref name="jacket2.org">{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/tom-raworth-carcanet|title=Tom Raworth's As When: A Selection, forthcoming from Carcanet – Jacket2|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> A book of Raworth's prose, ''Earn your Milk'', was published in 2009. The latter included all of his uncollected prose, and included his "uncategorizable prose-work", long out-of-print: ''A Serial Biography'' (1969), which has been described as an "assembly of memoir and reportage."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.saltpublishing.com/products/earn-your-milk-9781844715084 |title=Publisher's page: "Earn Your Milk" |publisher=Salt Publishing}}</ref>

Several boxes of Raworth's notebooks, typescripts, and correspondence (ca. 1968–1977) are held at the University of Connecticut's Dodd Research Center.<ref name="uconn.edu"/>

==Reception and influence==
Over the years, since his work began appearing in the 1960s, Raworth had more than 40 books of his own work published,<ref name="poetryfoundation.org"/> including pamphlets of poetry, prose and translations.<ref name="buffalo.edu"/> Raworth gave regular readings of his work throughout the course of his life, in Europe and the U.S. In time, he even gave readings in China and Mexico.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> He made a number of recordings and videos during the course of his career. Raworth's readings had their own "signature style," which was specifically noted for the speed of his delivery,<ref name="theguardian.com"/> something David Kaufmann has described as "breakneck speed."  Kaufmann writes that when Raworth "gives live readings, he runs roughshod over the line breaks, thus making it impossible for the reader to rest with what she has just heard."<ref name="washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com"/>

Raworth was also interested in collaborative work. This was reflected in the many performance events and texts he created in collaboration with musicians such as [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Joëlle Léandre]], Giancarlo Locatelli, [[Peter Brötzmann]] and Steve Nelson-Raney;  other poets, including Jim Koller, [[Anselm Hollo]], [[Gregory Corso]], Dario Villa and {{ill|Franco Beltrametti|it}};<ref name="britishcouncil.org"/> and painters including [[Joe Brainard]], [[Jim Dine]], Giovanni D'Agostino and Micaëla Henich.<ref name="buffalo.edu"/><!--He has also worked with his wife, Val Raworth.{{cn|date=February 2017}}-->

In 1991, he was the first European writer in 30 years to be invited to teach at the [[University of Cape Town]].<ref name="buffalo.edu"/>

In 2007, Raworth was awarded the {{ill|Antonio Delfini|it}} prize for lifetime achievement, in Modena, Italy.<ref name="jacket2.org"/> Some of his other awards included the [[Cholmondeley Award]], and the Philip Whalen Memorial Award.<ref name="auto"/>

His visual art consists mainly of drawings, [[collage]] and [[found object]] art and was exhibited in Italy, France, South Africa, and the United States.<ref name="tomraworth.com"/>

As fellow poet [[Catherine Wagner]] has pointed out, Raworth was an "inventor of dozens of ingenious and provocative forms," and so was an important influence on a succession of poets that have followed him.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/politics-meter-traditional-forms |title=The Politics of Meter: on Traditional Forms |last=Wagner |first=Catherine |date=21 February 2014 |website=poets.org |publisher=[[Academy of American Poets]]}}</ref> At the time of his death, he was considered by many to be, arguably, the finest British poet of his generation.<ref name="3ammagazine.com"/>

==Death==
Raworth was plagued by ill health for most of his life. In the 1950s, he was one of the first patients ever to survive [[open heart surgery]].<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/culture-stars-died-2017/tom-raworth/|title=Culture stars who died in 2017: from Tara Palmer-Tomkinson to Tom Raworth|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> In the autumn of 2016, he began cancer treatments, but on 23 January 2017 he wrote the final entry on his blog:

{{cquote|Please suspend any donations. Last Friday after two days of tests, scans, bone-marrow extraction and so on, our Doctor came in the evening to say the cancer had badly metastsized [''[[sic]]''] ... to bone marrow, liver, right lung, kidney and small bowel. Nothing to be done except palliative care and that I had at most two weeks to live. So that's it. I can't see I shall ever get back here. Emails will reach Val who obviously will pass along to me whatever she can. Bits of it all have been fun and it's been a decent run.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tomraworth.com/notes/ |title=NOTES |last=Raworth |first=Tom |date=January 23, 2017 |website=tomraworth.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218122216/http://tomraworth.com/notes/ |archivedate=February 18, 2017 }}</ref>}}

Raworth died on 8 February 2017 at the age of 78.<ref name="poetryfoundation.org"/><ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> He is survived by his wife Val Raworth who said: "Tom died this afternoon, peacefully, his family around him. A release from his sufferings."<ref name="auto"/>
