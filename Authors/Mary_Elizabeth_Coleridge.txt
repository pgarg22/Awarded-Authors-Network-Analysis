'''Mary Elizabeth  Coleridge''' (23 September 1861 – 25 August 1907) was a British [[novelist]] and [[poet]] who also wrote essays and reviews.<ref>[http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/mary_elizabeth_coleridge Mary Elizabeth Coleridge – Poems, Biography, Quotes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She wrote poetry under the [[pseudonym]] Anodos (a name taken from [[George MacDonald]]). Other influences on her were [[Richard Watson Dixon]] and [[Christina Rossetti]]. [[Robert Bridges]], the Poet Laureate, described her poems as 'wonderously beautiful… but mystical rather and enigmatic'.<ref>Phillips, Catherine, 'Robert Bridges' Oxford University Press, Oxford 1992 {{ISBN|0-19-212251-7}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Mary Coleridge was <!-- born somewhere, -->the daughter of [[Arthur Coleridge|Arthur Duke Coleridge]], the lawyer and influential amateur musician. With the singer [[Jenny Lind]], her father was responsible for the formation of the [[The Bach Choir|London Bach Choir]] in 1875. Other family friends included [[Robert Browning]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[John Millais]] and [[Fanny Kemble]]. She was the great-grandniece of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and the great niece of [[Sara Coleridge]], the author of ''Phantasmion''.

Coleridge was educated at home, mostly by the poet and educationalist [[W. J. Cory]], and began writing poetry as a child.<ref>[https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/A_Historical_Dictionary_of_British_Women/uY2B224NwmYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Mary+Coleridge%22&pg=PA226&printsec=frontcover Hartley, Cathy. ''A Historical Dictionary of British Women'' (2013), p 226]</ref> She travelled widely throughout her life, although her home was in London, where she lived with her family. She taught at the London Working Women's College for twelve years from 1895 to 1907.

She completed five novels. Her first was ''The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus'', published in February 1893 by [[Chatto & Windus]]. The story (which is unrelated to the [[Seven Sleepers of Ephesus]] legend) centres on a mysterious "Brotherhood" involved in the production of a play in a nineteenth-century German town.<ref>{{citation|magazine=[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]|date=8 April 1893|page=302|title=New novels|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000020223694&view=1up&seq=318}}</ref>  It received mixed reviews.<ref>e.g. {{cite journal |journal=Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1893-03-31 |page=7 |title=Literature of the Day |quote=a mere farrago of silly an unintelligible rubbish}}; {{cite journal |journal=Colonies and India |date=1893-03-11 |page=24 |quote=we can safely recommend 'The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus' to the consideration of the reader |title=Literature}}</ref>   The novel was credited only to "M. E. Coleridge", which led at least one newspaper to assume that the author was a man.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Books of the Week |journal=Scotsman  |date=1893-02-20 |page=2 |issue=15488 |location=Edinburgh |quote=A story by Mr M. E. Coleridge, entitled 'The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus,' was published by Messrs Chatto & Windus, London}}</ref> 

[[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] published the other four novels. The best known is ''The King with Two Faces'', which earned her £900 in royalties in 1897.
Coleridge died of complications arising from [[appendicitis]] while on holiday in [[Harrogate]] in 1907, leaving an unfinished manuscript for her next novel and hundreds of unpublished poems. Her poetry was first published under her own name in the posthumous ''Poems'' (1908).  In the preface to this volume, [[Henry Newbolt]] wrote:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/poemscoleridge00cole/page/n11/mode/2up |pages=v-vi |title=Poems |first=Mary E. |last=Coleridge |year=1908 |location=London |publisher=Elkin Mathews}}</ref> {{quote |As a poetess, Mary Coleridge never came before the public under her own name; her printed verse was always either anonymous or signed with the pseudonym ’Άνοδος {{--}} a name taken from George Macdonald's romance, "Phantastes," where it is evidently intended to bear the meaning of "Wanderer."  Probably several reasons or feelings prompted this concealment; the one by which my own arguments were always met was the fear of tarnishing the name which an ancestor had made illustrious in English poetry [...] I believe that no poems are less likely than these to jar upon lovers of "Christabel" and "The Ancient Mariner."}}

In 1954 interest was revived by the first comprehensive ''Collected Poems'' to be issued, edited by [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] and with an introduction by Theresa Whistler.<ref>[[Lord David Cecil]]. 'A Victorian Poetess', in ''The Observer'', 25 July 1954, p 8</ref> More recently, her work has been further re-assessed and included in anthologies of ''fin de siècle'' Victorian women's poetry by [[Angela Leighton]] and Margaret Reynolds,<ref>‘Mary E. Coleridge’, in ''Victorian women poets: an anthology'', ed. A. Leighton and M. Reynolds (1995), 610–26</ref> and [[Isobel Armstrong]] and [[Joseph Bristow (literary scholar)|Joseph Bristow]].<ref>''Nineteenth Century Women Poets: An Oxford Anthology'', ed. Isobel Armstrong and Joseph Bristow (1996)</ref><ref>Chapman, Alison.

==Musical settings==
The relative simplicity of Mary Coleridge's lyrical poetry, combined with its touch of mysticism and strong imagery, proved congenial to composers.<ref>H C Colles. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/910789 'Parry as Song-Writer'], in ''The Musical Times'', vol. 62, No. 936 (February 1921), pp. 82-87</ref> Both [[Hubert Parry]] and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] were friends of Mary's father, and frequent visitors to the family home at 12, Cromwell Place, South Kensington. Parry set seven of her poems as songs for voice and piano in his ''English Lyrics, Ninth Set'', published in 1909.<ref>[https://www.lieder.net/lieder/assemble_texts.html?SongCycleId=7521 Lieder.net]</ref> In the opinion of [[Trevor Hold]], "no-one set her more sympathetically than Parry."<ref>[https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Parry_to_Finzi/L_NS-he4Rx0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA19&printsec=frontcover Hold, Trevor. ''Parry to Finzi: Twenty English Song Composers'' (2005), p 22]</ref> Stanford composed two sets of eight choral [[List_of_compositions_by_Charles_Villiers_Stanford#Part-Songs|partsongs]], Op. 119 and Op. 127 (both 1910).<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2013/Dec13/Stanford_partsongs_SOMMCD0128.htm Stanford, ''Partsongs'', SOMM CD0128 (2013)]</ref><ref>[https://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/notes/880524-B.pdf Notes to ''Stanford and Howells Remembered'', Collegium CSCD524 (1992)]</ref> By far the best known of these (and of any Coleridge setting) is "The Blue Bird", from Mary's poem originally published in 1897 under the French title "L'Oiseau Bleu".<ref>{{cite book |title=Fancy's Guerdon |author=Anodos |year=1897 |publisher=Elkin Mathews |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/fancysguerdon00cole/page/26/mode/2up |page=27}}</ref> 

Other settings include several by [[John Ireland]] and [[Roger Quilter]], three poems (including "Thy Hand in Mine") by [[Frank Bridge]], and the ''Four Dramatic Songs'', Op. 44 for solo voice and orchestra by [[Cyril Rootham]] (1913 - later also arranged for voice and piano).<ref>[https://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_author_texts.html?AuthorId=553 Lieder.net]</ref> [[William Busch]] set "L'Oiseau Bleu" in a German translation as "Der blaue Vogel" (1944).<ref>[https://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=3926 "Der blaue Vogel", Lieder.net]</ref>
