Ankara: Gece Kitaplığı, 2020. s.220-231.</ref> He is considered one of the greatest writers of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Arabian poetry|poetry]] in [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic times]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0853515.html |title= Infoplease |access-date=2008-01-16 }}</ref> Zuhayr belonged to the [[Banu Muzaina]]. His father was a poet and his elder son [[Ka'b bin Zuhayr]] also became a poet, reading his works to [[Muhammad|the Prophet Muhammad]].

Zuhayr's poems can be found in [[Hammad Ar-Rawiya]]'s anthology, the ''[[Mu'allaqat]]'' ("the Suspended"), a collection of pre-Islamic poetry. He was one of the ''[[Seven Hanged Poems|Seven Hanged Poets]]'' who were reputed to have been honoured by hanging copies of their work in the [[Kaaba]] at [[Mecca]]. He was [[Umar ibn Khattab]]'s favourite poet.

Zuhayr's poetry was written when two [[Bedouin]] tribes ended a longstanding hostility. His poems deal with raids and other subjects of [[nomad]]ic desert life. He also wrote [[satire|satirical]] poems and poems about the glory of his tribe, but in his verses he was less satiric than most of his brother poets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} He strove to express deep thoughts in simple words, to be clear and by his clear phrases to teach his people high and noble ideas. He was a man of rank and wealth, the foremost of a family noted for their poetic skill and religious earnestness.
