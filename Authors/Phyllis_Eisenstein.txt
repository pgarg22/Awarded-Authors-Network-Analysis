'''Phyllis Eisenstein''' (February 26, 1946 â€“ December 7, 2020) was an American author of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] short stories as well as novels. Her work was nominated for both the [[Hugo Award]] and [[Nebula Award]].

==Biography==
Eisenstein was born Phyllis Leah Kleinstein <ref name="Phyllis Eisenstein 1946-2020">[https://locusmag.com/2020/12/phyllis-eisenstein-1946-2020/ Phyllis Eisenstein (1946-2020)]</ref> in 1946 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]{{sfn|Pederson|1996|p=291}} and lived there most of his life. While studying [[psychology]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963, she met her future husband Alex at a weekly gathering of Chicago's [[science fiction fandom]]. In 1966, shortly after attending [[24th World Science Fiction Convention|Tricon]], the 24th [[World Science Fiction Convention]], they were married. She continued college until Alex entered the [[U. S. Air Force]] and, following [[basic training]], was posted to Germany; they lived there for three years and then returned to Chicago upon his [[honorable discharge]] from the service.

Eisenstein had her first two science fiction stories published in 1971, the first in collaboration with husband Alex (he continued to be her writing partner for certain short stories). After establishing herself as a professional writer, she returned to college to finish her education, studying at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], where she earned a 1981 [[B.A. degree]] in [[anthropology]].<ref name="legacy.com">[https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?n=phyllis-eisenstein&pid=197272120 Phyllis Eisenstein obituary, ''Chicago Tribune'', Dec. 13, 2020]</ref>

She wrote eight novels, subsequently publishing six of them and nearly fifty shorter works of varying lengths in the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and [[horror fiction]];<ref name="legacy.com"/> Eisenstein also wrote a popular non-fiction book on the treatment of [[arthritis]]. Her stories have appeared in a number [[anthologies]] and in many major science fiction and fantasy print media magazines; these include ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'', ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'', ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Weird Tales]]'', and others.

Eisenstein's stories were nominated twice for science fiction's [[Hugo Award]] and three times for [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America|SFWA]]'s [[Nebula Award]].

Her 1978 short story "Lost and Found" was [[Lost and Found (The Twilight Zone)|adapted for television]] in 1986, airing on the mid-1980s series ''[[The New Twilight Zone]]''; the [[screenplay]] was written by the show's then [[story editor]] [[George R. R. Martin]]. She was an old friend of Martin and convinced him to include dragons in his international best-selling fantasy series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.<ref name="GRRM Rolling Stone">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/george-r-r-martin-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140423|title=George R.R. Martin: The Rolling Stone Interview|date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Martin then dedicated the third novel in the series, ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'', to Eisenstein.<ref name="GRRM Rolling Stone"/>

Eisenstein spent much of her adult life teaching writing; this began by assisting author [[Roger Zelazny]] at the [[Indiana University]] Writers Conference in 1977. She taught writing at the [[Clarion Science Fiction Writer's Workshop]] at [[Michigan State University]], [[Oakton Community College]] of [[Skokie, Illinois]], and the [[Writer's Digest]] School. For twenty years she was a member of the part-time faculty of [[Columbia College Chicago]], teaching courses in general science fiction, popular fiction writing, fantasy, and advanced science fiction writing. In 1999, Eisenstein received an "Excellence in Teaching" Award from this institution; she retired from CCC in 2009 to devote more time to her professional writing career.<ref name="legacy.com"/>

Beginning in 2000, Eisenstein began working full-time in Chicago's very competitive advertising business; she went on to become the executive manager of [[copy editors]] for more than a decade at Leo Burnett, Chicago's largest [[advertising agency]], until declining health forced her retirement in 2015.

The completed novel, ''The City in Stone'', the last volume of her "Book of Elementals" fantasy [[trilogy]], was left unreleased when [[Meisha Merlin Publishing]], a well-established fantasy and science fiction publisher, suddenly ceased operations in 2007;<ref>[http://greatsfandf.com/AUTHORS/PhyllisEisenstein.php Science-Fiction and Fantasy Books by Phyllis Eisenstein], Great Science-Fiction & Fantasy Works</ref> the novel remains unpublished, while the first two novels in the series are currently out-of-print.

Eisenstein completed ''The Walker Between Worlds'', the first novel in a new [[science-fantasy]] series called "The Masks of Power". The first eight chapters from the in-progress novel, comprising 38,000 words, was published in 2007 as a limited edition [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] from KaCSFFS Press, a [[Kansas City, Missouri]] science fiction and fantasy [[small press|independent publisher]]; this debuted for her Writer Guest of Honor appearance at Kansas City's longtime regional science fiction and fantasy convention [[ConQuesT]] 38.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Truesdale | first = Dave | title = Walker Between the Worlds by Phyllis Eisenstein | work = TangentOnline | publisher = Tangent | date = 2007-06-30 | url = http://www.tangentonline.com/print--other-reviewsmenu-263/novellas-chapbooks-misc-reviewsmenu-338/1081-walker-between-the-worlds-by-phyllis-eisenstein | access-date = 2011-04-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007044135/http://www.tangentonline.com/print--other-reviewsmenu-263/novellas-chapbooks-misc-reviewsmenu-338/1081-walker-between-the-worlds-by-phyllis-eisenstein | archive-date = 2015-10-07 | url-status = dead }}</ref> After completing ''The Walker Between Worlds'', she purposely left the novel unpublished while she worked to complete the two remaining volumes in the series before publication. At the time of her death, "The Masks of Power" trilogy remained unfinished.

Eisentein suffered a [[stroke]] in January 2020 and entered hospice care shortly after.<ref name="Phyllis Eisenstein 1946-2020"/> She died in December of that year in Chicago at age 74 after a protracted neurological illness, complicated by [[COVID-19]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois]]. She was survived by her husband, Alex.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/01/18/a-farewell-to-phyl/ A Farewell to Phyl]</ref><ref name="legacy.com"/>
