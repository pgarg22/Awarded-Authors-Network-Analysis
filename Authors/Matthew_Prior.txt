'''Matthew Prior''' (21 July 1664 – 18 September 1721) was an English poet and diplomat.<ref name=poet>{{cite web|title=Matthew Prior|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/matthew-prior/biography/|publisher=poethunter.com|access-date=18 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=literary>{{cite web|title=Matthew Prior (1664–1721)|url=http://literaryballadarchive.com/en/1600-1739/128-matthew-prior.html|publisher=literaryballadarchive.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130918154127/http://literaryballadarchive.com/en/1600-1739/128-matthew-prior.html|archive-date=18 September 2013}}</ref> He is also known as a contributor to ''[[The Examiner (1710–1714)|The Examiner]]''.

==Early life==

Prior was probably born in [[Middlesex]].<ref>Leopold George Wickham Legg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2Y3IGOTRXQC&dq= ''Matthew Prior: A Study of His Public Career and Correspondence''], Cambridge University Press, 2010. pp. 2–3.</ref> He was the son of a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] joiner at [[Wimborne Minster]], East [[Dorset]]. His father moved to London, and sent him to [[Westminster School]], under [[Richard Busby|Dr Busby]]. On his father's death, he left school, and was cared for by his uncle, a [[vintner]] in Channel Row. Here [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Lord Dorset]] found him reading [[Horace]], and set him to translate an [[ode]]. He did so well that the Earl offered to contribute to the continuation of his education at Westminster. One of his schoolfellows and friends was [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]]. It was to avoid being separated from Montagu and his brother James that Prior accepted, against his patron's wish, a scholarship recently founded at [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He took his B.A. degree in 1686, and two years later became a [[fellow]].<ref>{{acad|id=PRR683M|name=Prior, Matthew}}</ref> In collaboration with Montagu he wrote in 1687 the ''City Mouse and Country Mouse'', in ridicule of [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Hind and the Panther]]''.

==Career beginning==

It was an age when [[Satire|satirists]] could be sure of patronage and promotion. Montagu was promoted at once, and Prior, three years later, became secretary to the embassy at [[the Hague]]. After four years of this, he was appointed a [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]] at court. Apparently he acted as one of the King's secretaries, and in 1697 he was secretary to the [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] who concluded the [[Peace of Ryswick]]. Prior's talent for affairs was doubted by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], who had no special means of judging, but it is not likely that [[William III of England|King William]] would have employed in this important business a man who had not given proof of diplomatic skill and grasp of details.<ref name=foundation>{{cite web|title=Matthew Prior|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/matthew-prior|publisher=poetryfoundation.org|access-date=18 September 2013}}</ref>

The poet's knowledge of French is specially mentioned among his qualifications, and this was recognized by his being sent in the following year to Paris in attendance on the English ambassador. At this period Prior could say with good reason that "he had commonly business enough upon his hands, and was only a poet by accident." To verse, however, which had laid the foundation of his fortunes, he still occasionally trusted as a means of maintaining his position. His [[occasional poems]] during this period include an elegy on ''Queen Mary'' in 1695; a satirical version of [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s ''Ode sur le prise de Namur'' (1695); some lines on William's escape from assassination in 1696; and a brief piece called ''The Secretary''.

After his return from France, Prior became under-secretary of state and succeeded [[John Locke]] as a commissioner of trade. In 1701 he sat in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] for [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]]. He had certainly been in William's confidence with regard to the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|Partition Treaty]]; but when [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Somers]], [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Orford]] and [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] were impeached for their share in it he voted on the [[Tory]] side, and immediately on Anne's accession he allied himself with [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] and St John. Perhaps as a consequence of this; there is no mention of his name in connection with any public transaction for nine years. But when the [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] came into power in 1710, Prior's diplomatic abilities were again called into action, and until the death of Anne he held a prominent place in all negotiations with the French court, sometimes as secret agent, sometimes in an equivocal position as ambassador's companion and sometimes as fully accredited but very unpunctually paid ambassador. His share in negotiating the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], of which he is said to have disapproved personally, led to its popular nickname of "Matt's Peace." Prior is also known as a contributor to ''[[The Examiner (1710–1714)|The Examiner]]'' newspaper.

==Prison life and poetry writing==

{{Peacock|date=February 2017}}

When [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|the Queen]] died and the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] regained power, he was impeached by [[Robert Walpole]] and kept in close custody for two years (1715–1717). In 1709, he had already published a collection of verse. During this imprisonment, maintaining his cheerful philosophy, he wrote his longest humorous poem, ''Alma; or, The Progress of the Mind''. This, along with his most ambitious work, ''Solomon, and other Poems on several Occasions'', was published by subscription in 1718. The sum received for this volume (4000&nbsp;guineas), with a present of £4000 from Lord Harley, enabled him to live in comfort; but he did not long survive his enforced retirement from public life, although he bore his ups and downs with rare equanimity. He died at [[Wimpole Hall|Wimpole]], Cambridgeshire, a seat of the [[Earl of Oxford]], and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], where his monument may be seen in [[Poets' Corner]]. ''A History of his Own Time'' was issued by J Bancks in 1740. The book pretended to be derived from Prior's papers, but it is doubtful how far it should be regarded as authentic.<ref name=poet2>{{cite web|title=Matthew Prior|url=http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/prior.htm|publisher=poetsgraves.com.uk|access-date=18 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Matthew Prior|url=https://www.questia.com/library/literature/poetry/poets/matthew-prior|publisher=}}{{dl|date=July 2021}}</ref>

Prior's poems show considerable variety, a pleasant scholarship and great executive skill. The most ambitious, i.e. ''Solomon'', and the paraphrase of ''[[The Nut-Brown Maid]]'', are the least successful. But ''Alma'', an admitted imitation of [[Samuel Butler (1612–1680)|Samuel Butler]], is a delightful piece of wayward easy humour, full of witty turns and well-remembered allusions, and Prior's mastery of the octo-syllabic couplet is greater than that of [[Jonathan Swift]] or Pope. His tales in rhyme, though often objectionable in their themes {{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}, are excellent specimens of narrative skill; and as an [[epigram]]matist he is unrivalled in English. The majority of his love songs are frigid and academic, mere wax-flowers of [[Parnassus]]; but in familiar or playful efforts, of which type are the admirable lines ''To a Child of Quality'', he has still no rival. "Prior's"—says [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], himself no mean proficient in this kind—"seem to me amongst the easiest, the richest, the most charmingly humorous of English lyrical poems. Horace is always in his mind, and his song and his philosophy, his good sense, his happy easy turns and melody, his loves and his [[Epicureanism]], bear a great resemblance to that most delightful and accomplished master."

[[Wittenham Clumps]] in Oxfordshire is said to be where Prior wrote ''[[Henry and Emma]]'', and this is now commemorated by a plaque. Prior has been commemorated by other poets as well; [[Everett James Ellis]] named Prior as a significant influence and source of inspiration.
