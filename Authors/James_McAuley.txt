'''James Phillip McAuley''' (12 October 1917 – 15 October 1976) was an Australian academic, poet, journalist, [[Australian literature|literary]] critic and a prominent convert to [[Roman Catholicism]]. He was involved in the [[Ern Malley]] poetry hoax.

==Life and career==
McAuley was born in [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]], a suburb of Sydney. He was educated at [[Fort Street High School]] and then attended [[Sydney University]], where he majored in English, Latin and philosophy (which he studied under [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]]. In 1937 he edited ''[[Hermes (publication)|Hermes]]'', the annual literary journal of the [[University of Sydney Union]], in which many of his early poems, beginning in  1935,<ref> [[Peter Coleman]], ''The Heart of James McAuley: Life and Work of the Australian Poet,'' Wildcat Press 1980 p.6.</ref> were published until 1941.<ref name=Malley>{{cite book |last=Malley |first=Ern |title=The Darkening Ecliptic |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Green Integer]] |date=2017 |isbn=978-1-55713-439-4}}</ref>

He began his life as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and was sometime organist and choirmaster at Holy Trinity Church, [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]], in Sydney. He lost his Christian faith as a younger man.

In 1943 McAuley was commissioned as a lieutenant in the militia for the [[Australian Army]] and served in Melbourne ([[Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs|DORCA]]) and [[Canberra]]. After the war he also spent time in [[New Guinea]], which he regarded as his second "spiritual home". There he is rumoured to have shot a Japanese soldier dead on [[Manus Island]] in order to satisfy his curiosity about what it was like to kill somebody.<ref>Michael Ackland, ''Damaged Men: The precarious lives of James McAuley and Harold Stewart,'' [[Allen & Unwin]] 2001 p.90.</ref>

McAuley came to prominence in the wake of the 1943–44 Ern Malley hoax. With fellow poet [[Harold Stewart]], McAuley concocted sixteen nonsense poems in a pseudo-experimental [[modernist]] style. These were then sent to the young editor of the literary magazine ''[[Angry Penguins]]'', [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]]. The poems were raced to publication by Harris and Australia's most celebrated literary hoax{{discuss|6 March 2013}} was set in motion.<ref name=Malley /> [[Peter Coleman]] considered that "no one else in Australian letters has so effectively exposed or ridiculed modernist verse, leftie politics and mindless liberalism".<ref>Peter Coleman, "Dealing in Damage", review of Michael Ackland, ''Damaged Men: The Precarious Lives of James McAuley and Harold Stewart'', in ''The Weekend Australian'', 10–11 March 2001, pp. R10-11.</ref>

In 1952 he converted to Roman Catholicism, the faith his own father had abandoned, following an intense spiritual experience at a Catholic mission in New Guinea<ref>J. Page, Land of Apocalypse – James McAuley’s encounter with the Spirit: the French Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart, Kubuna, New Guinea, [http://australiancatholichistoricalsociety.com.au/pdfs/2017/ACHS_2016_Conference_Journal_special_issue.pdf ''Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society'', 37 (1) (2016)], 18-31.</ref> This was in the parish of St Charles at Ryde. He was later introduced to Australian musician [[Richard Connolly (composer)|Richard Connolly]] by a priest, [[Fr Ted Kennedy|Ted Kennedy]], at the Holy Spirit parish at [[North Ryde, New South Wales|North Ryde]]<ref>cf. Australasian Catholic Record, October 1995</ref> and the two subsequently collaborated to produce between them the most significant collection of Australian Catholic hymnody to date, titled "Hymns for the Year of Grace". Connolly was McAuley's sponsor for his confirmation into the Roman Catholic Church. McAuley had been influenced during his undergraduate years by communism, anarchism and the freethinking philosophy of Professor [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|editor-last=Ritchie|editor-first=John|editor2=Diane Langmore|title=McAuley, James Phillip (1917–1976)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher=Research School of Social Sciences, [[Australian National University]]|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcauley-james-phillip-10896|access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcauley-james-phillip-10896 |title=McAuley, James Phillip (1917–1976) |last=Pierce |first=Peter  |date=2000 |website=Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Melbourne University Publishing/Australian National University

However, he remained staunchly [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] throughout his later life. In 1956 he and [[Richard Krygier]] founded the literary and cultural journal, [[Quadrant (magazine)|''Quadrant'']] and was chief editor until 1963. From 1961 he was professor of English at the [[University of Tasmania]].

A portrait of McAuley by [[Jack Carington Smith]] won the 1963 [[Archibald prize]].

James McAuley died of cancer in 1976, at the age of 59, in [[Hobart]].
