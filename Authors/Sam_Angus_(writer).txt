''A Horse Called Hero'', is the story of two child evacuees from [[London]] during [[World War II]] who, in the depths of the British countryside, gradually come to understand that their Father, a hero of the First World War, has been imprisoned for cowardice. This story is set in the area of the West Country where Sam lives. Angus has said about her exploration of the relationship between children and animals: "[Children] almost without exception want their own dog, or their own horse, and that longing is intense. They want to love something unconditionally, and be loved in return."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyadvice/10321556/Childrens-notebook-Sam-Angus-on-her-new-book-A-horse-called-hero.html|title=Children's notebook: Sam Angus on her new book A horse called hero|last=Bridgewater|first=Daisy|date=19 September 2013|work=The Telegraph|access-date=28 February 2017}}</ref>
