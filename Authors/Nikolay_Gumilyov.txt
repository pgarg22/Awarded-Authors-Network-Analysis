'''Nikolay  Stepanovich Gumilyov''' ({{lang-rus|Никола́й Степа́нович Гумилёв|p=nʲɪkɐˈlaj sʲtʲɪˈpanəvʲɪtɕ ɡʊmʲɪˈlʲɵf|a=Nikolay Styepanovich Gumilyov.ru.vorb.oga}}; April 15 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|NS]] 1886 – August 26, 1921) was an influential Russian poet, literary critic, traveler, and military officer. He was a cofounder of the [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeist movement]]. He was husband of [[Anna Akhmatova]] and father of [[Lev Gumilev]]. Nikolay Gumilyov was [[Tagantsev conspiracy|arrested and executed]] by the [[Cheka]], the secret Soviet police force, in 1921.

==Early life and poems==
Nikolay Gumilyov was born in the town of [[Kronstadt]] on [[Kotlin Island]], into the family of Stepan Yakovlevich Gumilyov (1836–1910), a naval physician, and Anna Ivanovna L'vova (1854–1942). His childhood nickname was "Montigomo," the Hawk's Claw.<ref name=moscownews>"Gumilyov's Magic Wand". Mikhail Sinelnikov. ''[[Moscow News]]'' (Russia). CULTURE; No. 15. April 18, 1996.</ref> He studied at the gymnasium of [[Tsarskoye Selo]], where the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] poet [[Innokenty Annensky]] was his teacher. Later, Gumilyov admitted that it was Annensky's influence that turned his mind to writing poetry.

His first publication were verses ''I ran from cities into the forest'' ({{lang|ru|Я в лес бежал из городов}}) on September 8, 1902. In 1905 he  published his first book of lyrics entitled ''The Way of Conquistadors''. It comprised poems on most exotic subjects imaginable, from [[Lake Chad]] [[giraffe]]s to [[Caracalla]]'s crocodiles. Although Gumilyov was proud of the book, most critics found his technique sloppy; later he would refer to that collection as ''apprentice's work''.

From 1907 and on, Nikolai Gumilyov traveled extensively in Europe, notably in Italy and France. In 1908 his new collection ''Romantic  Flowers'' appeared. While in Paris, he published the literary magazine ''Sirius'', but only three issues were produced. On returning to Russia, he edited and contributed to the artistic periodical ''[[Apollon (journal)|Apollon]]''. At that period, he fell in love with a non-existent woman [[Cherubina de Gabriak]].  It turned out that Cherubina de Gabriak was the literary pseudonym for two people: {{ill|Elisaveta Ivanovna Dmitrieva|ru|Дмитриева,_Елизавета_Ивановна}} and [[Maximilian Voloshin]]. On November 22, 1909 he had a [[Cherubina de Gabriak#Duel|duel]] with Voloshin over the affair.

Gumilyov married [[Anna Akhmatova]] on April 25, 1910. He dedicated some of his poems to her.<ref>{{YouTube|iNQxUqz29No|"From Dragon's Nest"}} Poem by Gumilyov about Akhmatova, music and performance by [[Larisa Novoseltseva]]</ref> On September 18, 1912, their child [[Lev Gumilyov|Lev]] was born. He would eventually become an influential and controversial historian.

==Travel to Africa==

Like [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] before him, but inspired by exploits of [[Alexander Bulatovich]] and [[Nikolay Leontiev]], Gumilyov was fascinated with Africa and travelled there almost each year. He explored, helping development of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], sometime hunted lions, and brought to the Saint Petersburg [[Kunstkamera|museum of anthropology and ethnography]] a large collection of African artifacts. His landmark collection ''The Tent'' (1921) collected the best of his poems on African themes, one of them "Giraffe".<ref>{{YouTube|29eZEnGS01A|Giraffe}}, poem by Gumilyov, with English translation, music and performance by [[Larisa Novoseltseva]]</ref>

==Guild of Poets==

In 1910, Gumilyov fell under the spell of the [[Russian Symbolist]] poet and philosopher [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and absorbed his views on poetry at the evenings held by Ivanov in his celebrated "Turreted House". His wife Akhmatova accompanied him to Ivanov's parties as well.

Dissatisfied with the vague mysticism of [[Russian Symbolism]], then prevalent in the Russian poetry, Gumilyov and [[Sergei Gorodetsky]] established the so-called ''Guild of Poets'', which was modeled after medieval guilds of Western Europe. They advocated a view that poetry needs craftsmanship just like architecture needs it. Writing a good poem they compared to building a cathedral. To illustrate their ideals, Gumilyov published two collections, ''The Pearls'' in 1910 and the ''Alien Sky'' in 1912. It was [[Osip Mandelstam]], however, who produced the movement's most distinctive and durable monument, the collection of poems entitled ''Stone'' (1912).

According to the principles of [[acmeism]] (as the movement came to be dubbed by art historians), every person, irrespective of his talent, may learn to produce high-quality poems if only he follows the guild's masters, i.e., Gumilyov and Gorodetsky. Their own model was [[Théophile Gautier]], and they borrowed much of their basic tenets from the French [[Parnassian poets|Parnasse]]. Such a program, combined with colourful and exotic subject matter of Gumilyov's poems, attracted to the Guild a large number of adolescents. Several major poets, notably [[Georgy Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], passed the school of Gumilyov, albeit informally.

==War experience==

When World War I started, Gumilyov hastened to Russia and enthusiastically joined a corps of elite cavalry. He fought in battles in East Prussia and Macedonia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mirsky|first=D. Svyatopolk|title=Obituary: N.S. Gumilev|journal=Slavonic Review|date=June 1922|volume=1|issue= 1}}</ref>  For his bravery he was invested with two [[Cross of St. George|St. George cross]]es (December 24, 1914 and January 5, 1915).

His war poems were assembled in the collection ''The Quiver'' (1916). In 1916 he wrote a verse play, ''Gondla'', which was published the following year; set in ninth-century [[Iceland]], torn between its native [[paganism]] and Irish [[Christianity]], it is also clearly autobiographical, Gumilyov putting much of himself into the hero Gondla (an Irishman chosen as king but rejected by the [[Earl|jarl]]s, he kills himself to ensure the triumph of Christianity) and basing Gondla's wild bride Lera on Gumilyov's wife Akhmatova (or maybe [[Larissa Reysner]]). The play was performed in [[Rostov na Donu]] in 1920.

During the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], Gumilyov served in the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France]]. Despite advice to the contrary, he rapidly returned to [[Petrograd]]. There he published several new collections, ''Tabernacle'' and ''Bonfire'', and finally divorced Akhmatova (August 5, 1918), whom he had left for another woman several years prior. The following year he married Anna Nikolaevna Engelhardt, a noblewoman and daughter of a well-known historian.

==Execution==
In 1920 Gumilyov co-founded the ''All-Russia Union of Writers''. Gumilyov made no secret of his anti-communist views. He also made the [[Sign of the Cross]] in public and didn't care to hide his contempt for "half-literate [[Bolshevik]]s". On August 3, 1921, he was arrested by the [[Cheka]] on charges of participation in a nonexistent [[monarchist]] conspiracy known as the [[Tagantsev conspiracy|"Petrograd military organization"]].<ref>Vitaliy Shentalinsky, "Crime without Punishment" (Progress-Pleyada, Moscow, 2007) p. 286.</ref> On August 24, the Petrograd Cheka decreed execution of 61 participants of the case, including Nikolay Gumilyov. They were shot on August 26 in the [[Kovalevsky Forest]] (the actual date was established only in 2014; previously it was thought he died on August 25).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazeta.ru/culture/news/2014/10/27/n_6598905.shtml|title=Петербургские историки установили дату гибели Николая Гумилева|website=Газета.Ru|language=ru|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://predanie.org/vse-sobytiya/?record_id=230|title=Предание|website=predanie.org|language=ru|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> [[Maxim Gorky]], his friend and fellow writer, hurried to Moscow and appealed to Lenin, but was unable to save Gumilyov.

==Legacy==
Gumilyov's execution placed a stigma on [[Anna Akhmatova]] and on their son, [[Lev Gumilyov|Lev]]. Lev was arrested later in the purges of the 1930s and spent almost two decades in the [[Gulag]].<ref name="kunhay1973">''Poems of Akhmatova'', 1973, Staney Kunitz and Max Hayward, pub. Houghton Mifflin, pp. 15, 16.</ref>

Despite Gumilyov's execution by the [[Cheka]], ''Gondla'' was again performed in Petrograd in January 1922: "The play, despite its crowd scenes being enacted on a tiny stage, was a major success. Yet when the Petrograd audience called for the author, who was now officially an executed counter-revolutionary traitor, the play was removed from the repertoire and the theatre disbanded."<ref>Donald Rayfield, "Gondla," in Neil Cornwell and Nicole Christian (eds), ''Reference Guide to Russian Literature'' (Taylor & Francis, 1998: {{ISBN|1-884964-10-9}}), pp. 375-76.</ref>

In February 1934, as they walked along a Moscow street, [[Osip Mandelstam]] quoted Gondla's words "I am ready to die" to Akhmatova, and she repeated them in her "Poem without a Hero."<ref>[[Omry Ronen]], ''An Approach to Mandel'štam'' (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 302-03.</ref>

==Cultural influence==
Although banned in the Soviet times, Gumilyov was loved for his adolescent longing for travel and giraffes and hippos, for his dreams of a fifteen-year-old captain"<ref name=moscownews/> His "The Tram That Lost Its Way" is considered one of the greatest poems of the 20th century.<ref name=moscownews/>

*The [[Russia]]n [[progressive rock]] band [[Little Tragedies (rock group)|Little Tragedies]] used the poetry of Gumilyov in many of their songs,<ref name="littletragedies.com">{{Cite web |url=http://littletragedies.com/AlbomiMT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521193703/http://littletragedies.com/AlbomiMT.htm |archive-date=2013-05-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and had four albums which were entirely based on Gumilyov's poetry (''The Sun of the Spirit, Porcelain Pavilion, Return, Cross'').<ref name="littletragedies.com"/><ref>http://littletragedies.com/GIsolo.htm</ref>
* In 2016 an English translation of his verse drama ''Gondla'' was published  by the Irish poet and diplomat [[Philip McDonagh]] and a production toured in Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aae.ie/review-gondla/|title=Review-Gondla|date=2016-08-30|website=AN ÁIT EILE|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>
