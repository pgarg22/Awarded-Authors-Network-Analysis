==Biography==
Born in Kiev to a family of teachers, his father was from an Orthodox Christian priests family, who graduated from seminary and taught Latin and Greek at the University Gymnasium.

In 1897, Yan graduated from the historical and philological faculty of [[St. Petersburg University]]. Impressions of a two-year tour of Russia form the backbone of his book ''Notes of a Pedestrian'' (1901). In 1901–1904 he served as inspector of wells in [[Turkestan]], where he studied Oriental languages and lives of local people. During the [[Russian-Japanese war]], he was a military correspondent for the [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|St. Petersburg News Agency (SPA)]]. In 1906–1913, he taught Latin at the first Petersburg Gymnasium. As an organizer of the scouts he met with Colonel [[Robert Baden-Powell]], who came to Russia in 1910.

In the autumn of 1910 Vasily Yan introduced the magazine ''Pupil''. In 1913, he worked as a correspondent in [[Turkey]] SPA. In 1914, with the beginning of the First World War - he became SPA military correspondent in [[Romania]]. In 1918–1919 he worked in the [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Kolchak]] printing shop army camp in Siberia. After the restoration of Soviet power in [[Achinsk]] he worked as a teacher, correspondent and director of schools in Uryanhae ([[Tuva]]). He then became the editor of the leading newspaper ''The Power of labour'' in Minusinsk. That was when he first adopted the pseudonym Yan. In 1923, he moved to Moscow.

Falsification of the novel "Ermak's Campaign" was carried out in 2011 by "[[:ru:Лениздат|Leningrad publishing house]]" (ЛЕНИЗДАТ). In fact this novel is [[Lidia Charskaya|Lydia Charskaya's]] "Formidable squad" (Грозная дружина) published in 1909. The circulation of the fake "Lenizdat" was only 7050 copies. Since the falsification was successful, it is referred to as the real work of Vasily Yan.
