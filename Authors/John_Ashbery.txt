Ashbery is considered the most influential American poet of his time. Oxford University literary critic John Bayley wrote that Ashbery "sounded, in poetry, the standard tones of the age."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1991/08/15/richly-flows-contingency/|title=Richly Flows Contingency|last=Bayley|first=John|journal=New York Review of Books|date=August 15, 1991|access-date=September 10, 2019|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}</ref> Langdon Hammer, chair of the English Department at [[Yale University]], wrote in 2008, "No figure looms so large in American poetry over the past 50 years as John Ashbery" and "No American poet has had a larger, more diverse vocabulary, not [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], not [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]."<ref>Hammer, Langdon, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/books/review/Hammer-t.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&ref=books&pagewanted=print "‘But I Digress’"], review of ''Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems'', by John Ashbery, ''New York Times Book Review'', April 20, 2008, accessed same day.</ref> [[Stephanie Burt]], a poet and [[Harvard]] professor of English, has compared Ashbery to [[T.

Ashbery published more than 20 volumes of poetry and won nearly every major American award for poetry, including a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1976 for his collection ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (book)|Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror]]''. Renowned for its postmodern complexity and opacity, his work still proves controversial. Ashbery said he wished his work to be accessible to as many people as possible, not a private dialogue with himself.<ref name="NYT-MTV" /><ref name="npr.org">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4542617 NPR interview with Ashbery about his collection ''Where Shall I Wander'' – including poem audio.

H. Auden]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] and began writing poetry. Two of his poems were published in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine by a classmate who had submitted them under his own name, without Ashbery's knowledge or permission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/144210/john-ashbery|title=Remembering John Ashbery|date=September 11, 2017|publisher=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> Ashbery also published a piece of short fiction and a handful of poems—including a sonnet about his frustrated love for a fellow student—in the school newspaper, the ''Deerfield Scroll''. His first ambition was to be a painter: from the age of 11 until he was 15, Ashbery took weekly classes at the art museum in Rochester.

[[File:John Ashbery by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Ashbery at a 2007 tribute to [[W.H. Auden]] at [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City]].]]
Ashbery graduated in 1949 with an A.B., ''[[cum laude]]'', from [[Harvard|Harvard College]], where he was a member of the ''[[Harvard Advocate]]'', the university's literary magazine, and the [[Signet Society]]. He wrote his senior thesis on the poetry of W. H. Auden. At Harvard he befriended fellow writers [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Barbara Epstein]], [[V. R. Lang]], [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Edward Gorey]], and was a classmate of [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Bly]] and [[Peter Davison (poet)|Peter Davison]]. Ashbery went on to study briefly at [[New York University]] before receiving an M.A. from [[Columbia University]] in 1951.

After working as a [[copywriter]] in [[New York City|New York]] from 1951 to 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/38138/John-Ashbery |title=John Ashbery |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=August 26, 2014}}</ref> from the mid-1950s, when he received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellowship]], through 1965, Ashbery lived in [[France]]. He was an editor of the 12 issues of ''Art and Literature'' (1964–67) and the ''New Poetry'' issue of [[Harry Mathews]]' ''Locus Solus'' (# 3/4; 1962). To make ends meet he translated French murder mysteries, served as the art editor for the European edition of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and was an art critic for ''Art International'' (1960–65) and a Paris correspondent for ''[[ARTnews]]'' (1963–66), when Thomas Hess took over as editor. During this period he lived with the French poet [[Pierre Martory]], whose books ''Every Question but One'' (1990), ''The Landscape is behind the Door'' (1994) and ''The Landscapist'' he translated (2008), as he did [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (''Illuminations''), [[Max Jacob]] (''The Dice Cup''), [[Pierre Reverdy]] (''Haunted House''), and many titles by [[Raymond Roussel]]. After returning to the United States, he continued his career as an [[art critic]] for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines while also serving on the editorial board of ''ARTnews'' until 1972. Several years later, he began a stint as an editor at ''[[Partisan Review]]'', serving from 1976 to 1980.

During the fall of 1963, Ashbery became acquainted with [[Andy Warhol]] at a scheduled poetry reading at the [[Literary Theatre]] in New York. He had previously written favorable reviews of Warhol's art. That same year he reviewed Warhol's ''Flowers'' exhibition at Galerie [[Ileana Sonnabend]] in Paris, describing Warhol's visit to Paris as "the biggest transatlantic fuss since [[Oscar Wilde]] brought culture to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in the nineties". Ashbery returned to New York near the end of 1965 and was welcomed with a large party at [[the Factory]]. He became close friends with poet [[Gerard Malanga]], Warhol's assistant, on whom he had an important influence as a poet. In 1967 his poem ''Europe'' was used as the central text in [[Eric Salzman|Eric Salzman's]] ''Foxes and Hedgehogs'' as part of the ''New Image of Sound'' series at [[Hunter College]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. When the poet sent Salzman ''Three Madrigals'' in 1968, the composer featured them in the seminal ''Nude Paper Sermon'', released by [[Nonesuch Records]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&sortfield=publicationdate&sorttype=desc&se_type=EX&pg=20&/|title=Ashbery Research Center archive|access-date=September 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141214045519/http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&sortfield=publicationdate&sorttype=desc&se_type=EX&pg=20&/|archive-date=December 14, 2014}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Ashbery began teaching at [[Brooklyn College]], where his students included poet [[John Yau]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1983.<ref name=AAAS /> In the 1980s, he moved to [[Bard College]], where he was the Charles P. Stevenson, Jr., Professor of Languages and Literature, until 2008, when he retired but continued to win awards, present readings, and work with graduate and undergraduates at many other institutions. He was the [[List of U.S. states' Poets Laureate|poet laureate of New York State]] from 2001 to 2003,<ref>{{cite web|title=New York|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/newyork.html|work=US State Poet Laureates|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> and also served for many years as a chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. He served on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal ''[[Conjunctions]]''. In 2008 Ashbery was named the first poet laureate of [[MtvU]], a division of [[MTV]] broadcast to U.S. college campuses, with excerpts from his poems featured in 18 promotional spots and the works in their entirety on the broadcaster's website.

==Work==

Ashbery's long list of awards began with the [[Yale Younger Poets Prize]] in 1956. The selection, by [[W. H. Auden]], of Ashbery's first collection, ''Some Trees'', later caused some controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/jascha-kessler/|title=Jascha Kessler – ArtsBeat Blog – The New York Times|website=papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5235921.ece|title=The Times & The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5278554.ece|title=The Times & The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref> The volume was screened out in the contest's early stages and was given to Auden by [[Chester Kallman]] after Auden had decided not to award the prize that year because of the poor quality of the volumes he received.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sFZAAAAMAAJ|title=After the Death of Poetry: Poet and Audience in Contemporary America|last=Shetley|first=Vernon Lionel|date=1993|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-1342-7|location=Durham & London|pages=109|language=en}}</ref> Ashbery's early work shows the influence of Auden, along with [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Boris Pasternak]], and many of the French [[surrealists]] (his translations from French literature are numerous), though he claimed in a 1956 letter to "hate all modern French poetry, except for [[Raymond Roussel]]" and to like his own "wildly inaccurate translations of some of the 20th-century ones, but not the originals".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/15/collected-french-translations-poetry-john-ashbery-review|title=Collected French Translations: Poetry by John Ashbery – review|last=McGuinness|first=Patrick|date=November 15, 2014|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=November 18, 2018}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, John Bernard Myers, co-owner of the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], categorized Ashbery's [[avant-garde]] poetry and that of [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[James Schuyler]], [[Barbara Guest]], [[Kenward Elmslie]] and others as a "[[New York School (art)|New York School]]", despite their very different styles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://observer.com/2013/01/the-meaning-of-all-this-talking-to-john-ashbery-about-his-past-present-and-future/2/|title=The Meaning of All This: Talking to John Ashbery About His Past, Present and Future|date=January 1, 2013|work=Observer|access-date=November 18, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1953 Myers launched the magazine ''Semi-Colon'', in which New York School poets appeared amid an eclectic mix of authors, such as Auden, [[James Ingram Merrill|James Ingram Merill]] and [[Saul Bellow]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpxbAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets|last=Diggory|first=Terence|publisher=Infobase Learning|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4381-4066-7|location=New York|language=en}}</ref>

Ashbery published some work in the avant-garde [[little magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']] at the beginning of the 1960s. He then wrote two collections while in France, the highly controversial ''The Tennis Court Oath'' (1962) and ''Rivers and Mountains'' (1966), before returning to New York to write ''The Double Dream of Spring'', published in 1970.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Perrin Robert|date=December 2013|title="Rivers and mountains" : the conceptual wedding of the temporal and spatial in the early volumes of John Ashbery|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/24089|journal=University of Texas Electronic Theses and Dissertations|language=en}}</ref>

Increasing critical recognition in the 1970s transformed Ashbery from an obscure avant-garde experimentalist into one of America's most important poets (though still one of its most controversial). After the publication of ''Three Poems'' (1973) came ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (book)|Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'', for which he was awarded the three major American poetry awards: the [[Pulitzer Prize]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/john-ashbery|title=Winners in Poetry: Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, by John Ashbery (Viking)|website=www.pulitzer.org|language=en|access-date=November 18, 2018}}</ref> the [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]],<ref name=nba1976>

His subsequent collection, the more difficult ''Houseboat Days'' (1977), reinforced Ashbery's reputation, as did 1979's ''As We Know,'' which contains the long, double-columned poem "Litany." In 1988, his "Bridge Poem" was installed, using metal letters, on the 375-foot-wide [[Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge]] in Minneapolis; the poet was selected by the bridge's architect, artist [[Siah Armajani]], and commissioned by the [[Walker Art Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/magazine/john-ashbery-siah-armajani-bridge-poem|title=Not a Conduit but a Place: John Ashbery Reads his Poem for Siah Armajani's Bridge|first=Paul|last=Schmelzere|date=September 12, 2017|via=Walker Reader}}</ref> By the 1980s and 1990s, Ashbery had become a central figure in American and more broadly English-language poetry, as his number of imitators attested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://radioopensource.org/john-ashbery-is-you/|title=Let Us Now Praise John Ashbery – Open Source with Christopher Lydon|website=radioopensource.org|language=en-US|access-date=November 18, 2018|date=September 8, 2017}}</ref>

Ashbery's works are characterized by a free-flowing, often disjunctive syntax; extensive linguistic play, often infused with considerable humor; and a prosaic, sometimes disarmingly flat or parodic tone. The play of the human mind is the subject of a great many of his poems. He once said that his goal was "to produce a poem that the critic cannot even talk about".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2114565/|title=The Instruction Manual|first=Meghan|last=O'Rourke|date=March 9, 2005|access-date=September 3, 2017|via=Slate}}</ref> Formally, the earliest poems show the influence of conventional poetic practice, yet by ''The Tennis Court Oath'' a much more revolutionary engagement with form appears.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Straub|first=Peter|date=2007|title=The Oath Unbroken: The Tennis Court Oath (1962)|journal=Conjunctions|issue=49|pages=259–262|jstor=24516471}}</ref> Ashbery returned to something approaching a reconciliation between tradition and innovation with many of the poems in ''The Double Dream of Spring'',<ref name="test">{{cite journal|jstor=490097|title=Ashbery and the Individual Talent|first=James|last=Longenbach|date=September 3, 1997|journal=American Literary History|volume=9|issue=1|pages=103–127|doi=10.1093/alh/9.1.103}}</ref> though his ''Three Poems'' are written in long blocks of prose. Although he never again approached the radical experimentation of ''The Tennis Court Oath'' poems or [[The Skaters]] and "Into the Dusk-Charged Air" from his collection ''Rivers and Mountains,'' syntactic and semantic experimentation, linguistic expressiveness, deft, often abrupt shifts of register, and insistent wit remained consistent elements of his work.
