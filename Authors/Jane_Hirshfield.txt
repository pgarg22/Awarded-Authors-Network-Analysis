== Life and work ==
Jane Hirshfield was born on East 20th Street in New York City. She received her bachelor's degree from [[Princeton University]] in the school's first graduating class to include women as freshmen.

In 1979, Hirshfield received lay ordination in Soto Zen at the [[San Francisco Zen Center]].<ref name="fire">{{Cite book|last=Busch |first=Colleen Morton|title=Fire Monks: Zen Mind Meets Wildfire at the Gates of Tassajara |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-59420-291-9 |location=New York |lccn=2011010226 |oclc=682892561 |ol=OL25108970M |page=15}}</ref>

Hirshfield's nine books of poetry have received numerous awards. Her fifth book, ''Given Sugar, Given Salt'', was a finalist for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and her sixth collection, ''After'', was shortlisted for the "[[T.S. Eliot Prize]]" (UK) and named a 'best book of 2006' by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and the ''[[Financial Times]]''. Her eighth collection, ''The Beauty,'' was long-listed for the [[National Book Award]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-poetry-longlist-national-book-award-20150915-story.html|title=National Book Award poetry longlist announced|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 26, 2019|date=September 15, 2015}}</ref> and named a 'best book of 2015' by ''The San Francisco Chronicle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/books/article/Best-of-2015-100-recommended-books-6698121.php|title=Best of 2015: 100 recommended books|website=SFChronicle.com|access-date=January 29, 2018|date=December 15, 2015}}</ref> She has written two books of essays, ''Nine Gates: Entering the Mind of Poetry'' and ''Ten Windows: How Great Poems Transform the World''. ''The Ink Dark Moon'', her co-translation of the work of the two foremost women poets of classical-era Japan, was instrumental in bringing [[tanka]] (a 31-syllable Japanese poetic form) to the attention of American poets. She has edited four books collecting the work of poets from the past and is noted as being "part of a wave of important scholarship then seeking to recover the forgotten history of women writers."<ref>Mark A. Eaton, "Twentieth-Century American Nature Poets". Ed. J. Scott Bryson and Roger Thompson. ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' Vol. 342. Detroit: Gale, 2008.)</ref> She received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1985, the Academy of American Poets' 2004 Fellowship<ref>[http://www.poets.org/academy-american-poets/prizes/academy-fellowship Academy of American Poets' 2004 Fellowship]</ref> for Distinguished Achievement, a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 2005, and the Donald Hall-Jane Kenyon Award in American Poetry in 2012.
[[File:Janehirshfield023.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Hirshfield in 2012]]
Though never a full-time academic, Hirshfield has taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of San Francisco]], The Bennington Writing Seminars, and as the Elliston Visiting Poet at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. She was the Hellman Visiting Artist in 2013 in the Neuroscience Department at [[University of California, San Francisco]], and [[Stanford University]]'s 2016 Mohr Visiting Professor in Poetry. She has also taught at many writers conferences, including [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference|Bread Loaf]] and the Napa Valley Writers Conference and has served as both core and associate faculty in the [[Bennington College|Bennington Master of Fine Arts Writing Seminars]].<ref name=poets.org>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/563 Jane Hirshfield profile], Academy of American Poets, accessed January 15, 2007</ref> Hirshfield appears frequently in literary festivals both in America and abroad, including the [[Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival]], the [[National Book Festival]], the [[Los Angeles Times Festival of Books]], Poetry International (London, UK), the China Poetry Festival (Xi'an, China), and the Second International Gathering of the Poets [Kraków, Poland]. She has received numerous residency fellowships, including from [[Yaddo]], [[The MacDowell Colony]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macdowellcolony.org/artists-indexfellows.php|title=Index of Fellows on Portable MacDowell – The MacDowell Colony|website=MacDowellColony.org|access-date=January 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526052307/http://www.macdowellcolony.org/artists-indexfellows.php|archive-date=May 26, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Rauschenberg Foundation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rauschenbergfoundation.org/residency/past-residents|title=Past Residents|date=October 15, 2014|website=RauschenbergFoundation.org|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref> the Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Center, Civitella Ranieri,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civitella.org/about/directors-guests/|title=Civitella Rainieri|website=Civitella.org|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref> and the Djerassi Resident Artists Program.<ref>[http://www.djerassi.org/ Djerassi Resident Artists Program]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://djerassi.org/members/janehirshfield/|title=Djerassi Resident Artists Program {{!}} Jane Hirshfield|website=Djerassi Resident Artists Program|access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref> She is also a contributing editor at ''[[The Alaska Quarterly Review]]'' and ''[[Ploughshares]]'', a former guest editor of ''[[The Pushcart Prize]] Anthology'' and an advisory editor at ''[[Orion (magazine)|Orion]]'' and ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle]]''.

Hirshfield served as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets (2012–2017).<ref name="poets.org" />

In 2019, Hirshfield was elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.<ref name="newly-elected-members" />

== Poetry ==
[[David Baker (poet)|David Baker]] described Hirshfield  as "one of our finest, most memorable contemporary poets"<ref>David Baker, ''The American Poet'', spring 2005.</ref> and U.S. Poet Laureate [[Kay Ryan]] called Hirshfield  "a true person of letters".<ref name=poets.org /><ref>[[Kay Ryan]], from the [[Academy of American Poets]]' New Chancellor 2012 Press Release, reprinted in ''The American Poet''</ref> Hirshfield's poetry has often been described as sensuous, insightful, and clear. In the award citation for Hirshfield's 2004 Academy of American Poets' Fellowship, Rosanna Warren noted

<blockquote>Hirshfield has elaborated a sensuously philosophical art that imposes a pause in our fast-forward habits of mind. Her poems appear simple, and are not. Her language, in its cleanliness and transparency, poses riddles of a quietly metaphysical nature. Clause by clause, image by image, in language at once mysterious and commonplace, Hirshfield's poems clear a space for reflection and change. They invite ethical awareness, and establish a delicate balance.<ref name=poets.org /></blockquote>

The comment is echoed by the Polish Nobel Prize poet [[Czeslaw Milosz]], who wrote, "A profound empathy for the suffering of all living beings... It is precisely this I praise in the poetry of Jane Hirshfield. The subject of her poetry is our ordinary life among other people and our continuing encounter with everything Earth brings us: trees, flowers, animals, and birds…In its highly sensuous detail, her poetry illuminates the Buddhist virtue of mindfulness."<ref>[http://blog.loa.org/2012/10/jane-hirshfield-on-czesaw-miosz.html Czeslaw Milosz, Prze Kroj (Poland), quoted in ''Reader's Almanac'', Library of America] October 12, 2012</ref>

Hirshfield's poetry reflects her immersion in a wide range of poetic traditions, both Asian and Western, interests found also in the essays of Nine Gates and Ten Windows. Polish, Scandinavian, and Eastern European poets have been particularly important to her, along with the poetry of Japan and China. [[Zbigniew Herbert]]'s poem, "Pebble" stands as a model behind the small studies Hirshfield has labelled "pebbles", included in ''After'' and ''Come, Thief''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2011/09/a-conversation-between-brian-bouldrey-jane-hirshfield-pt-3.html|title=A Conversation between Brian Bouldrey & Jane Hirshfield, Pt. 3|website=The Best American Poetry|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>

Hirshfield's work consistently explores themes of social justice and environmental awareness, specifically the belief that natural world and human world are inextricably linked. Mark A. Eaton noted in ''The [[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' that "Hirshfield's work recognizes the full breadth and responsibilities of humans' transactions with the earth, not just the intimacies." Donna Seaman, reviewing Hirshfield's ninth collection, ''Ledger'', described Hirshfield's "carefully weighted tone as she reckons with our constant subtraction of Earth's life forces and incessant addition of carbon to our atmosphere, acid to our seas."<ref>{{cite book|last=Seaman|first=Donna|title=Ledger|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Ledger/pid=9729290
|publisher=Booklist|date=March 15, 2020|access-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref> Hirshfield has become an increasingly visible spokesperson for peace, justice, and environmental issues. In a review of her seventh collection,''Come, Thief'', Afaa M. Weaver wrote that her poems "find a middle ground between the larger landscape of political conflict and the personal landscape of our need to connect with one another."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orionmagazine.org/review/come-thief/|title=Come, Thief|last=Reviewed by Afaa M. Weaver|date=October 25, 2011|website=Orion Magazine|language=en|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Hirshfield's voice as a spokesperson for peace, justice, and environmental issues has become increasing visible, with her work concluding the Library of America's "War No More: Three Hundred Years of American Antiwar and Peace Writing"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loa.org/books/511-war-no-more-three-centuries-of-american-antiwar-and-peace-writing|title=War No More: Three Centuries of American Antiwar & Peace Writing – Library of America|website=LOA.org|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref> and appearing in many other collections of poems of social awareness.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/poltical-poetry-sampler.html|title=Poems of Resistance: A Primer|date=April 21, 2017|access-date=January 29, 2018|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="Refusing to Go Gentle">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/american-poets-refusing-to-go-gentle-rage-against-the-right.html|title=American Poets, Refusing to Go Gentle, Rage Against the Right|first=Alexandra|last=Alter|date=April 21, 2017|access-date=January 29, 2018|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

An article in ''Critical Survey of Poetry'' (2002) summarized the effect of Zen on Hirshfield's work:

<blockquote>Little of her poetry is political in the usual sense of direct comment on specific issues, but all her work is political in the sense of integrating the stirrings of the heart, with the political realities that surround all people. Undoubtedly, the source for these characteristics of her poetry, and for her very concept of what poetry is, "the magnification of being," derives from her strong Zen Buddhist training. Her emphasis on compassion, on the preexistent unity of subject and object, on nature, on the self-sufficient suchness of being, and on the daunting challenge of accepting transitoriness, as Peter Harris notes, are central themes in her poetry derived from Buddhism. Hirshfield does not, however, burden her poetry with heavy, overt Zen attitudes. Only occasionally is there any direct reference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pshares.org/issues/spring-1998/about-jane-hirshfield-profile|title=About Jane Hirshfield: A Profile|last=Peter Harris|website=pshares.org|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>
</blockquote>

While many reviewers mention, even make central, Hirshfield's Buddhism as the prevailing filter of her work, Hirshfield has expressed frustration in multiple interviews with being so labeled. "I always feel a slight dismay if I'm called a "Zen" poet. I am not. I am a human poet, that's all."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spiritualityhealth.com/articles/2013/04/01/poet-jane-hirshfield-mystery-existence|title=Poet Jane Hirshfield on the Mystery of Existence|last=Kim Rosen|date=April 1, 2013|website=spiritualityhealth.com|language=en|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Lisa Russ Spaar has called Hirshfield "a visionary", continuing: "It is arguable that the riddle, the existential joke of being, of meaning, of Dickinson's "prank of the Heart at play on the Heart," is as powerful a source as song for the lyric poem. Central to Hirshfield's vision is a kind of holy delight that is at the heart of riddles and koans".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/arts/mondays-poems-three-by-jane-hirshfield/29895|title=Monday's Poems: Three by Jane Hirshfield|date=September 24, 2011|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105080625/http://chronicle.com/blogs/arts/mondays-poems-three-by-jane-hirshfield/29895|archive-date=November 5, 2011|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>

Other reviewers note the investigative nature of Hirshfield's poems, in which life is approached as a puzzle which is not quite solveable. In a review of ''Come, Thief'' in ''[[The Georgia Review]]'', Judith Kitchen wrote "Jane Hirshfield's felt longing elevates description to insight: not self-knowledge, less fleeting than that... something more encompassing, more akin to the indefinable suddenly given expression."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kitchen|first=Judith|title=Jane Hirshfield's Come, Thief|url=https://garev.uga.edu/summer12/summer12.html|publisher=The Georgia Review Summer 2012|access-date=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

For all her focus on insight and the unknowable, as early as 1995, Stephen Yenser noted in ''The Yale Review'' Hirshfield's interest in the empirical. "The probably unspeakeable plenitude of the empirical world: Jane Hirshfield's poems recognize it at every point."<ref>Stephen Yenser, ''The Yale Review'' (April 1995) pp 147-152</ref> In a ''[[Booklist]]'' starred review, Donna Seaman has more recently noted Hirshfield's "meticulous reasoning, including a striking meditation on the paradoxical richness of spareness that can serve as her ars poetica."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napawritersconference.org/2011/07/12/meet-faculty-hirshfield_20110708/|title=Meet the 2011 Faculty: Jane Hirshfield|website=NapaWritersConference.org|access-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113092215/http://www.napawritersconference.org/2011/07/12/meet-faculty-hirshfield_20110708/|archive-date=January 13, 2013|author=Catherine|date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>

Hirshfield's poems and life increasingly reflect her long-standing interest in biology, as well as physics and other fields of science. She was the 2013 Hellman Visiting Artist in the Neuroscience department at The [[University of California, San Francisco]], a program "created to foster dialogue between scientists, caregivers, patients, clinicians and the public regarding creativity and the brain."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memory.ucsf.edu/about/art-mac|title=Hellman Visiting Artist Program, UCSF Memory and Ageing centre|website=Memory and Aging Center|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405010106/http://memory.ucsf.edu/ourcenter/artist|archive-date=April 5, 2012|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> In 2010, she was the Blue River Fellow in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest's Long Term Ecological Reflection project, whose goal is to track scientific research and artistic responses to the same sites for 200 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andrewsforestlog.org/about-hjarts-humanities/|title=About Andrews Forest Art & Humanities – Andrews Forest Log|website=AndrewsForestLog.org|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref>

In 2017, Hirshfield organized a Poets For Science component for the main D.C. March for Science held on Earth Day, April 22, on the Washington Mall. As a main rally speaker, she read "On the Fifth Day", a poem protesting the January 24, 2017, removal of scientific information from federal agency websites. The poem appeared on the front page of the ''[[Washington Post]]'s'' Opinion Section a week before the March.<ref>{{

While her work looks deeply at the inner world of the self and emotions, Hirshfield has kept most of the details of her private life out of both her poems and her public life as a poet, preferring that her work stand on its own.

Hirshfield's work has been published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', many literary journals, and multiple volumes of The ''[[Best American Poetry]]'' and [[Pushcart Prize]] anthologies.<ref>{{
