'''E. M. Foster''' (fl. late 18th – early 19th c.) was a relatively early female novelist. Some 14 popular novels of hers appeared in London between 1795 and 1810.<ref name="Feminist">Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, eds., ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English.

Foster's writing showed some improvement as she turned to more modern subject-matter in ''Frederic and Caroline, or the Fitzmorris Family'' (1800, E. M. F.),<ref name="BL"/> which she dedicated to the [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales]]. It was one of four novels of hers to appear in that year, and includes a scene set in the Minerva Circulating Library, which was associated with the [[Minerva Press]], responsible for most of her books.<ref name="Feminist"/> ''Light and Shade: a novel.

Foster), was published in 1803 in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and London and described as being by the author of "Rebecca, Judith, Miriam, etc."<ref name="BL"/>

==Views==
Foster's conservative social views appear particularly in ''The Corinna of England, and a Heroine in the Shade'' (1809), in which retribution is wreaked on a shallowly portrayed version of the French author [[Germaine de Staël]]'s heroine of that name.<ref>''Corinne, ou L'Italie'' (1807),</ref><ref name="Feminist"/> This work has also been ascribed to the another novelist active at the time, Mrs. E. G. Bayfield, perhaps through a confusion at the publisher's.<ref name="Bordoni2015">{{Cite book |editor-first=Sylvia |editor-last=Bordoni |title=The Corinna of England, or a Heroine in the Shade; A Modern Romance by E.

Foster's work largely endorses mainstream Christian morals, often taking an ironic approach through a narrator, who identifies as a woman with a proto-feminist outlook.<ref>Susan Brown, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, eds.
