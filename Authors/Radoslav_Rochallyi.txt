He debuted with the collection of poetry ''Panoptikum: Haikai no renga'' (2004), written in Japanese haiku.<ref>{{citation|last=Cifra|first=Stefan|url=https://www.spolok-slovenskych-spisovatelov.sk/products/rochallyi-radoslav/|title=Rochallyi's medallion|year=2017|publisher=Association of Slovak Writers|location=Slovakia|language=sk}}</ref>

According to Jan Balaz, the poetry of Radoslav Rochally is characterized by the use of a [[free verse]], which gives the author the necessary freedom and directness to retain the specific nature of the testimony without embellishments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baláž|first=Jan|title=Rochallyi's married poetic duo|journal=Literary Weekly|volume=32|issue=7–8| pages=17 | url=https://literarnytyzdennik.sk//wp-content//uploads//2018//11//LT-07-08-2019.pdf | year=2019|publisher=The Cultural-literary academy|location=Bratislava|issn=0862-5999|language=sk}}</ref>

According to Lenka Vrebl, the perception of Radoslav Rochallyi is not playful, it is serious, direct and focused.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vrebl|first=Lenka|title=Rochallyi's poet known and unknown. Analysis of creation|journal=Obrys-Kmen|volume=2019|issue=24| url=http://www.obrys-kmen.cz/index.php/rocnik-2019/282-24-2019-26-cervna-2019/2856-basnik-znamy-i-neznamym|location=Praha|publisher=Union of the Czech Writers|issn=1210-1494|language=cs}}</ref>

In the field of philosophy of poetry, he was influenced by the work of physicist [[Max Tegmark]] and mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]. In the field of creation, he was shaped by the works of early experimental avant-garde artists (painters and poets).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pw.org/directory/writers/radoslav_rochallyi |title=Poets & Writers Directory › Radoslav Rochallyi |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=[[Poets & Writers]] |publisher=Poets & Writers, Inc. |access-date=2020-11-26|location=USA}}</ref>

In the DNA-Canvases of Poetry collection he uses mathematical equations to express his poetry.<ref>

In the Punch collection, he uses poems based on mathematics, especially on mathematical equations. Both the texts and the equations are based on the author’s need to divide the text into a semantically and formally clear form. This work does not belong to [[Concrete poetry|concrete]], [[Pattern poem|pattern]], graphic, [[Code poetry|code]], FIB, or [[visual poetry]]. It is an alternative approach to creation.<ref>

By Andrea Schmidt Rochallyi be able to find a bearable relationship between the mathematical formalism and freedom. Schmidt argues that his poetry is a critique of semantics and language as such. Schmidt, in a review in the [[Rain Taxi]], writes that PUNCH can be considered one of the most important works of experimental poetry in the last decade. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Andrea Schmidt |date=2021 |title=PUNCH|url=https://www.raintaxi.com/punch/ |journal= [[Rain Taxi]]  |issue=Summer 2021 |oclc=939786025 |issn=1943-4383|publisher=Rain Taxi, Inc.|location=Minneapolis, USA}}</ref>

[[Steven J Fowler]] in an annotation to the book # Mathaeata wrote that Rochallyi builds poetry in mathematical terms, situating a droll humour laced with Nietzchean declaration within the context of brilliantly innovative visual design. <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCWNzgEACAAJ |title=# Mathaeata |last=Fowler |first=Steven J |date=2021 |publisher= |isbn=9788097373719 |access-date=2021-11-01 |quote=}}</ref> 

== Golden Ratio Poetry ==	


Rochallyi uses an experimental poetic form of the golden ratio. It follows a strict structure based on the golden number 1.618033 in syllables. Typically represented in the form of six lines, 1/6/1/8 / (0) / 3/3 - with so many words or syllables on the line that correspond to the golden number. The only limitation of poetry according to the golden number is the number of words or syllables followed by the sequence number 1.618033. The Greek letter Phi represents the [[golden ratio]]. Its value is 1.618034. In Golden Divine collection (2015), he tried to link poetry with Fi (φ) and hence the number 1,618034 in non-graphical form and with a golden section in its graphic form.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vrebl|first=Lenka|title=Rochallyi's poet known and unknown. Analysis of creation|journal=Obrys-Kmen|volume=2019|issue=24| url=http://www.obrys-kmen.cz/index.php/rocnik-2019/282-24-2019-26-cervna-2019/2856-basnik-znamy-i-neznamym|location=Praha|publisher=Union of the Czech Writers|issn=1210-1494|language=cs}}</ref>
Schmidt argues that his Golden Divine is a prototype of formal fundamentalism in poetry, employing a restriction according to the Greek letter phi. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Andrea Schmidt |date=2021 |title=PUNCH|url=https://www.raintaxi.com/punch/ |journal= [[Rain Taxi]]  |issue=Summer 2021 |oclc=939786025 |issn=1943-4383|publisher=Rain Taxi, Inc.|location=Minneapolis, USA}}</ref>

== Equation Poetry ==	


Equation Poetry uses mathematical language as an organizational principle and at the same time uses mathematical symbols to describe intonation notation (for example, nervous³), or to define various types of specifications that are simpler or more efficient to express in non-text form. Rochallyi claims that every formal rule in poetry is a mathematical rule. This restriction defines the form of poetry. Hence, it can be said that (almost) no form of poetry can do without mathematics. <ref>{{cite web

Combining the two is completely natural, as is reading and studying their patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rochallyi |first=Radoslav |date=2021 |editor= Mary Crockett Hill |title= 3 poems |url= https://www.roanokereview.org/2021-issue|language= en|journal= [[Roanoke Review]] |publisher=Roanoke College |issue= 2021 |issn= 0035-7367}}</ref>

Rochallyi claim that the ambition of Equation Poetry should not be to preserve the meaning of the equation, but to preserve the form, formula and symmetry as accurately as possible. <ref>{{cite book

In such a case, we would not even be making poetry because the resulting poem would be a cluster of precisely positioned words, but without the general meaning. And we wouldn't be creating anything mathematical either; the resulting equation would simply not make sense.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rochallyi |first=Radoslav |date=2021-10-27 |editor1-last= Sulej|editor1-first= Peter |title= Rovnicová poézia |trans-title= Equation Poetry|url= https://www.vlna.sk/vlna-88-s-temou-cas/|language= sk|journal= Vlna |volume= 88|issue= 2021 |pages=120 |issn= 1335-5341 |oclc= 45012887}}</ref>
