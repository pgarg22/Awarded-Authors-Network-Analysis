'''İlhan Berk''' (18 November 1918 – 28 August 2008) was a leading [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[poet]]. He was a dominant figure in the [[postmodern]] current in [[Turkish poetry]] (termed, "İkinci Yeni"; ''"The second new generation"'') and was very influential among Turkish literary circles.<ref>{{cite web|title=İlhan Berk'i kaybettik (Ilhan Berk passes away'')|url=http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer/clusteredition/tr/20080828,vatanim-7c293762c866edfe6c9b48eafe641d22.html#related_en.|publisher=Europe Media Monitor News Brief|date=2008-08-28|language=tr|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722100510/http://emm.newsexplorer.eu/NewsExplorer/clusteredition/tr/20080828,vatanim-7c293762c866edfe6c9b48eafe641d22.html|archive-date=2012-07-22}}</ref>

==Biography==
Berk was born in [[Manisa]], [[Turkey]] in 1918 and as a child witnessed the [[Fire of Manisa]]. He received a teacher's training in [[Balıkesir]]. He graduated from the [[French Language]] Department of [[Gazi University]] in [[Ankara]]. Between 1945 and 1955, Berk served as a teacher. He later began to work for the publishing office of [[Ziraat Bank]] as a translator (1956–1969). He became specialized in translation of poetry notably by translating into Turkish works by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Ezra Pound]]. In his later years, Berk resided in [[Bodrum]] where he died on 28 August 2008.

==Poetry==
Berk's poetry evolved from the approach of an epical [[socialist]] to the dreamy vision of a lyrical and erotic individual. He made the "object" visible in its glory and aimed to break down the meaning. Berk's poetry takes its roots from the [[mythology]], and a synthesis of Western and Eastern poetry traditions, yet he accomplishes to create a unique and postmodern approach. [[Peter Riley]], in an analysis of Berk's work published in [[The Fortnightly Review]], suggests the poet sometimes "runs poetry itself to an extremity at which it can no longer function as language."<ref>The Fortnightly Review http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2016/06/ilhan-berk/</ref>

History, geography, visual arts, cities such as [[Istanbul]], [[Paris]] and Ankara, feed Berk's poetry and, his themes are supported by a sizable vocabulary that includes colloquial words as well as very specific ones, such as musical terms and local names of plants.

A significant body of Berk's work is now available in [[English language|English]], most notably ''A Leaf About To Fall: Selected Poems'' (2006), ''Madrigals'' (2008), ''The Book of Things'' (2009) and ''New selected poems 1947-2008'' (2016); all translated by [[George Messo]].
