Belloc was also an orator, poet, sailor, [[satirist]], writer of letters, soldier, and political activist. His [[Catholic faith]] had a strong impact on his works.

Belloc became a [[naturalised]] British subject in 1902 while retaining his French citizenship.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27421 |date=1 April 1902 |page=2234}}</ref>He served as President of the [[Oxford Union]] and later [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Salford South (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford South]] from 1906 to 1910. Belloc was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds.

Belloc's writings encompassed religious poetry and comic verse for children. His widely sold ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]'' included "Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion" and "Matilda, who told lies and was burned to death".<ref>[http://www.poetry-archive.com/b/matilda.html "Matilda,"] 1907, in the ''Poetry Archive''.</ref> He wrote historical biographies and numerous travel works, including ''The Path to Rome'' (1902).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11814265|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985–1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=43|oclc=11814265}}</ref> He also collaborated with [[G.

== Family and career ==
[[File:Hilaire Belloc Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hilaire Belloc portrait, {{circa}}&nbsp;1903]]

=== Family ===
Belloc was born in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]], France to a French father, Louis Belloc (1830–1872) and an English mother. His sister [[Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes]] also became a writer.

Belloc's mother [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] (1829–1925) was a writer, activist and an advocate for women's equality, a co-founder of the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'' and the [[Langham Place Group]]. As an adult, Belloc campaigned against women's suffrage as a member of the [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]]. 

Belloc's maternal grandfather was [[Joseph Parkes]] (1796–1865). Belloc's grandmother, Elizabeth Rayner Priestley (1797–1877), was born in the United States, a granddaughter of [[Joseph Priestley]].  

In 1867, Parkes married attorney Louis Belloc, son of [[Jean-Hilaire Belloc]]. In 1872, five years after they wed, Louis died but not before being wiped out financially in a stock market crash. The young widow then brought her children back to England.

=== Early life ===
Belloc grew up in England; his boyhood was spent in [[Slindon]], Sussex.  He wrote about his home in poems such as  "West Sussex Drinking Song", "The South Country", and  "Ha'nacker Mill". After graduating from [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[The Oratory School|Oratory School]] in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham,  In 1890, Belloc met Elodie Hogan, an American living in [[Northern California]]. 

Belloc served his term of [[military service]], as a French citizen, with an artillery regiment near [[Toul]] in 1891.<ref>Brickel, Alfred G. [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic47philuoft#page/154/mode/2up "Hilaire Belloc and Cardinal Newman,"] ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review,'' Vol. XLVII, N°.185, 1922.</ref> He proceeded to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], as a history scholar, securing a [[first-class honours]] degree in 1895.  Belloc would later write in a poem "Balliol made me, Balliol fed me/ Whatever I had she gave me again".

=== Later years ===
Belloc traveled to the United States to visit Hogan. An athletic man who walked extensively in Britain and Europe, Belloc walked a significant part of the distance from the [[American Midwest]] to Hogan's home in [[California]]. While walking, he paid for lodging at remote farm houses and ranches by sketching the owners and reciting poetry. The couple married in 1896.

In 1906, Belloc purchased land and a house called King's Land at [[Shipley, West Sussex|Shipley]] in the United Kingdom. The couple had five children before Hogan's death in 1914 from [[influenza]]. Belloc wore mourning garb for the rest of his life and kept her room as she had left it.<ref>''The Point'' (August 1958).</ref> His son Louis was killed in 1918 while serving in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in northern France. Belloc placed a memorial tablet at the nearby [[Cambrai Cathedral]]. It is in the same side chapel as the [[icon]] Our Lady of Cambrai.

On 2 April 1941, Belloc's son Peter Gilbert Marie Sebastian Belloc died at age 36 of [[pneumonia]]. He fell ill while on active service with the 5th Battalion, [[Royal Marines]] in [[Scotland]]. He is buried in [[West Grinstead]] at Our Lady of Consolation and St. Francis churchyard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2723988/belloc,-peter-gilbert-marie-sebastian/|title=Casualty Record – Peter Gilbert Marie Sebastian Belloc|website=Commonwealth War Graves Commission}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=THE LIFE OF HILAIRE BELLOC|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofhilairebel00spea|last=SPEAIGHT|first=ROBERT|publisher=FARRAR, STRAUS & CUDAHY|year=1957|location=NEW YORK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifeofhilairebel00spea/page/522 522]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeofhilairebel00spea/lifeofhilairebel00spea_djvu.txt|title=THE LIFE OF HILAIRE BELLOC|website=Archive.org|year=1957}}</ref>

In 1937, Belloc was invited to be a visiting professor at [[Fordham University]] in New York City by university president Robert Gannon. Belloc delivered a series of lectures at Fordham which he completed in May of that year. While pleased to accept the invitation, the experience left him physically exhausted and he considered stopping the lectures early.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/5332/New_history_describes_founding_rise_and_secularization_of_Fordham_University.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202459/http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/5332/New_history_describes_founding_rise_and_secularization_of_Fordham_University.aspx |archive-date=25 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/%E2%80%98-catholic-room|title='A Catholic in the Room' - Commonweal Magazine|website=Commonwealmagazine.org|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Death and legacy ===
In 1941, Belloc suffered a [[stroke]] and never recovered from its effects. In the same year, he also suffered burns and shock after falling on his fireplace. He died on 16 July 1953 at Mount Alvernia Nursing Home in Guildford, Surrey.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 5|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=30|isbn=0-19-861355-5}}Article by Bernard Berganzi.</ref> 

Belloc was buried at the [[Shrine Church of Our Lady of Consolation and St Francis]] at [[West Grinstead]], where he had regularly attended Mass as a parishioner.<ref>Belloc's entry in Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6884181/hilaire-belloc</ref> His estate was [[probate]]d at [[pound sterling|£]]7,451. At his funeral Mass, homilist Monsignor [[Ronald Knox]] observed, "No man of his time fought so hard for the good things". Boys from the Choir and Sacristy of Worth Preparatory School sang and served at the Mass.

Recent biographies of Belloc have been written by [[A. N. Wilson]] and [[Joseph Pearce]]. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] political philosopher [[James V. Schall|James Schall]]'s ''Remembering Belloc'' was published by St. Augustine Press in September 2013. A memoir<ref>"My Memory of Hilaire Belloc," The Irish Monthly, Vol. 81, No. 962, Oct. 1953</ref> of Belloc was written by [[Henry Edward George Rope]].

===Political career===
At Balliol College,  Belloc served as President of the Oxford Union. He went into politics after he became a naturalised British subject. A great disappointment in his life was his failure to gain a [[fellow]]ship of [[All Souls College]], Oxford in 1895. This failure may have been caused in part by his producing a small statue of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and placing it before him on the table during the interview for the fellowship.

From 1906 to 1910, Belloc was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Salford South (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford South]]. During one campaign speech, he was asked by a heckler if he was a "[[papist]]." Retrieving his [[rosary]] from his pocket, he responded:
<blockquote>"Gentlemen, I am a Catholic. As far as possible, I go to Mass every day. This [taking a rosary out of his pocket] is a rosary. As far as possible, I kneel down and tell these beads every day. If you reject me on account of my religion, I shall thank God that He has spared me the indignity of being your representative."<ref>Hilaire Belloc: Speech to voters of South Salford (1906), quoted in Robert Speaight, The Life of Hilaire Belloc (London: Hollis & Carter, 1957), p. 204</ref> </blockquote>The crowd cheered and Belloc won the election.

Belloc's only period of steady employment after that was from 1914 to 1920 as editor of ''[[Land and Water]]''. Otherwise he lived by his writing and was often financially insecure.

===In controversy and debate===

Belloc first came to public attention shortly after arriving at Balliol College, Oxford as a recent French army veteran. Attending his first debate of the [[Oxford Union]] Debating Society, he saw that the affirmative position was wretchedly and half-heartedly defended. As the debate drew to its conclusion and the division of the house was called, he rose from his seat in the audience, and delivered a vigorous, impromptu defence of the proposition. Belloc won that debate from the audience, as the division of the house then showed, and his reputation as a debater was established. He was later elected president of the Union. He held his own in debates there with [[F. E. Smith]] and [[John Buchan]], the latter a friend.<ref>Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], who was a contemporary at Oxford, described his "...resonant, deep pitched voice..." as making an "...unforgettable impression".</ref><ref>Francis West, ''Gilbert Murray'', p. 107, describes [[Gilbert Murray|Murray]]'s impression on an occasion in 1899: ''In July [...] [Murray] attended a meeting on the principles of Liberalism, at which Hilaire Belloc spoke brilliantly although Murray could not afterwards remember a word that he had said.''</ref>

In the 1920s, Belloc attacked [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Outline of History]]''.  Belloc criticised what he termed Wells' secular bias and his belief in [[evolution by means of natural selection]], a theory that Belloc asserted had been completely discredited. Wells remarked that "Debating Mr. Belloc is like arguing with a hailstorm". Belloc's review of ''Outline of History'' observed that Wells' book was a powerful and well-written volume, "up until the appearance of Man, that is, somewhere around page seven". Wells responded with a small book, ''Mr. Belloc Objects''.<ref>Wells, H. G., ''Mr. Belloc Objects, to the Outline of History'', Watts & Company, London, 1926.</ref> Not to be outdone, Belloc followed with, "Mr. Belloc Still Objects".

[[G. G. Coulton]] wrote ''Mr. Belloc on Medieval History'' in a 1920 article. After a long simmering feud, Belloc replied with a booklet, ''The Case of Dr. Coulton'', in 1938.

Belloc's style during later life fulfilled the nickname he received in childhood, ''Old Thunder''. Belloc's friend, [[Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]], described his provocative personality in a preface to ''The Cruise of the Nona.''<ref> ''Time and again I have seen him throw out a sufficiently outrageous theory in order to stimulate his company, and, be it said, for the pleasure of seeing how slowly he might be dislodged from a position he had purposely taken up knowing it to be untenable.... Of course Belloc was prejudiced, but there were few who knew him who did not love his prejudices, who did not love to hear him fight for them, and who did not honor him for the sincerity and passion with which he held to them. Once the battle was joined all his armoury was marshalled and flung into the fray. Dialectic, Scorn, Quip, Epigram, Sarcasm, Historical Evidence, Massive Argument, and Moral Teaching --of all these weapons he was a past master and each was mobilised and made to play its proper part in the attack. Yet he was a courteous and a chivalrous man. A deeply sensitive man, his was the kindest and most understanding nature I have ever known. In spite of a rollicking and bombastic side he was as incapable of the least cruelty as he was capable of the most delicate sympathy with other people's feelings. As he himself used to say of others in a curiously quiet and simple way, "He is a good man. He will go to Heaven".''</ref>

===Hobbies===
During his later years, Belloc would sail when he could afford to do so and became a well-known [[yachtsman]]. He won many races and was on the French sailing team. 

In the early 1930s, he was given an old pilot [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] called ''Jersey''. He sailed this for some years around the coasts of England, with the help of younger men. One sailor, Dermod MacCarthy, wrote a book about it, called ''Sailing with Mr Belloc''.<ref>Sailing with Mr Belloc by Dermod MacCarthy : Vintage/Ebury (A Division of Random House Group), 20 October 1986 (reprint) : {{ISBN|9780002727754}} / 0002727757</ref>

== Writing ==
{{see also|Hilaire Belloc bibliography}}

Belloc wrote over 150 books,<ref>Michael H. Markel, ''Hilaire Belloc'', Twayne Publishers (1975), p. 34</ref><ref>David Perkins, ''A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode'', Harvard University Press (1976), p. 192</ref> The subjects ranged from warfare to poetry to the many current topics of his day. He has been called one of the Big Four of Edwardian Letters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7490 |title=Hilaire Belloc |website=Poetryarchive.org |access-date=2017-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521214852/http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7490 |archive-date=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> along with [[H. G. Wells]], George Bernard Shaw, and [[G. K. Chesterton]], all of whom debated with each other into the 1930s. Belloc was closely associated with Chesterton, and Shaw coined the term "Chesterbelloc" for their partnership. Belloc was co-editor with [[Cecil Chesterton]] of the literary periodical the [[G. K.'s Weekly|''Eye-Witness'']],

Asked once why he wrote so much,<ref>See [[Hilaire Belloc's books]] for a chronological list of work by Belloc</ref> Belloc responded, "Because my children are howling for pearls and caviar." Belloc observed that "The first job of letters is to get a canon," that is, to identify those works a writer sees as exemplary of the best of prose and verse. For his own prose style, he claimed to aspire to be as clear and concise as "[[Mary had a little lamb]]."

===Essays and travel writing===

In 1902, Belloc published ''The Path to Rome'' (1902), an account of a walking pilgrimage from Central France across the Alps to Rome,. ''The Path to Rome'' contains descriptions of the people and places he encountered, his drawings in pencil and in ink of the route, humour, poesy. In 1909, Belloc published ''The [[Pyrenees]]'', providing many details of that region. 

As an essayist he was one of a small,  group (with Chesterton, [[E. V. Lucas]] and [[Robert Wilson Lynd|Robert Lynd]]) of popular writers.

===Poetry===
[[File:CautionaryTales-Belloc-Blackwell-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Original cover for ''Cautionary Tales for Children'', illustrated by Basil T. Blackwood]]
His ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]'', humorous poems with an implausible moral, illustrated by [[Basil Temple Blackwood]] (signing as "B.T.B.") and later by [[Edward Gorey]], are the most widely known of his writings.<ref>Vogel, James. [http://www.crisismagazine.com/2012/hilaire-belloc-cautionary-tales-and-bad-childs-book-of-beasts "Hilaire Belloc, Cautionary Tales and Bad Child’s Book of Beasts,"] ''Crisis Magazine,'' 29 March 2012.</ref> Supposedly for children, they, like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s works, are more to adult and satirical tastes: "Henry King, Who chewed bits of string and was early cut off in dreadful agonies".<ref>''The Chief Defect of Henry King''
:''Was chewing little bits of String.''
:''At last he swallowed some which tied''
:''Itself in ugly Knots inside.''
:''Physicians of the Utmost Fame''
:''Were called at once; but when they came''
:''They answered, as they took their Fees,''
:''"There is no Cure for this Disease.''
:''Henry will very soon be dead."''
:''His Parents stood about his Bed''
:''Lamenting his Untimely Death,''
:''When Henry, with his Latest Breath,''
:''Cried – "Oh, my Friends, be warned by me,''
:''That Breakfast, Dinner, Lunch and Tea''
:''Are all the Human Frame Requires..."''
:''With that the Wretched Child expires.''</ref> A similar poem tells the story of "Rebecca, who slammed doors for fun and perished miserably".

The tale of "Matilda who told lies and was burned to death" was adapted into the play ''Matilda Liar!'' by [[Debbie Isitt]]. [[Quentin Blake]], the illustrator, described Belloc as at one and the same time the overbearing adult and mischievous child. [[Roald Dahl]] was a follower. But Belloc has broader if sourer scope. For example, with Lord Lundy (who was "far too freely moved to Tears"):

:''It happened to Lord Lundy then''
:''as happens to so many men''
:''about the age of 26''
:''they shoved him into politics ...''

leading up to

:''"we had intended you to be''
:''the next Prime Minister but three...''

instead, Lundy is condemned to the ultimate political wilderness:

:''...The stocks were sold; the Press was squared:''
:''The Middle Class was quite prepared.''
:''But as it is! . . . My language fails!''
:''Go out and govern New South Wales!"''

:''The Aged Patriot groaned and died:''
:''And gracious! how Lord Lundy cried!''

Of more weight is Belloc's ''Sonnets and Verse'', a volume that deploys the same singing and rhyming techniques of his children's verses. Belloc's poetry is often religious, often romantic; throughout ''The Path to Rome'' he writes in spontaneous song.

===History, politics, economics===
[[File:Portrait of Hilaire Belloc.jpg|thumb|upright|Hilaire Belloc portrait by Emil Otto Hoppé, 1915]]
Three of his best-known non-fiction works are ''[[The Servile State]]'' (1912), ''Europe and Faith'' (1920) and ''The Jews'' (1922).

From an early age Belloc knew Cardinal [[Henry Edward Manning]], who was responsible for the conversion of his mother to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].  In ''The Cruise of the "Nona"'' (1925), he mentions a "profound thing" that Manning said to him when he was just twenty years old: "''All human conflict is ultimately theological.''" What Manning meant, Belloc explains, is "that all wars and revolutions, and all decisive struggles between parties of men arise from a difference in moral and transcendental doctrine."<ref>''The Cruise of the "Nona"''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1958, p. 48.</ref> Belloc adds that he never met any man, "arguing for what should be among men, but took for granted as he argued that the doctrine he consciously or unconsciously accepted was or should be a similar foundation for all mankind. Hence battle."<ref>''The Cruise of the "Nona"''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 49.</ref> Manning's involvement in the 1889 [[London Dock Strike of 1889|London Dock Strike]] made a major impression on Belloc and his view of politics, according to biographer [[Robert Speaight]]. He became a trenchant critic both of [[capitalism]]<ref>[[Raymond Williams]], ''Culture and Society'', p. 186: ''Belloc's argument is that capitalism as a system is breaking down, and that this is to be welcomed. A society in which a minority owns and controls the means of production, while the majority are reduced to proletarian status, is not only wrong but unstable. Belloc sees it breaking down in two ways – on the one hand into State action for welfare (which pure capitalism cannot embody); on the other hand into monopoly and the restraint of trade. There are only two alternatives to this system: socialism, which Belloc calls collectivism; and the redistribution of property on a significant scale, which Belloc calls distributivism.''</ref> and of many aspects of [[socialism]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/socialismservile00bell#page/n1/mode/2up ''Socialism and the Servile State: A Debate between Hilaire Belloc and J. Ramsay MacDonald,''] South West London Federation of the Independent Labour, 1911.</ref>

With others ([[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Cecil Chesterton]], [[Arthur Penty]]) Belloc had envisioned the socioeconomic system of [[distributism]]. In ''The Servile State'', written after his party-political career had come to an end, and other works, he criticised the modern economic order and parliamentary system, advocating distributism in opposition to both capitalism and socialism. Belloc made the historical argument that distributism was not a fresh perspective or program of economics but rather a proposed return to the economics that prevailed in Europe for the thousand years when it was Catholic. He called for the dissolution of Parliament and its replacement with committees of representatives for the various sectors of society, an idea that was also popular among [[Fascists]], under the name of [[corporatism]].

He contributed an article on "Land-Tenure in the Christian Era" to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oZQuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA10&dq=William+Francis+Barry+%2B+Catholic+Encyclopedia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj78ObKp9LgAhWsiOAKHbb-BNoQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=W.H.%20Grattan%20Flood&f=false Belloc, Hilaire Joseph Peter", ''The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers'', New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 12]{{PD-notice}}</ref>

With these linked themes in the background, he wrote a long series of contentious biographies of historical figures, including [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[James II of England|James II]], and [[Napoleon]]. They show him as an ardent proponent of orthodox Catholicism and a critic of many elements of the modern world.

Outside academe, Belloc was impatient with what he considered axe-grinding histories, especially what he called "official history."<ref>''There is an enormous book called volume 1 of A Cambridge History of the Middle Ages. It is 759 pages in length of close print.... It does not mention the Mass once. That is as though you were to write a history of the Jewish dispersion without mentioning the synagogue or of the British empire without mentioning the city of London or the Navy'' (''Letters from Hilaire Belloc'', Hollis and Carter, 75).</ref> Joseph Pearce notes also Belloc's attack on the [[secularism]] of H. G. Wells's popular ''[[The Outline of History|Outline of History]]'':

<blockquote>Belloc objected to his adversary's tacitly anti-Christian stance, epitomized by the fact that Wells had devoted more space in his "history" to the Persian campaign against the Greeks than he had given to the figure of Christ.</blockquote>

He wrote also substantial amounts of military history. In [[alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]], he contributed to the 1931 collection ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' edited by [[Sir John Squire]].

===Reprints===
[[Ignatius Press]] of California and [[IHS Press]] of Virginia have reissued Belloc. [[TAN Books]] of Charlotte, North Carolina, publishes a number of Belloc's works, particularly his historical writings.

==Religion==
[[File:Hilaire Belloc (side view, 1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hilaire Belloc portrait, 1910]]
One of Belloc's most famous statements was "the faith is Europe and Europe is the faith";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/europeandfaith01bellgoog |title=Europe and the Faith ... : Hilaire Belloc : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref> Those views were expressed in many of his works from the period 1920–40. These are still cited as exemplary of Catholic [[apologetics]]. They have also been criticised, for instance by comparison with the work of [[Christopher Dawson]] during the same period.

As a young man, Belloc moved away from Catholicism. However, he later stated that a spiritual event, which he never discussed publicly, prompted his return to it..{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Belloc alludes to this return to Catholicism in a passage in ''The Cruise of the Nona''. 

According to his biographer A. N. Wilson (''Hilaire Belloc'', Hamish Hamilton), Belloc never wholly apostatised from the Faith (ibid p.&nbsp;105). The momentous event is fully described by Belloc in ''The Path to Rome'' (pp.&nbsp;158–61). It took place in the French village of [[Undervelier]] at the time of [[Vespers]].  Belloc said of it, "not without tears", "I considered the nature of Belief" and "it is a good thing not to have to return to the Faith". (See ''Hilaire Belloc'' by Wilson at pp.&nbsp;105–06.) Belloc believed that the Catholic Church provided hearth and home for the human spirit.<ref>A.N. Wilson's Introduction to Belloc's ''Complete Verse'', Pimlico, 1991.</ref> More humorously, his tribute to Catholic culture can be understood from his well-known saying, "Wherever the Catholic sun does shine, there's always laughter and good red wine."

Belloc had a disparaging view of the [[Church of England]], and used sharp words to describe heretics, such as, "Heretics all, whoever you may be/ In Tarbes or Nimes or over the sea/ You never shall have good words from me/ Caritas non-conturbat me". Indeed, in his "Song of the [[Pelagian]] Heresy" he described how the Bishop of [[Auxerre]], "with his stout Episcopal staff/ So thoroughly thwacked and banged/ The heretics all, both short and tall/ They rather had been hanged".

Belloc sent his son Louis to [[Downside School]] 1911–1915. Louis's biography and death in August 1918 is recorded in "Downside and the War".

Belloc's 1937 book ''The Crusades: the World's Debate'', he wrote, {{quote|The story must not be neglected by any modern, who may think in error that the East has finally fallen before the West, that Islam is now enslaved — to our political and economic power at any rate if not to our philosophy. It is not so. Islam essentially survives, and Islam would not have survived had the Crusade made good its hold upon the essential point of Damascus. Islam survives. Its religion is intact; therefore its material strength may return. ''Our'' religion is in peril, and who can be confident in the continued skill, let alone the continued obedience, of those who make and work our machines?&nbsp;... There is with us a complete chaos in religious doctrine.... We worship ourselves, we worship the nation; or we worship (some few of us) a particular economic arrangement believed to be the satisfaction of social justice.... Islam has not suffered this spiritual decline; and in the contrast between [our religious chaos and Islam's] religious certitudes still strong throughout the Mohammedan world lies our peril.<ref>''The Crusades: the World's Debate,'' Bruce Publishing Company, 1937, p. 8.</ref>}}

In ''The Great Heresies'' (1938), Belloc argued that although "Muslim culture happens to have fallen back in material applications; there is no reason whatever why it should not learn its new lesson and become our equal in all those temporal things which now ''alone'' give us our superiority over it—whereas in ''Faith'' we have fallen inferior to it."<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/HERESY4.TXT  ''The Great Heresies'', Ch. 4], "The Great and Enduring Heresy of Mohammed."</ref>

Belloc continued:

{{quote|It has always seemed to me possible, and even probable, that there would be a resurrection of Islam and that our sons or our grandsons would see the renewal of that tremendous struggle between the Christian culture and what has been for more than a thousand years its greatest opponent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/HERESY4.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817183410/http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/HERESY4.TXT|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 August 2000|date=17 August 2000|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref>}}<blockquote>"There is no reason why its recent inferiority in mechanical construction, whether military or civilian, should continue indefinitely.  Even a slight accession of material power would make the further control of Islam by an alien culture difficult.  A little more and there will cease that which our time has taken for granted, the physical domination of Islam by the disintegrated Christendom we know."</blockquote> Belloc considered that Islam was permanently intent on destroying the Christian Faith, as well as the West, which Christendom had built. In ''The Great Heresies'', Belloc grouped the [[Protestant Reformation]] together with Islam as one of the major heresies threatening the "[[Catholic Church|Universal Church]]".

===Accusations of antisemitism===
{{further|G. K.'s Weekly}}

Belloc's writings were at times supportive of anti-Semitism and other times condemnatory of it.<ref>[http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/3280 Ian Boyd, "Hilaire Belloc: the myth and the man", ''The Tablet'', 12 July 2003]</ref>

Belloc took a leading role in denouncing the [[Marconi scandal]] of 1912. Belloc emphasized that key players in both the government and the Marconi corporation had been Jewish. American historian [[Todd Endelman]] identifies Catholic writers as central critics. In his opinion:<blockquote>The most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by Hilaire Belloc and the brothers Cecil and [[G.K. Chesterton]], whose hostility to Jews was linked to their opposition to [[liberalism]], their backward-looking Catholicism, and the nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous. The Jew baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and their challenges to what were seen as traditional English values.<ref>{{cite book|author=Todd M. Endelman|title=The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMOQkrUtqkwC&pg=PR9|year=2002|page=9|isbn=9780520227194}}</ref></blockquote>A. N. Wilson's biography expresses the belief that Belloc tended to allude to Jews negatively in conversation, sometimes obsessively. [[Anthony Powell]] mentions in his review of that biography that in his view Belloc was thoroughly anti-Semitic, at all but a personal level.

In ''The Cruise of the Nona'', Belloc reflected equivocally on the [[Dreyfus Affair]] after thirty years.<ref>''I, for my part, pretend to no certain conclusion in the matter… Of my own intimate acquaintance who were on the spot [at Dreyfus' trial] and competent to judge, most were for the innocence of Dreyfus: but the rest, fully competent also, were and are, convinced of his guilt… There are in England to-day two Englishmen whose wide knowledge of Europe and especially of Paris, and the French tongue and society, enable them to judge. They are both close friends of mine. One is for, the other against… I believe that, when the passions have died down, the Dreyfus case will remain for history very much what the Diamond Necklace has remained, or the [[Tichborne case]]; that is, there will be a popular legend, intellectually worth nothing; and, for the historian, the task of criticising that legend, but hardly of solving the problem.''</ref> Norman Rose's book ''The [[Cliveden Set]]'' (2000) asserts that Belloc 'was moved by a deep vein of hysterical anti-semitism'.<blockquote>In his 1922 book, ''The Jews'', Belloc argued that "the continued presence of the Jewish nation intermixed with other nations alien to it presents a permanent problem of the gravest character," and that the "Catholic Church is the conservator of an age-long European tradition, and that tradition will never compromise with the fiction that a Jew can be other than a Jew. Wherever the Catholic Church has power, and in proportion to its power, the Jewish problem will be recognized to the full."<ref>Belloc, Hilaire, The Jews, London: Constable, 1922, 3–5, 209–210.</ref></blockquote>[[Robert Speaight]] cited a letter by Belloc in which he condemned [[Nesta Webster]] because of her accusations against "the Jews". In February 1924, Belloc wrote to an American Jewish friend regarding an anti-Semitic book by Webster. Webster had rejected Christianity, studied [[Eastern religions]], accepted the supposed [[Hindu]] concept of the equality of all religions and was fascinated by theories of [[reincarnation]] and ancestral memory.<ref>Nesta Webster, ''Spacious Days'', London and [[Bombay]], 1950, pp. 103 and 172–5.</ref><ref>{{quote|In my opinion it is a lunatic book. She is one of those people who have got one cause on the brain. It is the good old 'Jewish revolutionary' bogey. But there is a type of unstable mind which cannot rest without morbid imaginings, and the conception of a single cause simplifies thought. With this good woman it is the [[Jews]], with some people it is the [[Jesuits]], with others [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and so on. The world is more complex than that. R. Speaight, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeofhilairebel009626mbp The Life Of Hilaire Belloc]'', 1957, pp. 456–8.}}</ref> Speaight also points out that when faced with anti-Semitism in practice—as at elitist country clubs in the United States before [[World War II]]—he voiced his disapproval. Belloc also condemned [[Nazism|Nazi]] anti-Semitism in ''The Catholic and the War'' (1940).<ref>{{quote|The Third Reich has treated its Jewish subjects with a contempt for Justice which even if there had been no other action of the kind in other departments would be a sufficient warranty for determining its elimination from Europe.... Cruelty to a Jew is as odious as cruelty to any human being, whether that cruelty be moral in the form of insult, or physical.... You may hear men saying on every side, 'However, there is one thing I do agree with and that is the way they (The Nazis) have settled the Jews'. Now that attitude is directly immoral. The more danger there is that it will grow the more necessity there is for denouncing it. The action of the enemy toward the Jewish race has been in morals intolerable. Contracts have been broken on all sides, careers destroyed by the hundred and the thousand, individuals have been treated with the most hideous and disgusting cruelty.... If no price is paid for such excesses, our civilisation will certainly suffer and suffer permanently. If the men who have committed them go unpunished (and only defeat in war can punish them) then the decline of Europe, already advanced, will proceed to catastrophe. (pp. 29ff.)}}</ref>

==Sussex==
Belloc grew up in Slindon and spent most of his life in [[West Sussex]]. He always wrote of Sussex as if it were the crown of England and the western [[Sussex Downs]] the jewel in that crown.<ref name="Sx">{{cite book|last= Brandon|first=Peter|title=Sussex|publisher=Phillimore & Co Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7090-6998-0}}</ref> He loved Sussex as the place where he was brought up, considering it his earthly "spiritual home".<ref name="Sx"/> 

Belloc wrote several works about Sussex including ''Ha'nacker Mill'', ''The South Country'', the travel guide ''Sussex'' (1906) and ''The County of Sussex'' (1936). One of his best-known works relating to Sussex is ''[[The Four Men: a Farrago]]'' (1911), in which the four characters, each aspects of Belloc's personality,<ref name="BapByBeer">{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/ae/books/review.php?id=44663&page=1|title=Baptism by Beer: Hilaire Belloc's The Four Men: A Farrago|publisher=Catholic Online|access-date=29 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="CRdr-FourMen">{{cite web|url=http://acommonreader.org/the-four-men-hilaire-belloc/|title=Review: The Four Men – Hilaire Belloc|publisher=A Common Reader|access-date=29 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530173710/http://acommonreader.org/the-four-men-hilaire-belloc/|archive-date=30 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> travel on a pilgrimage across the county from [[Robertsbridge]] to [[Harting]].<ref name="CRdr-FourMen" /> The work has influenced others including musician [[Bob Copper]], who retraced Belloc's steps in the 1980s.<ref name="CRdr-FourMen" /> 

Belloc was also a lover of [[Music of Sussex|Sussex songs]]<ref name="SxPeople">{{cite book|last=Hare|first=Chris|title=A History of the Sussex People|publisher=Southern Heritage Books|location=Worthing|year=1995|isbn=978-0-9527097-0-1}}</ref> and wrote lyrics for some songs which have since been put to music.<ref name="SxPeople" /> Belloc is remembered in an annual celebration in Sussex, known as Belloc Night, that takes place on the writer's birthday, 27 July, in the manner of [[Burns Night]] in Scotland.<ref name="WtgDnlanders">{{cite web|url=http://www.worthingdownlanders.org.uk/events.htm|title=Worthing Downlander Events 2012|publisher=Worthing Downlanders|access-date=29 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721170414/http://www.worthingdownlanders.org.uk/events.htm|archive-date=21 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The celebration includes reading from Belloc's work and partaking of a bread and cheese supper with pickles.<ref name="WtgDnlanders" />

==In the media==
* [[Stephen Fry]] has recorded an audio collection of Belloc's children's poetry.
* The composer [[Peter Warlock]] set many Belloc s poems to music.
* [[Peter Ustinov]] recorded Belloc's ''The Cautionary Tales'' in 1968 for the [[Musical Heritage Society]] (MHC 9249M).
* A well-known parody of Belloc by [[Sir John Squire]], intended as a tribute, is ''Mr. Belloc's Fancy''.
* [[Syd Barrett]] was a fan. His song "[[Matilda Mother]]" was drawn directly from verses in ''Cautionary Tales'', and was rewritten when Belloc's estate refused permission to record them. The Belloc version has been released on a 40th anniversary reissue of ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]''.
* [[King's Mill, Shipley]], once owned by Belloc, was used in the British TV drama ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''.
* On the second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', in the sketch "[[The Mouse Problem]]", a list of famous people who secretly were mice is concluded with "and, of course, Hilaire Belloc".
