'''Saadallah Wannous''' ({{lang-ar|سعد الله ونوس}}) (1941 – 15 May 1997) was a [[Syria]]n [[playwright]]. He was born in the village of [[Hussein al-Bahr]], near [[Tartous]], where he received his early education. He studied [[journalism]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] and later served as editor of the art and cultural sections of the Syrian paper Al-Baath and the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] ''[[As-Safir]]''. He also held for many years the directorship in the Music and Theater Administration of [[Syria]]. In the late Sixties, he traveled to [[Paris]] where he studied [[theater]] and encountered various currents, trends, and schools of European stage. His career as a playwright had begun in the early Sixties with several short (one-act) plays which were characterized by a display of his fundamental theme: the relationship between the individual and society and its authorities.

==Career==
In the late Sixties, triggered by the Arab defeat of the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] with [[Israel]], political Arabic theater was born. The defeat had resulted in the creation of a new level of awareness among artists and intellectuals, particularly toward the government-controlled [[Mass media|press]] and its infiltration of [[popular culture]]. In 1969, joined by a group of playwrights, Wannous called for an Arab Festival for Theater Arts to be hosted in [[Damascus]], later realized and attended by [[dramatist]]s from all over the [[Arab world]]. In this festival, he introduced his new project: "theater of politicization," to replace the traditional "political theater." He intended theater to play a more positive role in the process of social and political change. His other powerful plays include ''Elephant, the King of All Times'' (1969), ''The King is the King'' (1977) and ''Hanthala's Journey from Slumber to Consciousness'' (1978).

In the late Seventies, Wannous helped establish and later taught at The High Institute for Theater Arts in Damascus. He also started ''Theater Life'' magazine, of which he was [[editor-in-chief]] for years. In 1982, and in the aftermath of the Israeli siege and invasion of [[Beirut]], he lived through a period of shock, ceasing to write for a decade. Back to writing in early nineties, Wannous delivered to Arabic theater a series of plays no less political than their predecessors, starting with ''The Rape'' (1990), a play about the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. Since then, he has written ''Fragments from History'' (1994), ''Rituals of Signs and Transformations'' (1994), ''Miserable Dreams'' (1995), ''A Day of Our Time'' (1995), and finally ''Mirage Epic'' (1996).

In 1996, he was Selected by [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Institute of Theater]], to present that year's address to the world theater community during its celebration of [[International Theater Day]] on March 27. This was the first selection of an Arab writer since the organization started this tradition in 1963.

==Personal life==
His daughter [[Dima Wannous]] is a journalist, writer and novelist.

==Death==
On May 15, 1997, he died of [[cancer]], a disease he had battled for 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.damascus-online.com/se/bio/wannous,%20saadallah.htm|title=Wannous, Saadallah. The Syrian Encyclopedia, Damascus Online}}</ref>
