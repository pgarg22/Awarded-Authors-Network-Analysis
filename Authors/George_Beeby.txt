'''Sir George Stephenson Beeby''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (23 May 1869 – 18 July 1942) was an Australian politician, judge and author. He was one of the founders of the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] in [[New South Wales]], and represented the party in state parliament from 1907 to 1912. He fell out with the party and later served as an independent, a [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]], and a [[Progressive Party (1920)|Progressive]]. He left parliament in 1920 to join the state arbitration court, and in 1926 was appointed to the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]]. He was Chief Judge from 1939 until his retirement in 1941.

==Early life==
Beeby was born in [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]], Sydney, the second son of English-born Edward Augustus Beeby, a book-keeper, and his wife Isabel, née Thompson. Beeby was educated at Crown Street Public School and entered the education department of N.S.W. on 3 July 1884 where he became a pupil teacher at Macdonald Town (Erskineville) Public School. Subsequently he was an accountant, and in 1900 qualified as a solicitor. He had become interested in the land taxation proposals of [[Henry George]] in 1890 and was prominent in the beginnings of the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|New South Wales Labor Party]].<ref name=dab>{{Dictionary of Australian Biography |first=Sir George Stephenson |last=Beeby |shortlink=0-dict-biogBe-Bo.html#beeby1 |access-date=3 September 2007}}</ref><ref name=adb>{{cite AuDB |id2=beeby-sir-george-stephenson-5183 |title=Beeby, Sir George Stephenson (1869–1942) |access-date=1 April 2007 |first=Bede |last=Nairn |volume=7 |year=1979 |pages=243–246}}</ref> He stood as a Labor candidate at the [[Results of the 1894 New South Wales colonial election#Armidale|1894 election for Armidale]], but finished 3rd with a margin of 188 votes (8.8%).<ref>{{cite NSW election |year=1894 |district=Armidale |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>

Beeby worked as a journalist for a while and then began practising as a solicitor. The 1901 arbitration act brought him much business; it was stated in 1906 that his firm had been concerned in two hundred disputes. He stood as the Labour candidate at the [[Results of the 1904 New South Wales state election#Leichhardt|1904 election for Leichhardt]], but again finished 3rd.<ref>{{cite NSW election |year=1904 |district=Leichhardt |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Beeby stood as a Labor candidate for [[Electoral district of Blayney|Blayney]] at the [[1907 Blayney state by-election|by-election in January 1907]] due to the resignation of [[Paddy Crick|W. P. (Paddy) Crick]], but Beeby was defeated by 23 votes.<ref>{{cite NSW election |title=1907 Blayney by-election |year=1904 |district=Blayney_1 |access-date=2021-04-03}}</ref>

==Parliamentary career==

Beeby won the seat of Blayney for the Labor Party at the [[Results of the 1907 New South Wales state election#Blayney|1907 election]], and with [[William Holman]] was successful in considerably modifying the amending industrial disputes bill brought in by [[Charles Wade]]. When [[James McGowen]] formed the first New South Wales Labor ministry in October 1910, Beeby was appointed [[Minister of Public Instruction (New South Wales)|Minister of Public Instruction]] and [[Minister for Labour and Industry (New South Wales)|Minister for Labour and Industry]] from 21 October 1910 until 10 September 1911. There was a re-shuffle following protests at legislation on land ownership and Beeby was appointed [[Secretary for Lands (New South Wales)|Secretary for Lands]], adding the portfolio of Labour and Industry in November 1911. In December 1912 he resigned from the ministry, parliament and Labor party in protest at the power of the extra-parliamentary Labor Party executive.<ref name=adb/> He was re-elected for Blayney as an independent after a close fought [[1913 Blayney state by-election|by-election on 23 January 1913]], with a margin of 136 votes (3.2%).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15392887 |title=Mr Beeby wins exciting struggle |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 January 1913 |access-date=24 March 2019 |page=9 |via=Trove}}</ref> Prior to the [[1913 New South Wales state election|1913 state election]], he created the National Progressive Party and ran a slate of 10 candidates. Only he polled over 10 percent of the vote, winning 19.5 percent in the seat of [[Electoral district of Waverley|Waverley]]. His voters helped elected a Labor candidate in the second round. He subsequently announced that his party had failed and there was no room for a third party in New South Wales.<ref name=dab/><ref name=nsw>{{Cite NSW Parliament |name=Sir George Stephenson Beeby (1869–1942) |id=1209 |former=Yes |access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref>

Beeby had been [[called to the bar]] in 1911 and now worked up a successful practice as a [[barrister]]. When Holman formed his [[Holman Nationalist ministry|Nationalist ministry]] in November 1916 Beeby again was appointed Minister for Labour and Industry with a seat in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. In 1918 Beeby, who had in the meanwhile been elected to the assembly for [[Electoral district of Wagga Wagga|Wagga Wagga]], succeeded in passing an industrial arbitration amendment act though it was strongly opposed by the Labour party. Towards the end of 1918 he visited Britain and the United States and, shortly after his return in June 1919, resigned from the government as a protest against administrative acts in connexion with the sale of wheat and the allotting of coal contracts. He joined the [[Progressive Party (1920)|Progressive Party]] in 1920, with the introduction of [[proportional representation]] and was elected as the member for [[Electoral district of Murray|Murray]],<ref name=nsw/> with the party winning 15 seats.<ref>{{cite NSW election |year=1920 |district=Totals |title=1920 election totals |access-date=26 June 2020}}</ref>

==Judge==

In August 1920, Beeby resigned from parliament to be appointed a judge of the New South Wales arbitration court.<ref>{{cite book |title=Laying the Foundations of Industrial Justice: The Presidents of the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW, 1902-1998 |chapter=Ch 6 George Stephenson Beeby (1920-1926) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8b0NLSCSxEC&pg=PA129 |editor=Patmore, Greg |last=Taksa |first=Lucy |publisher=Federation Press |year=2003 |isbn=9781862874633}}</ref> In 1926 he became a member of the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] bench.<ref name=dab/> In the same year Beeby imposed an award favourable to the Federal Government's industrial policy which the [[Waterside Workers' Federation]] rejected. This resulted in strike action and later violence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aic.gov.au/conferences/hcpp/baker.pdf |author=David Baker |title=Barricades and batons: an historical perspective of the policing of major industrial disorder in Australia |access-date=23 August 2007}}</ref> Beeby was appointed chief judge in March 1939 and was [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in the same year.<ref name=dab/>

==Late life and family==
Beeby retired in 1941 and died on 18 July 1942.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17803145 |title=Sir G Beeby dead |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 July 1942 |access-date=24 March 2019 |page=7 |via=Trove}}</ref> He married in 1892 and was survived by his wife, a son and three daughters. One daughter, Doris Isobel Beeby (1894–1948), was a communist party member and sought higher women's wages.<ref name=adb/> His son, Edward Augustus (1892–1984), was (among other things) a musician and playwright. Edward opened the Patch Theatre Company in Perth WA in 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatre.asn.au/node/11676 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330041253/http://www.theatre.asn.au/node/11676 |archive-date=30 March 2007 |title=Patch Theatre Company}}</ref>
