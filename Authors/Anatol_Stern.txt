'''Anatol Stern''' (24 October 1899 in [[Warsaw]] &ndash; 19 October 1968 in Warsaw) was a Polish poet, writer and art critic. Born 24 October 1899 to an assimilated family of Jewish ancestry, Stern studied at the [[Polish Studies]] Faculty of the [[University of Wilno]] but did not graduate. Prominent among Polish [[futurism (art)|futurist]] poets, between 1921 and 1923 he co-authored (together with [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]]) the "Nowa Sztuka" (''New Art'') monthly. He also collaborated with other notable art magazines of the time, including the ''[[Skamander]]'', [[Tadeusz Peiper]]'s ''Zwrotnica'' and ''[[Wiadomości literackie]]''.

With time he drifted away from avant-garde poetry and became a notable screenwriter. Prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], he authored more than 30 screenplays for both Polish and foreign films. After the [[Invasion of Poland]] he moved to Soviet-held [[Lwów]], where he was arrested by the [[NKVD]] and sent to Soviet [[Gulag]]. Released after the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]], he joined the [[Polish Army]] and with it reached [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. There he made his living translating some of his pre-war works to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In 1948 he returned to his home town, where he died 19 October 1968.
