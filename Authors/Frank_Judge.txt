He spent over a year in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]]. During his time in Italy and for several years after his return, he was a contributor to and an editor of ''The Vanderbilt Poetry Review'',<ref>{{cite web|title=''Vanderbilt Poetry Review''|url=https://catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991011410599703276&context=L&vid=01VAN_INST:vanui&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,Vanderbilt%20poetry%20review&mode=Basic|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref> and he compiled and edited material for an anthology of contemporary Italian poetry published as a special issue of the ''Review''. In his introduction to the anthology, Italian poet Pietro Cimatti notes that it "presents itself as honestly as its poems – tastefully and unpretentiously; including some notable poets, many who have been writing for years, and some relatively new ones – an open-ended package, a heterogeneous product of language by skilled craftsmen"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Vanderbilt Poetry Review|year= 1974|title=Intro|page= 5}}</ref> Of Judge's work as a poet and translator, scholar and translator Glauco Cambon<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/obituaries/glauco-cambon-professor-67.html|title = Glauco Cambon, Professor, 67|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 8 April 1988}}</ref> observed that "he moves at ease between English and Italian literature, between writing his own poetry and translating poems from other languages.".<ref>{{cite document|title=September, 1973 letter from Cimatti to Judge.}}</ref>

The volume contained his translations of poems by [[Sandro Penna]], [[Danilo Dolci]], [[Nelo Risi]], [[Vittorio Sereni]], [[Andrea Zanzotto]], [[Pietro Cimatti]], and others.

In December 2008, he started the monthly series, Rochester Poets @ Lovin' Cup, a cafe which opened in the summer of 2008 at [[Park Point at RIT|Park Point]] near RIT in [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta, NY]]. The series was discontinued in 2009 when time constraints, audience mix, lack of publicity and promotion, and changing focus by the venue made an ongoing literary event unfeasible.
