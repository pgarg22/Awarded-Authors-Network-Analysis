{{Nihongo|'''Shūsaku Endō'''|遠藤 周作|Endō Shūsaku|March 27, 1923&nbsp;– September 29, 1996}}<ref name="Classe"/> was a Japanese author who wrote from the rare perspective of a Japanese [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Internationally, he is known for his 1966 historical fiction novel [[Silence (Endō novel)|''Silence'']], which was adapted into a 2016 [[Silence (2016 film)|film of the same name]] by director [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref name="wp-silence">{{Cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=5 January 2017|title=Watching ‘Silence’ will make you feel terrible. It should.|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/01/05/watching-silence-will-make-you-feel-terrible-it-should/}}</ref> He was the laureate of several prestigious literary accolades, including the [[Akutagawa Prize]] and the [[Order of Culture]], and was inducted into the Roman Catholic [[Order of St. Sylvester]] by [[Pope Paul VI]]. 

Together with [[Junnosuke Yoshiyuki]], [[Shōtarō Yasuoka]], [[Junzo Shono]], [[Hiroyuki Agawa]], [[Ayako Sono]] (also Catholic), and [[Shumon Miura]], Endō is categorized as part of the "[[The Third Generation of Postwar Writers|Third Generation]]" (that is, the third major group of Japanese writers who appeared after [[World War II]]). 

== Biography ==
Soon after Endō was born in [[Tokyo City|Tokyo]] in 1923, his family moved to [[Dalian|Dairen]], then part of the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]] in [[Manchuria]].<ref name="Classe">{{cite book|author=Olive Classe|title=Encyclopedia of literary translation into English: A-L|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myLDA0_brhcC&pg=PA406|access-date=17 November 2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-36-7|pages=406}}</ref> When his parents divorced in 1933, Endō's mother brought him back to Japan to live with an aunt in [[Kobe]].<ref name="Williams pg225">{{Harvnb|Williams|p=225}}</ref> Endō was baptized as a Catholic at the age of 11 or 12<ref name="Morton pg1">{{Harvnb|Morton|p=1}}</ref> in the year 1934.<ref name="Williams pg225"/> Some say this was brought on by his mother, who had converted to Catholicism after her divorce,<ref name="Classe"/> while others state the aunt instigated the initiation.<ref name=nyt/>

Endō first attended [[Waseda University]] for the stated purpose of studying medicine,<ref name="Classe" /> but later decided to switch to the literature programme at [[Keio University]].<ref name="Morton pg1" /> His studies were interrupted by the war, during which he worked in a munitions factory<ref name="Williams pg225" /> and also contributed to literary journals. In 1968, he would later become chief editor of one of these, the prestigious ''[[Mita Bungaku]]''.<ref name="Williams pg226">{{Harvnb|Williams|p=226}}</ref>

Endō was among the first Japanese university students to study in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoekema|first=Alle|date=March 18, 2010|title=La ‘Christologie’ du Romancier Japonais’’, Shusaku  Endo|url=https://missionsetrangeres.com/eglises-asie/2000-10-16-la-christologie-du-romancier-japonais-shusaku-endo/|journal=Missions Étrangères de Paris: Églises d’Asie-Japon}}</ref> His studies at the [[University of Lyon]] over the 1950-1953 period deepened his interest in and knowledge of modern French Catholic authors, who were to become a major influence on his own writing.<ref name="Morton pg1" /><ref name="nyt" />

Upon his return to Japan, his success as a writer was almost immediate. In 1954, a year after completing his studies in France, he won the [[Akutagawa Prize]] for ''Shiroi Hito'' (White Men).<ref name="Morton pg2">{{Harvnb|Morton|p=2}}</ref> 

Endō married Okada Junko<ref name="Classe" /> in 1955.<ref name="Morton pg2" /> They had one son,<ref name="Morton pg2" /> Ryūnosuke,<ref name="nyt">[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/30/arts/shusaku-endo-is-dead-at-73-japanese-catholic-novelist.html Shusaku Endo Is Dead at 73; Japanese Catholic Novelist] New York Times. September 30, 1996. Case, Eric.</ref> born in 1956.

Endō lectured at at least two Tokyo universities.<ref name="Morton pg2" /> In 1956, he was hired as an instructor at [[Sophia University]],<ref name="Williams pg225" /> and [[Seijo University]] assigned him the role of "Lecturer on the Theory of the Novel" in 1967.<ref name="Williams pg226" /> He was considered a novelist not a university professor, however.<ref name="Morton pg2" />

Throughout his life bouts of disease plagued him, and he spent two years in hospital at one point.<ref name="Morton pg2" /> In 1952, while studying in France, he came down with [[pleurisy]] in Paris.<ref name="Williams pg225"/> A return visit in 1960 prompted another case of the same disease, and he stayed in hospital (in France and Japan) for the greater part of three years.<ref name="Williams pg226"/> Among other health problems, he contracted [[tuberculosis]],<ref name=untrustworthy_source/> underwent [[Scoliosis#Management#Surgery#Thoracoplasty|thoracoplasty]],<ref name=untrustworthy_source>{{cite journal| pmc=2563703 | pmid=16517794 | doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.037366 | volume=82 | title=Shushaku Endo (1923-1996): his tuberculosis and his writings | journal=Postgrad Med J | pages=157–61 | last1 = Sharma | first1 = OP}}</ref> and had a lung removed.<ref name="Morton pg2" />

While he lost the 1994 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] to [[Kenzaburō Ōe]],<ref name="nyt" /> he received the [[Order of Culture]] the subsequent year.<ref name="Williams pg226" /> Endō died shortly thereafter from complications of [[hepatitis]] at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo on September 29, 1996.<ref name="nyt" />

== Writing style and themes ==
While Endō wrote in several genres,<ref name="Morton pg3">{{Harvnb|Morton|p=3}}</ref> his oeuvre is strongly tied to Christianity if not Catholicism. Endō has been called "a novelist whose work has been dominated by a single theme&nbsp;... belief in Christianity".<ref name="Morton pg1" /> Others have said that he is "almost by default&nbsp;... [labeled] a 'Japanese Catholic author' struggling to 'plant the seeds of his adopted religion' in the 'mudswamp' of Japan".<ref name="Classe"/> He often likened Japan to a [[swamp]] or [[fen]].<ref name="Morton pg11">{{Harvnb|Morton|p=11}}</ref><ref name="Phillips Confessions" />  In the novel ''[[Silence (Endō novel)|Silence]]'', an official tells a priest who has apostatized, "Father, it was not by us that you were defeated, but by this mudswamp, Japan."  In Endō's stage version of this story, ''The Golden Country'', this official also says:  "But the mudswamp too has its good points, if you will but give yourself up to its comfortable warmth.  The teachings of Christ are like a flame.  Like a flame they set a man on fire.  But the tepid warmth of Japan will eventually nurture sleep."<ref>Francis Mathy, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], of Sophia University, (1974), ''Wonderful Fool'' (''Obaka San''), Tokyo:  Tuttle, p. 6, {{OCLC|1858868}}.</ref>  Thus, many of Endō's characters are [[allegory|allegories]].<ref name="Morton pg3" />

He may not be embraced by fellow Christians&mdash;Catholics, in particular.<ref name="Morton pg3" /> Some of his characters (many of whom are allegories) may reference non-Western religions.<ref name="Morton pg3" /> While not the main focus of his works, a few of Endō's books mention [[Kakure Kirishitan]]s (hidden Christians).<ref name="Morton pg8">{{Harvnb|Morton|p=8}}</ref> Endō preferred to use the term {{lang|ja|"かくれ切支丹"}} instead of the more common {{lang|ja|"かくれキリシタン"}}.<ref name="Mase-Hasegawa2008">{{cite book|author=Emi Mase-Hasegawa|title=Christ in Japanese culture: theological themes in Shusaku Endo's literary works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6d_4UKMQ68C&pg=PA24|access-date=19 November 2011|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16596-0|pages=24}}</ref>

His books reflect many of his childhood experiences, including the stigma of being an outsider, the experience of being a foreigner, the life of a hospital patient, and the struggle with tuberculosis. However, his books mainly deal with the moral fabric of life.

His Catholic faith can be seen at some level in all of his books and it is often a central feature. Most of his characters struggle with complex moral dilemmas, and their choices often produce mixed or tragic results.

His work is often compared to that of [[Graham Greene]],<ref name="Williams pg1">{{Harvnb|Williams|p=1}}</ref> with whom he shared a mutual admiration: Greene himself labeled Endō one of the finest writers alive,<ref name=nyt/> while it is reported that Endo would re-read Greene's novel ''[[The End of the Affair]]'' before beginning a new work of his own.<ref name="Phillips Confessions">{{cite news |last1=Philips |first1=Caryl |title=Confessions of a True Believer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview15 |access-date=25 June 2020 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 3, 2003}}</ref>
