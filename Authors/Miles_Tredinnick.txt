'''Miles Tredinnick''', also known as '''Riff Regan''', (born [[Warrington]] 18 February 1955) is a rock musician, songwriter and a stage and screenwriter. In the 1970s, he was the lead singer with the British rock band [[London (punk band)|London]].<ref name="Spicer">Spicer, Al, (2006) ''The Rough Guide to Punk'', Rough Guides Ltd, {{ISBN|978-1-84353-473-0}}, p. 155</ref> Afterwards he went on to write comedy plays for the stage. He has also written scripts for [[Frankie Howerd]], including the television special ''[[Superfrank!]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/362626?view=credit |title=Superfrank!

==Rock musician==
In 1976, with drummer [[Jon Moss]], guitarist Dave Wight (real name Colin Wight) and bassist Steve Voice, Tredinnick formed the punk band [[London (punk band)|London]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jo-Ann Greene |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/london-p18987/biography |title=London &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="Rimmer">Rimmer, Dave (1985) ''Like Punk Never Happened'', Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|978-0-571-13739-8}}, p. 40-42</ref> He was the lead singer Riff Regan. The band came to the notice of Danny Morgan who was a talent scout for ex-[[Yardbirds]] and ex-[[Marc Bolan]] manager [[Simon Napier-Bell]].<ref name="Napier-Bell">Napier-Bell, Simon (2001) ''Black Vinyl White Powder'', Ebury Press, {{ISBN|978-0-09-186992-2}}, p. 163</ref> He secured them a record deal with [[MCA Records]] and a nationwide tour supporting [[The Stranglers]]. Their singles "Everyone’s A Winner", "Summer of Love"/"Friday on My Mind" and "Animal Games" and their one and only album ''[[Animal Games]]'' were all produced by Napier-Bell at the [[IBC Studios]] in London. Their recording of "[[Friday on My Mind]]" was made in the same studio that [[The Easybeats]] had made the original.

Although [[London (punk band)|London]] had a popular live stage act, ticket sales never transformed into record sales. This was despite flamboyant film director Mike Mansfield directing the video for "Everyone's A Winner".  The highest UK chart position they reached was 52 for their EP ''Summer of Love''.  Jon Moss was particularly impatient to have chart success and following a nationwide tour the band decided to call it a day.  They broke up after a farewell gig at the [[Marquee Club]] in Wardour Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/Londoninterview1.htm |title=London- Riff Regan Interview |publisher=Punk77.co.uk |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> Jon Moss joined [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and later formed [[Culture Club]] with [[Boy George]]; Colin Wight became a Professor in International Politics;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/arts/government_international_relations/staff/academic_staff/colin_wight.shtml |title=Professor Colin Wight – The University of Sydney |publisher=Sydney.edu.au |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> Steve Voice formed The Original Vampires; Simon Napier-Bell went on to manage [[George Michael]] and [[Wham!]].

Tredinnick, as Riff Regan, released four more singles on MCA Records; "All The Nice Boys And Girls in the World" (produced by Napier-Bell), "Japanese Girls" (produced by Andy Miller), "You Call Me Lucky" and "The Only One" (both produced by [[Liam Sternberg]]) before recording "Hard Hearts Don’t Cry" (produced by Andy Miller) on [[Epic Records]] in 1981. In August 2015 his first solo album [[Milestones (Riff Regan album)|Milestones]] was released on Beach Café Records.

In 1997, Captain Oi! Records released a best of [[London (punk band)|London]] CD called ''[[London The Punk Rock Collection]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-punk-rock-collection-r514271/review |title=The Punk Rock Collection – London &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=9 May 2000 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> It contains all the band's MCA recordings.

Tredinnick also co-wrote the song "Hottest Woman in Town" with Andy Miller in 1982.  Recorded at London's [[Trident Studios]] by ex-[[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Ian Gillan]] lead guitarist [[Bernie Torme]], it was released as a single and featured on the "Metal Killers" album.

In 2007 he reformed [[London (punk band)|London]] with original bass player Steve Voice and new guitarist Hugh O'Donnell and new drummer Colin Watterston.  The band played their first London gig in over 30 years at the [[12 Bar Club]] in [[Soho]], London on Saturday 23 February 2008. ''[[Reboot (London album)|Reboot]]'', their first studio album in 34 years, was released in February 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detour-records.co.uk/LONDONINFOPAGE.htm |title=* |publisher=Detour-records.co.uk |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> and ''The Hell for Leather Mob'' album was released in July 2020.

==Theatre and television==
Tredinnick's first stage play, ''[[Because of Mr Darrow]],''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/transition-archive/archive_1980to1990.php |title=Finborough Theatre |publisher=Finborough Theatre |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> was produced at the [[Finborough Theatre]] in London and his second comedy ''[[Laugh? I Nearly Went To Miami!]]'' had a successful fringe run at the [[Pentameters Theatre]] in Hampstead. The latter was later produced for the first Liverpool Festival of Comedy.

In translation, ''Laugh? I Nearly Went To Miami!'' has been produced in many cities, including Vienna, where its title was ''...Und Morgen Fliegen Wir Nach Miami''. British Director [[Cyril Frankel]] directed with German translation by Adolf Opel.

In 1990, Tredinnick wrote the stage thriller ''[[Twist (stage play)|Twist]]''. This was translated into German by Ursula Grutzmacher-Tabori under the title ''Der Letzte Dreh'' and was later produced in London under the title ''Getting Away with Murder'' at the [[Pentameters Theatre]] in Hampstead. The play had its US debut in Taunton, Massachusetts in 2010<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Larocque |url=http://www.tauntongazette.com/newsnow/x1404220452/Brit-playwrights-work-makes-U-S-debut-in-Taunton?photo=0 |title=Brit playwright's work makes U.S. debut in Taunton – News – The Taunton Daily Gazette, Taunton, MA – Taunton, MA |publisher=Tauntongazette.com |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> and an acting edition was published by Josef Weinberger Plays in 2019.

His next stage comedy was ''[[It's Now Or Never!]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queens-theatre.co.uk/archive/itsnowornever1994.htm |title=It's Now Or Never 1994 |publisher=Queens-theatre.co.uk |accessdate=26 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040626072323/http://www.queens-theatre.co.uk/archive/itsnowornever1994.htm |archivedate=26 June 2004  }}</ref> in 1994.  Directed by Marina Calderone at the Queen's Theatre, [[Hornchurch]], England, it starred [[Tony Roper (actor)|Tony Roper]], [[Peter Polycarpou]] and Leyton Sommers as [[Elvis Presley]]. A German version, ''Jetzt Oder Nie,'' translated by Christian Wolffer has been successful as has a Dutch version translated by Martine Deboosere.

''[[Topless (stage play)|Topless]]'', a one-woman play set on an open-top London sightseeing bus, followed in 1999. Produced by [[The Big Bus Company]], this unique theatrical piece was actually performed, with audience, on top of a sightseeing bus driving through the streets of the West End of London. This was followed by ''[[Topless in Philadelphia]]'' (2009) featuring a male tour guide giving an open-top bus tour in America's most historical city and then ''[[Topless in Sydney]]'' (2014) and ''Topless in Las Vegas'' (2018).

===Frankie Howerd===
From 1985 to 1992 Tredinnick wrote regular stage and television scripts for [[Frankie Howerd]] including co-writing the hour long special, ''[[Superfrank!]]'' for Channel 4. He also wrote an updated stage version of ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'' although a proposed tour was put on the shelf when Howerd was offered a chance by [[Larry Gelbart]] to reprise his role as Pseudolus in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' at the Piccadilly Theatre in London's West End. The new play, now revised and updated, received its premiere in [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/lifestyle/damian_s_a_slave_to_his_art_1_2976746 |title=Damian’s a slave to his art |work=Derbyshire Times|date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> in January 2011 before embarking on a UK tour. Produced and directed by Bruce James, it starred Damian Williams, host of Sky One's ''[[Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? (UK)|Are You Smarter Than A Ten Year Old?]]'', as Lurcio the slave. An acting edition of the play was published by Josef Weinberger Ltd in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.josef-weinberger.com/plays-and-pantomime/play/up-pompeii.html |title=UP POMPEII &#124; Plays & Pantomimes |publisher=Josef Weinberger |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>
