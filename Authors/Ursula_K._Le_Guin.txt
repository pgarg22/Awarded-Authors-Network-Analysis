She was first published in 1959, and her literary career spanned nearly sixty years, producing more than [[Ursula K. Le Guin bibliography|twenty novels and over a hundred short stories]], in addition to poetry, [[literary criticism]], translations, and children's books. Frequently described as an author of science fiction, Le Guin has also been called a "major voice in American Letters".{{sfn|White|1999|pp=1–2}} Le Guin herself said she would prefer to be known as an "American novelist".<ref name="Phillips 2012">{{Cite news |last=Phillips |first=Julie |author-link=Julie Phillips |date=December 2012 |title=Ursula K.

Le Guin was born in [[Berkeley, California]], to author [[Theodora Kroeber]] and anthropologist [[Alfred Louis Kroeber]]. Having earned a master's degree in French, Le Guin began doctoral studies but abandoned these after her marriage in 1953 to historian Charles Le Guin. She began writing full-time in the late 1950s and achieved major critical and commercial success with ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), which have been described by [[Harold Bloom]] as her masterpieces.{{sfn|White|1999|p=2}} For the latter volume, Le Guin won both the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula awards for best novel]], becoming the first woman to do so. Several more works set in Earthsea or the Hainish universe followed; others included books set in the fictional country of [[Orsinia]], several works for children, and many anthologies.

[[Cultural anthropology]], [[Taoism]], [[feminism]], and the writings of [[Carl Jung]] all had a strong influence on Le Guin's work. Many of her stories used anthropologists or cultural observers as protagonists, and Taoist ideas about balance and equilibrium have been identified in several writings. Le Guin often subverted typical speculative fiction tropes, such as through her use of [[People of color|dark-skinned]] protagonists in Earthsea, and also used unusual stylistic or structural devices in books such as the experimental work ''[[Always Coming Home]]'' (1985). Social and political themes, including race, gender, sexuality, and [[coming of age]] were prominent in her writing, and she explored alternative political structures in many stories, such as in the parable "[[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas]]" (1973) and the utopian novel ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974).

Le Guin's writing was enormously influential in the field of speculative fiction, and has been the subject of intense critical attention. She received numerous accolades, including eight [[Hugo Award|Hugos]], six [[Nebula Award|Nebulas]], and twenty-two [[Locus Award for Best Novel|Locus Awards]], and in 2003 became the second woman honored as a [[SFWA Grand Master|Grand Master]] of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]. The U.S. [[Library of Congress]] named her a [[Library of Congress Living Legend|Living Legend]] in 2000, and in 2014, she won the [[National Book Award|National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]]. Le Guin influenced many other authors, including [[Booker Prize]] winner [[Salman Rushdie]], [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], [[Neil Gaiman]], and [[Iain Banks]]. After her death in 2018, critic [[John Clute]] wrote that Le Guin had "presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century",<ref name="Clute Guardian Obit" /> while author [[Michael Chabon]] referred to her as the "greatest American writer of her generation".<ref name="Fellow Writers" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Chabon |first=Michael |date=November 20, 2019 |title=Le Guin's Subversive Imagination |url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/11/20/leguins-subversive-imagination/ |access-date=November 24, 2019 |website=The Paris Review |language=en |archive-date=December 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224023023/https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/11/20/leguins-subversive-imagination/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Le Guin refused a [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|Nebula Award]] for her story "[[The Diary of the Rose]]" in 1977, in protest at the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]'s revocation of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s membership. Le Guin attributed the revocation to Lem's criticism of American science fiction and willingness to live in the [[Eastern Bloc]], and said she felt reluctant to receive an award "for a story about political intolerance from a group that had just displayed political intolerance".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Le Guin |first=Ursula |date=December 6, 2017 |title=The Literary Prize for the Refusal of Literary Prizes |url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/12/06/literary-prize-refusal-literary-prizes/ |access-date=December 25, 2018 |website=[[The Paris Review]] |archive-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121094400/https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/12/06/literary-prize-refusal-literary-prizes/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Dugdale 2018">{{Cite news |last=Dugdale |first=John |date=May 21, 2016 |title=How to turn down a prestigious literary prize – a winner's guide to etiquette |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/21/how-turn-down-prestigious-literary-prize-winners-guide-etiquette |access-date=December 25, 2018 |archive-date=December 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225175448/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/21/how-turn-down-prestigious-literary-prize-winners-guide-etiquette |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Chronology of writings ==
=== Early work ===

Some of her poetry from this period was published in 1975 in the volume ''Wild Angels''.{{sfn|Reid|1997|p=6}} Le Guin turned her attention to science fiction after lengthy periods of receiving rejections from publishers, knowing that there was a market for writing that could be readily classified as such.{{sfn|White|1999|p=45}} Her first professional publication was the short story "April in Paris" in 1962 in ''[[Fantastic Science Fiction]]'',{{sfn|Erlich|2009|p=25}} and seven other stories followed in the next few years, in ''Fantastic'' or ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45, 123}} Among them were "[[The Dowry of Angyar]]", which introduced the fictional [[Hainish universe]],{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=68}} and "[[The Rule of Names]]" and "[[The Word of Unbinding]]", which introduced the world of [[Earthsea]].{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81}} These stories were largely ignored by critics.{{sfn|White|1999|p=45}}

[[Ace Books]] released ''[[Rocannon's World]]'', Le Guin's first published novel, in 1966. Two more Hainish novels, ''[[Planet of Exile]]'' and ''[[City of Illusions]]'' were published in 1966 and 1967, respectively, and the three books together would come to be known as the Hainish trilogy.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=44–45}} The first two were each published as half of an "Ace Double": two novels bound into a paperback and sold as a single low-cost volume.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=44–45}} ''City of Illusions'' was published as a standalone volume, indicating Le Guin's growing name recognition. These books received more critical attention than Le Guin's short stories, with reviews being published in several science fiction magazines, but the critical response was still muted.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=44–45}} The books contained many themes and ideas also present in Le Guin's better known later works, including the "archetypal journey" of a protagonist who undertakes both a physical journey and one of self-discovery, cultural contact and communication, the search for identity, and the reconciliation of opposing forces.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|p=9}}

When publishing her story "Nine Lives" in 1968, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine asked Le Guin whether they could run the story without her full first name, to which Le Guin agreed: the story was published under the name "U. K. Le Guin". She later wrote that it was the first and only time she had experienced prejudice against her as a woman writer from an editor or publisher, and reflected that "it seemed so silly, so grotesque, that I failed to see that it was also important." In subsequent printings, the story was published under her full name.{{sfn|Le Guin|1978|p=128}}

=== Critical attention ===
Le Guin's next two books brought her sudden and widespread critical acclaim. ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'', published in 1968, was a fantasy novel written initially for teenagers.{{sfn|White|1999|p=2}} Le Guin had not planned to write for young adults, but was asked to write a novel targeted at this group by the editor of Parnassus Press, who saw it as a market with great potential.{{sfn|White|1999|p=10}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=xi}} A [[Bildungsroman|coming of age story]] set in the fictional archipelago of Earthsea, the book received a positive reception in both the U.S. and Britain.{{sfn|White|1999|p=10}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=8, 22}}

Her next novel, ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', was a Hainish universe story exploring themes of gender and sexuality on a fictional planet where humans have no fixed sex.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45–50}} The book was Le Guin's first to address feminist issues,{{sfn|Reid|1997|pp=51–56}} and according to scholar Donna White, it "stunned the science fiction critics"; it won both the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo]] and the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula Awards]] for best novel, making Le Guin the first woman to win these awards, and a number of other accolades.<ref name="Walton Obit">{{Cite journal |last=Walton |first=Jo |date=January 24, 2018 |title=Bright the Hawk's Flight on the Empty Sky: Ursula K.

Le Guin continued to develop themes of equilibrium and coming-of-age in the next two installments of the ''Earthsea'' series, ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'' and ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'', published in 1971 and 1972, respectively.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=26–27}} Both books were praised for their writing, while the exploration of death as a theme in ''The Farthest Shore'' also drew praise.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=14–15}} Her 1974 novel ''The Dispossessed'' again won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards for best novel, making her the first person to win both awards for each of two books.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Conversations with Ursula K.

=== Wider exploration ===
Le Guin published a variety of work in the second half of the 1970s. This included [[speculative fiction]] in the form of the novel ''[[The Eye of the Heron]]'', which, according to Le Guin, may be a part of the Hainish universe.{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2019}}{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=109–116}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=124}} She also published ''[[Very Far Away from Anywhere Else]]'', a realistic novel for adolescents,{{sfn|Spivack|1984|p=106}} as well as the collection ''[[Orsinian Tales]]'' and the novel ''[[Malafrena]]'' in 1976 and 1979, respectively. Though the latter two were set in the fictional country of Orsinia, the stories were realistic fiction rather than fantasy or science fiction.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=100, 114}} ''[[The Language of the Night]]'', a collection of essays, was released in 1979,{{sfn|Spivack|1984|p=125}} and Le Guin also published ''Wild Angels'', a volume of poetry, in 1975.{{sfn|White|1999|p=111}}

Between 1979, when she published ''Malafrena'', and 1994, when the collection ''[[A Fisherman of the Inland Sea]]'' was released, Le Guin wrote primarily for a younger audience.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=114–115}} In 1985 she published the experimental work ''[[Always Coming Home]]''.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=115–116}} She wrote 11 children's picture books, including the ''[[Catwings]]'' series, between 1979 and 1994, along with ''[[The Beginning Place]]'', an adolescent fantasy novel, released in 1980.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=170}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=114–115}}{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=116–117}} Four more poetry collections were also published in this period, all of which were positively received.{{sfn|White|1999|p=111}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=114–115}} She also revisited Earthsea, publishing ''[[Tehanu]]'' in 1990: coming eighteen years after ''The Farthest Shore'', during which Le Guin's views had developed considerably, the book was grimmer in tone than the earlier works in the series, and challenged some ideas presented therein. It received critical praise,{{sfn|White|1999|pp=107–111}} won Le Guin a third Nebula Award for Best Novel,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sfadb.com/Nebula_Awards_Winners_By_Category |title=Nebula Awards Winners By Category |work=Science Fiction Awards Database |publisher=Locus Science Fiction Foundation|access-date=August 17, 2021}}</ref> and led to the series being recognized among adult literature.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81, 97}}

Several scholars have commented that Le Guin's writing was influenced by [[Carl Jung]], and specifically by the idea of [[Jungian archetypes]].{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|White|1999|pp=12, 17}} In particular, the shadow in ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' is seen as the Shadow archetype from Jungian psychology, representing Ged's pride, fear, and desire for power.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=17}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|pp=100–103}} Le Guin discussed her interpretation of this archetype, and her interest in the dark and repressed parts of the psyche, in a 1974 lecture.{{sfn|White|1999|p=17}} She stated elsewhere that she had never read Jung before writing the first ''Earthsea'' books.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=17}} Other archetypes, including the Mother, Animus, and Anima, have also been identified in Le Guin's writing.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=5–6}}

Philosophical [[Taoism]] had a large role in Le Guin's world view,{{sfn|White|1999|p=24}} and the influence of Taoist thought can be seen in many of her stories.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=6–8}} Many of Le Guin's protagonists, including in ''The Lathe of Heaven'', embody the Taoist ideal of leaving things alone. The anthropologists of the Hainish universe try not to meddle with the cultures they encounter, while one of the earliest lessons Ged learns in ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' is not to use magic unless it is absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=6–8}} Taoist influence is evident in Le Guin's depiction of equilibrium in the world of Earthsea: the archipelago is depicted as being based on a delicate balance, which is disrupted by somebody in each of the first three novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea, implicit in the name "Earthsea", between people and their natural environment,{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=9–10}} and a larger cosmic equilibrium, which wizards are tasked with maintaining.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=25–26}} Another prominent Taoist idea is the reconciliation of opposites such as light and dark, or good and evil. A number of Hainish novels, ''The Dispossessed'' prominent among them, explored such a process of reconciliation.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=51–55}} In the Earthsea universe, it is not the dark powers, but the characters' misunderstanding of the balance of life, that is depicted as evil,{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=31–36}} in contrast to conventional Western stories in which good and evil are in constant conflict.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=18}}

=== Genre and style ===
Although Le Guin is primarily known for her works of speculative fiction, she also wrote realistic fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and several other literary forms, and as a result her work is difficult to classify.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=1–2}} Her writings received critical attention from mainstream critics, critics of children's literature, and critics of speculative fiction.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=1–2}} Le Guin herself said that she would prefer to be known as an "American novelist".<ref name="Phillips 2012" /> Le Guin's transgression of conventional boundaries of genre led to literary criticism of Le Guin becoming "[[Balkanization|Balkanized]]", particularly between scholars of children's literature and speculative fiction.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=1–2}} Commentators have noted that the ''Earthsea'' novels specifically received less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of [[children's literature]], describing it as "adult chauvinist piggery".{{sfn|White|1999|pp=1–2}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Esmonde |first=Margaret P. |year=1981 |title=The Good Witch of the West |journal=Children's Literature |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume=9 |pages=185–190 |doi=10.1353/chl.0.0112}}</ref> In 1976, literature scholar [[George Slusser]] criticized the "silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature{{'"}},{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=96}} while in Barbara Bucknall's opinion Le Guin "can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age."{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=96}}

{{quote box
 | quote   = Fortunately, though extrapolation is an element in science fiction, it isn't the name of the game by any means. It is far too rationalist and simplistic to satisfy the imaginative mind, whether the writer's or the reader's. Variables are the spice of life. [If] you like you can read [a lot of] science fiction, as a thought-experiment. Let's say (says Mary Shelley) that a young doctor creates a human being in his laboratory; let's say (says Philip K. Dick) that the Allies lost the second world war; let's say this or that is such and so, and see what happens... In a story so conceived, the moral complexity proper to the modern novel need not be sacrificed, nor is there any built-in dead end; thought and intuition can move freely within bounds set only by the terms of the experiment, which may be very large indeed.

She argued that the term "soft science fiction" was divisive, and implied a narrow view of what constitutes valid science fiction.<ref name="Vice Interview" />

The influence of anthropology can be seen in the setting Le Guin chose for a number of her works. Several of her protagonists are anthropologists or ethnologists exploring a world alien to them.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=5, 66–67}} This is particularly true in the stories set in the Hainish universe, an [[alternative history|alternative reality]] in which humans did not evolve on Earth, but on Hain. The Hainish subsequently colonized many planets, before losing contact with them, giving rise to varied but related biology and social structure.<ref name="Salon Profile" />{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=5, 66–67}} Examples include Rocannon in ''Rocannon's World'' and Genly Ai in ''The Left Hand of Darkness''. Other characters, such as Shevek in ''The Dispossessed'', become cultural observers in the course of their journeys on other planets.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=4–5}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=12–13}} Le Guin's writing often examines alien cultures, and particularly the human cultures from planets other than Earth in the Hainish universe.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=5, 66–67}} In discovering these "alien" worlds, Le Guin's protagonists, and by extension the readers, also journey into themselves, and challenge the nature of what they consider "alien" and what they consider "native".{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=5}}

Several of Le Guin's works have featured stylistic or structural features that were unusual or subversive. The heterogeneous structure of ''The Left Hand of Darkness'', described as "distinctly post-modern", was unusual for the time of its publication.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45–50}} This was in marked contrast to the structure of (primarily male-authored) traditional science fiction, which was straightforward and linear.{{sfn|Reid|1997|pp=20–25}} The novel was framed as part of a report sent to the [[Ekumen]] by the protagonist Genly Ai after his time on the planet Gethen, thus suggesting that Ai was selecting and ordering the material, consisting of personal narration, diary extracts, Gethenian myths, and ethnological reports.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=76–81}} ''Earthsea'' also employed an unconventional narrative form described by scholar Mike Cadden as "free indirect discourse", in which the feelings of the protagonist are not directly separated from the narration, making the narrator seem sympathetic to the characters, and removing the skepticism towards a character's thoughts and emotions that are a feature of more direct narration.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=92}} Cadden suggests that this method leads to younger readers sympathizing directly with the characters, making it an effective technique for young-adult literature.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=92–93}}

A number of Le Guin's writings, including the ''Earthsea'' series, challenged the conventions of epic fantasies and myths. Many of the protagonists in ''Earthsea'' were [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] individuals, in comparison to the [[White people|white-skinned]] heroes more traditionally used; some of the antagonists, in contrast, were white-skinned, a switching of race roles that has been remarked upon by multiple critics.{{sfn|Kuznets|1985}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=92}} In a 2001 interview, Le Guin attributed the frequent lack of character illustrations on her book covers to her choice of non-white protagonists. She explained this choice, saying: "most people in the world aren't white. Why in the future would we assume they are?"<ref name="Salon Profile" /> Her 1985 book ''Always Coming Home'', described as "her great experiment", included a story told from the perspective of a young protagonist, but also included poems, rough drawings of plants and animals, myths, and anthropological reports from the matriarchal society of the Kesh, a fictional people living in the Napa valley after a catastrophic global flood.{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2019}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=115–116}}

== Themes ==
=== Gender and sexuality ===
Gender and sexuality are prominent themes in a number of Le Guin's works. ''The Left Hand of Darkness'', published in 1969, was among the first books in the genre now known as [[feminist science fiction]], and is the most famous examination of [[androgyny]] in science fiction.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/womensciencefict00reid |title=Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Entries |volume=2|publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-313-33589-1 |editor-last=Reid |editor-first=Robin Anne |pages= 9, 120 |url-access=limited}}</ref> The story is set on the fictional planet of Gethen, whose inhabitants are ambisexual humans with no fixed [[gender identity]], who [[Biology in fiction|adopt female or male sexual characteristics]] for brief periods of their sexual cycle.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=74–77}} Which sex they adopt can depend on context and relationships.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=44–50}} Gethen was portrayed as a society without war, as a result of this absence of fixed gender characteristics, and also without sexuality as a continuous factor in social relationships.{{sfn|Reid|1997|pp=51–56}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=74–77}} Gethenian culture was explored in the novel through the eyes of a [[Earth|Terran]], whose masculinity proves a barrier to cross-cultural communication.{{sfn|Reid|1997|pp=51–56}} Outside the Hainish Cycle, Le Guin's use of a female protagonist in ''The Tombs of Atuan'', published in 1971, was described as a "significant exploration of womanhood".{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=171}}

[[File:Ursula K Le Guin.JPG|thumb|upright|Le Guin at a reading in [[Danville, California]] (June 2008)]]
Le Guin's attitude towards gender and feminism evolved considerably over time.{{sfn|Lothian|2006|pp=380–383}} Although ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' was seen as a landmark exploration of gender, it also received criticism for not going far enough. Reviewers pointed to its usage of masculine [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|gender pronouns]] to describe its androgynous characters,{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45–50}} the lack of androgynous characters portrayed in stereotypical feminine roles,{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=78–85}} and the portrayal of [[heterosexuality]] as the norm on Gethen.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=70–77}} Le Guin's portrayal of gender in ''Earthsea'' was also described as perpetuating the notion of a male-dominated world; according to the ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', "Le Guin saw men as the actors and doers in the [world], while women remain the still centre, the well from which they drink".{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2019}}<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Modern Children's Fantasy |encyclopedia=The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/16508/1/Modern%20Children%27s%20Fantasy.pdf |date=2012 |editor-last=James |editor-first=Edward |pages=224–235 |doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521429597.021 |isbn=978-0-521-42959-7 |last1=Butler |first1=Catherine |editor-first2=Farah |editor-last2=Mendlesohn |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-date=July 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712200817/http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/16508/1/Modern%20Children's%20Fantasy.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hatfield |first=Len |date=1993 |title=From Master to Brother: Shifting the Balance of Authority in Ursula K.

Le Guin revisited this essay in 1988, and acknowledged that gender was central to the novel;{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45–50}} she also apologized for depicting Gethenians solely in heterosexual relationships.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=70–77}}

Le Guin responded to these critiques in her subsequent writing. She intentionally used feminine [[pronoun]]s for all sexually latent Gethenians in her 1995 short story "Coming of Age in Karhide", and in a later reprinting of "[[Winter's King]]", which was first published in 1969.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=78–85}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Walton |first=Jo |date=June 8, 2009 |title=Gender and glaciers: Ursula Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness |url=http://www.tor.com/2009/06/08/the-poetry-of-anthropology-ursula-le-guins-the-left-hand-of-darkness/ |website=Tor.com |access-date=July 13, 2016 |archive-date=August 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827211823/http://www.tor.com/2009/06/08/the-poetry-of-anthropology-ursula-le-guins-the-left-hand-of-darkness/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Ketterer |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC |title=Flashes of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the War of the Worlds |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-313-31607-4 |pages=80–81 |access-date=August 16, 2019 |archive-date=June 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613031852/https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC |url-status=live }}</ref> "Coming of Age in Karhide" was later anthologized in the 2002 collection ''[[The Birthday of the World: and Other Stories|The Birthday of the World]]'', which contained six other stories featuring unorthodox sexual relationships and marital arrangements.{{sfn|Lindow|2012|p=205}} She also revisited gender relations in ''Earthsea'' in ''Tehanu'', published in 1990.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=106}} This volume was described as a rewriting or reimagining of ''The Tombs of Atuan'', because the power and status of the female protagonist Tenar are the inverse of what they were in the earlier book, which was also focused on her and Ged.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hollindale |first=Peter |date=September 2003 |title=The Last Dragon of Earthsea |journal=Children's Literature in Education |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=183–193 |doi=10.1023/A:1025390102089|s2cid=160303057 }}</ref> During this later period she commented that she considered ''The Eye of the Heron'', published in 1978, to be her first work genuinely centered on a woman.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cadden |first=Mike |date=2006 |title=Taking Different Roads to the City: The Development of Ursula K.

=== Moral development ===
Le Guin explores [[coming of age]], and moral development more broadly, in many of her writings.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=24}} This is particularly the case in those works written for a younger audience, such as ''Earthsea'' and ''Annals of the Western Shore''. Le Guin wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose to explore coming-of-age in ''Earthsea'' since she was writing for an adolescent audience: "Coming of age&nbsp;... is a process that took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact."{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}} She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing coming of age, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of "rational daily life".{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}}{{sfn|Tymn|1981|p=30}}

The first three ''Earthsea'' novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, and each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9}} ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' focuses on Ged's adolescence, while ''The Tombs of Atuan'' and ''The Farthest Shore'' explore that of Tenar and the prince Arren, respectively.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}}<ref name="Spivack 1984" /> ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' is frequently described as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'',{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=91}} in which Ged's coming of age is intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=99}} To Mike Cadden the book was a convincing tale "to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him".{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=91}} Reviewers have described the ending of the novel, wherein Ged finally accepts the shadow as a part of himself, as a [[rite of passage]]. Scholar Jeanne Walker writes that the rite of passage at the end was an analogue for the entire plot of ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', and that the plot itself plays the role of a rite of passage for an adolescent reader.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|White|1999|pp=34–35}}

Each volume of ''Annals of the Western Shore'' also describes the coming of age of its protagonists,<ref name="Lindow 2006">{{Cite journal |last=Lindow |first=Sandra J. |year=2006 |title=Wild Gifts: Anger management and moral development in the fiction of Ursula K.

=== Political systems ===
Alternative social and political systems are a recurring theme in Le Guin's writing.<ref name="Fellow Writers" />{{sfn|White|1999|pp=81–83}} Critics have paid particular attention to ''The Dispossessed'' and ''Always Coming Home'',{{sfn|White|1999|pp=81–83}} although Le Guin explores related themes in a number of her works,{{sfn|White|1999|pp=81–83}} such as in "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas".{{sfn|Rochelle|2008|pp=414–415}} ''The Dispossessed'' is an anarchist utopian novel, which according to Le Guin drew from pacifist anarchists, including [[Peter Kropotkin]], as well as from the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="GuardianQ&A" /> Le Guin has been credited with {{nowrap|"[rescuing]}} anarchism from the cultural ghetto to which it has been consigned", and helping to bring it into the intellectual mainstream.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Call |first=Lewis |year=2007 |title=Postmodern Anarchism in the Novels of Ursula K.

''The Dispossessed'', set on the twin planets of Urras and Anarres, features a planned anarcho-socialist society depicted as an "ambiguous utopia". The society, created by settlers from Urras, is materially poorer than the wealthy society of Urras, but ethically and morally more advanced.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=86–89}} Unlike classical utopias, the society of Anarres is portrayed as neither perfect nor static; the protagonist Shevek finds himself traveling to Urras to pursue his research. Nonetheless, the misogyny and hierarchy present in the authoritarian society of Urras is absent among the anarchists, who base their social structure on cooperation and individual liberty.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=86–89}} ''The Eye of the Heron'', published a few years after ''The Dispossessed'', was described as continuing Le Guin's exploration of human freedom, through a conflict between two societies of opposing philosophies: a town inhabited by descendants of pacifists, and a city inhabited by descendants of criminals.{{sfn|Rochelle|2008|p=415}}

''Always Coming Home'', set in California in the distant future, examines a warlike society, resembling contemporary American society, from the perspective of the Kesh, its pacifist neighbors. The society of the Kesh has been identified by scholars as a feminist utopia, which Le Guin uses to explore the role of technology.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=96–100}} Scholar Warren Rochelle stated that it was "neither a matriarchy nor a patriarchy: men and women just are".{{sfn|Rochelle|2008|pp=415–416}} "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas", a parable depicting a society in which widespread wealth, happiness, and security, comes at the cost of the continued misery of a single child, has also been read as a critique of contemporary American society.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|p=159}}{{sfn|Rochelle|2008|p=414}} ''The Word for World is Forest'' explored the manner in which the structure of society affects the natural environment; in the novel, the natives of the planet of Athshe have adapted their way of life to the ecology of the planet.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=87–90}} The colonizing human society, in contrast, is depicted as destructive and uncaring; in depicting it, Le Guin also critiqued colonialism and imperialism, driven partly by her distaste for U.S. intervention in the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=87–90}}{{sfn|Reid|1997|pp=58–60}}

Other social structures are examined in works such as the story cycle ''Four Ways to Forgiveness'', and the short story "Old Music and the Slave Women", occasionally described as a "fifth way to forgiveness". {{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=38}} Set in the Hainish universe, the five stories together examine revolution and reconstruction in a slave-owning society.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lindow |first=Sandra J. |date=April 29, 2018 |title=The Dance of Nonviolent Subversion in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle |url=http://www.nyrsf.com/2018/04/sandra-j-lindow-the-dance-of-nonviolent-subversion-in-le-guins-hainish-cycle.html |journal=The New York Review of Science Fiction |issue=346 |access-date=May 8, 2018 |archive-date=September 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928044519/http://www.nyrsf.com/2018/04/sandra-j-lindow-the-dance-of-nonviolent-subversion-in-le-guins-hainish-cycle.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Rochelle|2001|p=153}} According to Rochelle, the stories examine a society that has the potential to build a "truly human community", made possible by the Ekumen's recognition of the slaves as human beings, thus offering them the prospect of freedom and the possibility of utopia, brought about through revolution.{{sfn|Rochelle|2001|pp=159–160}} [[Slavery]], justice, and the role of women in society are also explored in ''Annals of the Western Shore''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Oziewicz |first=Marek C. |date=2011 |title=Restorative Justice Scripts in Ursula K.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Reception ===
Le Guin received rapid recognition after the publication of ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' in 1969, and by the 1970s she was among the best known writers in the field.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2019}} Her books sold many millions of copies, and were translated into more than 40 languages; several remain in print many decades after their first publication.<ref name="Clute Guardian Obit" /><ref name="NYT obit" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Iannuzzi |first=Giulia |title=Un laboratorio di fantastici libri.

Le Guin was unusual in receiving most of her recognition for her earliest works, which remained her most popular;<ref name="LA Times 2009" /> a commentator in 2018 described a "tendency toward didacticism" in her later works,<ref name="NYT obit" /> while [[John Clute]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that her later writing "suffers from the need she clearly felt to speak responsibly to her large audience about important things; an artist being responsible can be an artist wearing a crown of thorns".<ref name="Clute Guardian Obit">{{Cite news |last=Clute |first=John |date=January 24, 2018 |title=Ursula K Le Guin obituary |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/24/obituary-ursula-k-le-guin |access-date=February 28, 2019 |archive-date=November 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109010500/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/24/obituary-ursula-k-le-guin |url-status=live }}</ref> Not all of her works received as positive a reception; ''The Compass Rose'' was among the volumes that had a mixed reaction, while the ''Science Fiction Encyclopedia'' described ''The Eye of the Heron'' as "an over-diagrammatic political fable whose translucent simplicity approaches self-parody".{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2019}} Even the critically well-received ''The Left Hand of Darkness'', in addition to critique from feminists,{{sfn|White|1999|p=5}} was described by [[Alexei Panshin]] as a "flat failure".{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45–50}}

Her writing was recognized by the popular media and by commentators. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented in 2009 that after the death of [[Arthur C. Clarke]], Le Guin was "arguably the most acclaimed science fiction writer on the planet", and went on to describe her as a "pioneer" of literature for young people.<ref name="LA Times 2009" /> In an obituary, Clute described Le Guin as having "presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century", and as having a reputation as an author of the "first rank".<ref name="Clute Guardian Obit" /> In 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as "America's greatest living science fiction writer".<ref name="NYT 2016">{{Cite news |last=Streitfeld |first=David |date=August 28, 2016 |title=Ursula Le Guin Has Earned a Rare Honor.

According to Bloom, Le Guin was a "visionary who set herself against all brutality, discrimination, and exploitation".<ref name="Fellow Writers" /> ''The New York Times'' described her as using "a lean but lyrical style" to explore issues of moral relevance.<ref name="NYT obit" /> Prefacing an interview in 2008, ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine described Le Guin as having written "some of the more mind-warping [science fiction] and fantasy tales of the past 40 years".<ref name="Vice Interview" />

Le Guin's fellow authors also praised her writing.

[[File:Kyle-cassidy-neil-gaiman-April-2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Neil Gaiman, pictured here in 2013, is among the many authors who have acknowledged Le Guin's influence on their own writing.]]
Le Guin's writings set in the Hainish universe also had a wide influence. Le Guin coined the name "[[ansible]]" for an instantaneous interstellar communication device in 1966; the term was later adopted by several other writers, including [[Orson Scott Card]] in the ''[[Ender Series]]'' and Neil Gaiman in a script for a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Ansible |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ansible |date=April 7, 2018 |editor-last=Nicholls |editor-first=Peter |editor-last2=Clute |editor-first2=John |editor-last3=Sleight |editor-first3=Graham |access-date=February 26, 2019 |archive-date=February 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228130330/http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ansible |url-status=live }}</ref> Suzanne Reid wrote that at the time ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' was written, Le Guin's ideas of androgyny were unique not only to science fiction, but to literature in general.{{sfn|Reid|1997|pp=51–56}} That volume is specifically cited as leaving a large legacy; in discussing it, literary critic Harold Bloom wrote "Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time".{{sfn|Bloom|1987}} Bloom followed this up by listing the book in his ''[[The Western Canon]]'' (1994) as one of the books in his conception of artistic works that have been important and influential in Western culture.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |title=The Western Canon |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-547-54648-3 |page=564}}</ref> This view was echoed in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', which wrote that "No single work did more to upend the genre's conventions than ''The Left Hand of Darkness''",<ref name="Paris Review" /> while White argued that it was one of the seminal works of science fiction, as important as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818).{{sfn|White|1999|pp=45–50}}

Commentators have also described Le Guin as being influential in the field of literature more generally. Literary critic [[Elaine Showalter]] suggested that Le Guin "set the pace as a writer for women unlearning silence, fear, and self-doubt",<ref name="Fellow Writers" /> while writer [[Brian Attebery]] stated that "[Le Guin] invented us: science fiction and fantasy critics like me but also poets and essayists and picture book writers and novelists".<ref name="Fellow Writers" /> Le Guin's own literary criticism proved influential; her 1973 essay "From Elfland to Poughkeepsie" led to renewed interest in the work of [[Kenneth Morris (author)|Kenneth Morris]], and eventually to the publication of a posthumous novel by Morris.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=16–17}} Le Guin also played a role in bringing speculative fiction into the literary mainstream by supporting journalists and scholarly endeavors examining the genre.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=3–4}}

Several prominent authors acknowledge Le Guin's influence on their own writing. Jo Walton wrote that "her way of looking at the world had a huge influence on me, not just as a writer but as a human being".<ref name="Walton Obit" /> Other writers she influenced include [[Booker Prize]] winner [[Salman Rushdie]], as well as [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], Gaiman, [[Algis Budrys]], Goonan, and [[Iain Banks]].<ref name="Fellow Writers" /><ref name="Paris Review" /><ref name="LA Times 2009" /> Mitchell, author of books such as ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'', described ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to "wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kerridge |first=Jake |date=November 17, 2015 |title=The fantasy that inspired David Mitchell |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/classic-childrens-books/david-mitchells-favourite-book/ |access-date=September 13, 2016 |archive-date=January 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129082111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/classic-childrens-books/david-mitchells-favourite-book/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Le Guin is also credited with inspiring several female science fiction authors in the 1970s, including [[Vonda McIntyre]].

=== Adaptations of her work ===
Le Guin's works have been adapted for radio,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Episode 1: The Left Hand of Darkness |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pkpgg |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414050721/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pkpgg |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |access-date=May 15, 2015 |website=BBC Radio 4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Shadow |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pktvt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623210625/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pktvt |archive-date=June 23, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2015 |website=BBC Radio 4}}</ref> film, television, and the stage. Her 1971 novel ''The Lathe of Heaven'' has been released on film twice, [[The Lathe of Heaven (film)|in 1979]] by [[WNET]] with Le Guin's participation, and then [[Lathe of Heaven (film)|in 2002]] by the [[A&E Network]]. In a 2008 interview, she said she considered the 1979 version as "the only good adaptation to film" of her work to date.<ref name="Vice Interview" /> In the early 1980s Hayao Miyazaki asked to create an animated adaptation of ''Earthsea''.

Rather than being directed by Hayao Miyazaki himself, the film was directed by his son [[Gorō Miyazaki|Gorō]], which disappointed Le Guin. Le Guin was positive about the aesthetic of the film, writing that "much of it was beautiful", but was critical of the film's moral sense and its use of physical violence, and particularly the use of a villain whose death provided the film's resolution.<ref name="Ursula K. LeGuin, Gedo Senki" /> In 2004 the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] adapted the first two books of the ''Earthsea'' trilogy as the miniseries ''[[Legend of Earthsea]]''. Le Guin was highly critical of the miniseries, calling it a "far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned", objecting to the use of white actors for her red-, brown-, and black-skinned characters.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Le Guin |first=Ursula K. |date=December 16, 2004 |title=A Whitewashed Earthsea: How the Sci Fi Channel wrecked my books |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2111107 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201030304/http://slate.com/id/2111107/ |archive-date=February 1, 2008 |access-date=February 7, 2008 |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}</ref>

Le Guin's novel ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' was adapted for the stage in 1995 by Chicago's [[Lifeline Theatre]].
