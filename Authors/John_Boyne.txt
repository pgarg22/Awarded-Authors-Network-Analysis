Boyne is [[homosexuality|gay]], and has spoken about the difficulties he encountered growing up gay in Catholic Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Boyne |date=2017-07-19 |df=dmy |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/at-swim-two-boys-is-a-great-irish-novel-a-gay-love-story-but-so-much-more-1.3159991 |title=''At Swim, Two Boys'' Is a Great Irish Novel, a Gay Love Story but So Much More |work=The Irish Times |access-date=1 February 2019 |quote=As a young gay man behind a bookshop counter, I watched the people who bought ''At Swim, Two Boys''—and there were a lot of them—and used it as a tool for flirtation. }} A reprint of John Boyne's introduction to ''[[At Swim, Two Boys]]'' by [[Jamie O'Neill]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Boyne |date=2018-02-22 |df=dmy |title=John Boyne on Homosexuality and Changing Attitudes |url=https://blog.whsmith.co.uk/rjsp18-john-boyne-on-homosexuality-and-changing-attitudes/ |work=WHSmith |access-date=1 February 2019 |quote=[...]not because I had any issue with being gay[...] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Boyne |date=2014-11-07 |df=dmy |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/john-boyne-the-catholic-priesthood-blighted-my-youth-and-the-youth-of-people-like-me-1.1991196 |title=John Boyne: 'The Catholic priesthood blighted my youth and the youth of people like me' |work=The Irish Times |access-date=1 February 2019 |quote=It's not easy to be a young, gay teenager[...] }}</ref> Boyne has spoken of suffering abuse in [[Terenure College]] as a student there.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boyne |first1=John |title=John Boyne: I was abused at Terenure College, but not by John McClean |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/john-boyne-i-was-abused-at-terenure-college-but-not-by-john-mcclean-1.4487538 |website=The Irish Times |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref>

He regards [[John Banville]] as "the world's greatest living writer".<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Boyne|author-link=John Boyne|url=https://twitter.com/john_boyne/status/1182759158887653376|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011213552/https://twitter.com/john_boyne/status/1182759158887653376|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 October 2019|title=John Banville... the world's greatest living writer, is someone who has a legitimate chance of winning the Nobel Prize|date=11 October 2019|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>

In August 2020, it was noticed that Boyne's latest novel, ''A Traveller at the Gates of Wisdom'', which takes place in the real world in the year 1 AD, contained a section in which a seamstress refers to the ingredients used to create [[dye]]s. However, the listed ingredients were entirely fictional, being taken from the 2017 videogame ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', and included items such as the "silent princess" flower, "octorok eyeballs", and "the tail of the red lizalfos". The error was initially posted on [[Reddit]], and after writer [[Dana Schwartz]] highlighted the segment on Twitter, theorizing that Boyne had done an Internet search for 'how to dye clothes red' and used the ''Zelda'' results without looking into the context, Boyne admitted his error, saying "I’ll leave it as it is. I actually think it’s quite funny and you’re totally right. I don’t remember but I must have just Googled it. Hey, sometimes you just gotta throw your hands up and say ‘yup! My bad!’"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/03/john-boyne-accidentally-includes-zelda-video-game-monsters-in-novel "John Boyne accidentally includes Zelda video game monsters in novel"], The Guardian, Aug. 3, 2020.</ref>

== ''The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas'' ==
{{Main|The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas}}
''The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas'' was published in 2006. The book has sold over seven million copies worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/is-making-a-living-just-from-writing-books-a-literary-fiction-1.2891065|title=Is making a living just from writing books a literary fiction?|last=McClements|first=Freya|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> A [[Heyday Films|Heyday]]/[[Miramax]] film adaptation, ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (film)|The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', was shot in [[Budapest]] in mid-2007 and released in late 2008. Directed by [[Mark Herman]], the film stars [[Asa Butterfield]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Vera Farmiga]], [[Rupert Friend]] and [[Sheila Hancock]]. In January 2020, the book was cited by the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], in a set of back and forth tweets between the museum and the author, as a book that should be avoided by those promoting accurate understanding of [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/avoid-john-boyne-s-holocaust-novel-auschwitz-museum-advises-1.4131194|title=Avoid John Boyne's Holocaust novel, Auschwitz Museum advises|last=McGreevy|first=Ronan|date=5 January 2020|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> In response, Boyne suggested that the Museum's criticism contained inaccurate information.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/07/john-boyne-defends-work-from-criticism-by-auschwitz-memorial|title=The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas author defends work from criticism by Auschwitz memorial|date=2020-01-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
His 2019 book ''My Brother's Name is Jessica'', about a young boy coming to terms with his older sibling coming out as a trans girl, was criticised over its portrayal of [[transgender]] topics and for [[misgendering]] people. In an article in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' promoting the book, Boyne explained that he was inspired to write it by a transgender friend of his, and had spoken to gender-identity professionals and "several trans people" to ensure he portrayed the book's subject matter authentically. However, he received further criticism for stating in the article that "I reject the word '[[Cisgender|cis]]'... I don’t consider myself a cis man; I consider myself a man." He added that "while I will happily employ any term that a person feels best defines them... I reject the notion that someone can force an unwanted term on to another".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/john-boyne-why-i-support-trans-rights-but-reject-the-word-cis-1.3843005|title=John Boyne: Why I support trans rights but reject the word 'cis'|date=13 April 2019|last=Boyne|first=John|newspaper=The Irish Times|quote=I reject the word “cis” ...

Writing in response to Boyne in ''The Irish Times'', Aoife Martin, director of the Trans Equality Network Ireland, asserted that "whether Boyne likes it or not, he is a cis man and he has [[cis privilege]]", and stated that "I haven’t read his new book".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/whether-john-boyne-likes-it-or-not-he-is-a-cis-man-with-cis-privilege-1.3860808|title=Whether John Boyne likes it or not he is a cis man with cis privilege|date=15 April 2019|first=Aoife|last=Martin}}</ref> Boyne deleted his [[Twitter]] account, claiming social media harassment, though he would later rejoin the site.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/i-was-warned-not-to-go-out-alone-author-john-boyne-in-genderlabel-row-38035355.html|title='I was warned not to go out alone' - author John Boyne in gender-label row|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=24 April 2018|first=Donal|last=Lynch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/john-boyne-deletes-twitter-account-after-trans-article-backlash-1.3862249|title=John Boyne deletes Twitter account after trans article backlash|date=16 April 2019|first=Amy|last=O'Connor|newspaper=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Some writers have supported him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/john-boyne-flying-flag-for-trans-people-even-if-he-is-holding-it-upside-down-1.3863397|title=John Boyne flying flag for trans people even if he is holding it upside down|date=20 April 2019|first=Chris|last=Rickets|newspaper=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/04/25/john-boyne-is-a-man-not-a-cis-man/|title=John Boyne is a man, not a ‘cis’ man|date=25 April 2019|first=Ella|last=Whelan|newspaper=spiked}}</ref>
