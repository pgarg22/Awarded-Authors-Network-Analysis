'''Katherine Irene Kurtz''' (born October 18, 1944) is an American [[fantasy]] writer, author of sixteen [[historical fantasy]] novels in the ''[[Deryni novels|Deryni]]'' series, as well as occult and urban fantasy. Resident in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for over twenty years, she now lives in [[Virginia]].

==Personal life==
Kurtz was born October 18, 1944 in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], where she also grew up.

She secured a scholarship to study chemistry and graduated with a B.S. in chemistry from the [[University of Miami]].

She married Scott MacMillan in 1983; they have one son. Within the following couple of years they moved to [[Ireland]].  Both later became naturalized Irish citizens.  Until 2007, they lived at Holybrooke (Hollybrook) Hall, in the largest of four houses formed from the original historic building, between [[Kilmacanogue]] and [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]] in [[County Wicklow]], Ireland.  Kurtz wrote, and Macmillan, who had worked in the film industry, took a role as a herald in the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]].  They put their Irish home on the market in 2006 for 3.5 million euro,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Parsons |first1=Michael |title=€3.5m for trophy home at base of Sugarloaf |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/3-5m-for-trophy-home-at-base-of-sugarloaf-1.1010887 |access-date=24 May 2019 |work=Irish Times |date=1 June 2006}}</ref> moving back to the United States in 2007, to an historic house in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurtz|first1=Katherine|title=Biography|url=http://www.rhemuthcastle.com/static/katherines-corner/biography/|access-date=3 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407182334/http://www.rhemuthcastle.com/static/katherines-corner/biography/|archive-date=7 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Writing career==
Kurtz is best known for the Deryni novels and short stories.  Her 1970 [[debut novel]], ''[[Deryni Rising]]'', was one of the first fantasy novels written in a mode closer to [[historical fiction]] than to mythology or legend, as was common in the then-popular [[high fantasy]] works such as those by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Writing in ''[[Strange Horizons]]'', Kari Sperring calls Kurtz the "first writer of secondary-world [[historical fantasy]]", noting her close attention to the importance of faith in pre-modern Western societies and her portrayal of magic as a formal, ritual practice as opposed to the "[[picaresque]] and informal" way magic was depicted in other fantasy of the time.<ref name="Strange Horizons 30 March 2015" />

She also wrote several occult [[alternate history]] novels in her ''Templar'' series, and [[urban fantasy]] novels in her ''Adept'' series.<ref name="Strange Horizons 30 March 2015">{{cite news|last1=Sperring |first1=Kari |title=Matrilines: The Woman Who Made Fantasy: Katherine Kurtz |url=http://strangehorizons.com/2015/20150330/sperring-c.shtml |access-date=3 April 2015 |work=Strange Horizons |date=30 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405043602/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2015/20150330/sperring-c.shtml |archive-date= 5 April 2015 }}</ref>
