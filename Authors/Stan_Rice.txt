'''Stan Rice''' (November 7, 1942 – December 9, 2002) was an American poet and artist. He was the husband of author [[Anne Rice]].

==Biography==
Rice was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], in 1942. He met his future wife in a high-school journalism class in [[Richardson, Texas]], and they married in [[Denton, Texas]], on October 14, 1961. They briefly attended together [[North Texas State University]] in Denton, before moving to San Francisco in 1962, to enroll at [[San Francisco State University]], where they both earned their [[Master of Arts|MA]].

Rice was a professor of English and Creative Writing at [[San Francisco State University]]. In 1977, he received the [[Academy of American Poets]]' Edgar Allan Poe Award for Whiteboy,<ref>{{cite web |title=Edgar Allan Poe Award |url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/129 |website=Poets.org |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803140245/http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/129 |archive-date=August 3, 2013 |date=11 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and in subsequent years was also the recipient of the [[Joseph Henry Jackson Award]] as well as a writing fellowship from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].{{fact|date=April 2020}} Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the [[Creative Writing]] program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Stan-Rice-poet-and-painter-2711376.php|title=Stan Rice -- poet and painter|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-08-03}}</ref>

It was the death of his and [[Anne Rice|Anne]]'s first child, daughter Michele (1966–1972), at age six of [[leukemia]], which sparked Stan Rice's becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled ''Some Lamb'', and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, who both eventually encouraged their son, novelist [[Christopher Rice]], to become a published author as well.

Rice, his wife and his son moved to [[Garden District, New Orleans]], in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery. In 1989, they purchased the Brevard-Rice House, 1239 First Street, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard.

Stan Rice paintings are represented in the collections of the [[Ogden Museum of Southern Art]] and the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]]. He had a one-person show at the James W. Palmer Gallery, [[Vassar College]], [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]. The Art Galleries of Southeastern Louisiana presented an exhibition of selected paintings in March 2005. Prospective plans are underway to present exhibitions of Rice's paintings at various locations in Mexico.

In ''Prism of the Night'',<ref>''Prism of the Night'' by [[Katherine Ramsland]], {{ISBN|0-452-26862-1}}</ref> [[Anne Rice]] said of Stan: "He's a model to me of a man who doesn't look to heaven or hell to justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?"

Poet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, ''Red to the Rind'', which was dedicated to [[Christopher Rice|Christopher]], in whose success as a novelist his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: "Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that."<ref name=angel>[http://www.angelfire.com/journal/riceans/RIP_stan.html In Memory of Stan Rice]</ref>

Knopf's [[Victoria Wilson]], who edits [[Anne Rice|Anne]]'s novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, ''Paintings'', was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, "The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet."<ref name=angel/>

==Personal life==
Rice was an atheist.{{refn|group=note|Reviewing Anne Rice's Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt, Matt Thorne noted: "In a long author's note, Rice explains how she experienced an old-fashioned, strict Roman Catholic childhood in the 1940s and 1950s, before leaving the Church at 18 due to sexual pressure and her desire to read authors she considered forbidden to her, such as Kierkegaard, Sartre, and Camus. Two years later she married a passionate atheist, the poet and artist Stan Rice, and in 1974, began a literary career that she now retrospectively views as representing her 'quest for meaning in a world without God'."<ref name="Thorne">{{cite news |last1=Thorne |first1=Matt |title=Out of darkness, into profit |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3649059/Out-of-darkness-into-profit.html |access-date=27 April 2020 |work=The Telegraph |date=25 December 2005 |page=7:4}}</ref>}}

==Death==
Stan Rice died of [[brain cancer]] at age 60, on December 9, 2002,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetschoice0000hirs|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/poetschoice0000hirs/page/323 323]|quote=Stan Rice poet and painter.|title=Poet's Choice|last=Hirsch|first=Edward|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=015101356X|language=en}}</ref> in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by [[Anne Rice|Anne]] and [[Christopher Rice|Christopher]], as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.
