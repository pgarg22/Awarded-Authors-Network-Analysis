'''Simon Corble''' is an English [[playwright]], [[Theatre director|director]] and performer. He is the great nephew of [[Archibald Corble]], the British fencer. He grew up in rural Oxfordshire, the son of a country vicar.<ref name="hound">{{cite book|last=Corble|first=Simon|title=The Hound of The Baskervilles: A Sherlock Holmes Play|year=2012|publisher=MX Publishing|isbn=978-1780922768}}</ref> The family moved north in 1974, and at the age of sixteen he played [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] at Lymm Grammar School, Cheshire and "never looked back". After training as an actor at Manchester Polytechnic (now [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]) he went on to create his own dramatic works. He has explored the potential of [[site-specific theatre]] in both his own works and those of others. On his website he writes that his strengths lie in "comedy, site-specific and promenade theatre, audio work, directing Shakespeare, and in creating unique theatrical experiences".<ref>[http://www.corble.co.uk/ Simon Corble's website]</ref>

==Writing==
According to Tony Craze and Katie Brannigan, Corble writes "in obeyance of the unities of time and space – applying realistic and parallel scales between worlds of performance and real environment (short promenades for short distances traveled in a fictional world, careful allotment of time at each stationary point). Temporal and spatial settings for his work were seen to be of paramount importance. For The Woodlanders, this writer's research included close study of the North of England countryside, until focusing on a site with the largest, most remote wooded area, accessible only by a mile and a half trek."<ref>Tony Craze and Katie Brannigan, [http://www.writernet.co.uk/images/441.pdf Writing for Moving Theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219091512/http://www.writernet.co.uk/images/441.pdf |date=19 December 2007 }}, 1998.
