==Contribution to drama and the arts==

Bridie was the founder of the [[Citizens Theatre]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Citizens.htm|title=The Citizens Theatre, 119 Gorbals Street, Glasgow|website=www.arthurlloyd.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA00277&t=2|title=TheGlasgowStory: Citizens' Theatre|website=www.theglasgowstory.com}}</ref> in [[Glasgow]], in association with joint founders art director Dr [[Tom Honeyman]] and cinema magnate George Singleton, who also created the Cosmo, predecessor of today's [[Glasgow Film Theatre]]. Many of his plays were staged at the Citizens Theatre between 1943 and 1960. Tony Paterson has argued that Bridie's output set the tone for [[Theatre of Scotland|Scottish Theatre]] until the early Nineteen-Sixties and gave encouragement to other Scottish dramatists such as [[Robert Kemp (playwright)|Robert Kemp]], [[Alexander Reid (playwright)|Alexander Reid]] and George Munro.<ref>Paterson, Tony (1981), ''Four Decades of Drama'', in Murray, Glen (ed.), ''[[Cencrastus]]'' No. 7, Winter 1981 - 82, pp. 43 & 44., {{issn|0264-0856}}</ref> [[Alan Riach]] described (in 2021) Bridie's plays as both serious and offering  'high spirited fun'; both contemporarily 'commercially successful' and yet 'perennially provocative'; raising open questions that Riach considers as [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]]. He admires the quality of writing in Bridie's 1939 autobiography ''One Way of Living'', calling it a 'modern classic'.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Riach|first=Alan|date=27 September 2021|title=Perennially provocative|page=27|work=The National|url=https://www.thenational.scot|access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref>

Bridie was the first chairman of the Arts Council in Scotland and was also instrumental in the establishment of the [[Edinburgh Festival]].<ref name=mavor/> In 1950 he founded the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art, part of the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland|Royal Conservatoire]] today.

Bridie worked with the director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in the late 1940s.  They worked together on:

* ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947).  Bridie originally wrote the screenplay, and [[Ben Hecht]] contributed some additional dialogue. But due to casting, the characters had to be changed. So [[David O. Selznick]] had to write another script.
