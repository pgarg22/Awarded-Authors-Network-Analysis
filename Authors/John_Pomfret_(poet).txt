'''John Pomfret''' (1667–1702) was an English [[poet]] and clergyman.

John Pomfret was the son of Thomas Pomfret, vicar of [[Luton]], and was educated at [[Bedford School]].<ref>[[Wikisource:Pomfret, John (DNB00)]]</ref> His mother was Catherine Dobson, the only surviving daughter of [[English Civil War]] painter, [[William Dobson]].  After graduating from [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] Pomfret was appointed rector of [[Maulden]] in [[Bedfordshire]] in 1695.

He published a number of [[poems]], and was regarded as significant enough in his time to be included by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Lives of the Poets.'' 'The Choice' is the poem for which Pomfret is now probably most remembered, especially as it was chosen by [[Roger Lonsdale]] as the first poem in ''The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse''.<ref>* {{cite book

}}</ref> It is a poem which celebrates an ideal life of genteel moderation in the country. Although Pomfret was married, 'The Choice' suggests the ideal life to be that of a bachelor, who can spend his days among the classics in his library and drinking (moderately) with two 'brave, gen'rous and witty' friends. However, he would also like there to be a 'witty nymph' living nearby whose 'conversation' would give his life a keen edge. Unfortunately for Pomfret this last sentiment led indirectly to his death at the young age of 35. He had travelled to [[London]] to seek preferment from [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Dr.Henry Compton]], [[Bishop of London]], but the bishop had been informed that in 'The Choice' Pomfret had advocated the keeping of a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. He therefore kept Pomfret waiting in London. It was here that Pomfret caught the [[smallpox]] which killed him. It was once believed by some critics that he was a follower of Albaudism {{citation needed|reason=No references to Albaudism elsewhere|date=February 2016}} but this appears to have been the result of a misinterpretation of his poetry.
