==Life and education==
Joseph Thurston was baptised in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]], as the eldest son of Joseph Thurston (1672/1673–1714), a lawyer, of [[Little Wenham]], [[Suffolk]], and Mary (baptised 1677, died 1736),<ref name="ODNB"/> the eldest daughter of Sir [[Isaac Martin Rebow]] MP (1655–1726).<ref>[https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/rebow-isaac-1655-1726 History of Parliament. Retrieved 16 June 2020.]</ref> His father was Recorder of Colchester, where the family had made their money as woollen [[draper]]s. Joseph the younger, the eldest son and fifth child in the family, was admitted to [[Westminster School]], London, in February 1716 and to [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] on 13 April 1720.

There is no record of his Cambridge graduation. Although admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] on 25 July 1719, he was not [[call to the bar|called to the bar]].<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Broome and Pope==
Thurston became friendly with [[William Broome]], a poet and translator, and the [[Church of England]] [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of parishes in Suffolk. Broome had been one of three who translated the [[Iliad]] into prose, and as an excellent Greek scholar, had joined Pope in translating several books of the [[Odyssey]], in a style almost indistinguishable from Pope's. However, his own verses were of moderate merit.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Thurston became known to Pope through Broome. His first book, ''Poems on Several Occasions'' (1729), contains love poems and light verse. ''The Toilette'' (1730, in two editions) and his mock-heroic poem ''The Fall'' (1732) resemble in form Pope's ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', but have merits of their own as well.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Death==
Thurston died unmarried on 22 December 1732 and was buried at Little Wenham a week later. He was survived by his mother, two sisters, and a younger brother, Thomas, who was in 1765 to sell the family seat at Little Wenham (now in the [[Wenham Parva]] parish of the [[Babergh District]] of Suffolk).<ref name="Wenham"/>

Thurston's fellow poet [[Thomas Edwards (critic)|Thomas Edwards]] wrote about him in a letter of 16 January 1733. Pope, Edwards declared, had seen in Thurston "the most promising Genius that has appeared in England a great while." Edwards also made specific mention of Thurston's sweetness of temper and modesty, and of his "exceedingly charming" conversation.<ref>Letter book of Thomas Edwards, 1717–1735, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. 92, p. 68. Quoted in ODNB.</ref>
