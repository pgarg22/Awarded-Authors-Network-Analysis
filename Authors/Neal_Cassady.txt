'''Neal Leon Cassady''' (February 8, 1926&nbsp;– February 4, 1968) was a major figure of the [[Beat Generation]] of the 1950s and the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movements of the 1960s.

He was prominently featured as himself in the "scroll" (first draft) version of [[Jack Kerouac]]<nowiki>'s</nowiki> novel ''[[On the Road]]'', and served as the model for the character Dean Moriarty in the 1957 version of that book. In many of Kerouac's later books, Cassady is represented by the character Cody Pomeray. Cassady also appeared in [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s poems, and in several other works of literature by other writers.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2021}}
Cassady was born to Maude Jean (Scheuer) and Neal Marshall Cassady in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/books/chapters/1119-1st-sandi.html | work=The New York Times | title=Neal Cassady | first1=David | last1=Sandison | first2=Graham | last2=Vickers | date=2006-11-19 | access-date=2010-05-20}}</ref> His mother died when he was 10, and he was raised by his [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] father in [[Denver, Colorado]]. Cassady spent much of his youth either living on the streets of [[skid row]], with his father, or in [[reform school]].

As a youth, Cassady was repeatedly involved in petty crime. He was arrested for car theft when he was 14, for shoplifting and car theft when he was 15, and for car theft and [[fence (criminal)|fencing]] stolen property when he was 16.

In 1941, the 15-year-old Cassady met [[Justin W. Brierly]], a prominent Denver educator.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassady|Moore|2004|p=1}}.</ref> Brierly was well known as a mentor of promising young men and was impressed by Cassady's intelligence. Over the next few years, Brierly took an active role in Cassady's life. Brierly helped admit Cassady to [[East High School (Denver)|East High School]] where he taught Cassady as a student, encouraged and supervised his reading, and found employment for him. Cassady continued his criminal activities, however, and was repeatedly arrested from 1942 to 1944; on at least one of these occasions, he was released by law enforcement into Brierly's safekeeping. In June 1944, Cassady was arrested for [[possession of stolen goods]] and served 11 months of a one-year prison sentence. Brierly and he actively exchanged letters during this period, even through Cassady's intermittent incarcerations; this correspondence represents Cassady's earliest surviving letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassady|Moore|2004|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Sandison|Vickers|2006|pp=42–46}}.</ref> Brierly is also believed to have been responsible for Cassady's first homosexual experience.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1996|p=79}}:{{verify quote|date=November 2021}} "Brierly had been sexually attracted to Neal, and managed to entice him into his first homosexual experience." {{harvnb|Sandison|Vickers|2006|pp=41–42}}:{{verify quote|date=November 2021}} "Brierly was most likely also a closet homosexual, and it was probably through him that Neal Cassady would first discover and explore gay sex and serve as a hustler in Denver's gay community." According to some reports, however, Brierly's sexual orientation was an open secret; see {{citation |last1= Weir |first1= John |title=Everybody knows, nobody cares, or: Neal Cassady's Penis |journal=[[TriQuarterly]] |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5075349/Everybody-knows-nobody-cares-or.html |date= 2005-06-22 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090620152311/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5075349/Everybody-knows-nobody-cares-or.html |archive-date= 2009-06-20 |url-status=dead}}.</ref>{{verify quote|date=November 2021}}

=== Personal life ===

[[File:Neal.png|thumb|alt=See caption|1944 Denver [[mug shot]] of Cassady]]

In October 1945, after being released from prison, Cassady married  16-year-old Lu Anne Henderson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/OBITUARIES/2009-06/1245474484|title=RootsWeb: OBITUARIES-L [OBITS] Neal Cassady}}</ref> In 1946, the couple traveled to New York City to visit their friend, [[Haldon Chase|Hal Chase]], another protégé of Brierly's. While visiting Chase at [[Columbia University]], Cassady met Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Asher|first1=Levi|title=Neal Cassady|url=http://www.beatmuseum.org/cassady/nealcassady.html|website=beatmuseum.org|publisher=Literary Kicks|access-date=5 November 2014|ref=6}}</ref> Although Cassady did not attend Columbia, he soon became friends with them and their acquaintances, some of whom later became members of the Beat Generation. While in New York, Cassady persuaded Kerouac to teach him to write fiction. Cassady's second wife, Carolyn, has stated, "Neal, having been raised in the slums of Denver amongst the world's lost men, determined to make more of himself, to become somebody, to be worthy and respected. His genius mind absorbed every book he could find, whether literature, philosophy, or science. Jack had a formal education, which Neal envied, but intellectually he was more than a match for Jack, and they enjoyed long discussions on every subject."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nealcassadyestate.com/faq-s.html|title=Neal Cassady Carolyn Cassady Frequently Asked Questions}}</ref>

[[Carolyn Cassady|Carolyn Robinson]] met Cassady in 1947, while she was studying for her master's in theater arts at the University of Denver.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/23/carolyn-cassady|title=Carolyn Cassady obituary|last=Campbell|first=James|date=2013-09-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Five weeks after Lu Anne's departure, Neal got an annulment from Lu Anne and married Carolyn, on April 1, 1948. Carolyn's book, ''[[Off the Road]]: Twenty Years with Cassady, Kerouac and Ginsberg'' (1990), details her marriage to Cassady and recalls him as "the archetype of the American Man".<ref name="Academic Search Premier">{{cite book|last=Ferlinghetti|first=Lawrence|title=Off the Road: My Years with Cassady, Kerouac and Ginsberg|year=1990|publisher=Nation|pages=652–653}}</ref> Cassady's sexual relationship with Ginsberg lasted off and on for the next 20 years.<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Allen|author-link=Allen Young (writer)|title=Allen Ginsberg: the ''Gay Sunshine'' Interview| page= 1 |location=Bolinas, California|publisher= Grey Fox Press|date= 1973}}</ref>

During this period, Cassady worked for the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] and kept in touch with his "Beat" acquaintances, even as they became increasingly different philosophically.

The couple eventually had three children and settled down in a [[ranch house]] in [[Monte Sereno, California]], 50 miles south of [[San Francisco]], where Kerouac and Ginsberg sometimes visited.<ref name=OffTR>{{cite book|last=Cassady|first=Carolyn|title=[[Off the Road]]: My Years with Cassady, Kerouac, and Ginsberg|year=1990|publisher=[[Black Spring Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-948238-05-4}}</ref> This home, built in 1954 with money from a settlement from Southern Pacific Railroad for a train-related accident, was demolished in August 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.28.97/slices-9735.html|title=Metroactive Features – Neal Cassady's House}}</ref>
In 1950, Cassady entered into a [[bigamy|bigamous]] marriage with Diane Hansen, a young model who was pregnant with his child, Curtis Hansen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/18/beat-poets-cassady-kerouac-ginsberg|title=Neal Cassady: Drug-taker. Bigamist. Family man|last=Cochrane|first=Lauren|date=2011-01-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Cassady traveled cross-country with both Kerouac and Ginsberg on multiple occasions, including the trips documented in Kerouac's ''On the Road''.

=== Role of drugs ===
Following an arrest in 1958 for offering to share a small amount of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] with an [[Undercover operation|undercover]] agent at a San Francisco [[nightclub]], Cassady served a two-year sentence at California's [[San Quentin State Prison]] in [[Marin County]]. After his release in June 1960, he struggled to meet family obligations, and Carolyn divorced him when his parole period expired in 1963. Carolyn stated that she was looking to relieve Cassady of the burden of supporting a family, but "this was a mistake and removed the last pillar of his self-esteem".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nealcassadyestate.com/carolyn.html|title=Carolyn Cassady|website=Neal Cassady Estate}}</ref>

After the divorce, in 1963, Cassady shared an apartment with Allen Ginsberg and [[Beat poetry|Beat]] poet [[Charles Plymell]], at 1403 Gough Street, San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Cassady first met author [[Ken Kesey]] during the summer of 1962; he eventually became one of the [[Merry Pranksters]], a group that formed around Kesey in 1964, who were vocal proponents of the use of [[psychoactive drug|psychedelic drugs]].{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

=== Travels and death ===
During 1964, Cassady served as the main driver of the bus named ''[[Furthur (bus)|Furthur]]'' on the iconic first half of the journey from San Francisco to New York, which was immortalized by [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book, ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'' (1968). Cassady appears at length in a [[documentary film]] about the Merry Pranksters and their cross-country trip, ''[[Magic Trip]]'' (2011), directed by [[Alex Gibney]].

In January 1967, Cassady traveled to Mexico with fellow prankster George "Barely Visible" Walker and Cassady's longtime girlfriend Anne Murphy. In a beachside house just south of [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Jalisco]], they were joined by Barbara Wilson and Walter Cox. All-night storytelling, speed drives in Walker's [[Lotus Elan]], and the use of [[LSD]] made for a classic Cassady performance&nbsp;— "like a trained bear," Carolyn Cassady once said. Cassady was beloved for his ability to inspire others to love life, yet at rare times he was known to express regret over his wild life, especially as it affected his family. At one point, Cassady took Cox, then 19, aside and told him: "[T]wenty years of fast living — there's just not much left, and my kids are all screwed up. Don't do what I have done."{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

During the next year, Cassady's life became less stable, and the pace of his travels more frenetic. He left Mexico in May, traveling to San Francisco, Denver, New York City, and points in between. Cassady then returned to Mexico in September and October (stopping in [[San Antonio]], on the way to visit his oldest daughter, who had just given birth to his first grandchild), visited Ken Kesey's [[Oregon]] farm in December, and spent the [[New Year]] with Carolyn at a friend's house near San Francisco. Finally, in late January 1968, Cassady returned to Mexico once again.

On February 3, 1968, Cassady attended a wedding party in [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Guanajuato]], Mexico. After the party, {{anchor|occasion of death}} he went walking along a railroad track to reach the next town, but passed out in the cold and rainy night wearing nothing but a T-shirt and jeans. In the morning, he was found in a [[coma]] by the tracks, reportedly by Anton Black, later a professor at [[El Paso Community College]], who carried Cassady over his shoulders to the local post office building. Cassady was then transported to the closest hospital, where he died a few hours later on February 4, four days short of his 42nd birthday.

The exact cause of Cassady's death remains uncertain. Those who attended the wedding party confirm that he took an unknown quantity of [[secobarbital]], a powerful [[barbiturate]] sold under the brand name [[Seconal]]. The physician who performed the [[autopsy]] wrote simply, "general congestion in all systems." When interviewed later, the physician stated that he was unable to give an accurate report because Cassady was a foreigner and there were drugs involved. "Exposure" is commonly cited as his cause of death, although his widow believes he may have died of [[kidney failure]].<ref>[http://www.nealcassadyestate.com/carolyn.html Neal Cassidy website] (retrieved 26 January 2009)</ref>

=== Children ===
Cassady has five known children: Robert William Hyatt Jr. (1945), Cathleen Joanne Cassady (1948), Jami Cassady Ratto (1949), Curtis W. Hansen (1950), and John Allen Cassady (1951). Robert, son of Neal Cassady and Maxine Beam, is an artist working in Arvada, Colorado. In February 2017, he was featured in ''Westword'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/arts/neal-cassadys-denver-legacy-includes-a-secret-son-robert-hyatt-8769924|title=Neal Cassady's Denver Legacy Includes a Secret Son, Robert Hyatt|first=Gregory|last=Daurer|date=7 February 2017|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> Cathleen, known as Cathy, is the mother of the only grandchild Neal met. Cathy, Jami, and John keep a website in memory of their parents and parents' "beat" friends.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_22835060/legacy-iconic-literary-figure-neal-cassady-lives-santa |title=The legacy of iconic literary figure Neal Cassady lives on in Santa Cruz with his son and daughter|access-date= June 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nealcassadyestate.com/|website=Neal Cassady Estate|title= Cassady Family's Website|access-date= June 27, 2014}}</ref>

Curt, born from a bigamous marriage with Diana Hansen, died April 30, 2014, aged 63. He was one of the co-founders of radio station [[WEBE]] 108, in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.milfordmirror.com/16186/obituary-curtis-w-hansen-63-of-milford-co-founder-of-webe-108/ |title=Curtis Hansen Obituary|work=Milford Mirror|access-date= June 27, 2014}}</ref>

== Writing style and influence ==
Cassady is credited with helping Kerouac break with his [[Thomas Wolfe]]-influenced sentimental style, as seen in ''[[The Town and the City]]'' (1950). After reading Cassady's letters, Kerouac was inspired to write his story in Cassady's communication style: "...in a rush of mad ecstasy, without self-consciousness or mental hesitation".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Asher|first1=Levi|title=Neal Cassady|url=http://www.litkicks.com/NealCassady#.VF1FmfnF-So|website=LitKicks.come|publisher=Literary Kicks|access-date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

This fluid writing style, reading more like a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] or hypermanic rapid-fire conversation than written prose, is best demonstrated within Cassady's letters to family and friends. In a letter to Kerouac from 1953, Cassady begins with the following fervent sentence;

<blockquote>Well it's about time you wrote, I was fearing you farted out on top that mean mountain or slid under while pissing in Pismo, beach of flowers, food and foolishness, but I knew the fear was ill-founded for balancing it in my thoughts of you, much stronger and valid if you weren't dead, was a realization of the experiences you would be having down there, rail, home, and the most important, climate, by a remembrance of my own feelings and thoughts (former low, or more exactly, nostalgic and unreal; latter hi) as, for example, I too seemed to spend time looking out upper floor windows at sparse, especially night times, traffic in females—old or young.<ref name="newyorker.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/neal-cassady-american-muse-holy-fool|work=New Yorker|title=Neal Cassady: American Muse, Holy Fool}}</ref></blockquote>

''On the Road'' became a sensation. By capturing Cassady's voice, Kerouac discovered a unique style of his own that he called "spontaneous prose," a stream of consciousness prose form.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Arthur and Kit|title=Kerouac and the Beats|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781569249345|url-access=registration|year=1988|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-55778-067-6}}</ref>

Cassady's own written work was never formally published in his lifetime, and he left behind only a half-written manuscript and a number of personal letters. Cassady admitted to Kerouac in a letter from 1948, "My prose has no individual style as such, but is rather an unspoken and still unexpressed groping toward the personal. There is something there that wants to come out; something of my own that must be said. Yet, perhaps, words are not the way for me."<ref name="newyorker.com" />

** "Porque No Tiene, Porque Le Falta" (1969), as "Willie Wings"
** ''[[Dog Soldiers (novel)|Dog Soldiers]]'' (1974), as "Ray Hicks"
** ''[[Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties]]'' (2007)
* In [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' (1966), Cassady is described as, "the worldly inspiration for the protagonist of two recent novels", drunkenly yelling at police during the famed [[Hells Angels]] parties at Ken Kesey's residence in [[La Honda, California]]. Although Cassady's name was removed from the book at the insistence of Thompson's publisher, the description is clearly a reference to the character based on Cassady in Jack Kerouac's works, ''On the Road'' and ''[[Visions of Cody]]'' (1951–1952).
* [[Tom Wolfe]] also chronicled Cassady's drunken yelling at police during Hells Angels parties in ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'' (1968).

=== In music ===
* [[Tom Waits]] recorded "Jack & Neal /California, Here I Come," on his 1977 album ''[[Foreign Affairs (Tom Waits album)|Foreign Affairs]]''.
* A [[New York City]]-based folk duo, [[Aztec Two Step]], in their 1972 debut album memorialized Cassady in the song "The Persecution & Restoration of Dean Moriarty (On The Road)".
* [[Death Cab for Cutie]] loosely based their song "Styrofoam Plates" from ''[[The Photo Album]]'' (2001) on the events of Cassady's life depicted in ''On the Road''.
* The [[Doobie Brothers]] guitarist and songwriter [[Patrick Simmons]] refers to Cassady in his song "[[Stampede (The Doobie Brothers album)|Neal's Fandango]]" as his incentive for taking to the road.
* Cassady lived briefly with [[The Grateful Dead]] and is immortalized in "The Other One" section of their song "[[That's It For The Other One]]", as the bus driver "Cowboy Neal".<ref>{{cite web|website=Dead.net|url=http://www.dead.net/song/other-one|title=Other One|access-date= August 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/other1.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514110543/http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/other1.html |date=2008-05-14 }}, retrieved 23 August 2007</ref>
* A second Grateful Dead song, "Cassidy" by [[John Perry Barlow]], might seem to be a misspelling of Cassady's name. However, in fact, the song primarily celebrates the 1970 birth of baby girl Cassidy Law into the Grateful Dead family, though the lyrics also include references to Neal Cassady himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html|title=Cassidy's Tale<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref>

== Published works ==
* "The Joan Anderson Letter", written by Cassady to Jack Kerouac (December, 1950): it was, until 2014, thought to have been lost, though an excerpt had been published in a 1964 edition of John Bryan's magazine ''Notes from Underground''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sandison|Vickers|2006|pp=282}}</ref> Associated Press reported in November 24, 2014, that the entire letter had been found.
