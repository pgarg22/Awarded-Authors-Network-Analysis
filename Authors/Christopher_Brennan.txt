Brennan entered the [[University of Sydney]] in 1888, taking up studies in the Classics, and won a travelling scholarship to [[Berlin]]. There he met his future wife, Anna Elisabeth Werth; there, also, he encountered the poetry of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].<ref name="bio"/> About this time, he decided to become a poet. In 1893 Brennan's article "On the Manuscripts of [[Aeschylus]]" appeared in ''The Journal of Philology''.<ref name=dab>{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Christopher John|Last=Brennan|shortlink=0-dict-biogBr-By.html#brennan1|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> Brennan began forming a theory about the descent of Aeschylus' extant manuscripts in 1888.<ref name="bio"/> 

Returning to Australia, Brennan took up a position as a cataloguer in the [[State Library of New South Wales|public library]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Martin|first=Sylvia|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/19580629|title=Ida Leeson - A Life : Not a blue-stocking lady|date=2006|publisher=Sydney : Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-74176-206-8|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Perkins|first=Cathy|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/236377323|title=The shelf life of Zora Cross|date=2020|publisher=Clayton, Victoria : Monash University Publishing|isbn=978-1-925835-53-3|language=English}}</ref> before being given a position as assistant lecturer in French and German in the department of modern languages and literature and in 1920 the position of  associate professor in German and comparative literature at the University of Sydney.<ref>[https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A27110 Christopher Brennan], austlit.edu.au.

After Brennan's marriage broke up in 1922, he went to live with Violet Singer, the 'Vie' of his later poems,<ref name="bio"/> and, as a result of both his divorce and increasing drunkenness, he was removed from his position at the University in June 1925. The death of Singer in an accident in the same year left him distraught, and he spent most of his remaining years in poverty. Brennan died in 1932 from cancer.<ref name="PLJW" />

==Legacy==
Brennan influenced Australian writers of his own generation and many who succeeded him, including [[R. D. Fitzgerald]], [[A. D. Hope]], [[Judith Wright]] and [[James McAuley]].<ref name= "bio"/> In remembrance, the [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]] established the [[Christopher Brennan Award]] which is presented annually to "an Australian poet who has written work of sustained quality and distinction".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060827231443/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/grants/program/10808-3580.htm Grants and Services detail], cultureandrecreation.gov.au.
