== Life and work ==
He was born in [[Liberec|Liberec (Reichenberg)]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. His mother Erna Syrowatka, née Tscherwenka, and his father Josef Syrowatka were both teachers. They changed their family name from the Czech Syrowatka to the German Preußler in 1941 during the Nazi occupation of the country. After he graduated school in 1942, in the midst of [[World War II]], he was drafted into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. Although he survived the military action on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he was taken prisoner as a 21-year-old lieutenant in 1944. He spent the next five years in various [[POW]] camps in the [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar Republic]].

After his release in June 1949, he found his [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|displaced relatives]] and his fiancée, Annelies Kind in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Rosenheim]]. They married that same year.

Between 1953 and 1970, he was initially a primary school teacher, then a school principal in [[Rosenheim]]. There his talents as a storyteller and illustrator were put to good use, and often the stories he told the children would later be written down and published.

He won the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]] in 1972 for ''Krabat''.

Preußler resided in [[Haidholzen]], near [[Rosenheim]].

Over 15.2 million copies of his books have been sold in the German language, and his works have been translated into over 55 other languages.

Having essentially retired from writing stories, which had become his main occupation, he undertook the relation of his experiences as a prisoner in the [[POW]] camps; those memoirs are to be published after his death.

==Legacy==
A [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] (grammar school) is named after him (the "Otfried Preußler Gymnasium Pullach", in [[Pullach]], Bavaria, Germany).
There is also a [[Grundschule (Germany) | Grundschule]] ([[primary school]]) in [[Bad Soden]] which bears his name.

On October 20, 2017, [[Google]] celebrated his 94th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/otfried-preulers-94th-birthday|title=Otfried Preußler's 94th Birthday|website=Google|date=20 October 2017}}</ref>
