'''Christian Falster''' (January 1, 1690 &ndash; October 24, 1752) was a Danish poet and [[philologist]], born at [[Branderslev]] (island of [[Lolland|Laaland]]).   He became [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the school at [[Ribe]].  He preferred to live there, refusing to accept better positions, and keeping his rectorship.  He published translations of [[Ovid]] (1719) and the [[Satires of Juvenal]] (1731); 11 original [[satire]]s on his times, often reprinted (1720–39); and in [[Latin]] a number of works, such as ''Viglia Prima Noctium Ripensiun'' (1721); ''Memori Obscur (1722); Amnitates Philologic'' (three volumes, 1821–32).

The editors of ''[[The Classical Journal]]'' wrote that:
<blockquote>
Falster thought that all learning should be brought to bear upon theology,
and, like [[Erasmus]], he {{sic|though}} that classical authors could contribute
much toward sound religion.  Falster's work covered a broad field from the
history of Greek literature on the one hand, to Latin [[lexicography]] on the
other, recognizing that philology, in the narrow sense, and literature
are inextricably interwoven.<ref>{{cite journal | title=General Comment | journal=The Classical Journal |volume=14 |issue=6 |date=March 1919 |pages=391–392 |jstor=3288423}}</ref>
