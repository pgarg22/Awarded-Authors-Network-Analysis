'''James Arthur Baldwin''' (August 2, 1924 – December 1, 1987) was an American [[novelist]], [[playwright]], [[essayist]], [[poet]], and [[activist]]. His essays, collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]'' (1955), explore intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in the [[Western world|Western society]] of the United States during the [[20th century in the United States|mid twentieth-century]].<ref>"[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/james-baldwin-about-the-author/59/ About the Author]."

Retrieved June 14, 2020.</ref> Some of Baldwin's essays are book-length, including ''[[The Fire Next Time]]'' (1963), ''[[No Name in the Street]]'' (1972), and ''[[The Devil Finds Work]]'' (1976). An unfinished manuscript, ''[[Remember This House]]'', was expanded and adapted for cinema as the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]–nominated documentary film ''[[I Am Not Your Negro]]'' (2016).<ref>[[Raoul Peck|Peck, Raoul]], Rémi Grellety, and [[Hébert Peck]], nominees.

Baldwin's novels, [[Short story|short stories]], and [[Play (theatre)|plays]] fictionalize fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex [[Social pressure|social]] and psychological pressures. Themes of [[masculinity]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[Social class|class]] intertwine to create intricate [[narrative]]s that run parallel with some of the major [[political movement]]s toward social change in mid-twentieth-century America, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Gay liberation|gay liberation movement]]. Baldwin's protagonists are often but not exclusively [[African Americans|African American]], and [[gay men|gay]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] men frequently feature as protagonists in his literature. These characters often face internal and external obstacles in their search for [[Social acceptance|social-]] and [[self-acceptance]]. Such dynamics are prominent in Baldwin's second novel, ''[[Giovanni's Room]]'', which was written in 1956, well before the gay liberation movement.<ref name="Gournardoo">{{cite book |first1=Jean-François |last1=Gounardoo |first2=Joseph J. |last2=Rodgers |title=The Racial Problem in the Works of Richard Wright and James Baldwin |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1992 |pages=158, 148–200}}</ref>

== Early life ==

By the time Baldwin had reached [[adolescence]], he had discovered his passion for writing. His educators deemed him gifted, and in 1937, at the age of 13, he wrote his first article, titled "Harlem—Then and Now", which was published in his school's magazine, ''The Douglass Pilot''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Children of Promise: African-American literature and art for young people|date=1991|publisher=Harry N.

Baldwin spent much time caring for his several younger brothers and sisters. At the age of 10, he was teased and abused by two New York police officers, an instance of the racist harassment by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] that he would experience again as a teenager and document in his essays. His stepfather died of [[tuberculosis]] in the summer of 1943, on the day his last child was born, just before Baldwin turned 19. Not only would the day of the funeral be Baldwin's 19th birthday, it would also be that of the [[Harlem riot of 1943]], an event portrayed at the beginning of his "Notes of a Native Son" essay.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baldwin |first=James |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsauteQRd7UC&pg=PA127 |chapter=Notes of a Native Son |title=The Price of the Ticket: Collected Nonfiction, 1948–1985 |publisher=Macmillan |year=1985 |isbn=9780312643065 }}</ref>

===Education===
Baldwin said, "I knew I was black, of course, but I also knew I was smart. I didn't know how I would use my mind, or even if I could, but that was the only thing I had to use." Baldwin attended [[List of public elementary schools in New York City|P.S. 24]] on [[128th Street (Manhattan)|128th Street]], between [[Fifth Avenue|Fifth]] and [[Madison Avenue|Madison]] Avenues in Harlem where he wrote the school song, which was used until the school closed.<ref>DKDMedia. July 30, 2014. {{Vimeo|title=David Baldwin Remembers P.S. 24 School|id=102143825}}.</ref>

As told in "Notes of a Native Son", when he was 10 years old, Baldwin wrote a play that was directed by a teacher at his school. Seeing his talent and potential, she offered to take him to "real" plays. This provoked a backlash from Baldwin's stepfather, as the teacher was white. Baldwin's mother eventually overruled his father, saying "it would not be very nice to let such a kind woman make the trip for nothing." When his teacher came to pick him up, Baldwin noticed that his stepfather was filled with disgust. Baldwin later realized that this encounter was an "unprecedented and frightening" situation for his parents:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Notes of a Native Son|publisher=Boston : Beacon Press|year=2012|isbn=978-080700611-5}}</ref>

<blockquote>It was clear, during the brief interview in our living room, that my father was agreeing very much against his will and that he would have refused permission if he had dared. The fact that he did not dare caused me to despise him. I had no way of knowing that he was facing in that living room a wholly unprecedented and frightening situation.</blockquote>

His [[Middle school|middle-school]] years were spent at Frederick Douglass Junior High, where he was influenced by poet [[Countee Cullen]], a leading figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and was encouraged by his math teacher to serve as editor of the school newspaper, ''The Douglass Pilot''.<ref>"[http://www.goodmantheatre.org/artists-archive/creative-partners/playwrights/james-baldwin/ James Baldwin | Artist Bios]." ''[[Goodman Theatre]]''. Chicago. 2020.</ref> (Directly preceding him as editors at Frederick Douglass Junior High were [[Brock Peters]], the future actor and [[Bud Powell]], the future [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]].)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pullman|first=Peter|title=Wail: The Life of Bud Powell|publisher=Bop Changes|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9851418-1-3|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=11}}</ref>

He then went on to [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] in [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]], in [[the Bronx]].<ref>Allyn, Bobby. July 21, 2009. "[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/dewitt-clintons-remarkable-alumni DeWitt Clinton's remarkable alumni]", ''City Room'' (blog). ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> There, along with [[Richard Avedon]], Baldwin worked on the school magazine as literary editor but disliked school because of constant [[List of ethnic slurs|racial slurs]].<ref>"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1473132/Richard-Avedon.html?pageNum=1 Richard Avedon]." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].'' October 2, 2004. Retrieved September 14, 2009:

"He also edited the school magazine at DeWitt Clinton High, on which the black American writer James Baldwin was literary editor."</ref>

===Religion===
During his teenage years, Baldwin followed his stepfather's shadow into the religious life. The difficulties in his life including his stepfather's abuse led Baldwin to seek [[consolation]] in religion. At the age of 14, he attended meetings of the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal Church]] and, during a euphoric [[prayer meeting]], he converted and became a junior minister. Before long, at the Fireside Pentecostal Assembly, he was drawing larger crowds than his stepfather had done in his day. At 17, however, Baldwin had come to view [[Christianity]] as based on [[false premise]]s, considering it [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] and racist and later regarded his time in the [[pulpit]] as a way of overcoming his personal crises.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=James|title=Letter from a Region in My Mind|journal=New Yorker|date=November 17, 1962|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind|access-date= March 24, 2018}}</ref> He left the church although his step-father wanted him to become a preacher.

Baldwin once visited [[Elijah Muhammad]], leader of the [[Nation of Islam]], who inquired about Baldwin's religious beliefs. He answered, "I left the church 20 years ago and haven't joined anything since." Elijah asked, "And what are you now?" Baldwin explained, "Now? Nothing. I'm a writer. I like doing things alone."<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=James|title=The Fire Next Time|year=1963|publisher=Vintage|location=Down at the Cross—Letter from a Region of My Mind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsauteQRd7UC&pg=PA363|isbn=9780312643065}}</ref> Still, his church experience significantly shaped his [[worldview]] and writing.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Chireau Y. |last=James |title=Baldwin's God: Sex, Hope and Crisis in Black Holiness Culture |journal=Church History |year=2005 |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=883–884 |doi= 10.1017/s0009640700101210|s2cid=167133069 }}</ref> In his essay ''[[The Fire Next Time]],'' Baldwin reflected that "being in the pulpit was like working in the theatre; I was behind the scenes and knew how the illusion was worked."<ref>Baldwin, James.

Baldwin accused Christianity of reinforcing the system of [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]] by palliating the pangs of [[oppression]] and delaying [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] until a promised [[afterlife]].<ref name=VOA/> Baldwin praised religion, however, for inspiring some Black Americans to defy oppression.<ref name=VOA>{{cite web |title=James Baldwin wrote about race and identity in America |url=https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/a-23-2006-09-30-voa1-83130322/126336.html |date=September 30, 2006 |work=Learning English |publisher=Voice of America }}</ref> He once wrote, "If the [[concept of God]] has any use, it is to make us larger, freer, and more loving.

While working odd jobs, Baldwin wrote [[Short story|short stories]], essays, and book reviews, some of them later collected in the volume ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]'' (1955). He befriended actor [[Marlon Brando]] in 1944, and the two were roommates for a time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Douglas|title=A Historical Guide to James Baldwin|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195366532|page=36}}</ref> They remained friends for over twenty years.

==Emigration==
[[File:jamesbaldwin.jpg|thumb|left|James Baldwin, photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1955]]
In 1948 [[New Jersey]], Baldwin walked into a restaurant that only served white people. When the waitress refused to serve him, Baldwin threw a glass of water at her which shattered against the mirror behind the bar.<ref>Thorsen, Karen, dir. 1989.

US: [[Thirteen (PBS)|Channel Thirteen-PBS]].</ref>

Disillusioned by American [[prejudice]] against black people, as well as wanting to see himself and his writing outside of an African-American context, he left the United States at the age of 24 to settle in [[Paris]]. Baldwin wanted not to be read as "merely a [[Negro]]; or, even, merely a Negro writer."<ref>Baldwin, James. 1985. "The Discovery of What it Means to be an American." Ch. 18 in ''[[The Price of the Ticket|The Price of the Ticket: Collected Nonfiction, 1948–1985]].''

In Paris, Baldwin was soon involved in the [[cultural radicalism]] of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]. He started to publish his work in literary [[Anthology|anthologies]], notably ''Zero''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wdVDKAZZFoC&q=New+York+Times+'Zero'+Themistocles+Hoetis&pg=PP5|title=Zero: A Review of Literature and Art|publisher=[[Arno Press]]|year=1974|isbn=978-0-405-01753-7|location=New York|issue=1–7}}</ref> which was edited by his friend [[Themistocles Hoetis]] and which had already published essays by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]].

Baldwin lived in France for most of his later life. He also spent some time in [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]].<ref>"[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrkihow?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571268/James_Baldwin.html James Baldwin]."

</ref> During his lifetime, as well as since his death, Baldwin was seen not only as an influential African-American writer but also as an influential [[Emigration|emigrant]] writer, particularly because of his numerous experiences outside the United States and the impact of these experiences on his life and his writing.

Baldwin settled in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]] in the [[Southern France|south of France]] in 1970, in an old Provençal house beneath the [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] of the famous village.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1440445.ece|title=Freelance {{!}} TLS|date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194351/http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1440445.ece|archive-date=March 4, 2016|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> His house was always open to his friends who frequently visited him while on trips to the [[French Riviera]]. American painter [[Beauford Delaney]] made Baldwin's house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence his second home, often setting up his easel in the garden. Delaney painted several colorful portraits of Baldwin. [[Fred Nall Hollis]] also befriended Baldwin during this time. Actors [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] were also regular house guests.

Many of Baldwin's musician friends dropped in during the [[Jazz à Juan]] and [[Nice Jazz Festival]]s. They included [[Nina Simone]], [[Josephine Baker]] (whose sister lived in Nice), [[Miles Davis]], and [[Ray Charles]].<ref>Roullier, Alain. 1998.

<blockquote>I'd read his books and I liked and respected what he had to say. As I got to know Jimmy we opened up to each other and became real great friends. Every time I went to southern France to play [[Antibes]], I would always spend a day or two out at Jimmy's house in St. Paul de Vence. We'd just sit there in that great big beautiful house of his telling us all kinds of stories, lying our asses off.... He was a great man.</blockquote>

Baldwin learned to speak French fluently and developed friendships with French actor [[Yves Montand]] and French writer [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] who translated Baldwin's play ''[[The Amen Corner]]'' into French.

The years Baldwin spent in Saint-Paul-de-Vence were also years of work. Sitting in front of his sturdy typewriter, he devoted his days to writing and to answering the huge amount of mail he received from all over the world. He wrote several of his last works in his house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, including ''[[Just Above My Head]]'' in 1979 and ''Evidence of Things Not Seen'' in 1985. It was also in his Saint-Paul-de-Vence house that Baldwin wrote his famous "Open Letter to My Sister, [[Angela Y. Davis]]" in November 1970.<ref>Baldwin, James. November 19, 1970.

=== 1950s ===
In 1953, Baldwin's first novel, ''[[Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)|Go Tell It on the Mountain]]'', a semi-autobiographical ''[[bildungsroman]]'' was published. He began writing it when he was only seventeen and first published it in Paris. His first collection of essays, ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]'' appeared two years later. He continued to experiment with literary forms throughout his career, publishing poetry and plays as well as the fiction and essays for which he was known.

Baldwin's second novel, ''[[Giovanni's Room]]'', caused great controversy when it was first published in 1956 due to its explicit homoerotic content.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=Douglas |chapter=Passing as a Cold War novel: anxiety and assimilation in James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room |editor1-first=Douglas |editor1-last=Field |title=American Cold War Culture |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2005 |pages=88–106 }}</ref> Baldwin again resisted labels with the publication of this work.<ref name="Balfour">{{cite book |first1=Lawrie |last1=Balfour |title=The Evidence of Things Not Said: James Baldwin and the Promise of American Democracy |url=https://archive.org/details/evidenceofthings00lawr |url-access=registration |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8014-8698-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/evidenceofthings00lawr/page/51 51] }}</ref> Despite the reading public's expectations that he would publish works dealing with African American experiences, ''Giovanni's Room'' is predominantly about white characters.<ref name="Balfour" />[[Image:James Baldwin Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|Baldwin photographed by [[Allan Warren]]]]

Baldwin's lengthy essay "Down at the Cross" (frequently called ''[[The Fire Next Time]]'' after the title of the 1963 book in which it was published)<ref>{{cite news| first=Sheldon |last=Binn| title=Review of ''The Fire Next Time''| date= January 31, 1963| newspaper= The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-fire.html }}</ref> similarly showed the seething discontent of the 1960s in novel form. The essay was originally published in two oversized issues of ''The New Yorker'' and landed Baldwin on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in 1963 while he was touring the South speaking about the restive [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Around the time of publication of ''The Fire Next Time'', Baldwin became a known spokesperson for civil rights and a celebrity noted for championing the cause of Black Americans. He frequently appeared on television and delivered speeches on college campuses.<ref name="Palmer, Colin A. 2005">Palmer, Colin A.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
Baldwin's next book-length essay, ''[[No Name in the Street]]'' (1972), also discussed his own experience in the context of the later 1960s, specifically the assassinations of three of his personal friends: [[Assassination of Medgar Evers|Medgar Evers]], [[Assassination of Malcolm X|Malcolm X]], and [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr|Martin Luther King, Jr]].

He concluded his career by publishing a volume of poetry, ''Jimmy's Blues'' (1983), as well as another book-length essay, ''[[The Evidence of Things Not Seen]]'' (1985), an extended reflection on race inspired by the [[Atlanta murders of 1979–1981]].

Baldwin returned to the United States in the summer of 1957 while the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|civil rights legislation]] of that year was being debated in Congress. He had been powerfully moved by the image of a young girl, [[Dorothy Counts]], braving a mob in an attempt to desegregate schools in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], and ''Partisan Review'' editor [[Philip Rahv]] had suggested he report on what was happening in the American South. Baldwin was nervous about the trip but he made it, interviewing people in Charlotte (where he met [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]].), and Montgomery, Alabama. The result was two essays, one published in ''Harper's'' magazine ("The Hard Kind of Courage"), the other in ''Partisan Review'' ("Nobody Knows My Name"). Subsequent Baldwin articles on the movement appeared in ''Mademoiselle'', ''Harper's'', ''The New York Times Magazine'', and ''The New Yorker,'' where in 1962 he published the essay that he called "Down at the Cross", and the ''New Yorker'' called "Letter from a Region of My Mind". Along with a shorter essay from ''The Progressive'', the essay became ''The Fire Next Time''.<ref name=Polsgrove>{{cite book |last1=Polsgrove |first1=Carol |title=Divided minds : intellectuals and the civil rights movement |date=2001 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=9780393020137 |edition=1st}}</ref>{{rp|94–99, 155–56}}

While he wrote about the movement, Baldwin aligned himself with the ideals of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Joining CORE gave him the opportunity to travel across the American South lecturing on his views of racial inequality. His insights into both the North and South gave him a unique perspective on the racial problems the United States was facing.

In 1963 he conducted a lecture tour of the South for CORE, traveling to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] and [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] in North Carolina, and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. During the tour, he lectured to students, white liberals, and anyone else listening about his racial ideology, an ideological position between the "muscular approach" of Malcolm X and the nonviolent program of Martin Luther King, Jr.<ref>Leeming, David, ''James Baldwin: A Biography '' (New York: Henry Holt, 1994), 134.</ref> Baldwin expressed the hope that [[socialism]] would take root in the United States.<ref>Standley, Fred L., and Louis H. Pratt (eds), ''Conversations with James Baldwin'', p. 131. September 1972, Walker: "Most newly independent countries in the world are moving in a socialist direction. Do you think socialism will ever come to the U.S.A.?
Baldwin: I would think so. I don't see any other way for it to go. But then you have to be very careful what you mean by socialism. When I use the word I'm not thinking about Lenin for example&nbsp;... Bobby Seale talks about a Yankee Doodle-type socialism&nbsp;... So that a socialism achieved in America, if and when we do&nbsp;... will be a socialism very unlike the Chinese socialism or the Cuban socialism.
Walker: What unique form do you envision socialism in the U.S.A. taking?
Baldwin: I don't know, but the price of any real socialism here is the eradication of what we call the race problem&nbsp;... Racism is crucial to the system to keep Black[s] and whites at a division so both were and are a source of cheap labor."</ref>

By the spring of 1963, the mainstream press began to recognize Baldwin's incisive analysis of white racism and his eloquent descriptions of the Negro's pain and frustration. In fact, ''Time'' featured Baldwin on the cover of its May 17, 1963, issue. "There is not another writer", said ''Time'', "who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of the racial ferment in North and South."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601630517,00.html|title=The Negro's Push for Equality (cover title); Races: Freedom—Now (page title)|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|periodical=TIME|issue=20|department=The Nation|date=May 17, 1963|volume=81|pages=23–27|quote=[American] history, as Baldwin sees it, is an unending story of man's inhumanity to man, of the white's refusal to see the black simply as another human being, of the white man's delusions and the Negro's demoralization.|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=Polsgrove/>{{rp|175}}

In a cable Baldwin sent to Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] during the Birmingham, Alabama crisis, Baldwin blamed the violence in Birmingham on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[J. Edgar Hoover]], Mississippi Senator [[James Eastland]], and President Kennedy for failing to use "the great prestige of his office as the moral forum which it can be." Attorney General Kennedy invited Baldwin to meet with him over breakfast, and that meeting was followed up with a second, when [[Baldwin–Kennedy meeting|Kennedy met with Baldwin and others]] Baldwin had invited to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment. This meeting is discussed in Howard Simon's 1999 play, ''[[James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire]]''. The delegation included Kenneth B. Clark, a psychologist who had played a key role in the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision; actor [[Harry Belafonte]], singer [[Lena Horne]], writer [[Lorraine Hansberry]], and activists from civil rights organizations.<ref name=Polsgrove/>{{rp|176–80}} Although most of the attendees of this meeting left feeling "devastated", the meeting was an important one in voicing the concerns of the civil rights movement, and it provided exposure of the civil rights issue not just as a political issue but also as a moral issue.<ref>Leeming, ''James Baldwin: A Biography'' (1994).</ref>

Baldwin also made a prominent appearance at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on August 28, 1963, with Belafonte and long-time friends [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Marlon Brando]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=A Brando timeline |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=103D33558F1FDBF4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |date=July 3, 2004 |access-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref>

Baldwin's sexuality clashed with his activism. The civil rights movement was hostile to homosexuals.<ref>{{citation |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&context=historydiss |title=Freedom Indivisible: Gays and Lesbians in the African American Civil Rights Movement |series=Dissertations, Theses, & Student Research, Department of History. |last=Leighton |first=Jared E. |issue=61 |publisher=University of Nebraska |date=May 2013 |access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/28/us/blacks-rejecting-gay-rights-as-a-battle-equal-to-theirs.html|title=Blacks Rejecting Gay Rights As a Battle Equal to Theirs|first=Lena|last=Williams|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 28, 1993}}</ref> The only out gay men in the movement were James Baldwin and [[Bayard Rustin]]. Rustin and King were very close, as Rustin received credit for the success of the March on Washington. Many were bothered by Rustin's sexual orientation. King himself spoke on the topic of sexual orientation in a school editorial column during his college years, and in reply to a letter during the 1950s, where he treated it as a mental illness which an individual could overcome. King's key advisor, [[Stanley Levison]], also stated that Baldwin and Rustin were "better qualified to lead a homo-sexual movement than a civil rights movement"<ref>Baldwin FBI File, 1225, 104; Reider, Word of the Lord Is upon Me, 92.</ref> The pressure later resulted in King distancing himself from both men. Despite his enormous efforts within the movement, due to his sexuality, Baldwin was excluded from the inner circles of the civil rights movement and was conspicuously uninvited to speak at the end of the March on Washington.<ref>Anderson, Gary L., and Kathryn G. Herr. "Baldwin, James (1924–1987)." ''Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice''. ed. 2007. Print.</ref>

At the time, Baldwin was neither in the closet nor open to the public about his sexual orientation. Although his novels, specifically ''[[Giovanni's Room]]'' and ''[[Just Above My Head]]'', had openly gay characters and relationships, Baldwin himself never openly stated his sexuality. In his book, Kevin Mumford points out how Baldwin went his life "passing as straight rather than confronting homophobes with whom he mobilised against racism".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mumford|first=Kevin|title=Not Straight, Not White: Black Gay Men from the March on Washington to the AIDS Crisis|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2014|isbn=9781469628073|pages=25}}</ref>

After a bomb exploded in a Birmingham church three weeks after the March on Washington, Baldwin called for a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience in response to this "terrifying crisis". He traveled to [[Selma, Alabama]], where SNCC had organized a voter registration drive; he watched mothers with babies and elderly men and women standing in long lines for hours, as armed deputies and state troopers stood by—or intervened to smash a reporter's camera or use cattle prods on SNCC workers. After his day of watching, he spoke in a crowded church, blaming Washington—"the good white people on the hill". Returning to Washington, he told a ''New York Post'' reporter the federal government could protect Negroes—it could send federal troops into the South. He blamed the Kennedys for not acting.<ref name=Polsgrove/>{{rp|191, 195–98}} In March 1965, Baldwin joined marchers who walked 50 miles from Selma, Alabama, to the capitol in Montgomery under the protection of federal troops.<ref name=Polsgrove/>{{rp|236}}

Nonetheless, he rejected the label "civil rights activist", or that he had participated in a [[civil rights movement]], instead agreeing with [[Malcolm X]]'s assertion that if one is a citizen, one should not have to fight for one's civil rights. In a 1964 interview with [[Robert Penn Warren]] for the book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', Baldwin rejected the idea that the civil rights movement was an outright revolution, instead calling it "a very peculiar revolution because it has to... have its aims the establishment of a union, and a... radical shift in the American mores, the American way of life... not only as it applies to the Negro obviously, but as it applies to every citizen of the country."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=James Baldwin|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/james-baldwin|website=Robert Penn Warren's Who Speaks for the Negro?

==Inspiration and relationships==
[[Image:Richard Wright.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Wright (1908–1960) photographed in 1939 by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]

As a young man, Baldwin's poetry teacher was [[Countee Cullen]].<ref name="Leeming 1994 442">{{cite book|last=Leeming|first=David A.|title=James Baldwin: A Biography|year=1994|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-394-57708-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780394577081/page/442 442]|oclc=28631289|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780394577081/page/442}}</ref>

A great influence on Baldwin was the painter [[Beauford Delaney]]. In ''[[The Price of the Ticket]]'' (1985), Baldwin describes Delaney as

<blockquote>... the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, he would have been recognized as my teacher and I as his pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow.</blockquote>

Later support came from [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], whom Baldwin called "the greatest black writer in the world". Wright and Baldwin became friends, and Wright helped Baldwin secure the Eugene F. Saxon Memorial Award. Baldwin's essay "Notes of a Native Son" and his collection ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]'' allude to Wright's novel ''[[Native Son]]''. In Baldwin's 1949 essay "Everybody's Protest Novel", however, he indicated that ''Native Son'', like [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', lacked credible characters and psychological complexity, and the friendship between the two authors ended.<ref>Michelle M.

I was not attacking him; I was trying to clarify something for myself." In 1965, Baldwin participated in a debate with [[William F. Buckley]], on the topic of whether the [[American dream]] had been achieved at the expense of African Americans. The debate took place at [[The Cambridge Union]] in the UK. The spectating student body voted overwhelmingly in Baldwin's favor.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Baldwin|first1=James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/images/blogs/papercuts/baldwin-and-buckley.pdf|title=The American Dream|date=March 7, 1965|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 6, 2020|last2=Buckley|first2=William F.|pages=32+}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|oFeoS41xe7w|James Baldwin Debates William F.

In 1949 Baldwin met and fell in love with Lucien Happersberger, a boy aged 17, though Happersberger's marriage three years later left Baldwin distraught. When the marriage ended they later reconciled, with Happersberger staying by Baldwin's deathbed at their house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence.<ref>Winston Wilde, ''Legacies of Love'', p. 93.</ref> Happersberger died on August 21, 2010, in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web

Baldwin was a close friend of the singer, pianist, and civil rights activist [[Nina Simone]]. [[Langston Hughes]], [[Lorraine Hansberry]], and Baldwin helped Simone learn about the Civil Rights Movement. Baldwin also provided her with literary references influential on her later work.

Clark|Kenneth Clark]] and [[Lena Horne]] and others in an attempt to persuade Kennedy of the importance of civil rights legislation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Diane|title=Miss Hansberry and Bobby K|date=June 6, 1963|volume=VIII|number=33|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2009/05/clip_job_miss_h.php|work=The Village Voice|access-date=November 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018054636/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2009/05/clip_job_miss_h.php|archive-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>

Baldwin influenced the work of French painter [[Philippe Derome]], whom he met in Paris in the early 1960s. Baldwin also knew [[Marlon Brando]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Huey P. Newton]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Jean Genet]] (with whom he campaigned on behalf of the [[Black Panther Party]]), [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Rip Torn]], [[Alex Haley]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Amiri Baraka]], Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Dorothea Tanning]], [[Leonor Fini]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Chinua Achebe]], and [[Maya Angelou]]. He wrote at length about his "political relationship" with Malcolm X. He collaborated with childhood friend [[Richard Avedon]] on the 1964 book ''Nothing Personal''.<ref>{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Brustein | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1964/12/17/everybody-knows-my-name/ | title = Everybody Knows My Name | work = New York Review of Books | date = December 17, 1964 | quote= ''Nothing Personal'' pretends to be a ruthless indictment of contemporary America, but the people likely to buy this extravagant volume are the subscribers to fashion magazines, while the moralistic authors of the work are themselves pretty fashionable, affluent, and chic.}}</ref>

Maya Angelou called Baldwin her "friend and brother" and credited him for "setting the stage" for her 1969 autobiography ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]''. Baldwin was made a [[Legion of Honour|Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur]] by the French government in 1986.<ref>{{cite news |last=Angelou |first=Maya |title=A brother's love |work=The New York Times |date= December 20, 1987 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-angelou.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=login | access-date =October 8, 2008}}</ref>

Baldwin was also a close friend of Nobel Prize-winning novelist [[Toni Morrison]]. Upon his death, Morrison wrote a eulogy for Baldwin that appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In the eulogy, entitled "Life in His Language", Morrison credits Baldwin as being her literary inspiration and the person who showed her the true potential of writing. She writes:

{{quote|You knew, didn't you, how I needed your language and the mind that formed it? How I relied on your fierce courage to tame wildernesses for me? How strengthened I was by the certainty that came from knowing you would never hurt me? You knew, didn't you, how I loved your love? You knew. This then is no calamity. No. This is jubilee. 'Our crown,' you said, 'has already been bought and paid for. All we have to do,' you said, 'is wear it.'<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrison |first=Toni |title=Life in His Language |work=The New York Times |date=December 20, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-morrison.html |access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref>}}

[[Fred Nall Hollis]] took care of James Baldwin on his deathbed. Nall had been friends with Baldwin from the early 1970s because Baldwin would buy him drinks at the [[Café de Flore]]. Nall recalled talking to Baldwin shortly before his death about [[racism]] in Alabama. In one conversation, Nall told Baldwin "Through your books you liberated me from my guilt about being so [[bigoted]] coming from Alabama and because of my homosexuality." Baldwin insisted: "No, you liberated me in revealing this to me."<ref>{{cite book |last=Farber |first=Jules B. |date=2016 |title=James Baldwin: Escape from America, Exile in Provence |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TtxODgAAQBAJ&q=nall+james+baldwin&pg=PT213|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455620951 }}</ref>

At the time of Baldwin's death, he was working on an unfinished manuscript called ''[[Remember This House]]'', a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.<ref name=mcgrawhill>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/19/books/mcgraw-hill-drops-baldwin-suit.html "McGraw-Hill Drops Baldwin Suit"].

==Legacy and critical response==
Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] characterized Baldwin as "among the most considerable moral essayists in the United States".<ref name="Bloom2007">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=James Baldwin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sb-ncpGi8wC|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-7910-9365-8|page=1}}</ref>

Baldwin's influence on other writers has been profound: [[Toni Morrison]] edited the [[Library of America]]'s first two volumes of Baldwin's fiction and essays: ''Early Novels & Stories'' (1998) and ''Collected Essays'' (1998). A third volume, ''Later Novels'' (2015), was edited by [[Darryl Pinckney]], who had delivered a talk on Baldwin in February 2013 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', during which he stated: "No other black writer I'd read was as literary as Baldwin in his early essays, not even [[Ralph Ellison]]. There is something wild in the beauty of Baldwin's sentences and the cool of his tone, something improbable, too, this meeting of [[Henry James]], the Bible, and Harlem."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/04/04/james-baldwin/|title=On James Baldwin|last=Pinckney|first=Darryl|date=April 4, 2013|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>

One of Baldwin's richest short stories, "[[Sonny's Blues]]", appears in many anthologies of short fiction used in introductory college literature classes.

In the 1986 work ''[[The Story of English]]'', [[Robert MacNeil]], with [[Robert McCrum]] and William Cran, mentioned James Baldwin as an influential writer of African American Literature, on the level of [[Booker T. Washington]], and held both men up as prime examples of Black writers.

In 1987, Kevin Brown, a photo-journalist from Baltimore founded the National James Baldwin Literary Society. The group organizes free public events celebrating Baldwin's life and legacy.

In 1992, [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], established the James Baldwin Scholars program, an urban outreach initiative, in honor of Baldwin, who taught at Hampshire in the early 1980s. The JBS Program provides talented students of color from under-served communities an opportunity to develop and improve the skills necessary for college success through coursework and tutorial support for one transitional year, after which Baldwin scholars may apply for full matriculation to Hampshire or any other four-year college program.

[[Spike Lee]]'s 1996 film ''[[Get on the Bus]]'' includes a black gay character, played by [[Isaiah Washington]], who punches a homophobic character, saying: "This is for James Baldwin and [[Langston Hughes]]."

His name appears in the lyrics of the [[Le Tigre]] song "[[Hot Topic (song)|Hot Topic]]", released in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2019/10/hot-topic-lyrics-le-tigre-who-is.html|title=57 Champions of Queer Feminism, All Name-Dropped in One Impossibly Catchy Song|first=Tammy|last=Oler|date=October 31, 2019|website=Slate Magazine}}</ref>

In 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] included James Baldwin on his list of [[100 Greatest African Americans]].<ref>Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). ''100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia''. Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-963-8}}.</ref>

In 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] created a first-class postage stamp dedicated to Baldwin, which featured him on the front with a short biography on the back of the peeling paper.

In 2012, Baldwin was inducted into the [[Legacy Walk]], an outdoor public display that celebrates [[LGBT]] history and people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyprojectchicago.org/2012_INDUCTEES.html|title=2012 INDUCTEES|author=Victor Salvo // The Legacy Project}}</ref>

In 2014, East 128th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues was named "James Baldwin Place" to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Baldwin's birth. He lived in the neighborhood and attended P.S. 24. Readings of Baldwin's writing were held at The National Black Theatre and a month long art exhibition featuring works by New York Live Arts and artist Maureen Kelleher. The events were attended by Council Member Inez Dickens, who led the campaign to honor Harlem native's son; also taking part were Baldwin's family, theatre and film notables, and members of the community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2014/jul/31/james-baldwin-gets-his-place-harlem/|title=James Baldwin gets his 'Place' in Harlem|last=Boyd|first=Herb |date=July 31, 2014|work=The Amsterdam News|access-date=May 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://arts.columbia.edu/coe/news/2014/baldwin-street-naming|title=THE YEAR OF JAMES BALDWIN: A 90TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION {{!}} NAMING OF "JAMES BALDWIN PLACE" IN HARLEM|publisher=Columbia University School of Fine Arts|date=July 24, 2014|access-date=May 24, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604034837/http://arts.columbia.edu/coe/news/2014/baldwin-street-naming|archive-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>

Also in 2014, Baldwin was one of the inaugural honorees in the [[Rainbow Honor Walk]], a [[List of halls and walks of fame|walk of fame]] in San Francisco's [[Castro District, San Francisco|Castro neighborhood]] celebrating [[LGBTQ]] people who have "made significant contributions in their fields."<ref name=":022">{{Cite web|url=https://quirkytravelguy.com/lgbt-walk-fame-rainbow-honor-san-francisco/|title=The Rainbow Honor Walk: San Francisco's LGBT Walk of Fame|last=Shelter|first=Scott|date=March 14, 2016|website=Quirky Travel Guy|language=en-US|access-date=July 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sfist.com/2014/09/02/castros_rainbow_honor_walk_dedicate/|title=Castro's Rainbow Honor Walk Dedicated Today: SFist|date=September 2, 2014|website=SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports|access-date=August 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810075052/https://sfist.com/2014/09/02/castros_rainbow_honor_walk_dedicate/|archive-date=August 10, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaysonoma.com/2016/07/second-lgbt-honorees-selected-for-san-franciscos-rainbow-honor-walk/|title=Second LGBT Honorees Selected for San Francisco's Rainbow Honor Walk|last=Carnivele|first=Gary|date=July 2, 2016|website=We The People|access-date=August 12, 2019}}</ref>

Also in 2014, The Social Justice Hub at [[The New School]]'s newly opened University Center was named the Baldwin Rivera Boggs Center after activists Baldwin, [[Sylvia Rivera]], and [[Grace Lee Boggs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2015/12/24/students-seek-more-support-from-the-university-in-an-effort-to-maintain-a-socially-just-identity/|title=Students Seek More Support From the University in an Effort to Maintain a Socially Just Identity|last=Moore|first=Talia|date=December 24, 2015|website=The New School Free Press|language=en-US|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>

In 2016, [[Raoul Peck]] released his documentary film ''I Am Not Your Negro''. It is based on James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript, ''[[Remember This House]]''. It is a 93-minute journey into black history that connects the past of the Civil Rights Movement to the present of [[Black Lives Matter]]. It is a film that questions black representation in Hollywood and beyond.

In 2017, Scott Timberg wrote an essay for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' ("30 years after his death, James Baldwin is having a new pop culture moment") in which he noted existing cultural references to Baldwin, 30 years after his death, and concluded: "So Baldwin is not just a writer for the ages, but a scribe whose work—as squarely as George Orwell's—speaks directly to ours."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-james-baldwin-pop-culture-20170223-story.html|title=30 years after his death, James Baldwin is having a new pop culture moment |first=Scott| last=Timberg|date=February 23, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

At the Paris Council of June 2019, the city of Paris voted unanimously by all political groups to name a place in the capital in the name of James Baldwin. The project was confirmed on June 19, 2019, and announced for the year 2020. In 2021, Paris City Hall announced that the writer would give his name to the very first media library in the [[19th arrondissement]], which is scheduled to open in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |language=fr-FR |title=L'écrivain James Baldwin va donner son nom à une future médiathèque de Paris |url=https://tetu.com/2021/01/20/lecrivain-james-baldwin-va-donner-son-nom-a-une-future-mediatheque-de-paris/ |website=TÊTU |date=January 20, 2021 |access-date=January 21, 2021}}</ref>
