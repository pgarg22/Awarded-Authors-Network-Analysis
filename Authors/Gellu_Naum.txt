'''Gellu Naum''' (1 August 1915 – 29 September 2001) was a [[Romania]]n poet, dramatist, novelist, children's writer, and translator. He is remembered as the founder of the Romanian [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] group. The artist Lygia Naum, his wife, was the inspiration and main character in his 1985 novel ''Zenobia''.

==Biography==
Born in [[Bucharest]], he was the son of the poet {{ill|Andrei Naum|ro}} (who had been drafted in [[World War I]] and died during the [[Battle of Mărăşeşti]]) and his wife Maria Naum née Rosa Gluck. In 1933, he began studying philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest]]. In 1938, he left for [[France]], where he continued his studies at the [[University of Paris]]. He took his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] diploma with a thesis on the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher [[Pierre Abelard]].

In 1936 (the year when he published his first book), Naum met [[Victor Brauner]], who became his close friend and who later introduced him to [[André Breton]] and his Surrealist circle in [[Paris]].

In 1941, he helped create the Bucharest group of Surrealists (which also included [[Gherasim Luca]], [[Paul Păun]], [[Dolfi Trost]], and {{ill|Virgil Teodorescu|ro}}). Naum was drafted into [[Romanian Army]] during [[World War II]] and served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''). Marked by his wartime experience, he was discharged in 1944, after he had fallen ill.

In December 1947, the Surrealist group succumbed to the vicissitudes of postwar [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] and successful [[Communist Romania|Communist takeover]] of Romania's government. As [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist realism]] had officially become Romania's cultural policy, he could only publish books for children (out of which the two books with Apolodor were reissued several times). Although he published several books in the line of Socialist realism, which he reneged on afterwards, he never stopped writing Surrealist poems, such as the 1958 poem composed of several parts ''Heraclitus'' (published in the 1968 volume ''Athanor'') or the esoteric manuscript ''The Way of the Snake'', written in 1948–1949 and published after his death, in 2002.

Between 1950 and 1953, he taught philosophy at the Agronomic Institute in Bucharest while working also as a translator. He translated works by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[René Char]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], [[Julien Gracq]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Jacques Prévert]], [[Stendhal]], and [[Jules Verne]].

He resumed his literary career in 1968, in the wake of a relative cultural [[liberalization]] under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s regime.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], he traveled abroad and gave public readings in France, [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Netherlands]]. In 1995, the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] appointed him scholar at the [[University of Berlin]]. Naum spent much of his final years at his retreat in [[Comana, Giurgiu|Comana]].
