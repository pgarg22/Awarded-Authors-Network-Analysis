'''Robbie Coburn''' (born 25 June 1994) is a contemporary Australian poet and writer.

==Life and work==

Coburn was born in [[Melbourne]] and grew up on his family's farm in [[Woodstock, Victoria]]. His father was a [[horse trainer]] and later a [[greyhound trainer]], which is a large focus of his poetry.
He was educated at [[Whittlesea Primary School]] and [[Assumption College, Kilmore]] and briefly studied at [[La Trobe University]] before dropping out of his degree. He began suffering from depression as a teenager and has struggled with addictions to alcohol and various drugs, as well as with self-harm.
He began writing poetry at the age of 14, influenced by the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. 

Coburn's first published poem appeared in anarchist poet [[Pi O]]'s literary journal ''Unusual Work'' when he was 17 years old<ref name="austlit">[http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A147275?mainTabTemplate=agentDefault], ''AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource'', 19 May 2014</ref> and he has since been published in many journals and magazines, including [[Poetry magazine|''Poetry'']], ''[[Meanjin]]'', [[Island magazine|''Island'']] and [[Westerly (Australian literary magazine)|''Westerly'']]. Some of his poems have also been included in major anthologies.

His first full-length collection of poems ''Rain Season'' was published in 2013.
A second collection ''The Other Flesh'' was published by [[UWA Publishing]] in 2019.

In 2021, Coburn published "Home for the Rodeo", an essay detailing his struggles with alcoholism and his love of the sport of [[rodeo]], on his website.<ref name="www.robbiecoburn.com">[https://robbiecoburn.com], ''www.robbiecoburn.com'', 27 October 2021</ref>
