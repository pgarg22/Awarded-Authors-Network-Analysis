'''Hai Zi''' ({{zh|c=海子}}; March 1964 – 26 March 1989) is the pen name of the Chinese poet '''Zha Haisheng''' ({{lang|zh|查海生}}). He was one of the most famous poets in Mainland China after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He committed suicide by lying on the rail in [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] at the age of 25.

==Biography==
Zha Haisheng was born in an agricultural family of a small village in [[Anhui Province]]. He spent his childhood in traditional Chinese rural areas when the whole country was involved in the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In 1979, he was enrolled in [[Peking University]] at the age of 15.<ref>http://www.mellenpress.com/mellenpress.cfm?bookid=6440&pc=9 An English Translation of Poems of the Contemporary Chinese Poet Hai Zi</ref> He began to write poems as a student in early 1980s. After graduation, he worked in [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. He kept sending his own poems written in an extremely dull environment of life to different newspapers and publishers but was hardly accepted. He remained unknown to common readers until his death.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Hai Zi was fascinated with [[Tibetan culture]] and [[Qigong]] in his last years. He ended his life by lying on the rail not far from [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] near his 25th birthday.<ref>Bingbin, Han (March 23, 2012).

==Legacy==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Hai Zi has become one of the most quoted poets after the [[New Culture Movement]]. His mystical life and death remain an important topic of Chinese literature and society. A cult of Hai Zi involves young people from all over China since the 1990s, though he is still not entirely accepted by older experts.

Hai Zi's poems have a strong influence on the popular culture in Mainland China. Some of his poems have been set to songs.

Hai Zi's poem ''Facing the Sea, with Spring Blossoms'' is inferred and mentioned several times in the Hong Kong movie ''[[McDull, Prince de la Bun]]''.

Many coastal places of China are regarded as the one described in the poem ''Facing the Sea, with Spring Blossoms''. But according to some research about the life of the poet, the beach of [[Xichong, Shenzhen|Xichong]] in [[Shenzhen]] is the most probable place.

==Works==
Hai Zi wrote several long poems, "choral operas" and countless short poems in his brief life. His style is generally described as "anachronism". Many of his short poems contain symbolic images like ''Land'', ''Sea'' and ''Wheat field'' and recall the ideals of the ancient Chinese pastoral poet [[Tao Yuanming]].<ref>http://society.qianlong.com/4330/2008/03/22/3522@4361721_1.htm(Chinese) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908015934/http://society.qianlong.com/4330/2008/03/22/3522@4361721_1.htm |date=2009-09-08 }}</ref> Hai Zi was also obviously influenced by Western philosophy and arts, especially [[Nietzsche]] and [[Van Gogh]]. And the strong sense of [[mysticism]] in all of his works is probably one of the most important characteristics which turned him into a unique figure of Chinese literature.

Some of his poems have been translated into English. A bilingual book of his poems ''Over Autumn Rooftops'', translated by Dan Murphy, was published in 2010 by Host Publications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lark|first=Lolita|title=Over Autumn Rooftops|journal=The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities|date=Fall 2010|issue=205|url=http://www.ralphmag.org/GE/hai-zi.html}}</ref> A new bilingual book, ''Ripened Wheat: Selected Poems of Hai Zi'', translated by Ye Chun, was out from the Bitter Oleander Press in 2015.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In Italy, Del Vecchio Editore celebrated the 30th anniversary of Haizi’s death publishing, for the first time in Italian, a selection of 80 poems (“Un uomo felice“, 2019) translated by Francesco De Luca.
