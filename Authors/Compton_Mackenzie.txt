'''Sir Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} (17 January 1883 – 30 November 1972) was an English-born Scottish writer of fiction, biography, histories and a memoir, as well as a cultural commentator, raconteur and lifelong [[Scottish independence|Scottish nationalist]]. He was one of the co-founders in 1928 of the [[National Party of Scotland]] along with [[Christopher Murray Grieve|Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham|R. B. Cunninghame Graham]] and [[John MacCormick]]. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1952.

==Background==
Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie was born in [[West Hartlepool]], [[County Durham]], England, into a theatrical family of Mackenzies, many of whose members used Compton as their stage surname, starting with his English grandfather [[Henry Compton (actor)|Henry Compton]], a well-known [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor of the [[Victorian era]]. His father, [[Edward Compton (actor)|Edward Compton]], and mother, [[Virginia Frances Bateman]], were actors and theatre company managers; his sister, [[Fay Compton]], (whose son was [[Anthony Pelissier]], Compton's nephew), starred in many of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s plays, including ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''. He was educated at [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]], London, and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], from where he graduated with a degree in Modern History.<ref name="Undiscovered Scotland">{{cite web|title=Compton Mackenzie|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/mac/comptonmackenzie.html|website=Undiscovered Scotland: The Ultimate Online Guide|publisher=Undiscovered Scotland|access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>

==Writing==

Mackenzie is perhaps best known for two comic novels set in Scotland: ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]'' (1947) set in the [[Hebrides]], and ''[[The Monarch of the Glen (novel)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'' (1941) set in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. They were the sources of a successful [[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|film]] and a [[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|television series]] respectively. He published almost a hundred books on different subjects, including ten volumes of autobiography: ''My Life and Times'' (1963–71). He wrote history (on the [[Battle of Marathon]] and the [[Battle of Salamis]]), biography (''Mr Roosevelt'', a 1943 biography of FDR), literary criticism, satires, [[apologia]] (''Sublime Tobacco'' 1957), children's stories, poetry and so on. Of his fiction, ''[[The Four Winds of Love]]'' is sometimes considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.<ref name="The Spectator">{{cite news|last1=Massie|first1=Allan|title=The magnum opus of Compton Mackenzie|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/202191/the-magnum-opus-of-compton-mackenzie/|access-date=31 March 2015|work=The Spectator|date=26 September 2007}}</ref>

He was admired by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], whose first book, ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'', was written under the literary influence of Compton.<ref>{{cite journal

''[[Sinister Street]]'', his lengthy 1913–14 ''[[Bildungsroman]]'', influenced [[George Orwell]] and [[Cyril Connolly]], who both read it as schoolboys.<ref>Cyril Connolly, ''Enemies of Promise'' (White Samite), Routledge, London, 1938.</ref><ref>Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume I Letter to Connolly 14 December 1938'', Secker & Warburg, 1968.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref> [[Max Beerbohm]] praised Mackenzie's writing for vividness and emotional reality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120315224848/http://www.faber.co.uk/article/2009/6/allan-massie-on-compton-mackenzie/ "On Compton Mackenzie"] by Allan Massie, faber.co.uk; accessed 10 August 2014.</ref> [[Frank Swinnerton]], a literary critic, comments on Mackenzie's "detail and wealth of reference". [[John Betjeman]] said of it, "This has always seemed to me one of the best novels of the best period in English novel writing." [[Henry James]] thought it to be the most remarkable book written by a young author in his lifetime.

After his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1914, Mackenzie explored religious themes in a trilogy of novels, ''The Altar Steps'' (1922), ''The Parson's Progress'' (1923) and ''The Heavenly Ladder'' (1924). Following his time on [[Capri]], socialising with the gay exiles there, he treated the homosexuality of a politician sensitively in ''[[Thin Ice (novel)|Thin Ice]]'' (1956). He was the literary critic for the London-based national newspaper ''[[Daily Mail]]''.<ref name="Britannica Online for Kids">{{cite web|title=Compton Mackenzie|url=http://kids.britannica.com/comptons/article-9328757/Compton-Mackenzie|website=Compton's by Britannica.

''[[The Lunatic Republic]]'' (1959) is a political satire. For the version of English spoken by the inhabitants of Lunamania on the far side of the moon, Mackenzie invented over 150 new words.

==''Greek Memories''==
Mackenzie worked as an actor, political activist and broadcaster. He served with [[British Intelligence]] in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during the [[First World War]], later publishing four books on his experiences. According to these books, he was commissioned in the [[Royal Marines]], rising to the rank of captain. His ill-health making front-line service impractical, he was assigned counter-espionage work during the [[Gallipoli campaign]],<ref>Sir Compton Mackenzie: ''Gallipoli Memories''</ref> and in 1916 built up a considerable counter-intelligence network in Athens, Greece then being neutral.<ref>Sir Compton Mackenzie: ''Athenian Memories''.</ref> He is alleged to have taken part in an attempt to assassinate the King by poison in August 1916, during which the royal palace was to be surrounded by fire to prevent him escaping.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXInAQAAMAAJ&q=Compton+Mackenzie+attempt+to+kill+king+of+Greece|title=British Secret Service|first=Richard|last=Deacon|date=23 November 1991|publisher=Grafton|isbn=9780586209851|via=Google Books}}</ref> While his secret service work seems to have been valued highly by his superiors, including Sir [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming]], his passionate political views, especially his support for the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]], made him a controversial figure and he was expelled from [[Athens]] following the [[Noemvriana]].<ref>Sir Compton Mackenzie, ''Greek Memories''</ref>

In 1917, he founded the Aegean Intelligence Service, and enjoyed considerable autonomy for some months as its director. He was offered the Presidency of the Republic of [[Cerigo]], which was briefly independent while Greece was split between Royalists and [[Venizelists]], but declined the office. He was recalled in September 1917. Smith-Cumming considered appointing him as his deputy, but withdrew the suggestion after opposition from within his own service, and Mackenzie played no further active role in the war. In 1919, he was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE), and was also honoured with the French [[Legion of Honour]], the [[Serbia]]n [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]], and the Greek [[Order of the Redeemer]].<ref>Sir Compton Mackenzie, ''Aegean Memories''</ref>

After the publication of his ''Greek Memories'' in 1932, he was prosecuted the following year at the Old Bailey under the [[Official Secrets Act]] for quoting from supposedly secret documents. His account of the trial, vividly described, is in Octave Seven (1931–38) of his autobiography: the result was a fine of £100 and (prosecution) costs of £100. His own costs were over £1,000. Mackenzie states that a plea-bargain (described in the text as "an arrangement") had been reached with the judge prior to the trial: in exchange for his pleading guilty, he would be fined £500 with £500 costs. However [[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Sir Thomas Inskip]], then attorney general who prosecuted the case, succeeded in annoying the trial judge to such an extent that he then reduced the penalties to a token amount. Even so, the costs of his defence and the withdrawal from sale of ''Greek Memories'' left Mackenzie out of pocket and an attempt was made to ask the authorities exactly which passages in the book they objected to so it could be re-issued with the offending material removed. This approach was rebuffed.<ref>Sir Compton Mackenzie: ''Octave Seven'' p.104</ref> In Octave Eight, covering the years 1939–45, Mackenzie recounts that the matter was raised in Parliament and a new version of ''Greek Memories'' was eventually published in 1939.<ref>Sir Compton Mackenzie: ''Octave Eight'' pp. 14,15</ref>
However, in spite of the withdrawal of the 1st edition a copy had already been deposited at the British Museum<ref name="Official stamp">The official stamp in the book is dated 22 November 1932</ref> (which then contained what is now the independent British Library) but was not given a general catalogue reference making it effectively impossible to access. In 1994 ''The Guardian'' newspaper published an article about this anomaly ''The muzzling of Compton Mackenzie – 62 years on''.<ref name="The Guardian">The Guardian 8 January 1994, page 6. Available on microfiche at the British Library and via ProQuest</ref> Following this the 1932 edition was entered in the British Library's public catalogue.<ref name="Shelfmark">Shelfmark Cup.410.f.383</ref> 
In 2011 Biteback published the original 1932 edition of ''Greek Memories'', including the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] memo detailing the offending passages of the book.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120627204254/http://www.bitebackpublishing.com/products/187 ''Greek Memories'' backstory], bitebackpublishing.com; accessed 10 August 2014.</ref>

He was president of the [[Croquet Association]] from 1953–66. He was president of the Siamese Cat Club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faber.co.uk/author/compton-mackenzie/|title=Compton Mackenzie &#124; Authors &#124; Faber & Faber|website=www.faber.co.uk}}</ref> He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1956 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the [[King's Theatre, Hammersmith|King's Theatre]], [[Hammersmith]], London.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In 1923 he and his brother-in-law [[Christopher Stone (broadcaster)|Christopher Stone]] founded ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', the still-influential [[European classical music|classical music]] magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Compton Mackenzie|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/354846/Compton-Mackenzie|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref> Mackenzie continued to edit the magazine until 1961.

A strong supporter of [[Edward VIII]], Mackenzie was a leading member of the Octavians, a minor society that campaigned in support of Edward VIII and for his return to the UK after he became the Duke of Windsor.<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''"Hurrah for the Blackshirts!"

==Capri==
Between 1913 and 1920 he lived with his wife, [[Faith Compton Mackenzie|Faith]], on [[Capri]] at [[Villa Solitaria]], and returned to visit in later years. This Italian island near [[Sorrento]] was known to be tolerant not just of foreigners in general, but of artists and homosexuals in particular. He became friends with the writer [[Somerset Maugham]], a frequent visitor to the island. Faith had an affair with the Italian pianist [[Renata Borgatti]],<ref>''Infinite variety: the life and legend of the Marchesa Casati'', by Scot D. Ryersson, Michael Orlando Yaccarino, p. 99<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> who was connected to [[Romaine Brooks]].

Compton Mackenzie's observations on the local life of the Italian islanders and foreign residents led to at least two novels, ''[[Vestal Fire]]'' (1927) and ''[[Extraordinary Women (novel)|Extraordinary Women]]'' (1928). The latter, a [[roman à clef]] about a group of lesbians arriving on the island of Sirene, a fictional version of Capri,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Literature of Lesbianism: A Historical Anthology from Ariosto to Stonewall|first=Terry|last=Castle|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-231-12511-9|page=38 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capridream.com/ing/per-campton.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708134336/http://www.capridream.com/ing/per-campton.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 July 2011|title=Isola di Capri - Personaggi e dimore: Compton Mackenzie|date=8 July 2011}}</ref> was published in Britain in the same year as two other ground-breaking novels with lesbian themes, [[Virginia Woolf]]'s love letter to [[Vita Sackville-West]], ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', and [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s controversial polemic, ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', but Mackenzie's satire did not attract legal attention.<ref>{{cite book|title=A history of homosexuality in Europe: Berlin, London, Paris, 1919–1939, volume I & II| volume=1–2|series=A History of Homosexuality in Europe|first=Florence|last=Tamagne|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2006|isbn=0-87586-355-8|page=322}}</ref> He was a friend of [[Axel Munthe]], who built [[Villa San Michele]], and [[Edwin Cerio]], who later became mayor of Capri.<ref>[http://www.capri.com/en/personaggi Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719045403/http://www.capri.com/en/personaggi |date=19 July 2006 }}, capri.com; accessed 10 August 2014.</ref>

Mackenzie went to great lengths to trace the steps of his ancestors back to his spiritual home in the Highlands, and displayed a deep and tenacious attachment to [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic culture]] throughout his long and very colourful life. As his biographer, [[Andro Linklater]], commented, "Mackenzie wasn't born a Scot, and he didn't sound like a Scot. But nevertheless his imagination was truly Scottish." He was an ardent [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], the third Governor-General of the [[Royal Stuart Society]], and a co-founder of the [[National Party of Scotland]]. He became a member of the Scottish Arts Club in 1929.<ref>Graves, Charles (1974), ''Men of Letters'', in ''The Scottish Arts Club, Edinburgh, 1874 - 1974'', The Scottish Arts Club, Edinburgh, p. 52.</ref> He was rector of [[University of Glasgow]] from 1931 to 1934, defeating [[Oswald Mosley]], who later led the [[British Union of Fascists]], in his bid for the job.<ref>[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1052&type=P Compton Mackenzie profile], universitystory.gla.ac.uk; accessed 10 August 2014.</ref>

From 1920–23, Mackenzie was the [[List of tenants of Herm|Tenant of Herm]] and [[Jethou]]. He built a house on [[Barra]], Scottish Isles, in the 1930s. On Barra, he gained inspiration and found creative solitude, and befriended a great number of people that he described as "the aristocrats of democracy". {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

He was a founding member of the short-lived secret organisation [[Clann Albain]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linklater |first1=Andro |title=Compton Mackenzie: A Life |date=1992 |publisher=Hogarth Press |isbn=0701209844 |page=234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMfyAAAAMAAJ&q=Clann+Albain}}</ref>

==Private life==
Mackenzie was married three times. On 30 November 1905 (aged 22), he married [[Faith Compton Mackenzie|Faith Stone]] in [[St Saviour's, Pimlico]]: they remained married for more than 50 years, until her death.<ref name="wed">{{cite news|title=Marriages: 40th Anniversary|work=The Times|date=30 November 1945|language=en}}</ref> In 1962 (aged 79), he married Christina MacSween, who died the following year. Lastly, he married his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]], Lilian MacSween in 1965 (aged 82).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Jack|title=The Express Years|date=1994|publisher=Black & White Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1873631367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XE_KAwAAQBAJ|access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref>

Mackenzie was a keen supporter of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]]. Although from the north east of England, he "was influenced in the choice of Albion as 'my' team by the fact that their ground was romantically called The Hawthorns and that they were nicknamed the Throstles".<ref>[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/7th-may-1954/18/compton-mackenzie Profile], spectator.co.uk; accessed 10 August 2014.</ref>

He was also a keen fan of [[snooker]], and gave an account of the origin of the game's name in ''The Billiard Player'' magazine of 1939, describing how young lieutenant [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain]] (not the former British Prime Minister) was experimenting on the officers' mess table with the existing game of 'Black Pool' featuring 15 red balls and a black.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wpbsa/history-of-snooker/ |title=History of Snooker |publisher=World Snooker |date=22 January 1955 |access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/ |title=Billiard and Snooker Heritage Collection – Origins of Snooker |website=Snookerheritage.co.uk |access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> He presented the World Championship trophy to [[Joe Davis]] at the [[1939 World Snooker Championship|1939 Championships]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Death and taxes==
He converted to Catholicism in 1914. He died on 30 November 1972, aged 89, in Edinburgh and was interred in St Barr's churchyard cemetery at Eoligarry on the Isle of Barra.

After his retirement Mackenzie sold the entire copyright in 20 of his books for a lump sum of £10,000 arguing that this was a capital receipt and not the proceeds of the business. The Court of Appeal held that this was assessable income as part of the proceeds of his business: Mackenzie v Arnold (1952) 33 TC 363.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tiley|first1=John|title=Studies in the History of Tax Law, Volume 6|date=2013|publisher=Hart Publishing|location=Portland OR|isbn=9781849464802|pages=310–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJXbBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA310|access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref>
