==Biography==

===Early life===
Faulks was born on 20 April 1953 in [[Donnington, Berkshire]], to Peter Faulks and Pamela (née Lawless).<ref name=Debretts2005/> His father was a decorated soldier (he won the [[Military Cross]]), who later became a solicitor and circuit judge. His brother [[Edward Faulks, Baron Faulks]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], a barrister, became a Conservative Government Minister in January 2014 in the Ministry of Justice.<ref name="Tonkin">{{cite news|last=Tonkin|first=Boyd|title=Inside a city of dreams: Sebastian Faulks on money, morality and modern London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/inside-a-city-of-dreams-sebastian-faulks-on-money-morality-and-modern-london-1777978.html|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=28 August 2009}}</ref> His uncle was [[Neville Faulks|Sir Neville Faulks]], a High Court judge.

He was educated at [[Elstree School]], Reading and went on to [[Wellington College, Berkshire]]. He read English at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], of which he was made an Honorary Fellow in 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Emmanuel College Magazine, Volume XCIX 2016-2017}}</ref><ref name="Official">[http://www.sebastianfaulks.com/index.php?page_id=3 Profile on Faulkes' official biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316105031/http://www.sebastianfaulks.com/index.php?page_id=3 |date=16 March 2012 }}</ref> Whilst at Cambridge he participated in ''[[University Challenge]]'', in which Emmanuel College lost in the opening round. Faulks commented that his team was most probably hampered by a trip to the pub before the show, as recommended by the show's producer.<ref>As revealed in his episode of Desert Island Discs.</ref>

===Career===

After graduating, Faulks worked as a teacher at a private school in Camden Town, and then as a journalist for the ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Telegraph''.<ref Name="Official"/> Faulks's first novel, ''A Trick of the Light'', was published in 1984. He continued to work as a journalist, becoming the first literary editor of ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1986.<ref Name="Dec">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/23/week-in-december-faulks "A Week in December by Sebastian Faulks", ''Guardian''] 23 August 2009</ref> He became deputy editor of the ''Independent on Sunday'' in 1989; in the same year he published ''[[The Girl at the Lion d'Or]]'', the first of his historical novels set in France. In 1991 he left ''[[The Independent]].'' He wrote for various newspapers as a freelancer for the next ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebastianfaulks.com/index.php?page_id=3|title=Biography|work=Sebastian Faulks Official Website|publisher=Random House|access-date=20 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316105031/http://www.sebastianfaulks.com/index.php?page_id=3|archive-date=16 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Following the success of ''[[Birdsong (novel)|Birdsong]]'' (1993), Faulks quit journalism to write full-time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.sebastianfaulks.com/index.php?page_id=3|work=Sebastian Faulks Official Website|publisher=Random House|access-date=19 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316105031/http://www.sebastianfaulks.com/index.php?page_id=3|archive-date=16 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He has since published eight novels, the most recent being ''Where My Heart Used to Beat'' (2015), ''Paris Echo'' (2018) and ''Snow Country'' (2021). Faulks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1993 and appointed CBE for services to literature in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sebastian Faulks Official Website|work=Biography|publisher=Random House}}</ref>

Faulks appears regularly on British TV and radio. He was a regular team captain on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s literary quiz ''[[The Write Stuff]]'' (1998 - 2014).<ref name="debretts.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/f/6779/Sebastian+Charles.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121104047/http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/f/6779/Sebastian+Charles.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 January 2013|title=Sebastian Faulks, Esq, CBE, FRSL|publisher=Debrett's|access-date=20 March 2012}}</ref> The quiz involves the panellists each week writing a [[pastiche]] of the work of a selected author; Faulks has published a collection of his efforts as a book, ''Pistache'' (2006), which was described in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' as "a little treasure of a book. Faulks can catch, and caricature, another writers' fingerprints and foibles with a delicious precision that only a deep love of writing can teach".<ref name="scotsman.com">{{cite news|title=A licence to imitate: Sebastian Faulks|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/a_licence_to_imitate_sebastian_faulks_1_1435781|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=30 May 2008}}</ref> In 2011 Faulks presented a four-part [[BBC Two]] series called ''Faulks on Fiction'', looking at the British novel and its characters.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ykvgk ''Faulkes on Fiction'', BBC,2011]</ref> He also wrote a series tie-in book of the same name.

===Personal life===
Faulks married Veronica (née Youlten) in 1989. They have two sons, William and Arthur, born 1990 and 1996 respectively, and one daughter, Holly, born 1992.<ref name=Debretts2005>{{cite book|title=Debrett's People of Today 2005|year=2005|edition=18th|isbn=1-870520-10-6|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|page=534}}</ref> Faulks is a fan of [[West Ham United]] football club.<ref>{{cite news|last=Epstein|first=Robert|title='Sebastian Faulks told me I was bonkers': Rachel Wagstaff on bringing ''Birdsong'' to the stage|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/sebastian-faulks-told-me-i-was-bonkers-rachel-wagstaff-on-bringing-birdsong-to-the-stage-2080210.html|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 September 2010}}</ref> [[Debrett's]] lists his recreations as tennis and wine.<ref name="debretts.com"/>

A longtime [[cricket]] fan and player, Faulks is a member of the [[Authors Cricket Club|Authors XI]] cricket team.<ref>{{cite book|last=Authors Cricket Club|title=The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4088-4045-0}}</ref>

In August 2014, Faulks was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories &#124; Politics |work=theguardian.com |date=2014-08-07 |access-date=2014-08-26}}</ref>

==Novels==
The ''[[Literary Review]]'' has said that "Faulks has the rare gift of being popular and literary at the same time"; ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' called him "One of the most impressive novelists of his generation ... who is growing in authority with every book".<ref name="Bedell">{{cite news|last=Bedell|first=Geraldine|title=The many selves of Sebastian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/16/fiction.sebastianfaulks|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Observer|date=16 March 2008}}</ref> Faulks's 2005 novel, ''[[Human Traces]]'', was described by [[Trevor Nunn]] as "A masterpiece, one of the great novels of this or any other century."<ref Name="Dec"/>

Faulks is best known for his three novels set in early twentieth-century France.The first, ''[[The Girl at the Lion d'Or]]'', was published in 1989. This was followed by ''[[Birdsong (novel)|Birdsong]]'' (1993), and ''[[Charlotte Gray (novel)|Charlotte Gray]]'' (1998). The latter two were best-sellers, and ''Charlotte Gray'' was shortlisted for the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].<ref Name="Dec"/> In April 2003 ''Birdsong'' came 13th in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Big Read]]'' initiative which aimed to identify Britain's best loved novels.<ref>*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml The Big Read] from the BBC</ref>

In 2007, Faulks published ''[[Engleby]]''. Set in Cambridge in the 1970s, it is narrated by Cambridge University fresher Mike Engleby. Engleby is a loner, and the reader is led to suspect that he may be unreliable, particularly when a fellow student disappears. Faulks says of the novel's genesis, "I woke up one morning with this guy's voice in my head. And he was just talking, dictating, almost. And when I got to work, I wrote it down. I didn't know what the hell was going on; this wasn't an idea for a book".<ref name="Bedell"/> It was remarked upon as a change of direction for Faulks, both in terms of the near-contemporary setting and in the decision to use a first-person narrator.<ref Name="NYtimes">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Rafferty-t.html "Cantabrigian Psycho "] ''The New York Times'', 16 September 2007</ref> ''The Daily Telegraph'' said the book was "distinguished by a remarkable intellectual energy: a narrative verve, technical mastery of the possibilities of the novel form and vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3665008/The-inside-of-an-outsiders-mind.html "The inside of an outsider's mind"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 10 May 2007</ref>

To mark the 2008 centenary of [[Ian Fleming]]'s birth, the author's estate in 2006 commissioned Faulks to write a new [[James Bond]] novel. Faulks has said of the commission: "I'd just finished ''Human Traces'' and it seemed ridiculous. You've just spent five years in a Victorian lunatic asylum and then you go on to James Bond. But I think their hope is they'll get two markets. The more I think about it, the more I think it was clever of them, because the mismatch is intriguing".<ref name="Bedell"/> The result, ''[[Devil May Care (Faulks novel)|Devil May Care]]'', became an immediate best-seller in the UK, selling 44,093 hardback copies within 4 days of release.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/04/mediabusiness.sebastianfaulks "James Bond smashes sales figures"], ''The Guardian'', 4 June 2008</ref> ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s review of the novel  stated: "Faulks has done in some ways an absolutely sterling job. He has resisted pastiche", and blamed the book's weaknesses on the character of Bond as created by Fleming.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=Nice try, Mr Faulks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/01/fiction.sebastianfaulks|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=1 June 2008}}</ref> [[Mark Lawson]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', praised it as "a smart and enjoyable act of literary resurrection. Among the now 33 post-Fleming Bonds, this must surely compete with [[Colonel Sun|Kingsley Amis]]'s for the title of the best".<ref>{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Mark|title=Devil is in the detail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/28/fiction.sebastianfaulks|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 May 2008}}</ref>

Faulks's 2009 novel, ''[[A Week in December]]'', takes place, in the seven days leading up to Christmas in December 2007. It focuses on the lives of a varied cast of characters living in London; Faulks himself has described the novel as "Dickensian" and cites ''[[Bleak House]]'' and ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' as influences, as well as New York novelists such as [[Tom Wolfe]] and [[Jay McInerney]]. The book was partly a response to the banking crisis. He chose to set it specifically in 2007 because "the whole world had changed: the banks were collapsing, we were facing Armageddon, and I understood then that I couldn't make this book right up to the moment[...] I chose that time because then the writing's on the wall, and it should be clear to anyone half-sensible that the game is up, but they're still going on."<ref name="Tonkin"/> Other plot threads in the novel concern reality television, and Islamic militancy. While publicising the book, Faulks received some criticism for negative remarks he made about the Koran; he was quick to offer "a simple but unqualified apology to my Muslim friends and readers for anything that has come out sounding crude or intolerant. Happily, there is more to the book than that".<ref>{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Sebastian Faulks moves to head off Islam row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/24/sebastian-faulks-attacks-quran|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 August 2009}}</ref> Reviews for the novel were mixed. [[Tibor Fischer]], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', praised the novel's "comic élan", but felt it was "uneven" and criticised the character of John Veals as "lifeless".<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/books-life/6167661/A-Week-in-December-by-Sebastian-Faulks-review.html "A Week in December by Sebastian Faulks: review"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 September 2009</ref> [[Mark Lawson]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "an honest critic must surely conclude that Faulks has correctly identified the novel that needs to be written about these times, but may also have proved that British society is now so various that no single writer can capture all its aspects. However, in honourably failing to depict the entire state of the nation, Faulks has memorably skewered the British literary world."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/05/sebastian-faulks-novel-review "A Week in December by Sebastian Faulks"], ''The Guardian'', 5 September 2009</ref>

==Adaptations of novels==
In 2001 ''Charlotte Gray'' was made into a [[Charlotte Gray (film)|film]] starring [[Cate Blanchett]] and directed by [[Gillian Armstrong]]. In 2010 a [[Birdsong (play)|stage version]] of ''Birdsong'', adapted by Rachel Wagstaff (who had previously adapted ''[[The Girl at the Lion d'Or]]'' for radio)<ref>{{cite news|last=Epstein|first=Robert|title='Sebastian Faulks told me I was bonkers': Rachel Wagstaff on bringing Birdsong to the stage|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/sebastian-faulks-told-me-i-was-bonkers-rachel-wagstaff-on-bringing-birdsong-to-the-stage-2080210.html|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 September 2010}}</ref> and directed by Trevor Nunn, opened at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London; the production ran for only 4 months. It was subsequently rewritten by Wagstaff and made four successful nationwide tours.
