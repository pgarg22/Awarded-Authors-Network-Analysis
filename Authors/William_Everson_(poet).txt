'''William "Bill" Everson''', also known as '''Brother Antoninus''' (September 10, 1912 â€“ June 3, 1994), was an American poet, literary critic, teacher and [[small press]] printer. He was a member of the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].

==Beginnings==
Everson was born on September 10, 1912 in Sacramento, California. His parents, both of whom were printers, raised him on a farm outside the small fruit-growing town of [[Selma, California|Selma]], [[California]]. He played football at Selma High School and attended Fresno State College (later known as [[California State University, Fresno]]).

==Poet and teacher==
Everson was an influential member of the San Francisco Renaissance in poetry and worked closely with [[Kenneth Rexroth]] during this period of his life. Throughout his life, Everson was a great admirer of the work and life of poet [[Robinson Jeffers]]. Much of his work as a critic was done on Jeffers's poetry.

Everson registered as an [[anarchist]] and a [[pacifist]] with his draft board, in compliance with the 1940 draft bill. In 1943, he was sent to a [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS) work camp for [[conscientious objectors]] in Oregon.<ref>{{Cite web

More on this camp experience can be found in the book"Here on the Edge" by [[Steve McQuiddy]]. During his time as a conscientious objector, Everson completed ''The Residual Years'', a volume of poems that launched him to national fame.

Everson married poet [[Mary Fabilli]] on June 12, 1948,<ref name="Contemporary Authors">{{cite web|title=Mary Fabilli|work=Contemporary Authors Online|publisher=Gale|year=2005|url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/H1000126223/BIC?u=|access-date=September 12, 2019|url-access=subscription}}</ref> and influenced by her religious devotion, converted to Catholicism.<ref name="Catholic Legacy">{{cite web|last=Ripatrazone|first=Nick|title=The Straightforward Catholic Legacy of Poet Artist Mary Fabilli|url=https://angelusnews.com/news/nick-ripatrazone/the-straightforward-catholic-legacy-of-poet-artist-mary-fabilli|website=Angelus News|date=July 1, 2019|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> Everson joined the Catholic Church in 1951 and soon became involved with the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] in Oakland, California. He took the name Brother Antoninus when he joined the [[Dominican Order]] in 1951 in Oakland. As an initiate in the Order, he printed the unfinished ''Novum Psalterium PII XII,'' an acknowledged masterpiece in American fine press printing. A colorful literary and counterculture figure, he was nicknamed the Beat Friar. The central motif throughout all of Antoninus' Catholic poetry is Incarnation, the central symbol of the Christian mystery. In 1956, he met an English Dominican, Father [[Victor White (priest)|Victor White]], at St. Albert's Dominican priory. White, of the English Dominican province and a longtime friend of [[Carl Jung]], with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence, was resident lecturer and theologian there. It was through this relationship to Victor White that Antoninus learned to look at his dreams from an in-depth religious angle for meaning. He devoured the ''Collected Works'' of Jung and began his psychological analysis of the unconscious as well as the analysis of many individuals who came to him for counseling. Antoninus wrote the first draft of his long erotic poem ''River-Root / A Syzygy,'' which he considered to be his most prophetic work. As Everson said in an interview for ''Creation'' magazine, with its founder and editor, the theologian and Episcopal priest [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], he saw it as a complete re-writing of the Song of Songs, bringing frank Eros back into the [[Psalms]] and undoing Christianity's longstanding separation of the sexual from the spiritual for purposes of modernity. Jung's writings influenced the contributions Everson made to post-religious poetical thought in America. After leaving St Albert's, where he had practiced as a lay monk, poet and spiritual counselor for 18 years, Antoninus left his religious habit after a reading at the University of California at Davis campus on December 7, 1969. He left the Dominicans in 1969 and married a woman many years his junior, Susanna Rickson. At this time, he became a step-father to his son, Jude Everson. When Antoninus wrote ''The Rose of Solitude'', he saw it published in many magazines. However, when he wrote ''The Veritable Years'' under William Everson, having left Antoninus behind, he couldn't even get his work reviewed. He then assumed the mantle of a poet-shaman to replace his religious habit. The 1974 poem ''Man-Fate'' explores this transformation from Brother Antoninus into William Everson, the West-Coast poet-shaman. Everson was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1972.

Everson spent most of his years living near the central California coast a few miles north of Santa Cruz in a cabin he dubbed Kingfisher Flat. He was poet-in-residence at the University of California, Santa Cruz during the 1970s and 1980s. There he founded the Lime Kiln Press, a [[small press]] through which he printed highly sought-after fine-art editions of his own poetry as well as of the works of other poets, including [[Robinson Jeffers]] and [[Walt Whitman]]. For the most part, Everson's reputation was based on his poetry, printing, and public readings.

In 2009 Everson's former student Steven Herrmann brought renewed attention to Everson as a shamanic teacher. Herrmann later compiled a series of interviews with the poet-shaman from 1991 to 1993 that were published as ''William Everson: The Shaman's Call''. Everson maintained an adhesion to his Catholic faith until his final days. In 1982, by a meaningful coincidence, Everson was asked to write an introduction to Victor White's book ''God and the Unconscious''. In the final two years of his life, Everson worked on an unfinished autobiographical work titled ''Dust Shall Be the Serpent's Food''. Everson died at his home on June 2, 1994, and his body was buried at the Dominican Cemetery in Benicia, California.

Everson's papers are archived at the [[William Andrews Clark Memorial Library]] at [[UCLA]]<ref>"[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf638nb39d Register of the William Everson Papers, 1937-1971]"</ref> and [[The Bancroft Library]] at [[UC Berkeley]].<ref>"[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7g5005x9/ Guide to the William Everson Papers]"</ref>

[[Black Sparrow Press]] released a three-volume series of the collected poems of Everson, the last volume was published in 2000. In 2003, the [[California Legacy Project]] published ''Dark God of Eros: A William Everson Reader.''
