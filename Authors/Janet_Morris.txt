'''Janet Ellen Morris''' (born May 25, 1946) is an American [[author]] of fiction and nonfiction, best known for her fantasy and science fiction and her authorship of a [[non-lethal weapons]] concept for the U.S. military.<ref>''Nonlethality: A Global Strategy''</ref>

==Background==

===Writing===
Janet Morris began writing in 1976 and has since published more than forty novels, many co-authored with her husband [[Chris Morris (author)|Chris Morris]] or others.  Her debut novel, written as Janet E. Morris, was ''[[High Couch of Silistra]]'', the first in a quartet of character-driven novels with a female protagonist.  According to original publisher [[Bantam Books]], the Silistra quartet had over four million copies in print when the fourth volume, ''[[The Carnelian Throne]]'' was published. [[Charles N. Brown]], co-founder and editor of ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' magazine, is quoted on the [[Baen Books]] reissues of the series, noting that the stories featured "engrossing characters in a marvelous adventure."

Morris has contributed short fiction to the [[shared universe]] [[fantasy]] series ''[[Thieves' World]]'', in which she created [[the Sacred Band of Stepsons]], a mythical unit of ancient fighters modeled on the [[Sacred Band of Thebes]].

She created, orchestrated, and edited the [[Bangsian fantasy]] series ''[[Heroes in Hell]]'', writing stories for the series as well as co-writing the related novel, ''The Little Helliad'', with Chris Morris.

Most of her fiction work has been in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres, although she has also written historical and other novels. Her 1983 book ''I, the Sun'', a detailed [[biographical novel]] about the [[Hittites|Hittite]] King [[Suppiluliuma I]] was praised for its historical accuracy; O. M. Gurney, Hittite scholar and author of ''The Hittites'',<ref>''The Hittites'', O. M. Gurney, Penguin, 1952</ref> commented that "the author is familiar with every aspect of Hittite culture."<ref>''I, the Sun'', Janet Morris, Dell, 1983</ref>
 
Morris has written, contributed to, or edited several book-length works of non-fiction, as well as papers and articles on non-lethal weapons, developmental military technology and other defense and national security topics.

===Academic, strategic and business activity===

Morris was elected to the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] in 1980. Morris served as Research Director and Senior Fellow (1989–1994) at the U.S. Global Strategy Council, as well as Adjunct Fellow at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (1993–1995). Morris co-authored ''The Warriors Edge'', which explores embracing unconventional psychological combat techniques, in 1990. Janet Morris and the USGSC's campaign for the creation of a non-lethality panel resulted in the assembly of the Non-Lethality Policy Review Group, led by Major General Chris S. Adams, USAF (ret.) in 1991. The group earned the political backing of [[Sam Nunn]], chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]]. Janet Morris published numerous white papers in 1991, detailing the USGSC’s non-lethal war doctrine proposals. The papers promoted diversifying and expanding non-lethal weapon capability for use in increased American intervention in global conflicts. The papers urged additional development of anti-personnel incapacitants as well as vehicular area denial devices.<ref name=lobster>{{cite web|title=Psychic Warfare and Non-Lethal Weapons|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon09.htm|access-date=5 May 2011|author=Henry Azadehdel|date=June 1993}}</ref>

In 1991, Morris visited the Moscow Institute of Psycho-Correlations and observed the demonstration of the transmission of subliminal commands via [[infrasound]].<ref name="infrasound moscow">{{cite book|title=The art of information warfare: insight into the knowledge warrior philosophy|year=1999|publisher=[[Universal-Publishers]]|isbn=1-58112-857-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eThUEXPK62cC&q=%22the+warrior%27s+edge%22&pg=PA84|author=Richard Forno, Ronald Baklarz|access-date=5 May 2011|page=84}}</ref>

In 1995, Morris and her husband founded M2 Technologies.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=114333202 | title=M2 Technologies, Inc.: Private Company Information | publisher=[[Business Week]]}}</ref> Since that time, their writing output has decreased in proportion to the increasing success of the company, which works with U.S. federal and military agencies on non-lethal weapon systems, novel technology applications, and software.

In 2003 and 2004, she served on the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Independent Task Force on Nonlethal Weapons and Capabilities and contributed to the Task Force report, ''Nonlethal Weapons and Capabilities'' (2004).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cfr.org/defense-technology/nonlethal-weapons-capabilities/p6793 | title=Nonlethal Weapons and Capabilities | publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] | date=February 2004}}</ref>

===Equestrian===

A lifelong horsewoman, Morris and her husband bred [[Thoroughbred]]s from 2003 to 2013 and still maintain a World-Champion producing [[Morgan Horse]] breeding program begun in 1996. Her foundation mare, "UVM Christine" (pictured above), won Morgan Grand National Champion Four-Year-Old Mare, World Champion Senior Mare, and Reserve World Champion Mare in 1998.<ref>The Morgan Horse Magazine, December, 1998; The Morgan Connection, December, 1998</ref>

Other Grand National and Reserve Grand National and World Champions followed, including Reserve World Champion and Reserve Grand National Champion Park Horse, "Pastorale" in 2001 and 2002; homebred Grand National Champion Morgan Snaffle-Bit Reining Horse, "Spring Diva", in 2003; Grand National Champion Pleasure Driving Gelding "Burkland Rafinesque" in 2008; and homebreds "Privilege", World Champion Western Pleasure in 2014; and "Concordia", World Champion Pleasure Driving in 2018. The Morrises' Morgan breeding program was featured on the cover and in a profile article in ''Equine International''<ref>Equine International, Summer 2009, Vol. 1, Issue 2; www.alltech.com/EquineInternational</ref> in 2009.
