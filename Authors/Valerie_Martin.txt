While at the University of Alabama, Martin lived a few blocks away from novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] and they became friends. Martin was the first person to read the completed manuscript of Atwood's ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', claiming she told Atwood that the book would make her rich. Atwood returned the favor and read some of Martin's then-unpublished works, and liked them enough to send them to editor and publisher [[Nan A. Talese]], who has remained Martin's editor ever since.<ref name="brick"/>

Martin has continued to teach at the college level even though her writing career has been successful, sometimes taking breaks from the classroom in order to complete a work.
