{{short description|American writer}}
'''Kirby Michael Wright''' is an American writer best known for his 2005 [[coming-of-age]] island novel ''Punahou Blues'' and the epic novel ''Moloka'i Nui Ahina'', which is based on the life and times of Wright's paniolo grandmother. Both novels deal with the racial tensions between [[haoles]] (whites) and the indigenous Hawaiians, and illustrate the challenge for characters who, as the product of mixed-race marriages, must try to bridge the two cultures and overcome prejudice from both camps. Wright has ventured into the genre of creative nonfiction in 2019 with ''The Queen of Moloka'i'', which explores the teenage years of his part-Hawaiian grandmother and documents the Wright family saga in the islands.

Wright's work is primarily concerned with the complexities of multicultural Hawaii, Killahaole Day, prejudices against (and within) island high schools, and the tricky matter of interracial dating. He incorporates the local creole language into his novels and was the first author to document the [[pidgin English]] spoken by the paniolo cowboys on the east end of [[Molokai]].

Wright has ventured into the arena of  [[speculative fiction]] with a pair of books in 2013. ''The End, My Friend'' is a futuristic thriller set in the not-too-distant future featuring a survivalist couple roaming an apocalyptic landscape from San Diego north to Crater Lake, Oregon. ''Square Dancing at the Asylum'' is set, in part, at the former state asylum in Worcester, Mass., and is dedicated to [[Paul Ford Nolan]], Wright's great-uncle and lifelong resident of the asylum. Both books received Certificates of Excellence at the 2014 San Diego Book Awards. HOUDINI, his first play, was performed at  [[the Secret Theatre]] in New York on February 20, 2016.  [[The Secret Theatre]] produced his second play, ''Asylum Uncle'', on November 4, 2016.

His mother, the former June McCormack of [[Boston]], was a secretary at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [[MIT]].

It was here that Wright met [[Sophie Cooke]], a cattle rancher who wrote the memoir ''Sincerely, Sophie'' about her life and times on the islands.  This meeting proved influential to the young Wright because Cooke wrote about his grandmother.
