Kitchener Davies''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]] poet and playwright who wrote mostly in the [[Welsh language]]. Davies's work is highly influenced by the industrial landscape of his adopted village of [[Trealaw]] in the [[Rhondda]] Valley and his own nationalistic beliefs.

==Biography==
Born and brought up in [[Llangeitho]] in [[Ceredigion]], Davies spent his working life in the newly industrialised coalfields of the Rhondda Valley. The sometimes bleak conditions of his early life, especially as his early adulthood coincided with the economic despair of the depression, is reflected in his plays. Davies was part of the [[Cadwgan Circle]], a literary group of likeminded writers from Rhondda, that centred their image of Wales on the new industrialised society they were brought up in. Members of the Circle included [[Rhydwen Williams]], [[Pennar Davies]] and [[Gareth Alban Davies]].

His early play ''Cwm Glo'' (1934) was seen as controversial because it dealt with the social impact of the depression without the cultural romanticism which was stereotypical of Welsh literature. His verse play ''Meini Gwagedd'' (1944) is set in the [[Tregaron]] area and again looks at the harshness of the industrialised Wales and the self-destructive nature of people when drawn into a spiral of ill fortune.

In 1945, Davies stood in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom general election]], standing in the [[Rhondda East (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda East constituency]] as the first member of [[Plaid Cymru]] to contest the seat in the Rhondda Valleys. He came last out of three candidates, gaining 2,123 votes (6.1%).<ref>Williams (1996), pg. 161</ref> The next election, in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1950]] he ran again, this time the [[Rhondda West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda West constituency]] seat. He increased his vote to 6.6% and then improved this in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 election]] when he polled slightly higher with 7.7% of the vote, again in the Rhondda West constituency.<ref>Williams (1996), pg. 164</ref>

James Kitchener Davies is buried at ''Trealaw Cemetery'' in [[Trealaw]].
