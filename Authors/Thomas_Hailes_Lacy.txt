'''Thomas Hailes Lacy''' (1809 – 1 August 1873) was a British actor, playwright, theatrical manager, bookseller, and theatrical publisher.

==Life==
Lacy made his [[West End theatre|West End]] stage debut in 1828 but soon turned manager, a position he held from 1841 at The Theatre in [[Sheffield]] (destroyed by fire in 1935). On 25 January 1942, Lacy married actress Frances Dalton who was an actress known as [[Fanny Cooper]]. She was taking leading parts at Covent Garden and the Haymarket. The marriage probably took place at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's church in Covent Garden]], but maybe in Sheffield.<ref name=fanny>{{Cite ODNB|title=Cooper, Fanny [real name Frances Charlotte Dalton] (1814–1872), actress|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15847|access-date=2020-11-08|year = 2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15847}}</ref> He and his wife toured England together. Lacy's roles included [[Jacques]] (''[[As You Like It]]'') and [[Banquo]] (''[[Macbeth]]''). He would appear with his wife when she played Countess Wintersen in ''The Stranger'', Nerissa in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and Virginia in [[James Sheridan Knowles]]'s ''[[Virginius (play)|Virginius]]''.<ref name=fanny/>

In the mid-1840s, Lacy set up a business as a theatrical bookseller in London, at first in Wellington Street, [[Covent Garden]] and, from 1857, at 89 [[Strand, London|Strand]]. He also ventured into publishing with an innovative approach to playscripts, producing acting editions of recent plays so that each actor could have a full script to work from. Lacy's Acting Edition of Plays, published between 1848 and 1873, eventually ran to 99 volumes containing 1,485 individual pieces.

In 1859, he made the acquaintance of American entrepreneur [[Samuel French]], who had started a similar publishing business in New York City five years earlier and was visiting London. Lacy and French became partners, each acting as the other's agent across the Atlantic. In 1872, French decided to take up permanent residence in London, and when Lacy retired without any immediate heirs in 1873, he sold out to French for five thousand [[Pound sterling|pounds]].<ref name=lacy/>

His wife died in 1872. They had a son but he was mentally ill and died in 1895.<ref name=fanny/> Thomas Hailes Lacy died at 1 August 1873 in [[Sutton, London|Sutton, Surrey]]. His disregard for copyright during his life meant that there was a claim for £700 for infringement of rights. His executors paid after they negotiated the bill down to £250.<ref name=lacy>{{Cite ODNB|title=Lacy, Thomas Hailes (1809–1873), actor, playwright, and theatrical publisher|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15862|access-date=2020-11-08|year = 2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15862}}</ref>
