'''Robert B Suda''' (A.k.a. '''Suda Balázs Róbert''', born 16 June 1978) is a London-based theatre director, playwright and producer who has a BA and two MAs in cultural management (Janus Pannonius University of Pecs - 2000), theatre project management (University of Pecs 2002) and advanced theatre studies (Theatrology – University of Pannonia 2006). Since 1997, he has directed and produced numerous shows on stage, which have been highly acclaimed by both critics and audiences. He also has significant experience in producing for stage and for TV.
He was both educated in and employed Constantin Stanislavski's method of psychological realism [[Theatrical realism]] and the directing technique of Bertold Brecht [[Epic theatre]]. His works are also highly influenced by neo-expressionism, constructivism and minimalism. In his productions he has combined these techniques with elements of physical theatre, dance, pantomime and minimalist architectural set design both in prose and musical productions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.covershow.hu/data/nepszw2.html |title= Dráma, diszkó életre-halálra |access-date=2014-09-26 }}</ref>
He worked in long-term artistic collaboration with Veronika Karsai<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pantomim.hu/?main=eletrajz |title= Karsai Veronika és társulatainak honlapja |access-date=2014-09-26 |work=Karsai Veronika}}</ref> pantomime artist and physical-theatre director. During their teamwork they developed and staged two productions (Cursed Cows, richard2nixon) establishing their own theatrical form of expression. Suda's another long-term collaborative artistic colleague was Attila Galambos<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.galambosattila.hu/galambos-attila/ |title= Galambos Attila honlapja |access-date=2014-09-26 |work=Galambos Attila}}</ref> with whom they not only have written mainstream musicals (That's Enough!, Covershow, Better Than Sex), but Galambos, as an actor, was a part of many of Suda's productions (The Dumb-waiter, Cursed Cows, Covershow, moNOporno).
In 2005, he was selected as one of the best young playwrights of the year by the Young Writers’ Association, Hungary, (FISz)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fiatalirok.blog.hu/2012/01/06/fisz_taglista#S |title= FISZ taglista |access-date=2014-09-26 }}</ref> for his play Cursed Cows, which he both wrote and directed. The script was published by the Association in 2006.<ref name="hübners">{{cite web |url= http://www.whoiswho-verlag.ch/versionnew/ungarn/verlag/63.php?txt_Language=HU&real_str_PersID=49004199&uniqueID=e6d342f7-390a-4e4e-9e66-71a49d1c07a8 |title= Who is Who |access-date=2014-09-26 |work= Hübners }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://fiatalirok.blog.hu/2011/06/02/az_eddigi_fisz_kiadvanyok_listaja#more2946498 |title= Az eddigi FISZ-kiadványok listája|access-date=2014-09-26 |work= FISZinfo }}</ref>

{{reflist}}

<!-- “The FISZ award-winner director’s greatest feat is—who has staged contemporary plays and mainstream musicals—that he was able to integrate the exciting, unruly personality of the rock-star, Miss Pasztor and the songs of her band into the texture of the show. The projected road-movie scenes on the white canvases of the set, the video installations and the elements of virtual reality are the imprints of a mind-blowing amuck which not only delivers deeply multi-layered meaning but also gives a mainstream style to the whole show.” – KultutPart, V.M.R. on MoNOporno, or Miss Julie

“Suda has staged a disco-era Greek Tragedy in the Belvarosi Theatre… and has this ground-breaking twentieth-century antique tragedy played in a most pleasing manner.”
– Tamas Tarjan, Nepszava on CoverShow – The Musical
