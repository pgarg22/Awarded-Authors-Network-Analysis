==Early life==
In the same [[Chinese calendar|Chinese year]] '''Li Congjia''' was born, his grandfather [[Li Bian|Xu Zhigao, also known as Xu Gao (Li Bian)]] founded the state Qi ({{lang|zh-Hant|齊}}), renaming it Tang (known as the [[Southern Tang]]) 2 years later. When Li Congjia was 6, his father [[Li Jing (Southern Tang)|Li Jing]] became the next Southern Tang [[emperor of China|emperor]]. With Li Jing naming his younger brother [[Li Jingsui]] his [[heir apparent]], his sixth eldest son Li Congjia seemed unlikely to ever succeed the throne. However, many of Li Congjia's brothers died very young, and after the death of the second eldest brother Li Hongmao ({{lang|zh|李弘茂}}) in 951, Li Congjia all of a sudden found himself right behind [[Li Hongji]] — the eldest brother — and uncle Li Jingsui in the succession line.<ref name=sgcq19>{{harvnb|''Shiguo Chunqiu''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/十國春秋/卷019 ch. 19.]}}</ref><ref name=wdsj62>{{harvnb|''Wudai Shiji''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/新五代史/卷62 ch. 62.]}}</ref>

Li Hongji, a withdrawn and troubled young man, resented his [[crown prince]] uncle, whom he saw as a political enemy standing in his way. He also disliked his younger brother Li Congjia, even though they shared the same biological mother, [[Empress Zhong]]. Fearing the possible results of this family enmity, Li Congjia tried hard to be inconspicuous and focused on the arts, including poetry, painting and music. He loved reading, a passion encouraged by his father, also an acclaimed poet.<ref name=kurz91>{{harvnb|Kurz|loc=p. 91.}}</ref> At the age of 17, Li Congjia married [[Queen Zhou the Elder|Zhou Ehuang]], [[chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Zhou Zong]]'s daughter and a year his senior. Lady Zhou was not only highly educated but also multi-talented in music and the arts and the young couple enjoyed a very intimate relationship.<ref name=sgcq18>{{harvnb|''Shiguo Chunqiu''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/十國春秋/卷018 ch. 18.]}}</ref>

==Accession to the throne==
In 955, a year after Li Congjia's marriage, Southern Tang was invaded by [[Later Zhou]]. The resistance war did not end until spring 958, after Li Jing ceded all [[prefecture (China)|prefectures]] north of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] to his powerful northern neighbor. Li Jing also relinquished all imperial trappings, degrading his own title from [[emperor of China|emperor]] to king ({{lang|zh-Hant|國主}}).<ref name=sgcq16>{{harvnb|''Shiguo Chunqiu''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/十國春秋/卷016 ch. 16.]}}</ref> The national humiliation was soon followed by familial tragedy: later that year Li Hongji poisoned uncle Li Jingsui to death, which was followed by his own death a few months later, allegedly hastened by many encounters with Li Jingsui's vengeful ghost.<ref name=sgcq19 />

Not long after Li Hongji's death in 959, Li Congjia was given the post of royal secretary ({{lang|zh|尚書令}}) so that he could familiarize himself of governmental affairs. However, despite being the king's eldest surviving son, a few ministers considered him too dissolute and weak for the crown prince position, including [[Zhong Mo]], who pleaded to have Li Congjia's younger brother [[Li Congshan]] chosen instead. Li Jing found Zhong's suggestion offensive and demoted him.<ref name=wdsj62 /><ref name=sgcq17>{{harvnb|''Shiguo Chunqiu''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/十國春秋/卷017 ch. 17.]}}</ref>

Suffering from poor health, Li Jing decided to transfer all responsibilities to his successor. He named Li Congjia the crown prince in spring 961 to take over in the [[capital city|capital]] Jinling (金陵; modern [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]]) while he retired to the southern city of Hongzhou (洪州; modern [[Nanchang]], [[Jiangxi]]). A few months later he died, and Li Congjia officially succeeded the throne, not without a last-second effort by Li Congshan to challenge him. By then Zhong Mo had also died, so Li Congshan asked chancellor [[Xu You (Southern Tang)|Xu You]] to bring Li Jing's last will to him. Xu refused and confided in Li Congjia of Li Congshan's intentions. Li Congjia — changing his name to '''Li Yu''' — did not punish his younger brother other than a slight demotion.<ref name=kurz91 />

==As Southern Tang ruler==

===Appeasing the Song Dynasty===
A year before Li Yu ascended the throne, Southern Tang's nominal overlord Later Zhou had been replaced by the [[Song dynasty]] established by former Later Zhou general [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Zhao Kuangyin]], who had earlier participated in several campaigns against Southern Tang. Knowing the limit of Southern Tang's military strength and trying hard to be subservient to the northern court, Li Yu immediately sent a high official [[Feng Yanlu]] with a letter — whose language was of extreme humility<ref name="bryantxxiv"/> — to inform Song of his succession. Things got to a rocky start: during his accession to the throne Li Yu built a golden rooster, a symbol of imperial power, the news of which infuriated Zhao Kuangyin. In the end, the Southern Tang ambassador in the Song capital of Bianliang (汴梁; modern [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]) had to give the explanation that the golden rooster was actually a "weird bird" to satisfy the Song emperor.<ref name=sgcq17 />

Such an embarrassing relationship would define Li's entire reign, as tribute payments, both regular and irregular, drained the Southern Tang treasury. Essentially Li was ready to fulfill Emperor Taizu of Song's every demand except go to Bianliang himself. In 963, Li Congshan who accompanied a tributary mission was held hostage in Bianliang and had to write letters on behalf of the Song emperor asking his elder brother also join him at the Song court. Li Yu, naturally, did not heed the request.<ref name=sgcq19 />

===Successive deaths in the family===
Li Yu remained close to his musically gifted wife [[Zhou Ehuang]] — now Queen Zhou — so close that he sometimes canceled government meetings to enjoy her performances. The absences continued until a censor ({{lang|zh|監察御史}}) spoke out against it.<ref name=sgcq18 />

In around 964, the second of the couple's 2 sons, a 3-year-old still called by his [[milk name]] Ruibao ({{lang|zh|瑞保}}),<ref>The child was posthumously called Li Zhongxuan (李仲宣).</ref> died unexpectedly. Li would mourn his son by himself so as not to sadden his wife more than necessary,<ref name=sgcq19 /> but Queen Zhou was completely devastated and quickly deteriorated in health. During her illness, Li attended her so devotedly that he did not disrobe for days.<ref name=sgcq18 /> When the queen finally succumbed to illness, Li mourned so bitterly until "his bones stuck out and he could stand up only with the aid of a staff."<ref name=bryantxxiv>{{harvnb|Bryant|loc=p. xxiv.}}</ref> In addition to several grieving poems, he chiseled the roughly 2000 characters of his "Dirge for the Zhaohui Queen Zhou" ({{lang|zh|昭惠周后誄}}) — "Zhaohui" being her [[posthumous name]] — to her headstone himself.<ref name=sgcq18 /> Part of the dirge read (as translated by Daniel Bryant):<ref name=bryant118>{{harvnb|Bryant|loc=p. 118.}}</ref>

</center>

While Li Yu was almost certainly sincere in his love for his wife, during her last days he also engaged in a secret sexual relationship with Queen Zhou the Younger, the queen's younger sister, who was only around 14 at that time. Worst of all, the queen discovered the "affair"<ref>No [[Chinese sovereign]] was expected to be completely faithful to one's spouse.</ref> which probably hastened her demise and multiplied Li Yu's regret. A few months later, in late 965, disaster stroke again: Queen Dowager Zhong died after several months of attentive care-taking by Li. The subsequent mourning period delayed Li's marriage to the younger Lady Zhou until 968.<ref name=sgcq18 />

===Deaths of Lin Renzhao and Pan You===
After conquering [[Jingnan]], the [[Hunan]] region and [[Later Shu]], the Song Dynasty army set off to invade [[Southern Han]] in 971, Southern Tang's southwestern neighbor. [[Lin Renzhao]], the Southern Tang [[jiedushi|military governor]] of Zhenhai Command ({{lang|zh-Hant|鎮海軍}}) centering in [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] (in modern [[Hubei]]), believed the opportunity golden to attack the Song cities around [[Yangzhou]] (in modern Jiangsu) as the main Song army would be a long distance away and already severely fatigued. Li Yu immediately rejected Lin's request: "Stop the nonsense talks, (stop) destroying (our) country!"<ref name=sgcq24>{{harvnb|''Shiguo Chunqiu''|loc=[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/十國春秋/卷024 ch.24]}}</ref>

What Li was perhaps unaware was a year before, the Song military had gotten hold of an important chart with detailed measurements of Yangtze River crossing points, provided by a Southern Tang defector named [[Fan Ruoshui]]. After the conquest of Southern Han, their next step was to eliminate Lin Renzhao. In 974, Emperor Taizu of Song got hold of a Lin portrait through [[spy|agents]] working in Southern Tang, and Li Congshan, the hostage kept in Bianliang, was then made to believe that Lin's loyalty was with Song. When Li Yu was told of this, he without a thorough investigation secretly poisoned Lin to death. Chancellor [[Chen Qiao]] angrily reacted to Lin's death: "Seeing loyal ministers killed, I don't know where I will die!".<ref name=sgcq24 />

===Fall of Southern Tang===
{{See also|Conquest of Southern Tang by Song}}
Not known for his governing skill, Houzhu was nevertheless a highly accomplished scholar, he allowed himself indulgence with artistic and literature pursuits, with little regard to the strong Song Kingdom that was eying its weaker neighbor. In 971, Houzhu dropped the name of Tang from its Kingdom's name, in a desperate move to please the mighty [[Emperor Taizu of Song]].

Of the many other kingdoms surrounding the [[Southern Tang]], only [[Wuyue]] to the east had yet to fall. The Southern Tang's turn came in 974, when, after several refusals to summons to the Song court, on the excuse of illness, [[Song dynasty]] armies invaded. After a year long siege of the Southern Tang capital, modern [[Nanjing]], Li Houzhu surrendered, in 975; and, he and his family were taken as captives to the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] capital at present-day [[Kaifeng]].<ref>Wu, 213</ref> In a later poem, Li wrote about the shame and regret he had on the day he was taken away from Jinling (as translated by Hsiung Ting<ref name=hsiung332>{{harvnb|Hsiung|loc=p. 332}}</ref>):

==Devotion to the arts==
Although, Li Yu indeed was a great exponent and developer of the ''Ci'' poetry form, which form sometimes or often seems to characterize poetry of the Song Dynasty, there is also some difficulty in categorizing him as a Song poet: the Southern Tang state is more of a continuation of Tang than a precursor on the Song side of the divide of the history of the [[Tang-Song transition]], also known as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. Li Yu represents both a continuation of the [[Tang poetry]] tradition, as well as representing the ''Ci'' poetic style which is so especially associated with the poetry of Song.

Li Houzhu devoted much of his time to pleasure-making and literature, and this is reflected in his early poems. A second phase of Li's ''ci'' poems seems to have been the development of an even sadder style after the death of his wife, in 964.<ref name="Davis, xx">Davis, xx</ref> His best-known, and saddest, poems were composed during the years of his captivity, after he formally abdicated his reign to the Song, in 975. He was created the Marquess of Wei Ming (Chinese: 違命侯; literally, the Marquess of Disobeyed Edicts), a token title only: actually, he was a prisoner, though with the outward accoutrements of a prince. Li's works from this period dwell on his regret for the lost kingdom and the pleasures it had brought him.

He developed the [[Chinese poetry|ci]] by broadening its scope from [[love]] to [[history]] and [[philosophy]], particularly in his later works. He also introduced the two [[stanza]] form, and made great use of contrasts between longer lines of nine [[Character (computing)|characters]] and shorter ones of three and five. Only 45 of his ''ci'' poems survive, thirty of which have been verified to be his authentic works, the other of which are possibly composed by other writers: also, seventeen [[Shi (poetry)|shi]] style poems remain to his credit.<ref name="Davis, xx"/> His story remains very popular in many [[Cantonese opera]]s.

==Death==
He was poisoned by the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Taizong]] in 978, after he had written a poem that, in a veiled manner, lamented the destruction of his empire and the rape of his second wife Empress Zhou the Younger by the Song emperor. After his death, he was posthumously created the Prince of Wu ({{lang|zh-Hant|吳王}}).

==Writing==

===''Ci'' poetry===
{{Further|Ci (poetry)}}
The roughly 40 (some of which incomplete owing to damaged manuscripts) ''ci'' poems possibly written by Li Yu are summarized in the table below. The ''ci'' as a poetic form follows set patterns or tunes ({{lang|zh|詞牌}}).

A few poems have been set to music in modern times, most notably the 3 songs in superstar [[Teresa Teng]]'s 1983 album ''[[Dandan youqing|Light Exquisite Feelings]]''. Some of the songs are mentioned below.

====Poetry Examples====
Poems like these are often invoked in later periods of strife and confusion by literary figures.

<u>''Alone Up the Western Tower'' (獨上西樓)</u>

One of Li Yu's most famous poems, popularly known as "Alone Up the Western Tower" ({{lang|zh|獨上西樓}}), was written after his capture. Here is translated by Chan Hong-mo:<ref>{{harvnb|Chan|loc=p. 169.}}</ref>

{|
|-
|無言獨上西樓
|''Alone to silence, up the western tower, I myself bestow.''
|-
|月如鉤
|''Like silver curtain hook, so does the moon glow.''
|-
|寂寞梧桐
|''The fallen leaves of one forsaken [[Firmiana simplex|parasol]]''
|-
|深院鎖清秋
|''Make deeper still the limpid autumn locked up in the court below.''
|-
|剪不斷
|''Try cutting it, it is still profuse –''
|-
|理還亂
|''More minding will but more confuse –''
|-
|是離愁
|''Ah, parting's such enduring sorrow!''
|-
|class="nowrap"|別有一番滋味在心頭
|''It leaves behind a very special taste the heart alone could know.''

This was also rendered into a song by [[Teresa Teng]], one of the most popular Asian singers ever.

<u>''Jiangnan Remembrance'' (望江南), second stanza</u>

{|

|多少恨，
|''Such hatred,''
|-

===Prose writing===
Though miscellaneous in character, Li Yu's surviving prose writings also demonstrated his poetic genius. For example, "Dirge for the Zhaohui Queen Zhou" is rhymed and almost entirely in regular four-character [[metre (poetry)|metre]], resembling the dominant ''[[fu (poetry)|fu]]'' form a millennium before.

Li Yu's [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] style has been dubbed "Golden Inlaid Dagger" ({{lang|zh|金錯刀}}) for its perceived force and clarity. As one Song Dynasty writer noted: "The large characters are like split bamboo, the small ones like clusters of needles; altogether unlike anything done with a brush!"<ref>{{harvnb|Bryant|loc=p. xxiii.}}</ref>

==Television series==
Three independent television series focused on the complex relationships between Li Yu (Li Houzhu), [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] (Zhao Kuangyin) and the various women in their lives. They are:
* ''[[The Sword and the Song]]'' ({{lang|zh|絕代雙雄}}), a 1986 Singaporean series starring [[Li Wenhai (actor)|Li Wenhai]] as Li Yu.
* ''Love, Sword, Mountain & River'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|情劍山河}}), a 1996 Taiwanese series starring Chin Feng as Li Yu.
