'''Ron Androla''' (born August 7, 1954) is an American poet and the author of more than forty books of poetry. He has been published extensively in the American [[small press]] scene.

== Life ==

Androla was born in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]] to a family of mixed Syrian and Italian ancestry. In the early 1970s, Androla attended [[Point Park College]] and later [[Franconia College]], where he studied under poet [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]] and came ''under the influence'' of [[Language poets]] whom he emulated at the time. However, he regards himself as part of a tradition of underground American poetry that largely rejects academic context. He considers his entry into the labor force as the true inception of his poetic vocation. For over thirty years, he worked in factories as a [[Hydraulic press|pressure press]] operator. The faces and personas of coworkers often feature in his poetry, which sketches the minutiae of working-class existence in the United States in a confessional style. Before retiring, Androla also worked as a directory assistance operator for a major telecommunications company. 
His writing credits continue to accumulate, spanning over half a century of publishing.

He currently resides in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] with his wife, Ann, who is also a writer.

== Works ==

He cites the work of the [[Black Mountain poets]] as an early source of inspiration, and his work continues to show a strong influence of the [[Black Mountain poets#Projective verse|Projective Verse]] style. His work also demonstrates the considerable influence of [[Charles Bukowski]], especially in its disaffection and in its use of the short line, [[parataxis|paratactical]] structures, colloquial enjambments and [[stream of consciousness technique]]. Like [[Jack Kerouac]] and other [[Beat generation|Beat poets]], Androla prefers spontaneity and directness of experience. His poetry often explores an oneiric mental landscape which underlies everyday experience, with recurrent themes of alienation and ecstasy; its tone is most often curious and subtly bemused. He also writes vivid, imaginative short stories & flash fiction, featured in two of his recently published books.
