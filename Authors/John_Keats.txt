'''John Keats''' (31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821) was an English poet prominent in the second generation of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, with [[Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], although his poems had been published for only four years when he died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 25.<ref name="Neill418">O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), p. 418.</ref> They were indifferently received, but his fame grew rapidly after his death.<ref>Amy Wilcockson, "The Romantic Reputation of John Keats". ''History Today'', February 2021, pp. 13–16.</ref> By the end of the century he was placed in the canon of English literature and an inspiration for the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], strongly influencing many writers; the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' called one ode "one of the final masterpieces". [[Jorge Luis Borges]] named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges (2000). ''This Craft of Verse''. Harvard University Press, pp. 98–101.</ref> Keats had a style "heavily loaded with sensualities", notably in the [[John Keats's 1819 odes|series of odes]]. Typical of the Romantics, he underlined extreme emotion with natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature. Especially acclaimed are "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]", "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]", "[[Sleep and Poetry]]" and the sonnet "[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]".

==Biography==
===Early life===
John Keats was born in [[Moorgate]], London, on 31 October 1795, to Thomas and Frances Keats (née Jennings). There is little evidence of his exact birthplace. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29 October, baptism records give the date as the 31st.<ref name="Motion 1997, 10">Motion, 1997, p. 10.</ref><ref name="NDB">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15229?docPos=1 Kelvin Everest, "Keats, John (1795–1821)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 Online (subscription only)</ref> He was the eldest of four surviving children, the others being [[George Keats|George]] (1797–1841), Thomas (1799–1818), and Frances Mary "Fanny" (1803–1889), who later married the Spanish author Valentín Llanos Gutiérrez.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=27 December 1883 |title=Literary gossip |url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n31/mode/1up |journal=The Week : A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=61 |access-date=23 April 2013}}</ref> Another son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as a [[hostler]]<ref>Gittings (1968), 11.</ref> at the stables attached to the ''Swan and Hoop Inn'' owned by his father-in-law, John Jennings, an establishment he later managed, and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed he was born at the inn, a birthplace of humble origins, but there is no evidence to support this.<ref name="NDB"/> The ''Globe'' pub now occupies the site (2012), a few yards from modern [[Moorgate station]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 August 2008 |title=Two become one at The Globe |work=Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/bars/two-become-one-at-the-globe-7408848.html |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref>

Keats was baptised at [[St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate]], and sent to a local [[dame school]] as a child.<ref name="Motion 1997, 10"/><ref>Gittings (1968), p. 24.</ref>

[[File:Keatslifemask.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Life mask of Keats by [[Benjamin Haydon]], 1816]]
His parents wished to send their sons to [[Eton College|Eton]] or [[Harrow School|Harrow]], but the family decided they could not afford the fees.<ref>Bate, 2009, p. 5.</ref><ref>Harrow. Motion, 1998, p. 22.</ref><ref>Milnes, 1848.</ref> In the summer of 1803, John was sent to board at John Clarke's school in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], close to his grandparents' house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools.<ref name="Poemsletters"/> In the family atmosphere at Clarke's, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to [[Renaissance]] literature, including [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[George Chapman|Chapman's translations]]. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, "always in extremes", given to indolence and fighting. However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.<ref name="Poemsletters">Gittings (1987), pp. 1–3.</ref>

In April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture after falling from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school.<ref>''John Keats'', Colvin, S, (1917)</ref> He died [[intestacy|intestate]]. Frances remarried two months later, but left her new husband soon afterwards, and the four children went to live with a grandmother, Alice Jennings, in the village of [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]].<ref>Monckton Milnes (1848), p. xiii.</ref>

In March 1810, when Keats was 14, his mother died of [[tuberculosis]], leaving the children in their grandmother's custody. She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, for them. That autumn, Keats left Clarke's school to be an apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813.<ref name="NDB"/> Cowden Clarke, who remained close to Keats, called this period "the most placid time in Keats' life."<ref>Motion (1999), p. 46.</ref>

===Early career===
From 1814 Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday. £800 was willed by his grandfather John Jennings. Also Keats's mother left a legacy of £8000 to be equally divided between her living children.<ref group="nb"> Keats's share would have increased on the death of his brother Tom in 1818.</ref> <ref>{{Cite web |title=See the British National Archives for conversion rates |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/default0.asp#mid |access-date=1 March 2014 |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref> <ref name="NDB"/>It seems he was not told of the £800 and probably knew nothing of it as he never applied for it. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware of it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Motion |first=Andrew |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziYDoDVsNjYC&pg=PA43 |title=Keats |date=1999 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54240-9 |page=43}}</ref> William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely knew and had a [[duty of care]] to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not, though it would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a big concern for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.<ref name="NDB"/>

'''On First Looking into Chapman's Homer'''
Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken;
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
He star'd at the Pacific {{snd}} and all his men
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise {{snd}}
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.
</poem>|source =The sonnet "[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]"<br />October 1816}}

Having finished his apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered as a medical student at [[Guy's Hospital]] (now part of [[King's College London]]) from October 1815. Within a month, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital assisting surgeons during operations – the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a marked promotion acknowledging a distinct aptitude for medicine, but bringing greater responsibility and a heavier workload.<ref name="NDB"/> Keats's long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and Keats seems at that time to have a genuine desire to become a doctor.<ref name="NDB"/><ref name="Poemsletters"/> He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including [[Henry Stephens (doctor)|Henry Stephens]] who gained fame as an inventor and ink magnate.<ref>Motion (1998), p. 74.</ref>

However, Keats's training took up increasing amounts of his writing time and he became increasingly ambivalent about it. He felt he was facing a stark choice.<ref name="Poemsletters"/><ref>Motion (1998), p. 98.</ref> He had written his first extant poem, "An Imitation of Spenser," in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Lord Byron]], and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John "feared that he should never be a poet, & if he was not he would destroy himself."<ref>Motion (1997), p. 94.</ref> In 1816, Keats received his [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|apothecary's licence]], which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician and surgeon, but before the end of the year he had informed his guardian that he resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.<ref name="NDB"/>

While continuing to work and train at Guy's, Keats spent more and more time studying literature and experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet.<ref name="NDB"/> In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet "O Solitude" in his magazine ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', a leading liberal magazine of the day.<ref name="hirsch">Hirsch, Edward (2001)</ref> This was the first appearance of Keats's poetry in print; [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] called it his friend's red letter day,<ref>Colvin (2006), p. 35.</ref> the first proof that his ambitions could be achieved. Among his poems of 1816 was ''To My Brothers''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Keats |first=John |year=1816 |title=Sonnett VIII. To My Brothers |url=https://www.poemist.com/john-keats/sonnet-viii-to-my-brothers |access-date=31 October 2015 |publisher=Poemist.com}}</ref> That summer, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of [[Margate]] to write. There he began "Calidore" and initiated a great period of letter-writing. On returning to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself to study further for membership of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].<ref>Motion (1998), pp. 104–105.</ref>

In October 1816, Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of ''Poems'', the first volume of Keats's verse, which included "I stood tiptoe" and "Sleep and Poetry," both strongly influenced by Hunt.<ref name="hirsch" /> The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in ''The Champion''.<ref name="Poemsletters"/> Clarke commented that the book "might have emerged in Timbuctoo."<!---sic---><ref name="NDB"/> Keats's publishers, [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]], felt ashamed of it. Keats immediately changed publishers to [[John Taylor (English publisher)|Taylor and Hessey]] in [[Fleet Street]].<ref>Motion proposes that the Olliers suggested Keats leave their publishing lists. See Motion (1997) p. 156.</ref> Unlike the Olliers, Keats's new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of ''Poems'' they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists came to include [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[John Clare|Clare]], [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg|Hogg]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[Charles Lamb|Lamb]].<ref>Motion (1997), p. 156.</ref>

Through Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their [[Eton College|Eton]]-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by ''Poems''. Although he noted that Keats could be "wayward, trembling, easily daunted," he was convinced of Keats's genius, a poet to support as he became one of England's greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about the poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats's work.<ref name="NDB"/> Andrew Motion represents him as [[James Boswell|Boswell]] to Keats's [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]], ceaselessly promoting his work, fighting his corner and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few to accompany Keats to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] to embark on his final trip to Rome.<ref>Motion (1997), p. 157.</ref>

Despite the bad reviews of ''Poems'', Hunt published the essay "Three Young Poets" ([[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], Keats, and [[John Hamilton Reynolds|Reynolds]]) and the sonnet "[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]," foreseeing great things to come.<ref>Gittings (1968), p. 155.</ref> He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of ''[[The Times]]'', [[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]]; the writer [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]; the conductor [[Vincent Novello]]; and the poet [[John Hamilton Reynolds]], who would become a close friend.<ref>Motion (1997), pp. 116–120.</ref> Keats also met regularly with [[William Hazlitt]], a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed "a new school of poetry".<ref>Motion (1997) p. 130.</ref> At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, "I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth."<ref name="Neill418"/><ref>Keats's letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817</ref> This passage would eventually appear in the concluding lines of "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]": {{"'}}Beauty is truth, truth beauty' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter [[Benjamin Haydon]]. He would go on to lend £700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.<ref name="NDB"/><ref>Bate (1964) p. 632.</ref>

Having left his hospital training, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers to rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of [[Hampstead]] in April 1817. There John and George nursed their [[tuberculosis|tubercular]] brother Tom. The house was close to Hunt and others of his circle in Hampstead, and to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, then living in [[Highgate]]. On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had taken a long walk on [[Hampstead Heath]]. In a letter to his brother George, he wrote that they had talked about "a thousand things,... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics."<ref>Motion (1997), pp. 365–366.</ref> Around this time he met [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]] and James Rice.<ref>Motion (1997), pp. 364 and 184.</ref>

In June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the [[Lake District]] with [[Charles Armitage Brown]]. Keats's brother George and his wife Georgina came with them as far as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and then took a ship from [[Liverpool]] to America. They lived in [[Ohio]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky]] until 1841, when George's investments failed. Like Keats's other brother, they died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment at the time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/30/archives/tracing-the-keats-family-in-america-tracing-the-keats-family-in.html ''Tracing the Keats Family in America]'' ''New York Times'' Koch 30 July 1922.

===Wentworth Place===
[[File:J Keats House.jpg|thumb|Wentworth Place, now the [[Keats House]] museum (left), Ten Keats Grove (right)]]<!---worth not cropping re the library, the two buildings are inherently connected)--->

John Keats moved to the newly built Wentworth Place, owned by his friend Charles Armitage Brown. It was on the edge of [[Hampstead Heath]], ten minutes' walk south of his old home in Well Walk. The winter of 1818–19, though a difficult period for the poet, marked the beginning of his ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' in which he wrote his most mature work.<ref name="Neill418"/> He had been inspired by a series of recent lectures by Hazlitt on English poets and poetic identity and had also met [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref name="OCEL">"Keats, John" ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc.</ref> Keats may have seemed to his friends to be living on comfortable means, but in reality he was borrowing regularly from Abbey and his friends.<ref name="NDB"/>

He composed five of his [[John Keats's 1819 odes|six great odes]] at Wentworth Place in April and May and, although it is debated in which order they were written, "[[Ode to Psyche]]" opened the published series. According to Brown, "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" was composed under a plum tree in the garden.<ref group="nb">The original plum tree no longer survives, though others have been planted since.</ref><ref>Charles Armitage Brown (1937) 53–54</ref><ref>Hart, Christopher (2 August 2009).

Retrieved 29 January 2010.</ref> Brown wrote, "In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of our nightingale."<ref>Bate (1963), p. 63.</ref> Dilke, co-owner of the house, strenuously denied the story, printed in [[Richard Monckton Milnes]]' 1848 biography of Keats, dismissing it as 'pure delusion'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keats |first=John |url=https://archive.org/details/odesofkeatstheir0000keat |title=The odes of Keats and their earliest known manuscripts |last2=Gittings |first2=Robert |publisher=Kent State University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0873380997 |author-link2=Robert Gittings |url-access=registration}}</ref>

</poem> |source =First stanza of "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]",<br />May 1819}}

"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]" and "[[Ode on Melancholy]]" were inspired by sonnet forms and probably written after "Ode to a Nightingale".<ref name="NDB" /> Keats's new and progressive publishers Taylor and Hessey issued ''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]'', which Keats dedicated to [[Thomas Chatterton]], a work that he termed "a trial of my Powers of Imagination".<ref name="NDB"/> It was damned by the critics, giving rise to Byron's quip that Keats was ultimately "snuffed out by an article", suggesting that he never truly got over it. A particularly harsh review by [[John Wilson Croker]] appeared in the April 1818 edition of the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''.<ref group="nb">''The Quarterly Review''. April 1818, pp. 204–208. "It is not, we say, that the author has not powers of language, rays of fancy, and gleams of genius – he has all these; but he is unhappily a disciple of the new school of what has been somewhere called 'Cockney Poetry'; which may be defined to consist of the most incongruous ideas in the most uncouth language.... There is hardly a complete couplet enclosing a complete idea in the whole book. He wanders from one subject to another, from the association, not of ideas, but of sounds."</ref> [[John Gibson Lockhart]] writing in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', described ''Endymion'' as "imperturbable drivelling idiocy". With biting sarcasm, Lockhart advised, "It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop Mr John, back to plasters, pills, and ointment boxes."<ref group="nb">[http://google.com/search?q=cache:mdpSIpsVc4AJ:www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/nineteenth_century_literary_manuscripts_part_4/Extract-Cockney-School-ofPoetry.aspx+John+Gibson+Lockhart+wrote+in+%27%27Blackwood%27s+Magazine%27%27+%3Cblockquote%3E+%22To+witness+the+disease+of+any+human+understanding&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-a Extracts] from [[Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]], 3 (1818) pp. 519–524.

"To witness the disease of any human understanding, however feeble, is distressing; but the spectacle of an able mind reduced to a state of insanity is, of course, ten times more afflicting. It is with such sorrow as this that we have contemplated the case of Mr John Keats.... He was bound apprentice some years ago to a worthy apothecary in town. But all has been undone by a sudden attack of the malady&nbsp;... For some time we were in hopes that he might get off with a violent fit or two; but of late the symptoms are terrible. The phrenzy of the "Poems" was bad enough in its way; but it did not alarm us half so seriously as the calm, settled, imperturbable drivelling idiocy of ''Endymion''.... It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the [apothecary] shop Mr John, back to 'plasters, pills, and ointment boxes' ".</ref> It was Lockhart at ''Blackwoods'' who coined the defamatory term "the [[Cockney School]]" for Hunt and his circle, which included both Hazlitt and Keats. The dismissal was as much political as literary, aimed at upstart young writers deemed uncouth for their lack of education, non-formal rhyming and "low diction". They had not attended [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] or [[Oxbridge]] and they were not from the upper classes.<ref>Motion (1997) pp. 204–205.</ref>

In 1819, Keats wrote "[[The Eve of St. Agnes]]", "[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]", "[[Hyperion (poem)|Hyperion]]", "[[Lamia (poem)|Lamia]]" and a play, ''Otho the Great'' (critically damned and not performed until 1950).<ref>A preface to Keats (1985) Cedric Thomas Watts, Longman, University of Michigan p. 90 {{ISBN|978-0582353671}}</ref> The poems "Fancy" and "Bards of passion and of mirth" were inspired by the garden of Wentworth Place. In September, very short of money and in despair considering taking up journalism or a post as a ship's surgeon, he approached his publishers with a new book of poems.<ref name="NDB" /> They were unimpressed with the collection, finding the presented versions of "Lamia" confusing, and describing "St Agnes" as having a "sense of pettish disgust" and "a 'Don Juan' style of mingling up sentiment and sneering" concluding it was "a poem unfit for ladies".<ref>Gittings (1968), p. 504.</ref> The final volume Keats lived to see, ''Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems'', was eventually published in July 1820. It received greater acclaim than had ''Endymion'' or ''Poems'', finding favourable notices in both ''The Examiner'' and ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. It would come to be recognised as one of the most important poetic works ever published.<ref name="NDB"/>

===Isabella Jones and Fanny Brawne===
{{See also|Fanny Brawne}}
Keats befriended Isabella Jones in May 1817, while on holiday in the village of [[Bulverhythe|Bo Peep]], near [[Hastings]]. She is described as beautiful, talented and widely read, not of the top flight of society yet financially secure, an enigmatic figure who would become a part of Keats's circle.<ref name="Motion180-1">Motion (1997), pp. 180–181.</ref><ref name="Gittings 1968, 139"/> Throughout their friendship Keats never hesitates to own his sexual attraction to her, although they seem to enjoy circling each other rather than offering commitment. He writes that he "frequented her rooms" in the winter of 1818–19, and in his letters to George says that he "warmed with her" and "kissed her".<ref name="Gittings 1968, 139">Gittings (1968), p. 139.</ref> The trysts may have been a sexual initiation for Keats according to Bate and Gittings.<ref name="Gittings 1968, 139"/> Jones inspired and was a steward of Keats's writing. The themes of "The Eve of St. Agnes" and "The Eve of St Mark" may well have been suggested by her, the lyric ''Hush, Hush!'' ["o sweet Isabel"] was about her, and that the first version of "[[Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art|Bright Star]]" may have originally been for her.<ref>Walsh, William (1981) ''Introduction to Keats'' Law Book Co of Australasia, p. 81.</ref><ref>Gittings (1956), ''Mask of Keats''. Heinemann, p. 45.</ref> In 1821, Jones was one of the first in England to be notified of Keats's death.<ref name="Motion180-1"/>

Letters and drafts of poems suggest that Keats first met Frances (Fanny) Brawne between September and November 1818.<ref>Gittings (1968), 262</ref> It is likely that the 18-year-old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there. She was born in the hamlet of West End (now in the district of [[West Hampstead]]), on 9 August 1800. Like Keats's grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats's sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent.<ref>Gittings (1968), p. 268.</ref> During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.<ref>Gittings (1968), p. 264.</ref>

[[File:Fannybrawne.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Ambrotype]] of Fanny Brawne taken circa 1850 (photograph on glass)]]
On 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke's Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet "Bright Star" (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. "All his desires were concentrated on Fanny".<ref name="autogenerated1">Gittings (1968), pp. 293–298</ref> From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture.<ref name="Gittings327">Gittings (1968), pp. 327–331.</ref> Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his 'star' began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as "The Eve of St. Agnes" and "La Belle Dame sans Merci" where love and death both stalk. "I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;" he wrote to her, "...your loveliness, and the hour of my death".<ref name=Gittings327/>

In one of his many hundreds of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: "My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you&nbsp;– I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again&nbsp;– my Life seems to stop there&nbsp;– I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving&nbsp;– I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you&nbsp;... I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion&nbsp;– I have shudder'd at it&nbsp;– I shudder no more&nbsp;– I could be martyr'd for my Religion&nbsp;– Love is my religion&nbsp;– I could die for that&nbsp;– I could die for you."

Tuberculosis took hold and he was advised by his doctors to move to a warmer climate. In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters, although he did correspond with her mother.<ref name="NDB" /> He died there five months later. None of Brawne's letters to Keats survive.<ref>[http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/exhibits/keats/year_1820.cfm Houghton Library, Harvard University], ''I shall ever be your dearest love: John Keats and Fanny Brawne''. "1820".</ref>

It took a month for the news of his death to reach London, after which Brawne stayed in mourning for six years. In 1833, more than 12 years after his death, she married and went on to have three children; she outlived Keats by more than 40 years.<ref name="guardian"/><ref>Richardson, 1952, p. 112.</ref>

===Last months: Rome===
During 1820 Keats displayed increasingly serious symptoms of [[tuberculosis]], suffering two lung haemorrhages in the first few days of February.<ref>Bate (1964), p. 636.</ref><ref>Motion (1997), p. 496.</ref> On first coughing up blood, on 3 February 1820, he said to Charles Armitage Brown, "I know the colour of that blood! It is arterial blood. I cannot be deceived in that colour. That drop of blood is my death warrant. I must die."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |url=https://archive.org/details/greatestbenefitt00port |title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity (The Norton History of Science) |year=1998 |publisher=[[W.

He lost large amounts of blood and was bled further by the attending physician. Hunt nursed him in London for much of the following summer. At the suggestion of his doctors, he agreed to move to Italy with his friend [[Joseph Severn]]. On 13 September, they left for [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and four days later boarded the sailing brig ''Maria Crowther''. On 1 October the ship landed at [[Lulworth Cove|Lulworth Bay]] or Holworth Bay, where the two went ashore; back on board ship he made the final revisions of "Bright Star".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rodriguez |first=Andres |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oRsm49wthkC&pg=PA221 |title=Book of the Heart: The Poetics, Letters, and Life of John Keats |last2=Rodríguez |first2=Andrés |year=1993 |publisher=SteinerBooks |isbn=978-0940262577 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>Thomas Hardy's poem "At Lulworth Cove a Century Back", September 1920, commemorates Keats's landing on the Dorset coast on the voyage to Rome.</ref> The journey was a minor catastrophe: storms broke out, followed by a dead calm that slowed the ship's progress. When they finally docked in Naples, the ship was held in quarantine for ten days due to a suspected outbreak of [[cholera]] in Britain. Keats reached Rome on 14 November, by which time any hope of the warmer climate he sought had disappeared.<ref name="window"/>

[[File:Keats-Shelley House.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keats–Shelley Memorial House|Keats's house]] in Rome]]
Keats wrote his last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; "Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book – yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence".<ref>[http://www.keats-shelley-house.org/en/works/works-john-keats/john-keats-keats-s-last-letter Keats's Last Letter], written to [[Charles Armitage Brown]] from Rome, 30 November 1820.</ref>

On arrival in Italy, he moved into a villa on the [[Spanish Steps]] in Rome, today the [[Keats–Shelley Memorial House]] museum. Despite care from Severn and [[James Clark (physician)|Dr. James Clark]], his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical attention Keats received may have hastened his death.<ref>Brown (2009)</ref> In November 1820, Clark declared that the source of his illness was "mental exertion" and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet: a standard treatment of the day, but also likely a significant contributor to Keats's weakness.<ref name="mistakes">Flood, Alison.

Retrieved 29 January 2010.</ref> Severn's biographer Sue Brown writes: "They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn't realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn't let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again.... Severn was in such a quandary he didn't know what to do, so in the end he went to the doctor, who took it away. As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all." Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him [[laudanum]] (opium). He repeatedly demanded, "How long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on?"<ref name="mistakes"/>

===Death===
The first months of 1821 marked a slow and steady decline into the final stage of tuberculosis. Keats was coughing up blood and covered in sweat. Severn nursed him devotedly and observed in a letter how Keats would sometimes cry upon waking to find himself still alive. Severn writes,

{{quote|Keats raves till I am in a complete tremble for him<ref name="mistakes"/>... about four, the approaches of death came on. [Keats said] "Severn{{snd}}I{{snd}}lift me up{{snd}}I am dying{{snd}}I shall die easy; don't be frightened{{snd}}be firm, and thank God it has come." I lifted him up in my arms. The phlegm seem'd boiling in his throat, and increased until eleven, when he gradually sank into death, so quiet, that I still thought he slept.<ref>Colvin (1917), p. 208.</ref>}}
[[File:John Keats Tombstone in Rome 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Keats's grave in Rome]]

John Keats died in Rome on 23 February 1821. His body was buried in the city's [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]]. His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date, only the words, "Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water." Severn and Brown erected the stone, which under a relief of a [[lyre]] with broken strings, includes the epitaph: <!-- This is a poem - marking the given line break format is important. -->
{{quote|This Grave / contains all that was Mortal, / of a / YOUNG ENGLISH POET, / Who, / on his Death Bed, / in the Bitterness of his Heart, / at the Malicious Power of his Enemies, / Desired / these Words to be engraven on his Tomb Stone / ''Here lies One / Whose Name was writ in Water / Feb 24<sup>th</sup> 1821''}}

The text bears an echo from [[Catullus]] LXX:
{{quote|{{lang|la|Sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti / in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua}} (What a woman says to a passionate lover / should be written in the wind and the running water).}}
[[Francis Beaumont]] also used the expression in ''The Nice Valour'', Act 5, scene 5 (? 1616):
{{quote|All your better deeds / Shall be in water writ, but this in marble.}}

Severn and Brown added their lines to the stone in protest at the critical reception of Keats's work. Hunt blamed his death on the ''Quarterly Review''{{'}}s scathing attack of "Endymion". As Byron quipped in his narrative poem ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]'';
{{quote|<poem>
'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle
Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.
(canto 11, stanza 60)
</poem>}}

Seven weeks after the funeral, Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem ''[[Adonais]]''.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/adonais-elegy-death-john-keats Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats]. Representative Poetry Online. Retrieved 29 January 2010.</ref> Clark saw to the planting of daisies on the grave, saying that Keats would have wished it.

When Keats died at 25, he had been writing poetry seriously for only about six years, from 1814 until the summer of 1820, and publishing for only four. In his lifetime, sales of Keats's three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies.<ref name="guardian1">{{Cite news |last=Andrew Motion |date=23 January 2010 |title=Article 23 January 2010 ''An introduction to the poetry of John Keats'' |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/john-keats-andrew-motion |access-date=15 February 2010}}</ref> His first poem, the [[sonnet]] ''O Solitude'', appeared in ''the Examiner'' in May 1816, while his collection ''Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems'' was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats's work.<ref name="Neill418"/>

Although prolific during his short career, and now one of the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, [[John Keats's 1819 odes|centred on the Odes]],<ref>Strachan (2003), p. 2.</ref> and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death.<ref name="Walsh">Walsh (1957), pp. 220–221.</ref> Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, "I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember'd."<ref>{{Cite web |title=John-Keats.com – Letters |url=http://www.john-keats.com/briefe/000220.htm |access-date=23 February 2019 |website=www.john-keats.com}}</ref>

Keats's ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt.<ref name="guardian1"/> His admirers praised him for thinking "on his pulses", for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities, more gorgeous in its effects, more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him: "loading every rift with ore".<ref>Keats Letter To Percy Bysshe Shelley, 16 August 1820</ref> Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keats's death had been brought on by bad reviews in the ''Quarterly Review''. Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote ''[[Adonais]]'', a despairing elegy,<ref>''[[Adonais]]'' by Shelley is a despairing [[elegy]] of 495 lines and 55 [[Spenserian stanza]]s. It was published that July 1820 and he came to view it as his "least imperfect" work.</ref> stating that Keats's early death was a personal and public tragedy:
{{quote|<poem>
The loveliest and the last,

Died on the promise of the fruit.<ref>''[[Adonais]]'' (Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats, Author of Endymion, Hyperion, etc.) by Shelley, published 1821</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats &#124; Representative Poetry Online |url=https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/adonais-elegy-death-john-keats |website=rpo.library.utoronto.ca}}</ref></poem>}}

Although Keats wrote that "if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all," poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye.<ref name="Walsh"/> His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's ''Examiner'', which Keats read as a boy.<ref name="Poems18">Gittings (1987), pp. 18–21.</ref> Hunt scorned the [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] or "French" school, dominated by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. Indeed, during Keats's few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a "new school" for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis for the scathing attacks from ''Blackwood's'' and the ''Quarterly Review''.<ref name="Poems18"/>
{{Quote box |width=450px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right |quote =<poem>
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
</poem> |source =First stanza of "[[To Autumn]]",<ref name="PaL157">Gittings (1987), 157</ref><br />September 1819}}
By the time of his death, Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools: the obscurity of the first-wave Romantics and the uneducated affectation of Hunt's "Cockney School". Keats's posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers' caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of the hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling, which Shelley later portrayed.<ref name="Poems18"/>

The Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing, his reputation grew steadily and remarkably.<ref name="Poems18" /> His work had the full support of the influential [[Cambridge Apostles]], whose members included the young [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]],<ref group="nb">[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] was writing Keats-style poetry in the 1830s and was being critically attacked in the same manner as his predecessor.</ref> later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century.<ref name="OCEL"/> [[Constance Naden]] was a great admirer of his poems, arguing that his genius lay in his 'exquisite sensitiveness to all the elements of beauty'.<ref>'Poesy Club', Mason College Magazine, 4.5 (October 1886), p. 106.</ref> In 1848, twenty-seven years after Keats's death, [[Richard Monckton Milnes]] published the first full biography, which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], including [[John Everett Millais|Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including "The Eve of St. Agnes", "Isabella" and "La Belle Dame sans Merci", lush, arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats's work.<ref name="Poems18"/>

In 1882, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] wrote in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' that "the Ode to a Nightingale, [is] one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages".<ref>"Keats, John". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Ninth Edition, Vol. XIV. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1882. pp. 22–24.</ref> In the 20th century Keats remained the muse of poets such as [[Wilfred Owen]], who kept his death date as a day of mourning, Yeats and T. S. Eliot.<ref name="Poems18"/> Critic [[Helen Vendler]] stated the odes "are a group of works in which the English language find ultimate embodiment."<ref>Vendler (1983) p. 60.</ref> [[Jonathan Bate|Bate]] declared of ''[[To Autumn]]'': "Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English"<ref>Bate (1963) p. 581.</ref> and M.

The largest collection of the letters, manuscripts, and other papers of Keats is in the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]]. Other collections of material are archived at the [[British Library]], [[Keats House]], [[Hampstead]], the [[Keats–Shelley Memorial House]] in Rome and the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] in New York.

===Biographers===
None of Keats's biographies were written by people who had known him.<ref name="gittings3"/> Shortly after his death, his publishers announced they would speedily publish ''The memoirs and remains of John Keats'' but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to such an extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunt's ''Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries'' (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats's supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues.<ref name="NDB"/> Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters.<ref name="gittings3">Gittings (1968), p. 3.</ref> However, early accounts often gave contradictory or biased versions of events and were subject to dispute.<ref name="gittings3"/> His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats's life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.<ref>Gittings (1968), p. 5.</ref>

Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today.<ref>Motion (1997), p. 499.</ref> The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include [[Sidney Colvin]], [[Robert Gittings]], [[Walter Jackson Bate]], Aileen Ward, and [[Andrew Motion]]. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.<ref name="NDB"/>

==Letters==
[[File:John Keats - On death - Breestraat 113, Leiden.JPG|thumb|The poem ''On death'' on a wall at Breestraat 113 in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]
Keats's letters first appeared in 1848 and 1878. Critics in the 19th century disregarded them as distractions from his poetic works,<ref name="PaL12"/> but in the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry,<ref name="OCEL"/> and are highly regarded in the canon of English literary correspondence.<ref>Strachan (2003), p. 12.</ref> [[T. S. Eliot]] called them "certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet."<ref name="OCEL"/><ref>[[T. S. Eliot]] ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1937) p. 100''</ref> Keats spent much time considering poetry itself, its constructs and impacts, displaying a deep interest unusual in his milieu, who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics, fashions or science. Eliot wrote of Keats's conclusions; "There is hardly one statement of Keats' about poetry which... will not be found to be true, and what is more, true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote."<ref name="PaL12">Gittings (1987), pp. 12–17.</ref><ref>[[T. S. Eliot]] ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1937) p. 101.''</ref>

Few of Keats's letters remain from the time before he joined his literary circle. From spring 1817, however, there is a rich record of his prolific, impressive letter-writing skills.<ref name="NDB"/> He and his friends, poets, critics, novelists, and editors wrote to each other daily, and Keats's ideas are bound up in the ordinary, his day-to-day missives sharing news, parody and social commentary. They glitter with humour and critical intelligence.<ref name="NDB"/> Born of an "unself-conscious stream of consciousness," they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots.<ref name="PaL12"/> When his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in detail, the body of letters becoming "the real diary" and self-revelation of Keats's life, as well as an exposition of his philosophy, with the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats's finest writing and thought.<ref>Gittings (1968), p. 66.</ref> Gittings sees them as akin to a "spiritual journal" not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis.<ref name="PaL12"/>

Keats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry. Specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe.<ref name="PaL12"/> In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters.<ref name="NDB"/> Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as "the vale of Soul-making", <!--- Keats's capitalisation---> anticipating the great odes he wrote some months later.<ref name="PaL12"/><ref>Letter to George Keats, Sunday 14 February 1819</ref> Here Keats coined ideas such as the [[Mansion of Many Apartments]] and the [[Chameleon Poet]], which came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, though only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence.<ref>Grant Scott, ed. ''Selected Letters of John Keats'', Harvard University Press (2002)</ref> The poetical mind, Keats argued:
<blockquote>
has no self – it is every thing and nothing – It has no character – it enjoys light and shade;... What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity – he is continually in for – and filling some other Body – The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute – the poet has none; no identity – he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures.

He used the term [[negative capability]] to discuss a state of being "capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.... [Being] content with half knowledge" where one trusts in the heart's perceptions.<ref>Duncan Wu, 2005. ''Romanticism: an anthology: Edition: 3, illustrated.'' Blackwell, 2005 p. 1351. Citing letter to George Keats. Sunday, 21 December 1817.</ref> He wrote later he was "certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination – What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth – whether it existed before or not – for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty"<ref>Letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817.</ref> constantly returning to what it means to be a poet.<ref name="autogenerated4">O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), p. 419.</ref> "My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk", Keats notes to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. In September 1819, Keats wrote to [[John Hamilton Reynolds|Reynolds]] "How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it.... I never lik'd the stubbled fields as much as now – Aye, better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm – in the same way as some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my Sunday's walk that I composed upon it".<ref>Houghton (2008), 184</ref> The final stanza of his last great ode, "[[To Autumn]]", runs:
<blockquote><poem>
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too, –
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<ref name="PaL157"/>
</poem></blockquote>
"To Autumn" was to become one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language.<ref group="nb">Bate p. 581: "Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English."</ref><ref group="nb">The 1888 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' declared that, "Of these [odes] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that of to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn" Thomas Baynes, ed. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Vol. XIV. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1888. {{OCLC|1387837}}, p. 23.</ref>

There are areas of his life and daily routine that Keats omits. He mentions little of his childhood or his financial straits, being seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is no reference to his parents.<ref name="NDB"/> In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often give way to despair and morbid obsessions. His letters to Fanny Brawne, published in 1870, focus on the period and emphasise its tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.<ref name="PaL12"/>

==References in popular culture==
In the 2003 mystery thriller [[In the Cut]] by [[Jane Campion]], [[Meg Ryan]] portrays a New York City English teacher named Annie Avery who recites the opening lines of Keats' poem “La Belle Dame Sans Merci” in a scene with [[Mark Ruffalo]].

[[Dan Simmons|Dan Simmons']] [[Hyperion Cantos]] series features several references to the life and works of John Keats. The first novel features an Artificial Intelligence recreation of John Keats as a major side character. The second book expands upon this further, with most of the story being told from the point of view of the Keats recreation, or through visions experienced by him. The novels themselves are named after two of Keats' works, namely ''[[Hyperion (poem)|Hyperion]]'' and ''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]''. These are also used in-universe as location names, such as the planet of Hyperion which contains the city of Endymion and the capital Keats.
