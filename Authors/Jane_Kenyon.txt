'''Jane Kenyon''' (May 23, 1947 – April 22, 1995) was an American [[poet]] and [[translation|translator]]. Her work is often characterized as simple, spare, and emotionally resonant. Kenyon was the second wife of poet, editor, and critic [[Donald Hall]] who made her the subject of many of his poems.

==Life==
Kenyon was born in 1947 in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] to Ruele and Pauline, she grew up in the [[Midwest]]. She earned a B.A. from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1970 and an M.A. in 1972. She won a [[Hopwood Award]] at Michigan. Also, while a student at the University of Michigan, Kenyon met the poet [[Donald Hall]]; though he was some nineteen years her senior, she married him in 1972, and they moved to Eagle Pond Farm, his ancestral home in [[Wilmot, New Hampshire|Wilmot]], [[New Hampshire]]. Kenyon was New Hampshire's [[poet laureate]] when she died on April 22, 1995 from [[leukemia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/27/obituaries/jane-kenyon-47-a-poet-laureate.html |title=Jane Kenyon, 47, A Poet Laureate |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 April 1995}}</ref>

==Career==
Four collections of Kenyon's poems were published during her lifetime: ''From Room to Room'' (1978), ''Constance'' (1993), ''The Boat of Quiet Hours'' (1986), and ''Let Evening Come'' (1990). She spent some years translating the poems of [[Anna Akhmatova]] from Russian into English (published as ''Twenty Poems of Anna Akhmatova,'' 1985), and she championed translation as an important art that every poet should try. When she died, she was working on editing ''Otherwise: New and Selected Poems''. In 2004, Ausable Press published ''Letters to Jane'', a compilation of letters written by the poet [[Hayden Carruth]] to Kenyon in the year between her diagnosis and her death.

Kenyon's poems are filled with rural images: light streaming through a hayloft, shorn winter fields. She wrote frequently about wrestling with depression, which plagued her throughout her adult life. Kenyon's poem "Having it out with Melancholy" describes this struggle and the brief moments of happiness she felt when taking an [[MAOI]], [[Nardil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15920 |title=Having it out with Melancholy |first=Jane |last=Kenyon |work=POETS.org |publisher=[[Academy of American Poets]] |accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref> The essays collected in ''A Hundred White Daffodils'' reveal the important role church came to play in her life once she and Hall moved to Eagle Pond Farm. However, two visits to [[India]] in the early 1990s led to a crisis of faith, as Hall (in introductions to her books and in his own memoirs), [[Alice Mattison]], and her biographer John Timmerman have described.

Her poem "Let Evening Come" was featured in the film ''[[In Her Shoes (2005 film)|In Her Shoes]]'', in a scene where the character played by [[Cameron Diaz]] reads the poem (as well as "One Art" by Elizabeth Bishop) to a blind nursing home resident. "Having it out with Melancholy" has been read by Amanda Palmer on [https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/27/having-it-out-with-melancholy-jane-kenyon-amanda-palmer/ Brain Pickings].

Kenyon was also a contributor to ''[[Columbia: A Journal of Literature and Art]]''.

Kenyon's papers, including manuscripts, personal journals, and notebooks are held at the University of New Hampshire Library Special Collections and Archives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/jane-kenyon-papers-1961-1995|title=Jane Kenyon Papers, 1961-1995 {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=www.library.unh.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>
