Middleton published a paper, describing his observations, in the [[Royal Society]]'s ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''.

On 5 March 1741, Middleton was appointed to the command of {{HMS|Furnace|1740|6}}, a Royal Navy [[bomb vessel]] which was refitted at [[Deptford Dockyard]] and rigged as a [[three-masted ship]]. In May, he left England on ''Furnace'', accompanied by a smaller vessel, the purchased {{HMS|Discovery|1741|6}}, under the command of [[William Moor]], and sailed to [[Hudson Bay]] in search of a [[Northwest Passage]].{{sfn|Barr|1983|p=98}}

He spent the winter at [[Prince of Wales Fort|Fort Churchill]], and then proceeded north, into [[Roes Welcome Sound]] and discovered [[Wager Inlet]] where he was iced in for three weeks. At the head of the sound he found himself blocked by ice, and named the place [[Repulse Bay, Nunavut|Repulse Bay]].

Middleton returned to England in 1742, where he was presented with the [[Royal Society's Copley Medal]], to whom he presented a paper entitled "The effects of cold; together with observations of the longitude, latitude, and declination of the magnetic needle, at Prince of Wales's fort, upon Churchill-River in Hudson's Bay, North America".{{sfn|Middleton|1743|pp=157–171}}

Middleton was given command of {{HMS|Shark|1732|6}}, in May&nbsp;1745, and commanded her until 1748, when peace was negotiated with Spain.{{sfn|Williams|1974|loc=§ 1}} Royal Navy officers were entitled to half-pay, when not employed, and Middleton spent the rest of his life on half-pay. He went back to the Hudson's Bay Company, and requested a command, there, without success.
