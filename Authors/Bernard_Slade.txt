==Early years==
Slade was born in [[St. Catharines, Ontario]] in May 1930, the son of Bessie Harriet (Walbourne) and Frederick Newbound.<ref name=bkr1/><ref name="p">{{cite news |last1=Hedley |first1=Tom |title=The Last Laugh of Bernard Slade |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34210144/bernard_slade/ |access-date=July 25, 2019 |work=The Province |date=July 26, 1975 |location=Canada, British Columbia, Vancouver |page=80|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref><ref name="Barnes">{{cite news|last=Barnes |first=Mike |title=Bernard Slade, 'Partridge Family' Creator and 'Same Time, Next Year' Writer, Dies at 89|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bernard-slade-dead-partridge-family-creator-was-89-1251174|date=October 30, 2019|access-date=October 30, 2019|publisher=[[HollywoodReporter.com]]}}</ref> Slade moved to England with his family at age five.

==Career==
Slade began his career as an actor in [[repertory theatre]] in England.<ref name=ws/> He also acted with the Garden Center Theatre in [[Vineland, Ontario]]. In the mid-1960s, he relocated to [[Hollywood]] and began to work at [[Screen Gems]] as a writer for [[television]] [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]], including ''[[Bewitched]]'' (including the 7th episode, "The Witches Are Out," which introduced Aunt Clara). When [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] gave him the opportunity to create a series, he devised ''[[Love on a Rooftop]]'', similar in theme to [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]'', about a young couple living in a windowless walk-up apartment with access to a rooftop with a view of [[San Francisco]].

The following year, Slade developed ''[[The Flying Nun]]'' (adapted from [[Tere Rios]]' book, ''The Fifteenth Pelican''), with [[Sally Field]] as a young novice whose habit's headgear enabled her to fly. After briefly leaving Screen Gems to work as a script supervisor on ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], he came back to Screen Gems to create ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', based on the real-life [[Cowsills]], and ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'', inspired by the play ''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]''. He also wrote the script to the 1972 [[Columbia Pictures]] film ''[[Stand Up and Be Counted]],'' directed by [[Jackie Cooper]] and starring [[Jacqueline Bisset]], in which the [[Helen Reddy]] song "[[I Am Woman]]" was first introduced. The last show he created for Screen Gems before it changed its name to [[Columbia Pictures Television]] was ''[[The Girl with Something Extra]]''.

Despite his success in television, Slade returned to the theater in 1975 with his play ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]'',<ref name=ibdb/> about a couple who are married to others but meet once-a-year for sex and conversation. With [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Ellen Burstyn]] in the leads, the play was a major hit and ran for 1,453 performances. Slade received the [[Drama Desk Award]] and a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Play. 

In 1978, he followed with ''[[Tribute (play)|Tribute]]'', the story of a man who learns to love his father, a successful actor who always had more time for his theatrical cohorts than his son. Even with [[Jack Lemmon]] heading the cast, it proved to be far less successful than its predecessor, closing after 212 performances. Slightly more successful was ''[[Romantic Comedy (play)|Romantic Comedy]]'' (1979),<ref name=ibdb/> starring [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Mia Farrow]]. Slade wrote the screenplays for the film versions of all three plays, and was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for his [[Same Time, Next Year (film)|screen adaptation]] of ''Same Time, Next Year''.<ref>"[https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Broadway-Playwright-Bernard-Slade-Passes-Away-at-89-20191030 Broadway Playwright Bernard Slade Passes Away at 89]".
