'''Christian Friedrich Hebbel''' (18 March 1813 – 13 December 1863) was a German poet and [[dramatist]].

==Biography==
Hebbel was born at [[Wesselburen]] in Dithmarschen, [[Holstein]], the son of a bricklayer. He was educated at the ''[[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums]]'', a grammar school in Hamburg, Germany. Despite his humble origins, he showed a talent for poetry,<ref name=EB1911/> resulting in the publication in the ''Hamburg Modezeitung'', of verses which he had sent to [[Amalie Schoppe]] (1791–1858), a popular journalist and author of nursery tales. Through her patronage, he was able to go to the [[University of Hamburg]].

A year later he went to [[Heidelberg University]] to study law, but gave it up and went on to the [[University of Munich]], where he devoted himself to philosophy, history and literature. In 1839, Hebbel left Munich and walked all the way back to Hamburg, where he resumed his friendship with Elise Lensing, whose self-sacrificing assistance had helped him over the darkest days in Munich. In the same year he wrote his first [[tragedy]], ''[[Judith (Hebbel)|Judith]]'' (1840, published 1841), which in the following year was performed in Hamburg and Berlin and made his name known throughout Germany.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1840, he wrote the tragedy ''Genoveva'', and the following year finished a comedy, ''Der Diamant'', which he had begun at Munich. In 1842 he visited [[Copenhagen]], where he obtained from [[Christian VIII of Denmark|King Christian VIII]] a small travelling studentship, which enabled him to spend some time in Paris and two years (1844–1846) in Italy. In Paris he wrote the "tragedy of common life", ''{{ill|Maria Magdalena (Hebbel)|de|lt=Maria Magdalena}}'' (1844). On his return from Italy, Hebbel met in Vienna two Polish noblemen, the brothers Zerboni di Sposetti, who in their enthusiasm for his genius urged him to remain, and supplied him with the means to mingle in the best intellectual society of the Austrian capital.<ref name=EB1911/>

Hebbel's old precarious existence now became a horror to him, and he made a deliberate breach with it by marrying (in 1846) the beautiful and wealthy actress [[Christine Enghaus]], giving up Elise Lensing (who remained faithful to him until her death), on the grounds that "a man's first duty is to the most powerful force within him, that which alone can give him happiness and be of service to the world": in his case the poetical faculty, which would have perished "in the miserable struggle for existence". This "deadly sin," which, "if peace of conscience be the test of action," was, he considered, the best act of his life, established his fortunes. Elise, however, still provided useful inspiration for his art. As late as 1851, shortly after her death, he wrote the little epic ''Mutter und Kind'', intended to show that the relation of parent and child is the essential factor which makes the quality of happiness among all classes and under all conditions equal.<ref name=EB1911/>

Long before this Hebbel had become famous, German sovereigns bestowed decorations upon him; in foreign capitals he was feted as the greatest of living German dramatists. From the grand-duke of Saxe-Weimar he received a flattering invitation to take up his residence at [[Weimar]], where several of his plays were first performed. He remained, however, at Vienna until his death.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Works==

Besides the works already mentioned, Hebbel's principal tragedies are:<ref name=EB1911/>
*''Herodes and Mariamne'' (1850)<ref name=EB1911/>
*''Julia'' (1851)<ref name=EB1911/>
*''Michel Angelo'' (1851)<ref name=EB1911/>
*''{{ill|Agnes Bernauer (Hebbel)|de|Agnes Bernauer (Hebbel)|lt=Agnes Bernauer}}'' (1855)<ref name=EB1911/>
*''Gyges and His Ring'' (1856)<ref name=EB1911/>
*''{{ill|Die Nibelungen (Hebbel)|de|Die Nibelungen (Hebbel)|lt=Die Nibelungen}}'' (1862), his last work (a trilogy consisting of a prologue, ''Der gehörnte Siegfried'', and the tragedies, ''Siegfrieds Tod'' and ''Kriemhilds Rache''), which won for the author the {{ill|Schiller Prize (Prussia)|de|Schiller-Preis (Preußen)|lt=Schiller Prize}}.<ref name=EB1911/>

Of his comedies ''Der Diamant'' (1847), ''Der Rubin'' (1850) and the tragi-comedy ''Ein Trauerspiel in Sizilien'' (1845), are the more important, but they are heavy and hardly rise above mediocrity. All his dramatic productions, however, exhibit skill in characterization, great glow of passion, and a true feeling for dramatic situation; but their poetic effect is frequently marred by extravagances which border on the grotesque, and by the introduction of incidents the unpleasant character of which is not sufficiently relieved. In many of his lyric poems, and especially in ''Mutter und Kind'', published in 1859, Hebbel showed that his poetic gifts were not restricted to the drama.<ref name=EB1911/>

Hebbel's short stories are often wry and witty observations of society. His well-known story "The master tailor Nepomuk Schlägel in the search for joy" has been published in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/bartholomewbegley/friedrich-hebbel-the-master-tailor-nepomuk-schl%C3%A4gel-in-the-search-for-joy|title=Bartholomew Begley – Friedrich Hebbel, The master tailor Nepomuk Schlägel in the search for joy|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=23 August 2021}}</ref>

His collected works were first published by E. Kuh in 12 volumes at Hamburg, 1866–1868.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Hebbel, Christian Friedrich|volume=13|pages=165–166|inline=1}}</ref>

==Music==
Some of Hebbel's works were set to music, such as his poem ''Requiem'' by [[Peter Cornelius]] and in [[Max Reger]]'s ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Hebbel Requiem]]''. Reger [[Die Weihe der Nacht|set his poem]] "Die Weihe der Nacht" for voice, choir and orchestra. [[Robert Schumann]]'s opera ''[[Genoveva]]'' is based on a play of Hebbel.

In 1872 [[Samuel de Lange]] used Hebbel's poem "Ein frühes Liebesleben" in an unusual instrumentation for voice, string quartet and harp. An arrangement with piano instead of harp was made during a centennial revival of Samuel and {{ill|Daniël de Lange|nl}}'s music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pythagoraskwartet.nl/samuel-de-lange-ein-fruhes-liebesleben/|title=Samuel de Lange, "Ein frühes Liebesleben"|website=pythagoraskwartet.nl|language=nl|access-date=24 March 2017}}</ref>

[[Eduard Lassen]] wrote incidental music to ''Die Nibelungen'' in 1873. In 1878/79 [[Franz Liszt]] combined music from the ''Die Nibelungen'' setting with excerpts from Lassen's incidental music to Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', in a single piano transcription, ''Aus der Musik zu Hebbels Nibelungen und Goethes Faust'' (S.496).

In 1922 [[Emil von Reznicek]] composed an opera ''Holofernes'' after Hebbel's ''Judith und Holofernes''.

[[Anna Teichmüller]] used Hebbel's text for her composition ''Schlafen, Schlafen, opus 24''.

The poem "Dem Schmerz sein Recht" was set to music by [[Alban Berg]] in 4 Gesänge, Op. 2, No 1.

==Films==
* ''Glutmensch'' (A man aglow, 1975), 90 minutes; writer and director: [[Jonatan Briel]]; production: [[Sender Freies Berlin|SFB]] and Literarisches Berliner Kolloquium; plot: Hebbel is confined to his sickbed on his 50th birthday, and recalls his youth in his feverish dreams.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0490422|Glutmensch}}</ref>
