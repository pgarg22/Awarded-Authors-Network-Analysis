Perry wrote and produced many stage plays during the 1990s and early 2000s. Perry has developed several television series, most notably ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'', which ran for eight seasons on [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] from June 21, 2006 to August 10, 2012. On October 2, 2012, Perry struck an exclusive multi-year partnership with [[Oprah Winfrey]] and her [[Oprah Winfrey Network]].

In contrast to his father, his mother took him to church each week, where he sensed a certain refuge and contentment.<ref name="JRankBio">{{cite web| year = 2010|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2872/Perry-Tyler.html| title= Tyler Perry Biography&nbsp;– Inspired by Oprah, Perseverance Paid Off, Concentrated on Madea Character| publisher= Net Industries| access-date =January 16, 2010}}</ref> At age 16, he had his first name legally changed from Emmitt to Tyler in an effort to distance himself from his father.<ref name="BiographyCom">{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/tyler-perry-361274| title=Tyler Perry Biography: Film Actor, Filmmaker, Screenwriter, Playwright (1969–)| publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (American TV channel)|FYI]]/[[A&E Networks]]) | access-date = December 15, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214402/http://www.biography.com/people/tyler-perry-361274 | archive-date= September 9, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Many years later, after seeing the film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', Perry was moved to reveal for the first time that he had been [[Child sexual abuse|molested]] by a friend's mother at age 10;<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/06/tyler.perry.abuse.precious/ "Tyler Perry recounts childhood abuse on Web site"].

While Perry did not complete high school, he earned a [[General Educational Development|GED]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Oprah Talks to Tyler Perry|url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Oprah-Interviews-Tyler-Perry_1/3}}</ref> In his early 20s, watching an episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', he heard someone describe the sometimes therapeutic effect the act of writing can have, enabling the author to work out his or her own problems. This comment inspired him to apply himself to a career in writing. He soon started writing a series of letters to himself, which became the basis for the musical ''[[I Know I've Been Changed]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speaker Bio: Tyler Perry|url=http://www.natpe.org/conference/speakers/bios/index.jsp?speaker_id_string=3734:PYjS-98ZaG7syvaDDO6NpA**|work=natpe.org/|access-date=May 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520200307/http://www.natpe.org/conference/speakers/bios/index.jsp?speaker_id_string=3734:PYjS-98ZaG7syvaDDO6NpA**|archive-date=May 20, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Career==
===Stage===
Around 1990, Perry moved to [[Atlanta]], where two years later ''I Know I've Been Changed'' was first performed at a community theater, financed by the 22-year-old Perry's $12,000 life savings.<ref name="Forbes05">{{cite news | first=Brett | last=Pulley | title=A Showbiz Whiz | date=September 15, 2005 |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/1003/075.html |work=Forbes | access-date =March 25, 2010 }}</ref> The play included Christian themes of forgiveness, dignity, and self-worth, while addressing issues such as child abuse and [[dysfunctional families]]. The musical initially received a "less than stellar" reception and was a financial failure.<ref name="USAToday08">{{cite news | first=Scott | last=Bowles | title=Tyler Perry holds on to his past | date=September 10, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-09-09-tyler-perry_N.htm |work=USA Today | access-date =March 25, 2010 }}</ref> Perry persisted, and over the next six years he rewrote the musical repeatedly, though lackluster reviews continued. In 1998, at age 28, he succeeded in retooling the play and restaging it in Atlanta, first at the [[House of Blues]], then at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]]. Perry continued to create new stage productions, touring with them on the so-called "[[Chitlin' Circuit]]" (now also known as the "urban theater circuit")<ref name="BiographyCom" /> and developing a large, devoted following among African-American audiences. In 2005, ''Forbes'' reported that he had sold "more than $100&nbsp;million in tickets, $30&nbsp;million in videos of his shows and an estimated $20&nbsp;million in merchandise", and "the 300 live shows he produces each year are attended by an average of 35,000 people a week".<ref name="Forbes05" />

==Legal actions==
===The Writers Guild of America, West===
The [[Writers Guild of America, West]] filed unfair labor practice charges with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), alleging that Perry's production company, Tyler Perry Studios, unlawfully fired four writers in October 2008 in retaliation for them trying to get a union contract.<ref name="WGAWstrike">{{cite web|title=Writers at Tyler Perry Studio to Take Strike Action&nbsp;– Will Picket Grand Opening and Ask Invited Guests Not To Attend |first=Gregg |last=Mitchell |year=2008 |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2970 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010045936/http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2970 |archive-date=October 10, 2008 }}</ref> The dispute was settled a month later, when Tyler Perry Studios agreed to be a WGA signatory.<ref name="settlement">{{cite web|title=TOLDJA!

===Mo' Money Taxes===
In early 2009, Perry threatened legal action against Mo' Money Taxes, a tax preparation company based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for running a [[Television advertisement|TV spot]] that he felt offensively [[parody|parodied]] his work, in particular ''Madea Goes to Jail''.

==Reception==
===Criticisms===
Despite praising Perry in 2006, director [[Spike Lee]] criticized his work in 2009, stating "Each artist should be allowed to pursue their artistic endeavors but I still think there is a lot of stuff out today that is 'coonery buffoonery'."<ref name="Our World">{{cite video|title=Our World with Black Enterprise |date=May 31, 2009 |url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/tv-video/our-world/full-episode-our-world-with-black-enterprise-tv-video/2009/05/30/our-world-episode-73/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106194319/http://www.blackenterprise.com/tv-video/our-world/full-episode-our-world-with-black-enterprise-tv-video/2009/05/30/our-world-episode-73 |archive-date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref> When asked if Perry's success among black audiences was a result of just giving black America what they wanted, Lee responded, "the imaging is troubling."

In an open letter to Perry on [[National Public Radio]], journalist [[Jamilah Lemieux]], while thanking Perry for "giving black folks jobs in front of and behind the camera," also criticized his shows ''[[Meet the Browns (TV series)|Meet the Browns]]'' and ''[[House of Payne]]''. In her letter, she stated that "both your shows are marked by old stereotypes of buffoonish, emasculated black men and crass, sassy black women." While she noted his work for its humor and "positive messages of self-worth, love and respect," she later expressed frustration that African-Americans "have been fed the same images of ourselves over and over and over because they sell." Lemieux dismissed his famous Madea character, claiming that "Through her, the country has laughed at one of the most important members of the black community: Mother Dear, the beloved matriarch. ... Our mothers and grandmothers deserve much more than that." While she expressed appreciation toward Perry for dismissing critics' negative comments, Lemieux claimed that "many black folks have expressed some of the very same attitudes about your work that white critics have," and urged him to "stop dismissing the critics as haters and realize that black people need new stories and new storytellers."<ref>{{cite news|title=An Open Letter to Tyler Perry|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112760404|date=September 11, 2009|access-date=March 29, 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio}}</ref>

On January 6, 2020, Perry posted a video on [[Instagram]] in which he revealed that he doesn't use a writers room for his films and TV shows and prefers to write his work himself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/tyler-perry-writes-all-of-his-own-shows-1202822941/|title=Tyler Perry Says He Writes All Of His Shows: "I Have No Writers Room"|last1=Bennett|first1=Anita|date=January 7, 2020|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref> Perry received criticism from several outlets and figures in entertainment for denying opportunities to up-and-coming black writers. Later that month, Perry responded in an interview by stating that he had experienced issues when working with both WGA writers and nonunion writers. He claims that the WGA writers would submit "scripts that would need rewrites in order to get paid multiple times." He also said that nonunion writers struggled to meet his standards of quality and that he "was unhappy with every single script they wrote" because "they were not speaking to the voice."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2020/01/tyler-perry-addresses-writers-room-controversy|title=Tyler Perry on Why He Doesn't Have a Writers' Room: 'My Audience Wants My Voice'|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

====Response====
In October 2009, during a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, Perry was read a quote of [[Spike Lee]]'s comments about his work and responded, "I would love to read that [criticism] to my fan base. ... That pisses me off. It is so insulting. It's attitudes like that that make Hollywood think that these people do not exist, and that is why there is no material speaking to them, speaking to us." Perry also stated that "all these characters are bait&nbsp;– disarming, charming, make-you-laugh bait. I can slap Madea on something and talk about God, love, faith, forgiveness, family, any of those."<ref>{{cite news|title=60 Minutes: Tyler Perry's Amazing Journey to the Top|date=October 25, 2009|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/22/60minutes/main5410095.shtml |publisher=CBS News}}</ref> In an interview with Hip Hollywood, Perry responded to Spike Lee's comments by telling him to "go to hell."<ref>{{cite news|title=Tyler Perry Tells Spike Lee to "Go To Hell!"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOnY6cx-nBI|date=April 20, 2011|access-date=March 29, 2013|newspaper=Hip Hollywood}}</ref>

===Acclaim===
Perry's work has been praised by [[Oprah Winfrey]], who joined Perry in promoting [[Lee Daniels]]' film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' (2009). She told an interviewer, "I think [Perry] grew up being raised by strong, black women. And so much of what he does is really in celebration of that. I think that's what Madea really is: a compilation of all those strong black women that I know and maybe you do too? And so the reason it works is because people see themselves."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/10/26/2009-10-26_tyler_perry_responds_to_spike_lees_claim_that_his_work_is_comparable_to_amos_n_a.html#ixzz0j7BuSSil| title=Tyler Perry responds to Spike Lee's claim that his work is comparable to 'Amos 'n' Andy'|author=Issie Lapowsky |work=Daily News|date=October 26, 2009 | location=New York}}</ref>

[[Goldie Taylor]], of [[The Grio]] and [[MSNBC]], stated in an April 21, 2011 [[National Public Radio|NPR]] ''[[All Things Considered]]'' interview regarding Perry's target audience: "I don't think Tyler Perry is talking to [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]].

===Parodies and satire===
In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "[[American Dad!

Perry was satirized by ''[[South Park]]'' in the Season Fifteen episode "[[Funnybot]]". He was given an award for "Comedian Most likely to turn up to collect their comedy award" and the black characters in the episode, [[Token (South Park character)|Token Black]] and [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], express their own disbelief that they can't stop watching his comedy and giving him money. At the end of the episode Perry, as Madea, is buried and encased in steel with Obama's declaring, "I am pleased to announce that the greatest threat to mankind has now gone forever. Justice has been done."<ref>{{cite news | first = Kate | last = Ward | title = New 'South Park' references death of Osama bin Laden | date = May 4, 2011 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/05/04/south-park-bin-laden/ |work=Entertainment Weekly | access-date =May 5, 2011}}</ref>

Tyler Perry as Madea was parodied in ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' episode "[[Pause (The Boondocks)|Pause]]", in which a thinly disguised version of Perry named Winston Jerome played a similar character to Madea dubbed "Ma Dukes."
