'''İsmet Özel''' (born 19 September 1944, in [[Kayseri]]) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[poet]] and writer.

==Early years==
Özel is a son of a police officer from [[Söke]].  He attended primary and secondary school in [[Kastamonu]], [[Çankırı]] and [[Ankara]].  He attended classes at [[Political Science]] Faculty of [[Ankara University]], and graduated from the [[French Language]] department of [[Hacettepe University]].

==Career==
Özel published ''Halkın Dostları'' magazine with [[Ataol Behramoğlu]].  Özel's songs of [[liberty|freedom]] derived its content from [[socialism]] but their [[structure]] and [[symbol]]ism reflected the tastes of the [[Second New]] generation movement in [[Poetry of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish poetry]]. In the 1970s, Özel developed a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Islamist]] view which shocked his [[leftist]] audience.

He worked as a French [[lecturer]] in the State [[College or university school of music|Conservatory]]. He spent all his time writing after he retired. Because of both his interesting character and works, he took an impressive place among his contemporaries.

Özel, who published his early poems in 1963, became salient with densely using images and his meticulous effort to choose words. He collected his early poems in the book called ''Geceleyin Bir Koşu'' (''A Run in the Night'', 1966), in which he searches the [[truth]] of being [[human]]. His attributions about gathering the innovations and [[experimental literature|experimental]] sides of Turkish Poetry with [[social realism]] and his success to realize it caused to his second book called ''Evet İsyan'' (''Yes, [[Rebellion|Rebel]]'', 1969) made big echoes.

In 1970, he published Halkın Dostları review with [[Ataol Behramoğlu]]. In fact, Ataol Behramoğlu purified his poetry by leaving out crude propaganda and naive [[didacticism]]. İsmet Özel, perhaps the most talented of the group, turned to Islam for inspiration, but preserved the revolutionary bravura of his Marxist days. In following years, İsmet Özel experienced great changes in his political and philosophical approaches, and dedicated himself to the [[Islamic thought]].

When asked by his friend [[Murat Belge]], a noted socialist [[intellectual]], the reason for his conversion, Özel replied, "a man looks either after his freedom or his security, but he cannot acquire one without the other. All my life has been a search for [[ontology|ontological]] security. I am convinced that I found this security in the [[Qur'an]]. Islam is a healing for me. Those who either have no wounds or are not aware of their wounds will have no need for this healing." However, Özel is convinced that mankind is sick. In ''Three Problems: Technology, Civilization and Alienation'' and in ''To Speak in Difficult Times'' and also ''It Is Prohibited to Eat the Stones'', Özel argues that mankind is from an acute [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] which is a result of destructive [[technology]], artificial division of man and nature, and the enlightened principles of Islam which emphasize the synthesis of the sacred and the profane is the only medicine available for this disease. ''Three Problems'' is one of the most influential books of recent times in Turkey.

Another following twenty years, he claimed that he broke the ties with the Islamic Media. His third work called ''Cinayetler Kitabı'' (''The Book of Murders'', 1975) was a perfect example of his quality in writing poems which it emphasizes the dedication to his early works.

In addition to putting his understanding of poetry, the book called ''Şiir Okuma Kılavuzu'' (''The Handbook of Reading a Poem'', 1980) also points an still being a research field: the contemporary position of Turkish Poetry.

In the book called ''Celladıma Gülümserken'' (''When I Smile at My Executioner'', 1984), the main borders of İsmet Özel's poetic world clarified, he collected all his poems in the book ''Erbain / Kırk Yılın Şiirleri'' (''Erbain - The Poems of 40 Years'', 1987).

Except newspaper works, starting from 1960, he published his poems and works in ''Devinim 60'', ''Papirüs'', ''Yeni Dergi'', ''Şiir Sanatı'', ''Halkın Dostları'' (1964–71), ''Diriliş'', ''Mavera'', ''Gösteri'', etc.

The most notable of these is undoubtedly the column he had in newspapers of ''Yeni Devir'' (1977–79 and 1981–82), beginning from 1981-82 / 1985 partially in the ''Millî Gazete'', moreover also in the ''[[Yeni Şafak]]'' newspaper.

Both in these works and his first essay book called ''Üç Mesele'' (''In Three Problems: Technology, Civilization and Alienation'') (1978), he defended that [[Muslim]]s had to be dependent to the Islamic sources itself. He claimed that this is the most realistic and rightful effort in the conditions that is far and away from Islamic Sources.

He won the Writers' Union Turkey's Essay Award (1985) and [[Chile]]an poet [[Gabriela Mistral]] Award (1995) with his book ''Taşları Yemek Yasak'' (''It Is Prohibited to Eat the Stones'').

He told his views about intellectual agenda in the television program ''İsmet Özel'le Başbaşa'' (''Alone with İsmet Özel'') which was hosted by İsmail Kara on [[Kanal 7|Channel 7]].

Özel has aimed at a new awareness of social responsibilities. In the 1970s, he adopted a [[mystical]] view of life without losing the strength of expression and inventiveness which he had evolved during his socialist period.

He has drawn upon his knowledge of [[Western philosophy]], [[Marxist]] [[sociology]], and [[Radicalization|radical]] [[Islamist]] [[political theory]] to advocate a modern Islamic perspective that does not hesitate to criticize genuine societal ills while simultaneously remaining faithful to the ethical values and spiritual dimensions of [[religion]].

Özel, a [[Marxist]] convert to [[Islam]]: "I did not consider myself a part of the [[society]] I was in—but as a candidate for the courageous and uncompromising defense of the cause of the just."

İsmet Özel, an ex-Marxist convert and the most prominent [[Islamist]] intellectual, argued that it was [[Atatürk]]'s [[Atatürk's Reforms|reforms]] that, ironically Islamicized Turkey by forcing people to internalize and value their religious identity and not simply take it for granted as in the past.

According to him, "[[Muslim]] is a [[terrorist]]. The first duty of the Muslim is to be a terrorist. [[Infidel#Islam|Infidel]]s will be [[fear|afraid]] of Muslims. When they are not afraid, a Muslim is not a Muslim."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7P1aAtqF3E İsmet Özel "Müslümanlar Teröristtir" (in Turkish)]: "''Müslüman teröristtir. Müslüman'ın ilk vazifesi terörist olmaktır. Kâfirler Müslümanlardan korkacaktır. Korkmadıkları zaman Müslüman, Müslüman değildir.''"</ref> He stated that "I accept that by being a Muslim, the entire [[Kafir|non-Muslim]] world is [[Supremacism#Islamic|lower than me]]. So I am a Muslim and everyone who is not a Muslim is a lower person than me. As with all other religions, they can only be tolerated as a human, if not Muslim."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlRCbkpZoo4 "Müslüman olmayan herkes benden daha düşük bir insandır." İsmet Özel (in Turkish)]: "''Ben Müslüman olmakla bütün gayrimüslim dünyanın benim altımda olduğunu kabul ediyorum. Yani ben bir Müslüman'ım ve Müslüman olmayan herkes benden daha düşük bir insandır. Bütün diğer dinler olduğu gibi insan olarak da, yani Müslüman değilse sadece hoşgörülebilir.''"</ref>

He wrote a poem titled, ''Of not being a [[Jew]]'', in which he lamented the fact that he felt like a pursued [[Jew]], but had no second country to go to. "Your load is heavy / He's very heavy / Just because he's your brother / Your brothers are your [[pogroms]] / When you reach the doorsteps of your friends / Starts your [[Diaspora]]," he wrote.

"As a [[political system]] in Turkey, [[socialism]] is possible, [[Pan-Turkism|Turkism]] is probable, [[Islam]] is certain", however in a recent article he defended the isolation of Muslims from the society unless they adapt to the secular democracy, and emphasized Islam as a political system in Turkey is dead.<ref>http://www.dipnot.tv/10254/ikna-odalarina-giren-ogrenciler-cok-kizacak-ismet-ozel-ikna-odalari-tutarli-bir-isti.aspx</ref>
