'''Guy Gavriel Kay''' (born November 7, 1954) is a Canadian writer of [[fantasy]] fiction. The majority of his novels take place in [[Fictional universe|fictional setting]]s that resemble real places during real historical periods, such as [[Constantinople]] during the reign of [[Justinian I]] or Spain during the time of [[El Cid]]. Kay has expressed a preference to avoid genre categorization of these works as [[historical fantasy]]. {{As of|2019}}, Kay has published 14 novels and a book of poetry. {{As of|2018}}, his fiction has been translated into at least 22 languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=au:Guy Gavriel Kay |url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AGuy+Gavriel+Kay&fq=x0%3Abook+%3E+mt%3Afic&dblist=638&fc=ln:_25&qt=show_more_ln%3A&cookie |publisher=WorldCat |access-date=November 11, 2021}}</ref>

==Biography==

Kay was born in [[Weyburn]], Saskatchewan, in 1954.<ref name="biog"/> He was raised and educated in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, and received a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1975. He obtained an [[LLB]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1978.<ref name="biog"/>

When [[Christopher Tolkien]] needed an assistant to edit his father [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s unpublished work, he chose Kay, then a student of philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]]. Kay moved to [[Oxford]] in 1974 to assist Christopher in editing ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/29/guy-gavriel-kay-jrr-tolkien-interview-fionovar-tapesty-the-summer-tree |title=Guy Gavriel Kay: 'I learned a lot about false starts from JRR Tolkien' |last=Flood |first=Alison |website=The Guardian |date=October 29, 2014 |access-date=April 1, 2017}}</ref>

He returned to Canada in 1975 to pursue a law degree at the [[University of Toronto]]. He was called to the bar of Ontario in 1981 and practiced law for a year.<ref name="biog"/> Kay became principal writer and an associate producer for a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio series, ''The Scales of Justice,'' and continued as principal writer when the series transferred to television.<ref name="biog"/>

In 1984, Kay's first fantasy work, ''[[The Summer Tree]]'', the first volume of ''[[The Fionavar Tapestry]]'' trilogy, was published.<ref name="biog"/>

Kay has stated concerns about the decline of individual privacy, the expectation of privacy, and also literary privacy. The latter primarily concerns the use of real individuals in works of fiction, such as [[Michael Cunningham]] basing ''[[The Hours (novel) |The Hours]]'' on [[Virginia Woolf]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/privacy-between-the-covers/article25575216/ |title=Privacy between the covers |last=Levin |first=Martin |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=December 2, 2000 |access-date=October 28, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://quillandquire.com/book-news/2007/12/18/the-internet-and-other-modern-horrors/ |title=The Internet, and other modern horrors |last=Woods |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Quill & Quire]] |date=December 18, 2007 |access-date=October 28, 2021}}</ref>
