*A year after his death, Mr. Sastrowardoyo was quoted in an essay by [[Barbara Crossette]] for the Week in Review section of ''The New York Times'':<ref name="NYT1996">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/weekinreview/introspection-and-repression-why-indonesia-isn-t-talking.html?scp=1&sq=Subagio%20Sastrowardoyo&st=cse |title=Introspection and Repression;Why Indonesia Isn't Talking

<blockquote> A few years ago, [John] McGlynn's foundation collected Indonesians' impressions of the United States, many of them unsettling, in a book called ''On Foreign Shores.'' One of the poets, [[Ajip Rosidi]], reacted to New York in a poem titled "Manhattan Sonnet."

"Is it within these strong and rigid walls /
one's sense of safety nestles? /
All I find here is vigilance, the source of apprehension."

His compatriot Subagio Sastrowardoyo wrote about a city "where life is cheap." New York's greed, he said, "has made this place too confined for prayer or a human voice."<ref name="NYT1996"/></blockquote>
