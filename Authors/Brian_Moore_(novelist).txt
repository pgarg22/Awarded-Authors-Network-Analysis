Moore also wrote [[screenplay]]s and several of his books were made into films.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born and grew up in [[Belfast]] with eight siblings<ref name="Lee"/> in a large [[Roman Catholic]] family. His grandfather, a severe, authoritarian solicitor, had been a Catholic convert.<ref name="Lee"/> His father, James Bernard Moore, was a prominent surgeon and the first Catholic to sit on the senate of [[Queen's University, Belfast|Queen's University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=565|title=Brian Moore|publisher=[[Culture Northern Ireland]]|date=25 November 2008|access-date=24 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207222311/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=565|archive-date=7 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and his mother, Eileen McFadden Moore, a farmer's daughter from [[County Donegal]],<ref name="Lee"/> was a nurse.<ref name=Flood>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/brianmoore0000floo|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/brianmoore0000floo/page/n99 11]|title=Brian Moore|author= Flood, Jeanne| publisher= [[Bucknell University Press]]|location=[[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]]|year= 1974|access-date= 21 August 2012|isbn=9780838779729}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news| author=Smith, Dinitia| author-link=Dinitia Smith|title=Brian Moore, Prolific Novelist on Diverse Themes, Dies at 77|url= http://partners.nytimes.com/library/books/011299obit-moore.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 January 1999|access-date = 19 January 2018}}</ref> His uncle was the prominent [[Irish nationalist]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], founder of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] (the Gaelic League) and Professor of Irish at [[University College Dublin]].<ref name="Going Home"/>

Moore was educated at [[St Malachy's College]], Belfast.<ref name="Lee"/><ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13112311 |title=Why do some schools produce clusters of celebrities? |last1=Spencer |first1=Clare |date=6 May 2011 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=24 August 2012 |archive-date=17 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717063515/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13112311 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He left the college in 1939, having failed his senior exams. The physical description of the school at the heart of ''[[The Feast of Lupercal]]'' matches closely that of Moore's [[alma mater]] and is widely held to be a lightly fictionalised setting of the college as he unfondly remembered it.

==Wartime service and move to North America==
Moore was a volunteer [[Air Raid Warden|air raid warden]] during the Second World War and served during the [[Belfast Blitz]] in April and May 1941. He went on to serve as a civilian with the [[British Army]] in North Africa, Italy and France. After the war ended he worked in Eastern Europe for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].

in 1948 he emigrated to Canada to worked as a reporter for the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', and became a [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizen. While eventually making his primary residence in California, Moore continued to live part of each year in Canada up to his death.<ref name=NYT/>

Moore lived in Canada from 1948 to 1958,<ref name= Canadian/> moving to New York in 1959 to take up a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]<ref name="Lee"/> and remaining there until his divorce in 1967.<ref name="Lee"/> He then moved to the west coast of the United States, settling in [[Malibu, California]], with his new wife Jean.<ref name="Lee"/> He taught [[creative writing]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].<ref name= "Blades">{{cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/20572-pw-brian-moore-travels-of-a-literary-infidel.html|title=Brian Moore: Travels of a Literary Infidel |work=[[Publishers Weekly]]| author= Blades, John|date= 5 January 1998| access-date= 19 January 2018}}</ref>

==Novels and themes==
Moore wrote his first novels in Canada.<ref name= Canadian>{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/brian-moore/ | title= Brian Moore | encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | last=Lynch | first=Gerald | date=16 December 2013 | access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> His [[Brian Moore's early fiction|earliest books]] were [[thrillers]], published under his own name or using the pseudonyms Bernard Mara or Michael Bryan.<ref name="Sampson">{{cite book | title=Brian Moore: The Chameleon Novelist | url=https://archive.org/details/brianmoorechamel0000samp | url-access=registration | publisher=[[Doubleday Canada]] | author=Sampson, Denis | author-link = Denis Sampson|year=1998 | location=Toronto}}</ref> The first two of these pieces of pulp fiction, all of which he later disowned,<ref name=" Melgaard">{{Cite news |last= Melgaard |first=Michael |date=1 September 2017 |title=Uncovering Canada's 'forgotten, neglected and suppressed' books, from pulp fiction to gothic horror |url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/uncovering-canadas-forgotten-neglected-and-suppressed-books-from-pulp-fiction-to-gothic-horror|work=[[National Post]] |access-date=9 August 2020}}</ref> were published in Canada by [[Harlequin Enterprises|Harlequin]]  – ''Wreath for a Redhead'' in March 1951 and ''The Executioners'' in July 1951.

''[[Judith Hearne]]'', which Moore regarded as his first novel and was the first he produced outside the thriller genre, remains among his most highly regarded. The book was rejected by ten American publishers before being accepted by a British publisher.<ref name=NYT/> It was made into a [[The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne|film]], with British actress [[Maggie Smith]] playing the lonely [[spinster]] who is the book/film's title character.<ref name=NYT/>

Other novels by Moore were adapted for the screen, including ''[[Intent to Kill]]'', ''[[The Luck of Ginger Coffey (novel)|The Luck of Ginger Coffey]]'', ''[[Catholics (novel)|Catholics]]'', ''[[Black Robe (film)|Black Robe]]'', ''[[Cold Heaven (film)|Cold Heaven]]'', and ''[[The Statement (film)|The Statement]]''. He co-wrote the screenplay for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Torn Curtain]]'', and wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Blood of Others (film)|The Blood of Others]]'', based on the novel ''[[The Blood of Others|Le Sang des autres]]'' by [[Simone de Beauvoir]].

Moore criticised his Belfast schooling through his novels ''[[The Feast of Lupercal]]'' and ''[[The Emperor of Ice-Cream (novel)|The Emperor of Ice-Cream]]''.<ref name="Get Writing NI">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/getwritingni/wh_moore2.shtml | title=Local Writing legends&nbsp;– Brian Moore: Growing Up | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=Get Writing NI | access-date=8 November 2012}}</ref>

Some of his novels feature staunchly anti-doctrinaire and [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] themes, and in particular, he spoke strongly about the effect of the Church on life in Ireland. A recurring theme in his novels is the concept of the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priesthood]]. On several occasions, he explores the idea of a priest losing his faith. At the same time, several of his novels are deeply sympathetic and affirming portrayals of the struggles of faith and religious commitment, ''[[Black Robe]]'' most prominently.

[[Graham Greene]] said that Moore was his favourite living novelist,<ref name="Prose">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/10/specials/moore-silence.html | title=The Reluctant Terrorist | work=[[The New York Times]] | date= 2 September 1990 | access-date=29 October 2012 | author=Prose, Francine | author-link=Francine Prose }}</ref> though Moore began to regard the label as "a bit of an albatross".<ref name="Boland">{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/praise-for-moore-s-lasting-impact-on-irish-fiction-1.145338 |title=Praise for Moore's lasting impact on Irish fiction |last=Boland |first=Rosita |work= [[The Irish Times]]|date=13 January 1999 |access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Moore was married twice.

==Death==
Brian Moore died at his Malibu home on 11 January 1999, aged 77, from [[pulmonary fibrosis]].<ref name=NYT/> He had been working on a novel about the 19th-century French symbolist poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]].<ref>{{cite news|author= Fulford, Robert|author-link= Robert Fulford (journalist)| title=A writer who never failed to surprise his readers|url=http://www.robertfulford.com/BrianMoore.html|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=12 January 1999| access-date= 28 August 2012}}</ref> His last published work before his death was an essay entitled "Going Home".<ref name="Going Home">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/07/bookend/bookend.html | title=Going Home | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=7 February 1999 | access-date=3 January 2014 | author=Moore, Brian}}</ref> It was a reflection inspired by a visit he made to the grave in [[Connemara]] of his family friend, the Irish nationalist [[Bulmer Hobson]]. The essay was commissioned by ''[[Granta]]'' and published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 7 February 1999.<ref name="Going Home"/> Despite Moore's often conflicted attitude to Ireland and his Irishness, his concluding reflection in the piece was "The past is buried until, in Connemara, the sight of Bulmer Hobson's grave brings back those faces, those scenes, those sounds and smells which now live only in my memory. And in that moment I know that when I die I would like to come home at last to be buried here in this quiet place among the grazing cows."<ref name="Going Home"/>
