After living for a period in the nearby town of [[Portchester]], Hampshire, where Neil was born in 1960, the Gaimans moved in 1965 to the [[West Sussex]] town of [[East Grinstead]], where his parents studied [[Dianetics]] at the [[Saint Hill Manor|Scientology centre]] in the town; one of Gaiman's sisters works for the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles. His other sister, Lizzy Calcioli, has said, "Most of our social activities were involved with Scientology or our Jewish family. It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid. I'd say, 'I'm a Jewish Scientologist.{{' "}} Gaiman says that he is not a Scientologist, and that like Judaism, Scientology is his family's religion.<ref name=Goodyear>{{Cite magazine |url= https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/25/100125fa_fact_goodyear|title= Kid Goth Neil Gaiman's fantasies|magazine= The New Yorker|first= Dana|last= Goodyear|date= 25 January 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130427005709/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/25/100125fa_fact_goodyear|archive-date= 27 April 2013|url-status= live}}</ref> About his personal views, Gaiman has stated, "I think we can say that God exists in the DC Universe. I would not stand up and beat the drum for the existence of God in this universe. I don't know, I think there's probably a 50/50 chance. It doesn't really matter to me."<ref>{{cite journal|last = Whitaker|first = Steve|author-link = Steve Whitaker|title = Neil Gaiman interview|journal = [[Fantasy Advertiser|FA]]|issue = 109|pages = 24–29|date = January 1989}}</ref>

Gaiman was able to read at the age of four. He said, "I was a reader. I loved reading. Reading things gave me pleasure. I was very good at most subjects in school, not because I had any particular aptitude in them, but because normally on the first day of school they'd hand out schoolbooks, and I'd read them—which would mean that I'd know what was coming up, because I'd read it."<ref>{{cite book|last= Abbey|first= Cherie D.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' from his school library. Although the library only had the first two of the novel's three volumes, Gaiman consistently checked them out and read them. He later won the school English prize and the school reading prize, enabling him to finally acquire the third volume.<ref name="Abbey"/>

For his seventh birthday, Gaiman received [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series. He later recalled that "I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader, where he would just talk to you ... I'd think, 'Oh, my gosh, that is so cool! I want to do that! When I become an author, I want to be able to do things in parentheses.' I liked the power of putting things in brackets."<ref name="Abbey"/> ''Narnia'' also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the 1956 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] won by the concluding volume. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, the press reported him recalling, "it had to be the most important literary award there ever was"<ref name=bbc/> and observing, "if you can make yourself aged seven happy, you're really doing well – it's like writing a letter to yourself aged seven."<ref name=flood/>
[[File:Ardingly College, Sussex.jpg|thumb|right|Gaiman attended [[Ardingly College]] in [[Ardingly]], West Sussex]]
[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' was another childhood favourite, and "a favourite forever. Alice was default reading to the point where I knew it by heart."<ref name="Abbey"/> He also enjoyed [[Batman]] comics as a child.<ref name="Abbey"/>

Gaiman was educated at several [[Church of England]] schools, including Fonthill School in East Grinstead,<ref name="egnet" /> [[Ardingly College]] (1970–1974), and [[Whitgift School]] in [[Croydon]] (1974–1977).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exclusivebooks.com/features/authors/ngaiman.php|title=Neil Gaiman|publisher=Exclusive Books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103401/http://www.exclusivebooks.com/features/authors/ngaiman.php|archive-date=4 December 2008|access-date=2 February 2012}}</ref> His father's position as a public relations official of the [[Church of Scientology]] was the cause of the seven-year-old Gaiman being forced to withdraw from Fonthill School and remain at the school that he had previously been attending.<ref name=Goodyear /><ref>{{cite news|title=Head Bars Son of Cult Man|work=The Times|date=13 August 1968|page=2|url=http://cosmedia.freewinds.be/media/articles/tim130868.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029211637/http://cosmedia.freewinds.be/media/articles/tim130868.html|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead|quote=A headmaster has refused the son of a scientologist entry to a preparatory school until, he says, the cult "clears its name".

Gaiman has said [[Roger Zelazny]] was the author who influenced him the most,<ref name=Zelazny>"Of Meetings and Partings" by Neil Gaiman, introduction to ''This Mortal Mountain: Volume 3 of The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny'', NESFA Press, edited by David G.

In the early 1980s, Gaiman pursued journalism, conducting interviews and writing book reviews, as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published.<ref name="Abbey"/> He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society.<ref name="NGB">{{cite web|url= http://www.neilgaimanbibliography.com/bookreviews.html|title= Works by Gaiman – Book Reviews|date= n.d.|work= NeilGaimanBibliography.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131017032546/http://neilgaimanbibliography.com/bookreviews.html|archive-date= 17 October 2013|url-status= dead|access-date= 26 October 2013}}</ref> His first professional short story publication was "Featherquest", a fantasy story, in ''[[Imagine (AD&D magazine)|Imagine Magazine]]'' in May 1984.<ref name="NGB" />

When waiting for a train at London's [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] in 1984, Gaiman noticed a copy of ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' written by [[Alan Moore]], and carefully read it. Moore's fresh and vigorous approach to comics had such an impact on Gaiman that he later wrote "that was the final straw, what was left of my resistance crumbled. I proceeded to make regular and frequent visits to London's [[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] shop to buy comics".<ref name=MOR/>

In 1984, he wrote his first book, a biography of the band [[Duran Duran]], as well as ''[[Ghastly Beyond Belief]]'', a book of quotations, with [[Kim Newman]].<ref name="Abbey"/> Even though Gaiman thought he had done a terrible job, the book's first edition sold out very quickly.

In the mid-1990s, he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by [[Tekno Comix]].

Although Gaiman's name appeared prominently as creator of the characters, he was not involved in writing any of the above-mentioned books.

Gaiman wrote a semi-autobiographical story about a boy's fascination with [[Michael Moorcock]]'s anti-hero [[Elric of Melniboné]] for [[Ed Kramer]]'s anthology ''Tales of the White Wolf.'' In 1996, Gaiman and [[Ed Kramer]] co-edited ''[[The Sandman: Book of Dreams]]''. Nominated for the [[British Fantasy Award]], the original fiction anthology featured stories and contributions by [[Tori Amos]], [[Clive Barker]], [[Gene Wolfe]], [[Tad Williams]], and others.

Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling, Gaiman said: {{Blockquote
|text="One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was, in many ways, untouched ground. It was virgin territory. When I was working on ''Sandman'', I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle. I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before. When I'm writing novels I'm painfully aware that I'm working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw-droppingly brilliant things for, you know, three-four thousand years now. You know, you can go back. We have things like ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. And you go, well, I don't know that I'm as good as that and that's two and a half thousand years old. But with comics I felt like – I can do stuff nobody has ever done. I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of.

In a collaboration with author [[Terry Pratchett]], best known for his series of ''[[Discworld]]'' novels, Gaiman's first novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' was published in 1990. In 2011 Pratchett said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them, Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman's scheduled involvement with ''Sandman''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|first= Terry|last= Pratchett|title= Words from the Master|work= Lspace.org|date= n.d.|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130929041235/http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|archive-date= 29 September 2013|url-status= live|access-date=26 July 2011}}</ref>

The 1996 [[Neverwhere (novel)|novelisation]] of Gaiman's teleplay for the BBC mini-series ''[[Neverwhere]]'' was his first solo novel. The novel was released in tandem with the television series though it presents some notable differences from the television series. Gaiman has since revised the novel twice, the first time for an American audience unfamiliar with the [[London Underground]], the second time because he felt unsatisfied with the originals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2015/08/author-s-preferred-text-of-neil-gaiman-s-neverwhere-what-do-those-words-mean.html |title=What Does It Mean When a Book Is Stamped With the Words "Author's Preferred Text?" |last=Martinelli |first=Marissa |date=20 August 2015 |website=Slate |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref>

Gaiman has not written a direct sequel to ''American Gods'' but he has revisited the characters. A glimpse at Shadow's travels in Europe is found in a short story which finds him in Scotland, applying the same concepts developed in ''American Gods'' to the story of ''[[Beowulf]]''. The 2005 novel ''[[Anansi Boys]]'' deals with [[Anansi]] ('Mr. Nancy'), tracing the relationship of his two sons, one semi-divine and the other an unassuming Englishman, as they explore their common heritage. It debuted at number one on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref name="NYT 2005-10-09">{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/books/bestseller/1009besthardfiction.html|title= Best-Seller Lists: Hardcover Fiction|date=9 October 2005|work= [[The New York Times]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131027003946/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/books/bestseller/1009besthardfiction.html?_r=0|archive-date=27 October 2013 |url-status= live|access-date= 6 March 2010}}</ref>

===Film and screenwriting===
{{See also|Neil Gaiman bibliography#Film}}

Gaiman wrote the 1996 BBC dark fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''. He cowrote the screenplay for the movie ''[[MirrorMask]]'' with his old friend [[Dave McKean]] for McKean to direct. In addition, he wrote the localised English language script to the [[anime]] movie ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', based on a translation of the Japanese script.<ref name="princescripts">{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Hank|last2=Golden|first2=Christopher|author-link2=Christopher Golden|last3=Bissette|first3=Stephen R.|author-link3=Stephen R.

After his disappointment with the production limitations of ''Neverwhere'', Gaiman asked his agent to pull him out an unnamed UK television series that was to begin production immediately afterward. "I didn't want to do it unless I had more control than you get as a writer: in fantasy, the tone of voice, the look and feel, the way something is shot and edited is vital, and I wanted to be in charge of that."<ref name=":0" />

He cowrote the script for [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' with [[Roger Avary]], a collaboration that has proved productive for both writers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://video.stv.tv/bc/info-outFilmsVideo_interviews-20071120-neil-gaiman-and-roger-avary-shaping-beowulfs-story/?redirect=no|title= Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary: Shaping ''Beowulf's'' story|year= 2007|work= [[Stv.tv]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120625235711/http://video.stv.tv/bc/info-outFilmsVideo_interviews-20071120-neil-gaiman-and-roger-avary-shaping-beowulfs-story/?redirect=no|archive-date= 25 June 2012|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Gaiman has expressed interest in collaborating on a [[film adaptation]] of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first = Tom |last= Ambrose|title = He Is Legend|newspaper=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date = December 2007|page= 142}}</ref>

Gaiman frequently performs public readings from his stories and poetry, and has toured with his wife, musician [[Amanda Palmer]]. In some of these performances he has also sung songs, in "a novelist's version of singing",<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/arts/music/amanda-palmer-takes-connecting-with-her-fans-to-a-new-level.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 June 2012|title=Giving Love, Lots of It, To Her Fans|first=Ben|last=Sisario}}</ref> despite having "no kind of singing voice".<ref>{{citation|journal=[[The Independent]]|title=Amanda Palmer & Neil Gaiman, Queen's Hall, Edinburg|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/amanda-palmer--neil-gaiman-queens-hall-edinburgh-8038697.html|date=14 August 2012|first=David|last=Pollack}}</ref>

===Blog and Twitter===
In February 2001, when Gaiman had completed writing ''[[American Gods]]'', his publishers set up a promotional website featuring a [[weblog]] in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of revising, publishing, and promoting the novel.

Gaiman generally posts to the blog describing the day-to-day process of being Neil Gaiman and writing, revising, publishing, or promoting whatever the current project is. He also posts reader emails and answers questions, which gives him unusually direct and immediate interaction with fans. One of his answers on why he writes the blog is "because writing is, like death, a lonely business."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/02/m-is-for-mirrors-youll-stare-in-forever.html |title=Neil Gaiman's journal, 2/11/2008 |work=Journal.neilgaiman.com |date=11 February 2008 |access-date=26 July 2011}}</ref>

==Litigation==
In 1993, Gaiman was contracted by [[Todd McFarlane]] to write a single issue of ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', a popular title at the newly created [[Image Comics]] company. McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman, [[Alan Moore]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and [[Dave Sim]] each write a single issue.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In issue No. 9 of the series, Gaiman introduced the characters [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], [[Cogliostro]], and [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Medieval Spawn]]. Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no real direction in his actions. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn's existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to [[Malebolgia]], the demon that creates Hellspawn.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

As intended,<ref>See Judge Shabaz's ruling for the legal reasoning: "As a co-owner, McFarlane was not violating the Copyright Act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work, but, as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation, he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latter's share of the profits."</ref> all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe. In papers filed by  Gaiman in early 2002, however, he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter (himself) and artist (McFarlane), not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series.<ref>Listen to the "Oral Argument," [http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?caseno=03-1331&submit=showdkt&yr=03&num=1331.PD List of Documents in case: 03-1331 : Gaiman, Neil v.

McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters, and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively 'swap' McFarlane's interest in the character [[Marvelman]].<ref>See Judge Shabaz's [http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 ruling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205043220/http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 |date=5 December 2008 }}: "A tentative agreement was reached that... Gaiman would exchange his rights in Medieval Spawn and Cogliostro for McFarlane's rights in another comic book character, Miracleman."</ref> McFarlane had purchased interest in the character when [[Eclipse Comics]] was liquidated while Gaiman was interested in being able to continue his aborted run of the Marvelman title. McFarlane later changed his initial position, claiming that Gaiman's work had only been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's creations entirely. The presiding judge, however, ruled against their agreement being work for hire, based in large part on the legal requirement that "copyright assignments must be in writing."<ref>Judge Shabaz, [http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 Official ruling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205043220/http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 |date=5 December 2008 }}, as per "Schiller & Schmidt, Inc. v.

On the specific issue of Cogliostro, presiding Judge [[John C. Shabaz]] proclaimed, "The expressive work that is the comic-book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane—their contributions strike us as quite equal—and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright".<ref>See Judge Shabaz's [http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 ruling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205043220/http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 |date=5 December 2008 }} for similar statements on Angela and Medieval Spawn.</ref> Similar analysis led to similar results for the other two characters, Angela and Medieval Spawn.

==Literary allusions==
Gaiman's work is known for a high degree of [[allusion|allusiveness]].<ref>See particularly Rodney Sharkey, James Fleming, and Zuleyha Cetiner-Oktem's articles in ''ImageTexT''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/#Articles special issue] on Gaiman's work.</ref> Dr. Meredith Collins, for instance, has commented upon the degree to which his novel ''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture.<ref>Collins, Meredith. [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/collins/ "Fairy and Faerie: Uses of the Victorian in Neil Gaiman's and Charles Vess's Stardust"] ''ImageTexT'' 4.1.</ref> Particularly in ''The Sandman'', literary figures and characters appear often; the character of Fiddler's Green is modelled visually on [[G. K. Chesterton]], both [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] appear as characters, as do several characters from within ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''<ref>See this  [http://www.satt.org/comic/02_10_faery_1.html detailed analysis].</ref> and ''[[The Tempest]]''. The comic also draws from numerous mythologies and historical periods.

Analyzing Gaiman's ''The Graveyard Book'', bibliographer and librarian [[Richard Bleiler]] detects patterns of and allusions to the Gothic novel, from [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' to [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''. He concludes that Gaiman is "utilizing works, characters, themes, and settings that generations of scholars have identified and classified as Gothic, ...

Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works, often to the exclusion of his collaborators.<ref>Smith, Clay. [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/smith/ "Get Gaiman?: PolyMorpheus Perversity in Works by and about Neil Gaiman]" ''ImageTexT'' 4.1.</ref> However, Smith's viewpoint is in the minority: to many, if there is a problem with Gaiman scholarship and intertextuality it is that "... his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work."<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/introduction.shtml |title=A Special Issue on the Works of Neil Gaiman, Introduction |volume=4 |issue=1 |journal=English.ufl.edu |access-date=26 July 2011 |year=2008 |last1=Sandifer |first1=Philip |last2=Eklund |first2=Tof |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728061227/http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/introduction.shtml |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel ''[[Coraline]]'', where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[Uncanny|the Uncanny]], or the ''[[Unheimlich]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.bolton.ac.uk/emcs_journals/1/ |title=An Eye for an 'I': Neil Gaiman's Coraline and the Question of Identity |last=Rudd |first=David |journal=Children's Literature and Education |volume=39 |number=3 |year=2008 |pages=159–168 |doi=10.1007/s10583-008-9067-7 |s2cid=144285798 |access-date=28 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928032720/http://digitalcommons.bolton.ac.uk/emcs_journals/1/ |archive-date=28 September 2008  }}</ref>

Though Gaiman's work is frequently seen as exemplifying the [[monomyth]] structure laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'',<ref>See Stephen Rauch, ''Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and Joseph Campbell: In Search of the Modern Myth'', Wildside Press, 2003</ref> Gaiman says that he started reading ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' but refused to finish it: "I think I got about half way through ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' and found myself thinking if this is true – I don't want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff.
