'''Kate Forsyth''' (born 3 June 1966) is an Australian author. She is best known for her historical novel ''Bitter Greens'', which interweaves a retelling of the ''[[Rapunzel]]'' fairy tale with the true life story of the woman who first told the tale, the 17th century French writer [[Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force]].

Forsyth is also the author of several children's books, including ''The Gypsy Crown'', ''The Puzzle Ring'', ''The Starthorn Tree'', ''The Wildkin's Curse'', ''The Starkin Crown'' and  ''Dragon Gold''. She has also published two [[heroic fantasy]] series, ''The Witches of Eileanan'' and ''Rhiannon's Ride'', the poetry collection ''Radiance'', and the novel ''Full Fathom Five'' under her maiden name, Kate Humphrey.  She is a five-time [[Aurealis Award]] winner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/frontier-women-20120607-1zx69.html |title=Frontier women|first=Linda |last=Morris|date=9 June 2012}}</ref>

She is married with three children, and lives in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. She is also a direct descendant of [[Charlotte Barton]], the author of Australia's earliest known children's book. Forsyth's older sister, Belinda Murrell, is also an author for children and young adults and their younger brother, Nick Humphrey, is a [[nonfiction]] author.<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/the-book-show/literary-families:-sisters-belinda-murrell-and-kate-forsyth/10350218 Literary families: sisters and writers Belinda Murrell and Kate Forsyth]</ref>

==Journalism==
After graduating in a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Literature from [[Macquarie University]], Forsyth worked as a full-time [[journalist]], including Editor of ''Hair'' and deputy editor of ''Money Watch'' before quitting to work [[freelance]], writing articles for ''[[Vogue Australia]]'', ''[[Black+White]]'', ''Studio Bambini'', ''Mode Brides'', ''Interiors'' and ''Australian Collections'' amongst others.

Freelancing allowed her to concentrate more on her poetry and to be President of the Poets Union.  She publishes her poetry under her maiden name, Kate Humphrey. This has appeared in Australian newspapers, such as ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', ''[[The Age]]'', and ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', and domestic and international literary magazines.

She wrote "Full Fathom Five" as the thesis for her [[Master of Arts]] in Writing, and then, to relieve the tedium of studying theorists such as [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[Derrida]] and de Saussure for her exams, she started reading a multi-book fantasy series. The turning point was when her husband, Greg Forsyth, suggested that she write such a series herself.

She is currently undertaking a doctorate in fairy-tale retelling at the University of Technology, Sydney. Her novel ''Bitter Greens'' was written as the creative component of her doctorate, and she is now writing a theoretical examination of Rapunzel.
