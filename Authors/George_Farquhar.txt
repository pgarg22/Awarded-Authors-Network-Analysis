'''George Farquhar''' (1677<ref name=birthd>The explanation for the dual birth year appears in Louis A. Strauss, ed., ''[https://archive.org/details/adiscourseuponc00stragoog A Discourse Upon Comedy, The Recruiting Officer, and The Beaux’ Stratagem by George Farquhar]'' (Boston: D.C. Heath & Co., 1914), p. v. Strauss notes that "Our sole source of information as to the time of his birth is the entry of his matriculation in the register of Trinity College" on 17 July 1694, where "His age is given as 17." Earlier biographers took this to mean Farquhar was in his 17th year—hence born in 1678—and Strauss favors this date. But later writers, such as William Myers, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B_efAAAACAAJ George Farquhar: The Recruiting Officer and Other Plays],'' {{ISBN|0-19-282249-7}} (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. vii, give the dual year, and John Ross, ed., ''George Farquhar: The Recruiting Officer (New Mermaids),'' 2nd ed., {{ISBN|0-7136-3349-2}} (London: A&C Black, 1991), p. xiii, gives a birthdate of "''ca.'' 1677" for the playwright.</ref> – 29 April 1707) was an Irish [[dramatist]]. He is noted for his contributions to late [[Restoration comedy]], particularly for his plays ''[[The Constant Couple]]'' (1699), ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]'' (1706) and ''[[The Beaux' Stratagem]]'' (1707).

==Acting career==

Farquhar joined a company performing on the [[Dublin]] stage, probably through his acquaintance with the well-known actor [[Robert Wilks]].<ref name="strauss1"/> However, Farquhar was reportedly not that impressive as an actor. We are told that "his Voice was somewhat weak"<ref name="ingenious"/> and that "his movements [were] stiff and ungraceful."<ref name=alex2>{{cite book

 | no-pp = true  }}</ref> But he was well received by audiences and thought to continue in this career "till something better should offer."<ref name="ingenious"/> Some of the roles reportedly played by Farquhar were Lennox in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]],'' Young Bellair in ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' by [[George Etherege]], Lord Dion in ''[[Philaster (play)|Philaster]]'' by [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]], and Guyomar in ''The Indian Emperor'' by [[John Dryden]].<ref name="strauss1"/>

But while he was performing in the Dryden play, an accident on stage put an end to Farquhar's acting career. As Guyomar, Farquhar was supposed to "kill" Vasquez, one of the Spanish generals in the drama. Forgetting to exchange his sword for a [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] before enacting this scene, Farquhar severely wounded Price, the actor playing Vasquez. Although Price recovered, Farquhar resolved after this mishap to give up acting for good.<ref name="ingenious"/><ref name="strauss1"/><ref name=alex3>{{cite book

==Writing career==

Farquhar then left for London, "possibly with a draft of his first play in his portmanteau."<ref name="myers"/> Some writers tie his move to that of his friend Wilks, who had received an offer from the manager of [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] to come to London and join that theatre,<ref name=alex4>{{cite book

Farquhar's first comedy, ''[[Love and a Bottle]],'' was premiered in 1698; "for its sprightly Dialogue and busy Scenes," it is said to have been "well received by the Audience."<ref name="ingenious2"/> Called a "licentious piece" by one scholar,<ref name="myers"/> and cited as proof that Farquhar had "absorbed the stock topics, character-types, and situations of Restoration comedy" by another,<ref name="ross"/> the play deals with Roebuck, "An ''Irish'' Gentleman of a wild roving Temper" who is "newly come to ''London.''"<ref name=ingeniousplay>{{cite book

After the favourable reception of ''Love and a Bottle,'' Farquhar decided to devote himself to playwriting. He also at this point received a commission in the regiment of the Earl of Orrery, so his time for the next few years was divided between the vocations of soldier and dramatist.<ref name="alex4"/> It was also at about this time that Farquhar discovered [[Anne Oldfield]], who was reading aloud a scene from ''[[The Scornful Lady]]'' at her aunt's tavern. Impressed, he brought her to the notice of [[John Vanbrugh|Sir John Vanbrugh]], and this led to her theatrical career, during which she was the first performer of major female roles in Farquhar's last comedies.<ref name=strauss3>{{cite book
