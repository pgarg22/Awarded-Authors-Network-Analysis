'''Thomas Archibald Barron''' (born March 26, 1952) is an [[American people|American]] writer of [[fantasy literature]], books for children and young adults, and nature books.

==Biography==
Barron <ref name=isfdb/> spent his early childhood in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]], a town full [[apple orchard]]s and lots of New England history. His family moved to [[Colorado]] and he spent much of his youth on a ranch in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Barron's writing reflects his great passion for nature and the spiritual values of the natural world, as well as his belief in the power of every person.

He studied history at [[Princeton University]], where he was a Trustee,<ref>[http://www.princeton.edu/vpsec/trustees/current/ "Board of Trustees, 2012–13"]. Vice President & Secretary. Princeton University. Retrieved 2013-06-28.</ref> attended [[Oxford University]] on a [[Rhodes scholarship]], and has business and law degrees from [[Harvard University]]. He served as president of a private equity firm in [[New York City]] before changing careers in 1990, when he returned to [[Colorado]] to become a full-time writer and conservationist.

Since then, he has written more than thirty novels, children's books, non-fiction books, and nature books. In 2011, he received [[Fay B. Kaigler Children's Book Festival|The de Grummond Medallion]] for "lifetime contribution to the field of children's and young adult literature."<ref name=USM/> He has also won the [[Nautilus Award|Nautilus Award Grand Prize]], and many other literary awards.

He is actively involved with environmental and conservation organizations, including the Wilderness Society, [[Earthjustice]], World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Conservation Society, the Alaska Conservation Foundation, and Colorado Open Lands.

In 2000, he founded a national prize to celebrate outstanding young people, who help other people, or the environment—the [http://barronprize.org Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes] (named after his mother). He has produced a documentary film, “Dream Big”, as well as several highly acclaimed videos that honor extraordinary young people of diverse backgrounds for his [https://inspiringyoungheroes.org/ Inspiring Young Heroes] website.  He won a [https://www.tellyawards.com/ Telly Award] in 2020 for excellence in video production in the Social Impact category.

Barron also helped to create the [https://environment.princeton.edu/ High Meadows Environmental Institute] at [[Princeton University]]. Recently, the Wilderness Society honored him with the Robert Marshall Award, its highest award given to citizens active in conservation.

==Writer==
In many of his novels, Barron writes about [[nature]] and [[ecology]] in mythical settings. Inspired by nature's power of renewal as well as humanity's power of free choice, he says, "I truly believe every person can make a difference — that's why I'm drawn to heroic quest stories." {{ref|barron-1}}. His books have received the Nautilus Award Grand Prize for literature that helps to renew the spirit and envision a better world, as well as many other awards from the [[American Library Association]], and the [[International Literacy Association]]. ''The Merlin Saga'' (13 titles) and the novel ''The Ancient One'' have been international best sellers; ''The Great Tree of Avalon'' trilogy has been a [[New York Times]] best seller.

According to ''[[Booklist]]'', his books are "completely magical" and "will enchant readers." The ''[[New York Times]]'' has called his work "august" and "compelling". Fellow author [[Isabel Allende]] has said his writing is "brilliant—a real gift"; similarly, author [[Madeleine L'Engle]] called his stories "a crescendo of miracles." Fellow writer [[Terry Tempest Williams]] has hailed him as the creator of "environmental fables for our time." [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]], [[M.D.]] has praised his work by saying, "Here is so much grace." And writer [[Lloyd Alexander]] called his books "an intense and profoundly spiritual adventure."
