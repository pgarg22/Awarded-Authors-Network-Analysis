'''Vasily Pavlovich Aksyonov''' ({{lang-rus|Васи́лий Па́влович Аксёнов|p=vɐˈsʲilʲɪj ˈpavləvʲɪtɕ ɐˈksʲɵnəf}}; August 20, 1932 – July 6, 2009) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] [[novelist]]. He became known in the [[Western world|West]] as the author of ''The Burn'' (''Ожог'', ''Ozhog'', from 1975) and of ''[[Generations of Winter]]'' (''Московская сага'', ''Moskovskaya Saga'', from 1992), a [[family saga]] following three generations of the Gradov family between 1925 and 1953.

==Early life==
{{rquote|right|"When I was in Kazan during my student years, I was under surveillance by the KGB. I didn’t realize it at first—it was only after they began "inviting" my friends in to talk that I realized they were following me, and our whole group. It wasn’t like it is here at an American university—we were all one group in our class, a group of about 30 which existed together the entire six years of study; we had all of our classes together and were all living together.

}}
Vasily Aksyonov was born to Pavel Aksyonov and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] in [[Kazan]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] on August 20, 1932. His mother, Yevgenia Ginzburg, was a successful journalist and educator and his father, Pavel Aksyonov, had a high position in the administration of Kazan. Both parents "were prominent communists."<ref name="Yoffe"/><ref name="NYTOBT"/> In 1937, however, both were arrested and tried for her alleged connection to [[Trotskyists]]. They were both sent to [[Gulag]] and then to exile, and "each served 18 years, but remarkably survived."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "Later, Yevgenia came to prominence as the author of a famous memoir, ''Into the Whirlwind'', documenting the brutality of Stalinist repression."<ref name="Yoffe"/>

Aksyonov remained in Kazan with his nanny and grandmother until the [[NKVD]] arrested him as a son of "[[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]", and sent him to an orphanage without providing his family any information on his whereabouts.<ref name="Yoffe"/> Aksyonov "remained [there] until rescued in 1938 by his uncle, with whose family he stayed until his mother was released into exile, having served 10 years of forced labour."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "In 1947, Vasily joined her in exile in the notorious [[Magadan]], [[Kolyma]] prison area, where he graduated from high school."<ref name="Yoffe"/> Vasily's half-brother Alexei (from Ginzburg's first marriage to Dmitriy Fedorov) died from starvation in besieged [[Leningrad]] in 1941.<ref name="sovlit.com"/>

His parents, seeing that doctors had the best chance to survive in the camps, decided that Aksyonov should go into the medical profession.<ref name="Yoffe"/>  "He therefore entered the [[Kazan University]] and graduated in 1956 from the [[First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg]]" and worked as a doctor for the next 3 years.<ref name="Yoffe"/> During his time as a medical student he came under surveillance by the KGB, who began to prepare a file against him. It is likely that he would have been arrested had the liberalisation that followed Stalin's death in 1953 not intervened.<ref name="sovlit.com"/>

==Career==
[[File:Vasily Aksyonov_1980.jpg|thumb|Aksyonov in 1980]]
Reportedly, "during the liberalisation that followed Stalin's death in 1953, Aksyonov came into contact with the first Soviet countercultural movement of zoot-suited hipsters called ''[[stilyagi]]'' (the ones 'with style')."<ref name="Yoffe"/> As a result,

<blockquote>
He fell in love with their slang, fashions, libertine lifestyles, dancing and especially their music. From this point on began his lifelong romance with jazz. Interest in his new milieu, western music, fashion and literature turned out to be life-changing for Aksyonov, who decided to dedicate himself to chronicling his times through literature. He remained a keen observer of youth, with its ever-changing styles, movements and trends. Like no other Soviet writer, he was attuned to the developments and changes in popular culture.<ref name="Yoffe"/>
</blockquote>

In 1956, he was "discovered" and heralded by the Soviet writer [[Valentin Kataev]] for his first publication, in the liberal magazine Youth.<ref name="Yoffe"/> "His first novel, ''Colleagues'' (1961), was based on his experiences as a doctor."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "His second, ''Ticket to the Stars'' (1961), depicting the life of Soviet youthful hipsters, made him an overnight celebrity."<ref name="Yoffe"/>

In the 1960s Aksyonov was a frequent contributor to the popular ''[[Yunost]]'' ("Youth") magazine and eventually became a staff writer. Aksyonov thus reportedly became "a leading figure in the so-called "youth prose" movement and a darling of the Soviet liberal intelligentsia and their western supporters: his writings stood in marked contrast to the dreary, socialist-realist prose of the time."<ref name="Yoffe">''Obituary: Vasily Aksyonov: Libertarian Russian writer and leading light in 'youth prose', he fell foul of the KGB.'' Mark Yoffe. The Guardian (London) – Final Edition July 16, 2009. GUARDIAN OBITUARIES PAGES; pg. 34.</ref> "Aksyonov's characters spoke in a natural way, using hip lingo, they went to bars and dance halls, had premarital sex, listened to jazz and rock'n'roll and hustled to score a pair of cool American shoes."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "There was a feeling of freshness and freedom about his writings, similar to the one emanating from black-market recordings of American jazz and pop."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "He soon became one of the informal leaders of the [[Sixtiers|Shestidesyatniki]] – which translates roughly as "the '60s generation" – a group of young Soviets who resisted the Communist Party's cultural and ideological restrictions."<ref name="OBLA"/> "'It was amazing: We were being brought up robots, but we began to listen to jazz,' Aksyonov said in a 2007 documentary about him."<ref name="OBLA"/>

For all his hardship, Aksyonov, 
<blockquote>
as a prose stylist, was at the opposite pole from Mr. [[Solzhenitsyn]], becoming a symbol of youthful promise and embracing fashion and jazz rather than dwelling on the miseries of the gulag. Ultimately, however, he shared Mr. Solzhenitsyn's fate of exile from the Soviet Union.

''Solzhenitsyn is all about the imprisonment and trying to get out, and Aksyonov is the young person whose mother got out and he actually can live his life now,'' said Nina L. Khrushcheva, who is a granddaughter of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and a friend of the Aksyonov family and who teaches international affairs at the New School in New York. ''It was important to have the Aksyonov light, that light of personal freedom and personal self-expression.''<ref name="NYTOBT"/>
</blockquote>

However, as [[Mark Yoffe]] notes in Aksyonov's obituary, his "open pro-Americanism and liberal values eventually led to problems with the KGB."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "And his involvement in 1979 with an independent magazine, ''Metropol'', led to an open confrontation with the authorities."<ref name="Yoffe"/><ref name="OBLA"/> His next two celebrated dissident novels, ''The Burn'' and ''The Island of Crimea'', could not be published in the USSR.<ref name="Yoffe"/> "The former explored the plight of intellectuals under communism and the latter was an imagining of what life might have been like had the [[White movement|white army]] staved off the Bolsheviks in 1917."<ref name="Yoffe"/>

"When ''The Burn'' was published in Italy in 1980, Aksyonov accepted an invitation for him and his wife Maya to leave Russia for the US."<ref name="Yoffe"/> "Soon afterwards, he was stripped of his Soviet citizenship, regaining it only 10 years later during Gorbachev's perestroika."<ref name="Yoffe"/>

"Aksyonov spent the next 24 years in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Virginia]], where he taught [[Russian Literature]] at [[George Mason University]]."<ref name="Yoffe"/><ref name="NYTOBT">''Vasily Aksyonov, 76, Exiled Soviet Writer.'' SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY. The New York Times July 8, 2009. Section A; Column 0; Obituary; pg. 23.</ref> "He [also] taught literature at a number of [other] American universities, including [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[Goucher College]] in Maryland... [and] worked as a journalist for Radio Liberty."<ref name="OBLA">OBITUARIES / VASILY AKSYONOV, 1932 – 2009; Dissident writer was expelled from the Soviet Union Los Angeles Times July 10, 2009. MAIN NEWS; Metro Desk; Part A; Pg. 26.</ref>

"He continued to write novels, among which was the ambitious ''Generations of Winter'' (1994), a multi-generational saga of Soviet life that became a successful Russian TV mini-series."<ref name="Yoffe"/> The so-called "''The Moscow Saga,'' [this 1994] epic trilogy... described the lives of three generations of a Soviet family between the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and Stalin's death in 1953."<ref name="OBLA"/>  The TV mini-series consisted of 24 episodes and was broadcast on Russian television in 2004.<ref name="OBLA"/>  "[In 1994], he also won the Russian Booker Prize, Russia's top literary award, for his historical novel ''Voltairian Men and Women,'' about a meeting between the famous philosopher [[Voltaire]] and Empress [[Catherine II]]."<ref name="OBLA"/>

"In 2004, he settled in [[Biarritz, France]], and returned to the US less frequently, dividing his time between France and Moscow."<ref name="Yoffe"/> His novel ''Moskva-kva-kva'' (2006) was published in the [[Moscow]]-based magazine ''Oktyabr''.

"Aksyonov was translated into numerous languages, and in Russia remained influential".<ref name="Yoffe"/> In addition to writing novels, he is also known as author of poems, occasionally performed as songs.<ref>{{YouTube|id=YKFyk7i9Mds&list=UUca7CDkB4Id1a6HKzeni3Mw|title=Cold Spring}} - [[Larisa Novoseltseva]] reads poems and performs her song on poetry by Aksenov</ref> He was reportedly "forever a hipster [and] was used to being in the avant garde, be it in fashion or literary innovation."<ref name="Yoffe"/> He was described as "a colourful man, with his trademark moustache, elegant suits, expensive cars, and a love for grand cities, fine wine and good food."<ref name="Yoffe"/>

On July 6, 2009, he died in Moscow at the age of 76.<ref name="Yoffe"/>

==Political views==
Vasily Aksyonov was a convinced anti-totalitarian. On the presentation of one of his last novels, he stated: "If in this country one starts erecting Stalin statues again, I have to reject my native land. Nothing else remains."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/306349|script-title=ru:Писатель Василий Аксенов: "Если начнется восстановление памятников Сталину – я отрекусь от родины"|trans-title=Writer Vasily Aksyonov: If in this country one starts erecting Stalin statues again, I have to reject my native land|publisher=Izvestia.ru|author=Natialia Kochetkova|access-date=13 August 2012|date=21 September 2005|language=ru}}</ref>
