She worked for several years as a high-school teacher but is currently a freelance writer and tutor, living in [[Norfolk]].

==Poetry==
Alvi says: "'Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan' was one of the first poems I wrote. When I wrote this poem I wasn't actually back in Pakistan. The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin, and she thinks things aren't straightforward for her. I found it was important to write the Pakistan poems because I was getting in touch with my background. And maybe there's a bit of a message behind the poems about something I went through, that I want to maybe open a few doors if possible."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/zc7b4wx "'Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan' by Moniza Alvi (analysis)"], BBC GCSE Bitesize.

''Peacock Luggage'', a book of poems by Moniza Alvi and Peter Daniels, was published after the two poets jointly won the Poetry Business Prize in 1991, in Alvi's case for "Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan".<ref>[http://www.sawnet.org/books/authors.php?Alvi+Moniza.

Accessed March 2016.</ref> That poem and "An Unknown Girl" have featured on England's [[GCSE]] exam syllabus for young teenagers.

Since then, Moniza Alvi has written four poetry collections. ''The Country at My Shoulder'' (1993) led to her being selected for the [[Poetry Society]]'s [[New Generation Poets]] promotion in 1994.
