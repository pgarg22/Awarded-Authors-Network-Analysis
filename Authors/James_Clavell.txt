Clavell is best known as the author of his [[The Asian Saga|Asian Saga]] novels, a number of which have had television adaptations. Clavell also wrote such screenplays as those for ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]''  (1958) (based on [[The Fly (Langelaan)|the short story]] by [[George Langelaan]]) and ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) (based on [[The Great Escape (book)|the personal account]] of [[Paul Brickhill]]). He directed the popular 1967 film ''[[To Sir, with Love]]'' for which he also wrote the script.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Australia, Clavell was the son of Commander Richard Charles Clavell, a [[Royal Navy]] officer who was stationed in Australia with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] from 1920 to 1922. Clavell was educated at [[Portsmouth Grammar School]], after which he returned to Australia.

===World War II===
In 1940, Clavell joined the [[Royal Artillery]]. Though trained for desert warfare, after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 he was sent to [[Singapore]] to fight the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. The ship taking his unit was sunk en route to Singapore, and the survivors were picked up by a Dutch boat fleeing to India. The commander, described by Clavell years later as a "total twit", insisted that they be dropped off at the nearest port to fight the war despite having no weapons.<ref name="Bernstein">{{cite news |last1=Bernstein |first1=Peter |title=Making of a Literary Shogun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/magazine/making-of-a-literary-shogun.html |access-date=26 January 2020 |work=The New York Times Magazine|date=13 September 1981}}</ref>

==== Imprisoned in Changi ====
Shot in the face,<ref name="Bernstein" /> he was captured in  Java in 1942 and sent to a Japanese [[prisoner of war camp]] on [[Java]]. Later he was transferred to [[Changi Prison]] in Singapore, where only 1 in 15 prisoners survived.<ref name="NY Times obituary">{{cite news |last1=Grimes |first1=William |title=James Clavell, Best-Selling Storyteller of Far Eastern Epics, Is Dead at 69 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/08/obituaries/james-clavell-best-selling-storyteller-of-far-eastern-epics-is-dead-at-69.html |access-date=26 January 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=8 September 1994}}</ref>

In 1981, Clavell recounted: <blockquote>"'Changi became my university instead of my prison. Among the inmates there were experts in all walks of life -the high and the low roads. I studied and absorbed everything I could from physics to counterfeiting, but most of all I learned the art of surviving, the most important course of all."<ref name="Bernstein" /> </blockquote>Prisoners were fed a quarter of a pound of rice per day, one egg per week and occasional vegetables.  Clavell believed that if atomic bombs had not been dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]  he would not have survived the war."<ref name="Bernstein" />

Clavell did not talk about his wartime experiences with anyone, even his wife, for 15 years after the war. For a time he carried a can of sardines in his pocket at all times and fought an urge to forage for food in trash cans. He also experienced bad dreams and a nervous stomach kept him awake at night.<ref name="Bernstein"/>

===Post-war career===
By 1946 Clavell had become a captain, but a motorcycle accident ended his military career. He enrolled with the [[University of Birmingham]], where he met April Stride, an actress, whom he married in 1949 (date of marriage sometimes given as 1951).<ref>{{cite web|title=FreeBMD Entry Info|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=JWMw7lbUOdxcx8VyTpzoRg&scan=1|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS|access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> He would visit her on the film sets where she was working and began to be interested in becoming a film director.<ref name="james">{{cite news|title=An author at home in Hollywood and Hong Kong|author=Dudar, Helen|work=Chicago Tribune|date=12 April 1981|page=e1}}</ref>

===Early work on films===
Clavell entered the film industry via distribution and worked at that in England for a number of years. He tried to get into producing but had no luck so started writing screenplays. In 1954 he moved to New York, then to Hollywood. While trying to break into screenwriting he paid the bills working as a carpenter.<ref name="james"/>

In 1956, he sold a script about pilots to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], ''Far Alert''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Drama: Marine Rescue Story to Star Arness; Stage, Screen Blend Efforts|author=Schallert, Edwin|date=June 19, 1956|work=Los Angeles Times|page=19}}</ref> The same year [[Michael Pate]] bought a story of his, ''Forbidden Territory'', for filming.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bon Voyage' Announced as Major Buy; 'Holiday in Monaco' Wald Film|author=Schallert, Edwin|date=October 9, 1956|work=Los Angeles Times|page=C11}}</ref>

Neither was filmed but ''Far Alert'' kept being sold and re-sold. "In 18 months it brought in $87,000", he later said. "We kept getting paid for writing it and rewriting it as it went from one studio to another. It was wonderful."<ref name="james"/> It was later sold to [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] where it attracted the attention of [[Robert L. Lippert]] who hired Clavell to write the science-fiction horror movie ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' (1958). This became a hit and launched Clavell as a screenwriter.

He wrote ''[[Watusi (film)|Watusi]]'' (1959) for director [[Kurt Neumann (director)|Kurt Neumann]], who had also made ''The Fly''.

Clavell wrote ''[[Five Gates to Hell]]'' (1959) for Lippert, and when they could not find a suitable director, Clavell was given the job.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esCnTSqGtUYC&q=harry+spaling+writer&pg=PA320|page=320|title=Double Feature Creature Attack: A Monster Merger of Two More Volumes of Classic Interviews|first=Tom|last=Weaver|publisher=McFarland|date=19 February 2003|isbn=9780786482153}}</ref>

[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] hired Clavell to write a film about the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=SCHARY SUPPORTS WRITERS' STRIKE: Independent Film Producer Not Affected by Walkout Defends Pay in TV Sales|work=New York Times|date=27 October 1959|page=42}}</ref> It ended up not being made. Neither was a proposed movie about [[Francis Gary Powers]] made.<ref>{{cite news|title=U-2 Incident Causes Movie Repercussions|author=Vernon, Scott|work=Los Ambrose Times|date=May 28, 1960|page=A7}}</ref> Clavell did write, produce, and direct a Western at Paramount, ''[[Walk Like a Dragon]]'' (1960).

In 1959, Clavell wrote  "Moon Landing" and "First Woman in the Moon", two episodes of ''[[Men into Space]]'', a "day after tomorrow"-style science fiction drama, which depicted, in realistic terms, the (at the time) near future of [[space exploration]].

In 1960, he had written a Broadway show with [[John Sturges]], ''White Alice'', a thriller set in the Arctic.<ref>{{cite news|title=ELLIS LISTS STARS OF 'HAPPY ENDING': Ruth Chatterton, Pert Kelton and Conrad Nagel to Head Cast at New Hope, Pa.|author=SAM ZOLOTOW|work=New York Times|date=5 August 1960|page=13}}</ref> It was never produced.

===Early prose and screenplay work===
In 1960, the Writers Guild went on strike, meaning Clavell was unable to work. He decided to write a novel, ''[[King Rat (Clavell novel)|King Rat]]'', based on his time at Changi. It took him three months and several more months after that to rework it. The book was published in 1962 and sold well. It was turned into [[King Rat (film)|a film in 1965]].<ref name="james"/>

In 1961, Clavell announced he had formed his own company, Cee Productions, who would make the films ''King Rat'', ''White Alice'' and ''No Hands on the Clock''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Irwin Allen Signs Multiple Film Deal|date=June 28, 1961|work=Los Angeles Times|page=C11}}</ref>

In 1962, he signed a multi picture contract with a Canadian company to produce and direct two films there, ''Circle of Greed'' and ''[[The Sweet and the Bitter (1967 film)|The Sweet and the Bitter]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=FILMLAND EVENTS: Curtis' 'Playboy' Goes to Columbia|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Jan 11, 1962|page=B9}}</ref> Only the second was made and it was not released until 1967.

He wrote scripts for the war films ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) and ''[[633 Squadron]]'' (1964).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://librarycatalog.wgfoundation.org/award/search.ashx|title=Writers Guild Foundation Library Database|publisher=Writers Guild Foundation|access-date=9 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909233535/http://librarycatalog.wgfoundation.org/award/search.ashx|archive-date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

He wrote a short story, "[[The Children's Story]]" (1964) and the script for ''[[The Satan Bug]]'' (1965), directed by John Sturges who had made ''The Great Escape''. He also wrote ''Richard Sahib'' for Sturges which was never made.<ref>{{cite news|title=BY WAY OF REPORT: John Sturges' 'Sahib' – Together Again|author=A.H. WEILER|work=New York Times|date=May 3, 1964|page=X9}}</ref>

Clavell wanted to write a second novel because "that separates the men from the boys".<ref>{{cite news|title=AUTHOR JAMES CLAVELL: A LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME|last=Rosenfield|first=Paul|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=19 April 1981|page=L5}}</ref> The money from ''King Rat'' enabled him to spend two years researching and then writing what became ''[[Tai-Pan (novel)|Tai-Pan]]'' (1966). It was a huge bestseller, and Clavell sold the film rights for a sizeable amount (although the film would not be made until 1986).<ref>{{cite news|title='Tai-Pan' Means Big Novel, Big Money, Big Movie: More on Movies|author=A.H. WEILER. New York Times 3 July 1966|page=45}}</ref>

===Leading film director===
Clavell returned to filmmaking. He wrote, produced and directed ''[[To Sir, With Love]]'' (1967), featuring [[Sidney Poitier]] and based on [[E. R. Braithwaite]]'s semiautobiographical [[To Sir, With Love (novel)|1959 book]]. It was a huge critical and commercial success.<ref name="los">{{cite news|title=A Blue-Ribbon Packager of Movie Deals|author=Warga, Wayne|work=Los Angeles Times|date=20 April 1969|page=w1}}</ref>

Clavell was now in much demand as a filmmaker. He produced and directed ''[[Where's Jack?]]'' (1969), a highwayman film which was a commercial failure.<ref name="Deeley">Michael Deeley, ''Blade Runners, Deer Hunters and Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: My Life in Cult Movies'', Pegasus Books, 2009 p 43-44</ref> So too was an epic film about the [[Thirty Years' War]], ''[[The Last Valley (1971 film)|The Last Valley]]'' (1971).<ref name="variety">{{cite news|title=ABC's 5 Years of Film Production Profits & Losses|work=Variety|date=31 May 1973|page=3}}</ref>

===Career as novelist===
Clavell returned to novel writing, which was the focus of the remainder of his career. He spent three years researching and writing ''[[Shōgun (novel)|Shōgun]]'' (1975), about an Englishman who becomes a samurai in feudal Japan. It was another massive best seller. Clavell was heavily involved in the [[Shōgun (1980 miniseries)|1980 miniseries]] which starred [[Richard Chamberlain]] and achieved huge ratings.

In the late 1970s he spent three years researching and writing his fourth novel, ''[[Noble House (book)|Noble House]]'' (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963. It was another best seller and was turned into a miniseries in 1986.<ref name="author">{{cite news|title=An author at home in Hollywood and Hong Kong|last=Dudar|first=Helen|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=12 April 1981|page=E1}}</ref>

Clavell briefly returned to filmmaking and directed a thirty-minute adaptation of his novelette ''The Children's Story''. He was meant to do a sequel to ''Shogun'' but instead wrote a novel about the 1979 revolution in Iran, ''[[Whirlwind (novel)|Whirlwind]]'' (1986).<ref name="bully">{{cite news|title=Clavell bullies the bullies now that he's No. 1|author=Allemang, John|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=29 November 1986|page=E.3}}</ref>

Clavell eventually returned to the ''Shogun'' sequel, writing ''[[Gai-Jin]]'' (1993). This was his last completed novel.

==Novelist==
''[[The New York Times]]'' said that "Clavell has a gift. It may be something that cannot be taught or earned. He breathes narrative ... He writes in the oldest and grandest tradition that fiction knows".<ref name="schott19750622">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/22/archives/shogun-from-james-clavell-with-tea-and-blood.html |title=Shogun |last=Schott |first=Webster |date=22 June 1975 |work=The New York Times |access-date=15 March 2018 |page=236  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> His first novel, ''[[King Rat (1962 novel)|King Rat]]'' (1962), was a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences at Changi. When the book was published it became an immediate best-seller, and three years later it was adapted as a movie. His next novel, ''[[Tai-Pan (novel)|Tai-Pan]]'' (1966), was a fictional account of [[Jardine Matheson]]'s successful career in Hong Kong,<ref>Robyn Meredith, "Sailing From Old to New Asia; Jardine Matheson is ever more a play on its traditional region", ''[[Forbes Asia]]'', Volume 4, Issue 15 (15 September 2008), p. 88.</ref> as told via the character who was to become Clavell's heroic archetype, [[Dirk Struan]].<ref>"Book (1966): ''Tai-Pan'', James Clavell", ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (29 March 2009), p. 7.</ref> Struan's descendants were characters in almost all of his following books. ''Tai-Pan'' was adapted as a movie in 1986.

Clavell's third novel, ''[[Shōgun (novel)|Shōgun]]'' (1975), is set in 17th century Japan, and it tells the story of a shipwrecked English navigator in Japan, based on that of [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]]. When the story was made into a [[Shōgun (1980 miniseries)|TV miniseries]] in 1980, produced by Clavell, it became the second highest rated miniseries in history with an audience of more than 120 million, after ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-james-clavell-1447652.html|title=Obituary: James Clavell|last=Guttridge|first=Peter|date=9 September 1994|website=Independent|access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref>

Clavell's fourth novel, ''[[Noble House (book)|Noble House]]'' (1981), became a bestseller that year and was adapted into a [[Noble House (miniseries)|TV miniseries]] in 1988.

Following the success of ''Noble House'', Clavell wrote ''[[Thrump-o-moto]]'' (1985), ''Whirlwind'' (1986), and ''[[Gai-Jin]]'' (1993).

===Peter Marlowe===
Peter Marlowe is Clavell's [[author surrogate]]<ref name="Bernstein" /> and a character of the novels ''King Rat'' and ''Noble House'' (1981); he is also mentioned once (as a friend of Andrew Gavallan's) in ''[[Whirlwind (novel)|Whirlwind]]'' (1986).  Featured most prominently in ''King Rat'', Marlowe is an English [[Far East Prisoners of War|prisoner of war]] in [[Changi Prison]] during World War II. In ''Noble House'', set two decades later, he is a novelist researching a book about Hong Kong.  Marlowe's ancestors are also mentioned in other Clavell novels.

In ''Noble House'' Marlowe is mentioned as having written a novel about Changi which, although fictionalized, is based on real events (like those in ''King Rat''). When asked which character was based on him, Marlowe answers, "Perhaps I'm not there at all", although in a later scene, he admits he was "the hero, of course".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/390711.Noble_House| title=Noble House (Chapter 65)|author=Clavell, James|date=1981 }}</ref>

In 1963 Clavell became a naturalized citizen of the United States.<ref name="Bernstein" /> Politically, he was said to have been an ardent [[Individualism|individualist]] and proponent of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], as many of his books' heroes exemplify. Clavell admired [[Ayn Rand]], founder of the [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] school of philosophy, and sent her a copy of ''Noble House'' during 1981 inscribed: "This is for Ayn Rand—one of the real, true talents on this earth for which many, many thanks.
