In 1920 the Lénárd family moved from Hungary to [[Austria]]. His first studies were private lessons at home because he couldn't stand being at school. In 1920-1921 he began his study at Wiener Theresianum (a board school in Vienna) where he was hungry and cold, and the few days at home at weekends were a real happiness to him.<ref name="Lenard">[http://mek.oszk.hu/kiallitas/lenard/cv/indexde.html/Péter Siklós:Von Budapest bis zum Tal am Ende der Welt Sándor Lénárds romanhafter Lebensweg] Retrieved on 16 Jan 2018</ref> He didn't stay long in this school, because their family moved to [[Klosterneuburg]] and there he finished his studies in 1928. During his leisure time he practiced playing piano, rowing, swimming and running.

Lénárd conducted his medical studies at the [[University of Vienna]]. He continued studying in the university till 1936 and had a good relationship with the professors and his fellow students; with some of them, the likes of Karl Adams and Egon Fenz, he had contacts till his death. During the 1930s, he travelled to Greece, Denmark, England, the Czech Republic, France, and Turkey. In 1936 he married Gerda Coste, who gave birth to their son, Hans-Gerd.

After the 1938 [[Anschluss|"Anschluss" with Germany]], he escaped to [[Italy]]. There is no notice if he had obtained his certificate in medicine, because literature and poetry were more attractive to him.<ref name="Lenard"/> His staying in Italy he described as a very productive time for his poetry. At the beginning of the World War II he attempted to join the French Army in Basel as a volunteer but failed to do this. During World World II, he escaped the attention of the Fascist regime by leaving no "paper trail" (identity card, ration card, etc.). He survived by trading his medical services for food and shelter. His leisure hours were spent in the Vatican library, reading texts in Latin until it became a colloquial language to him. He met his second wife, Andrietta Arborio di Gattinara from a noble Italian family, in 1942.<ref name="Lenard"/> His brother Károly presumably died in 1944 in a Nazi labour camp ([[Arbeitslager]]) while his sister settled in England. After the end of the War, his second son, Giovanni Sebastiano, was born in Rome.

In 1952, he emigrated to Brazil, where in 1956 he took part and earned some money in a São Paulo Television program called "The sky is the limit", answering questions about J.S.Bach. Later he settled in the Dona Emma valley, where he bought a small farm with a house he made "invisible" by surrounding it with his favourite trees. He treated the local population medically until his death in 1972.
==Work==
While in Brazil, he tutored the children of a local residents in Latin, and they expressed the wish for something interesting to read. In response, he translated ''Winnie the Pooh'' into Latin, for which he combed the classics for idiomatic expressions used during ancient times. He was working on this translation for about 7 years and could not find a publisher to have this work edited. And at last he published the first copies by his own money.<ref>[https://greatpenformances.wordpress.com/tag/alexander-lenard/Posts Tagged ‘Alexander Lenard’]{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 16 Jan 2018</ref> Privately printed, the book gradually reached larger audiences until it became an international best-seller. He also wrote ([[prose]] and [[poetry]]), and non-fiction such as musical, [[culinary]], [[linguistic]] and medical essays and studies. {{asof|2010}} Two of his original books have been published in English – ''The Valley of the Latin Bear'' (1965), and ''The Fine Art of Roman Cooking'' (1966).
