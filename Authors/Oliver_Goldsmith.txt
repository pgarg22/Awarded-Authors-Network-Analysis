'''Oliver Goldsmith''' (10 November 1728 – 4 April 1774) was an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] novelist, playwright and poet, who is best known for his novel ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766), his pastoral poem ''[[The Deserted Village]]'' (1770), and his plays ''[[The Good-Natur'd Man]]'' (1768) and ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1771, first performed in 1773). He is thought to have written the classic children's tale ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'' (1765).

==Biography==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}
Goldsmith's birth date and year are not known with certainty. According to the [[Library of Congress]] authority file, he told a biographer that he was born on 10 November 1728. The location of his birthplace is also uncertain. He was born either in the [[townland]] of Pallas, near [[Ballymahon]], [[County Longford]], Ireland, where his father was the [[Anglican]] [[curate]] of the parish of [[Forgney]], or at the residence of his maternal grandparents, at the [[Smith Hill (house)|Smith Hill]] House near [[Elphin, County Roscommon|Elphin]] in [[County Roscommon]], where his grandfather Oliver Jones was a clergyman and master of the Elphin diocesan school, and where Oliver studied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sligogrammarschool.org/historyschool.htm|title=History|website=Sligo Grammar School}}</ref> When Goldsmith was two years old, his father was appointed the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the parish of "Kilkenny West" in [[County Westmeath]]. The family moved to the [[rectory|parsonage]] at Lissoy, between [[Athlone]] and Ballymahon, and continued to live there until his father's death in 1747.

In 1744, Goldsmith went up to [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. His tutor was [[Theaker Wilder]]. Neglecting his studies in theology and law, he fell to the bottom of his class. In 1747, along with four other undergraduates, he was expelled for a riot in which they attempted to storm the [[City Marshalsea, Dublin|Marshalsea Prison]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Maurice|title=Dublin 1650–1860|year=1952|publisher=Allen Figgis & Co. Ltd.|page=184}}</ref> He was graduated in 1749 as a Bachelor of Arts, but without the discipline or distinction that might have gained him entry to a profession in the church or the law. His education seemed to have given him mainly a taste for fine clothes, playing cards, singing Irish airs, and playing the flute. He lived for a short time with his mother, tried various professions without success, studied medicine desultorily at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1752 to 1755, and set out on a walking tour of [[Flanders]], France, Switzerland, and [[Northern Italy]], living by his wits (busking with his flute).

He settled in London in 1756, where he briefly held various jobs, including an [[apothecary]]'s assistant and an usher of a school. Perennially in debt and addicted to gambling, Goldsmith produced a massive output as a [[hack writer]] on [[Grub Street]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/brothers-of-the-quill-oliver-goldsmith-in-grub-street-by-norma-clarke-review-1.2629400|title=Brothers of the Quill: Oliver Goldsmith in Grub Street by Norma Clarke review|website=irishtimes.com|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/11/brothers-of-the-quill-oliver-goldsmith-in-grub-street-norma-clarke-review|title=Brothers of the Quill: Oliver Goldsmith in Grub Street by Norma Clarke – review|first=John|last=Mullan|date=11 February 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/oliver-goldsmith-the-most-fascinating-bore-in-literature/|title=Oliver Goldsmith: the most fascinating bore in literature |publisher= The Spectator|date=7 May 2016|website=spectator.co.uk|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/trinitywriters/writers/oliver-goldsmith/|title=Oliver Goldsmith |first=Trinity Writers, Trinity College|last=Dublin|website=www.tcd.ie|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> for the publishers of London, but his few painstaking works earned him the company of [[Samuel Johnson]], with whom he was a founding member of "[[The Club (dining club)|The Club]]". There, through fellow Club member [[Edmund Burke]], he made the acquaintance of Sir George Savile, who would later arrange a job for him at Thornhill Grammar School. The combination of his literary work and his dissolute lifestyle led [[Horace Walpole]] to give him the epithet "inspired idiot". During this period he used the pseudonym "James Willington" (the name of a fellow student at Trinity) to publish his 1758 translation of the autobiography of the [[Huguenot]] [[Jean Marteilhe]].

In his 'Life', Washington Irving states that Goldsmith was between 5'4" and 5'6" in height, not heavily built but quite muscular and with rather plain features. In character he had a lively sense of fun, was totally guileless, and never happier than when in the light-hearted company of children. The money that he sporadically earned was often frittered away or happily given away to the next good cause that presented itself so that any financial security tended to be fleeting and short-lived. Goldsmith's talents were unreservedly recognised by Samuel Johnson, whose patronage – somewhat resented by Boswell – aided his eventual recognition in the literary world and the world of drama.

Goldsmith was described by contemporaries as prone to envy, a congenial but impetuous and disorganised personality who once planned to emigrate to America but failed because he missed his ship. At some point around this time he worked at Thornhill Grammar School, later basing Squire Thornhill (in ''The Vicar of Wakefield'') on his benefactor Sir George Savile and certainly spending time with eminent scientist Rev. John Mitchell, whom he probably knew from London. Mitchell sorely missed good company, which Goldsmith naturally provided in spades. [[Thomas De Quincey]] wrote of him "All the motion of Goldsmith's nature moved in the direction of the true, the natural, the sweet, the gentle".<ref>''De Quincey Writings'' (ed) James Thomas Fields 1850–1855</ref>

His premature death in 1774 may have been partly due to his own misdiagnosis of his kidney infection. Goldsmith was buried in [[Temple Church]] in London. The inscription reads; "HERE LIES/OLIVER GOLDSMITH". A monument was originally raised to him at the site of his burial, but this was destroyed in an air raid in 1941. A monument to him survives in the centre of [[Ballymahon]], also in [[Westminster Abbey]] with an [[epitaph]] written by Samuel Johnson.<ref>''"Oliver Goldsmith: A Poet, Naturalist, and Historian, who left scarcely any style of writing untouched, and touched nothing that he did not adorn. Of all the passions, whether smiles were to move or tears, a powerful yet gentle master. In genius, vivid, versatile, sublime. In style, clear, elevated, elegant."'' Epitaph written by [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson]], translated from the original Latin.</ref>

Among his papers was found the prospectus of an encyclopedia, to be called the ''Universal dictionary of the arts and sciences''. He wished this to be the British equivalent of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and it was to include comprehensive articles by [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] and [[Charles Burney|Dr. Burney]]. The project, however, was not realised due to Goldsmith's death.<ref>Collison Robert Lewis.

== Works ==
{{see also|The Vicar of Wakefield|The Good-Natur'd Man|The Traveller (poem)|She Stoops to Conquer}}

===''The Citizen of the World''===
In 1760 Goldsmith began to publish a series of letters in the ''Public Ledger'' under the title ''The Citizen of the World''. Purportedly written by a Chinese traveller in England by the name of Lien Chi, they used this fictional outsider's perspective to comment ironically and at times moralistically on British society and manners. It was inspired by the earlier essay series ''[[Persian Letters]]'' by [[Montesquieu]].

===''The Hermit''===
Goldsmith wrote this romantic ballad of precisely 160 lines in 1765. The hero and heroine are Edwin, a youth without wealth or power, and Angelina, the daughter of a lord "beside the Tyne". Angelina spurns many wooers, but refuses to make plain her love for young Edwin. "Quite dejected with my scorn", Edwin disappears and becomes a hermit. One day, Angelina turns up at his cell in boy's clothes and, not recognising him, tells him her story. Edwin then reveals his true identity, and the lovers never part again. The poem is notable for its interesting portrayal of a hermit, who is fond of the natural world and his wilderness solitude but maintains a gentle, sympathetic demeanor toward other people. In keeping with eremitical tradition, however, Edwin the Hermit claims to "spurn the [opposite] sex". This poem appears under the title of "A Ballad" sung by the character of Mr. Burchell in Chapter 8 of Goldsmith's novel, ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''.<ref name=Dyachok>Dyachok, Tatyana (2012). ''Oliver Goldsmith's works in the sociocultural context of the Enlightenment''. Master's dissertation, Belarusian State University. pp. 341–342</ref>

===''The Deserted Village''===
{{main|The Deserted Village}}

In the 1760s Goldsmith witnessed the demolition of an ancient village and destruction of its farms to clear land to become a wealthy man's garden. His poem ''The Deserted Village'', published in 1770, expresses a fear that the destruction of villages and the conversion of land from productive agriculture to ornamental [[landscape garden]]s would ruin the [[peasant]]ry.<ref name=Rowley/>

==In popular culture==
Two characters in the 1951 comedy ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' quote the same line from Goldsmith's poem "The Traveller" – a subtle joke, because the film's plot involves the recasting of stolen gold.

During the opening credits of the [[SKY One]] adaptation of Sir [[Terry Pratchett]]'s Christmas-like story "[[The Hogfather]]", a portrait of Goldsmith is shown as part of a hall of memorials to those "inhumed" by the "[[Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild]]".

In the 1925 novel ''[[The Painted Veil (novel)|The Painted Veil]]'' by [[W. Somerset Maugham]], the last words of the poem ''An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog'', "The dog it was that died", are the dying words of bacteriologist Walter Fane, one of the primary characters in the novel. And using the title "Elegy for a Mad Dog" is an episode of Marcus Welby, M.D. (1971, Season 2, Episode 21).

In the [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]] novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'', a central character's house is situated between "Goldsworth" (the name of an estate) and "Wordsmith University." Crossing these two names yields the names of the poets [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and Goldsmith; one of the narrators refers to this as the "witty exchange of syllables invoking the two masters of the heroic couplet."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nabokov |first1=Vladimir |title=Pale Fire |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |isbn=978-0-679-72342-4 |page=82 |edition=1st}}</ref>
