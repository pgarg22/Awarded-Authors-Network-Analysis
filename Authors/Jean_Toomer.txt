'''Jean Toomer''' (born '''Nathan Pinchback Toomer'''; December 26, 1894 &ndash; March 30, 1967) was an American poet and novelist commonly associated with the [[Harlem Renaissance]], though he actively resisted the association, and modernism. His reputation stems from his novel ''[[Cane (novel)|Cane]]'' (1923), which Toomer wrote during and after a stint as a school principal at a black school in rural [[Sparta, Georgia]]. The novel intertwines the stories of six women and includes an apparently autobiographical thread; sociologist [[Charles S. Johnson]] called it "the most astonishingly brilliant beginning of any Negro writer of his generation".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/books/review-cane-jean-toomer.html?emc=edit_bk_20181231&nl=book-review&nlid=2251275320181231&te=1|access-date=January 1, 2019|title=A Century Later, a Novel by an Enigma of the Harlem Renaissance Is Still Relevant|first=Parul|last=Sehgal|author-link=Parul Sehgal|date=December 25, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> He resisted being classified as a Negro writer, as he identified as "American". For more than a decade Toomer was an influential follower and representative of the pioneering spiritual teacher [[G.I. Gurdjieff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-lives-of-jean-toomer/|title=The Lives of Jean Toomer : A Hunger for Wholeness|author=Cynthia Earl Kerman|website=Lsupress.org|access-date=October 28, 2021}}</ref> Later in life he took up Quakerism.

Toomer continued to write poetry, short stories and essays. His first wife died soon after the birth of their daughter. After he married again in 1934, Toomer moved with his family from New York to [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. There he became a member of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (also known as Quakers) and retired from public life. His papers are held by the [[Beinecke Rare Book Library]] at [[Yale University]].

Born Nathan Pinchback Toomer in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1894, the son of Nathan Toomer (1839–1906), a former [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] man and farmer of mixed race, and his third wife Nina Elizabeth Pinchback (1866–1909), whose parents became [[free people of color]] prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leslie |first1=Kent |last2=NGE Staff |title=Amanda America Dickson (1849-1893) |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/amanda-america-dickson-1849-1893 |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia |access-date=25 August 2021}}</ref>

==Ancestry==
His father was born into slavery in [[Chatham County, North Carolina]] and was later sold with members of his family to John Toomer, in [[Houston County, Georgia]] in the 1850s. After the death of John Toomer, his brother Henry Toomer became owner of the family with Nathan assigned to be his personal valet and assistant. Nathan would remained in this position after the Civil War and learned the ways of the [[White race|white]] upper class. He later took his former enslaver's surname, "Toomer" after emancipation.<ref name="amanda">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/amanda-america-dickson-1849-1893 Kent Anderson Leslie, "Amanda America Dickson, (1849–1893)"], History and Archaeology, ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'', 2003/2013</ref>

His father was married three times. His first marriage produced four daughters. After the death of his first wife, Nathan,Sr. married [[Amanda America Dickson]], a former enslaved woman of mixed race whose inheritance from her white father resulted in great wealth. She was called the "wealthiest colored woman in America."<ref name="leslie">[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40582942?uid=3739744&uid=2129&uid=2134&uid=20405288&uid=2&uid=70&uid=3&uid=20405280&uid=3739256&uid=60&sid=21103743117767 Kent Anderson Leslie and Willard B. Gatewood Jr. "'This Father of Mine ... a Sort of Mystery': Jean Toomer's Georgia Heritage"], ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' 77 (winter 1993)</ref> She died intestate in 1893 after about a year of marriage. A legal struggle with her children, which did not end until years after his third marriage, left the senior Nathan with little to no inheritance.<ref name="leslie" /><ref name="amanda" />

In 1893, the now 54 year old widower married 28-year-old Nina Elizabeth Pinchback, another young wealthy young woman of color. She was born in [[New Orleans]] as the third child of Eliza Stewart and politician [[P. B. S. Pinchback]], both who were of mixed heritage. Her father was suspicious of Nathan Toomer and strongly opposed his daughter's choice for marriage, but ultimately acquiesced in her choice.<ref name="leslie" />  Born from this union and named Nathan after his father, he would later use "Jean" as his first name at the start his literary career.

==Early life==
His father soon abandoned his wife and his young son, returning to Georgia seeking to still obtain a portion of his late second wife's estate. Nina divorced him and took back her [[maiden name]] of Pinchback; she and her son returned to live with her parents in [[Washington D.C.]], angered by her husband's abandonment, her father insisted they use another name for her son and started calling him Eugene, after the boy's godfather.<ref name="kerman29">[https://books.google.com/books?id=PD3jxWlrGpQC&q=Marjorie+Content#v=snippet&q=Marjorie%20Content&f=false Cynthia Earl Kerman, ''The Lives of Jean Toomer: A Hunger for Wholeness''], LSU Press, 1989, p. 29</ref> The boy also was given a variety of nicknames by various family members. He would only see his father once more in 1897, prior this death in 1906.<ref name="leslie"/>

As a child in Washington, Jean attended segregated black schools. When his mother remarried and they moved to suburban [[New Rochelle, New York]], the youth attended an all-white school. After his mother's death in 1909, when he was 15, Jean returned to Washington to live with his maternal grandparents. He graduated from the [[M Street High School]], a prestigious academic black high school in the city with a national reputation.<ref name=Poets/>

==Education==
Between 1914 and 1917, Jean attended six institutions of higher education (the [[University of Wisconsin]], the Massachusetts College of Agriculture, the American College of Physical Training in Chicago, the [[University of Chicago]], [[New York University]], and the [[City College of New York]]) studying agriculture, fitness, biology, sociology, and history, but he never completed a degree. His wide readings among prominent contemporary poets and writers, and the lectures he attended during his college years, shaped the direction of his writing.<ref name="MAP-Toomer"/>

==Career==
After leaving college, Toomer returned to Washington, DC. He published some short stories and continued writing during the volatile social period following [[World War I]]. He worked for some months in a shipyard in 1919, then escaped to middle-class life. Labor strikes and [[race riots]] of whites attacking blacks occurred in numerous major industrial cities during the summer of 1919, which became known as [[Red Summer]] as a result. People in the working class were competing after World War I for jobs and housing, and tensions erupted in violence. In [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919|Chicago]] and other places, blacks fought back. At the same time, it was a period of artistic ferment.

Toomer devoted eight months to the study of Eastern philosophies and continued to be interested in this subject.<ref name="MAP-Toomer"/> Some of his early writing was political, and he published three essays from 1919 to 1920 in the prominent [[socialist]] paper ''[[New York Call]]''. His work drew from the socialist and "New Negro" movements of New York.<ref name=ScruggsVan /> Toomer was reading much new American writing, for instance [[Waldo Frank]]'s ''[[Our America]]'' (1919).<ref name=Scruggs /> In 1919, he adopted "Jean Toomer" as his literary name, and it was the way he was known for most of his adult life.<ref name="Kerman 1989 p. 29">Kerman (1989), ''The Lives of Jean Toomer'', p. 29</ref>

By his early adult years, Toomer resisted racial classifications. He wanted to be identified only as an American.<ref name=Poets/><ref name="MAP-Toomer">{{cite web |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/toomer/life.htm |title=Jean Toomer's Life and Career |last1=Jones |first1=Robert B.|work=Modern American Poetry |publisher=Department of English, University of Illinois|location= Urbana-Champaign, Illinois |access-date=29 May 2012}}</ref> Accurately claiming ancestry among seven ethnic and national groups, he gained experience in both white and "colored" societies, and resisted being classified as a Negro writer. He grudgingly allowed his publisher of ''[[Cane (novel)|Cane]]'' to use that term to increase sales, as there was considerable interest in new Negro writers.<ref name="letters">[https://books.google.com/books?id=kJFOJpnheGkC&dq=%27In+the+Land+of+Cotton%27:+Economics+and+Violence+in+Jean+Toomer%27s+Cane,%22+%27%27African+American+Review%27%27&source=gbs_navlinks_s "Introduction," ''The Letters of Jean Toomer, 1919–1924''], University of Tennessee Press, 2006</ref>

As Richard Eldridge has noted, Toomer 
<blockquote>"sought to transcend standard definitions of race. I think he never claimed that he was a white man," Mr. Eldridge said. "He always claimed that he was a representative of a new, emergent race that was a combination of various races. He averred this virtually throughout his life."<ref name="lee">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/books/27cane.html?scp=3&sq=%22jean%20toomer%22&st=cse&_r=0 FELICIA R. LEE, "Scholars Say Chronicler of Black Life Passed for White"], ''New York Times'', 26 December 2010, accessed 27 March 2014</ref> William Andrews has noted he "was one of the first writers to move beyond the idea that any black ancestry makes you black."<ref name="lee"/></blockquote>

In 1921 Toomer took a job for a few months as a principal at a new rural agricultural and [[industrial school]] for blacks in [[Sparta, Georgia]]. Southern schools were continuing to recruit teachers from the North, although they had also trained generations of teachers since the Civil War. The school was in the center of [[Hancock County, Georgia|Hancock County]] and the [[Black Belt (Georgia)|Black Belt]] 100 miles southeast of Atlanta, near where his father had lived. Exploring his father's roots in Hancock County, Toomer learned that he sometimes [[racial passing|passed for white]].<ref name="leslie"/> Seeing the life of rural blacks, accompanied by [[racial segregation]] and virtual labor [[peonage]] in the [[Deep South]], led Toomer to identify more strongly as an [[African American]] and with his father's past.

Several [[lynching]]s of black men took place in Georgia during 1921 and 1922, as whites continued to violently enforce [[white supremacy]]. In 1908 the state had ratified a constitution that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites by raising barriers to voter registration. Other former Confederate states had passed similar laws since 1890, led by Mississippi, and they maintained such disenfranchisement essentially into the late 1960s. That exclusion was challenged and eventually overcome after  Congress passed laws to enforce constitutional voting rights.

By Toomer's time, the state was suffering labor shortages due to thousands of rural blacks leaving in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest. Trying to control their movement, the legislature passed laws to prevent outmigration. It also established high license fees for Northern employers recruiting labor in the state. Planters feared losing their pool of cheap labor. This period was a formative experience for Toomer; he started writing about it while still in Georgia and, while living in Hancock County, submitted the long story "Georgia Night" to the socialist magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'' in New York.<ref name=ScruggsVan /><ref name=Poets>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/71 "Jean Toomer"], Poets.org, accessed 27 Dec 2010</ref>

Toomer returned to New York, where he became friends with [[Waldo Frank]]. They had an intense friendship through 1923, and Frank served as his mentor and editor on his novel ''Cane.''<ref name="Scruggs" /> The two men came to have strong differences.<ref>''Brother Mine: The Correspondence of Jean Toomer and Waldo Frank'', Edited by Kathleen Pfeiffer, Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2010</ref>

=== ''Cane'' ===
During Toomer's time as principal of Sparta Agricultural and Industrial Institute in Georgia, he wrote stories, sketches, and poems drawn from his experience there. These formed the basis for ''Cane'', his [[Modernist literature|High Modernist]] novel published in 1923. ''Cane'' was well received by both black and white critics. ''Cane'' was celebrated by well-known African-American critics and artists, including [[Claude McKay]], [[Nella Larsen]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Wallace Thurman]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''Cane'' is structured in three parts. The first third of the book is devoted to the black experience in the Southern farmland. The second part of ''Cane'' is more urban and concerned with Northern life. The conclusion of the work is a prose piece entitled "Kabnis." People would call Toomer's ''Cane'' a mysterious brand of Southern psychological realism that has been matched only in the best work of [[William Faulkner]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Toomer is the first poet to unite folk culture and the elite culture of the white avant-garde.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The book was reissued in 1969, two years after Toomer's death. ''Cane'' has been assessed since the late 20th century as also an "analysis of class and caste", with "secrecy and [[miscegenation]] as major themes of the first section".<ref name="ScruggsVan" /> He had conceived it as a short-story cycle, in which he explores the tragic intersection of female sexuality, black manhood, and industrial modernization in the South. Toomer acknowledged the influence of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'' (1919) as his model, in addition to other influential works of that period. He also appeared to have absorbed ''[[The Waste Land]]'' of [[T. S. Eliot]] and considered him to be one of the American group of writers he wanted to join, "artists and intellectuals who were engaged in renewing American society at its multi-cultural core."<ref name="Scruggs">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_1_36/ai_85185735/ Charles Scruggs, ''Jean Toomer and the Harlem Renaissance'' - book review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514003306/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_1_36/ai_85185735 |date=2008-05-14 }}, ''African American Review,'' Spring, 2002, accessed 15 January 2011</ref> 
[[File:Jean Toomer passport 1926.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jean Toomer's passport (1926)]]

Many scholars have considered ''Cane'' to be Toomer's best work.<ref name="PF">{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/jean-toomer|title=Jean Toomer|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date=28 October 2021|website=Poetryfoundation.org|access-date=28 October 2021}}</ref> ''Cane'' was hailed by critics and has been considered as an important work of both the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and Modernism. But Toomer resisted racial classification and did not want to be marketed as a Negro writer. As he wrote to his publisher [[Horace Liveright]], "My racial composition and my position in the world are realities that I alone may determine."<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20078269 Harmon, Charles. " 'Cane,' Race, and 'Neither/Norism'"], ''Southern Literary Journal'', 2000 Spring; 32(2): 90–101, accessed 15 January 2011.</ref> Toomer found it more difficult to get published throughout the 1930s, the period of the [[Great Depression]], as did many authors.

===Later work===
In the 1920s, Toomer and Frank were among many Americans who became deeply interested in the work of the spiritual leader [[George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff]], from the Russian Empire, who had a lecture tour in the United States in 1924. That year, and in 1926 and 1927, Toomer went to France for periods of study with Gurdjieff, who had settled at [[Fontainebleau]]. He was a student of Gurdjieff until the mid-1930s.<ref name="MAP-Toomer" /> Much of his writing from this period on was related to his spiritual quest and featured allegories. He no longer explored African-American characters. Some scholars have attributed Toomer's artistic silence to his ambivalence about his identity in a culture insistent on forcing binary racial distinctions.<ref name="lee" /> [[Wallace Thurman]], Dorothy Peterson, [[Aaron Douglas (artist)|Aaron Douglas]], and [[Nella Larsen]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/hughesl-bigsea/hughesl-bigsea-00-h-dir/hughesl-bigsea-00-h.html#chapter0303|title = The Big Sea by Langston Hughes|website=Gutenberg.ca}}</ref> along with [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and [[George Schuyler]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/2000/04/09/in-harmony-with-the-music-of-gurdjieff/2ca3661a-c74b-4a0d-bcbb-a08645d1d337/|title=In Harmony With the Music of Gurdjieff|website=Washingtonpost.com}}</ref> were among those known to have been Toomer’s students in the Gurdjieff work during this period.

Toomer continued with his spiritual exploration by traveling to India in 1939. Later he studied the psychology developed by [[Carl Jung]], the mystic [[Edgar Cayce]], and the [[Church of Scientology]], but reverted to Gurdjieff's philosophy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jean-toomer-37322|title=Jean Toomer Biography|website=Biography.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks|access-date=February 23, 2016}}</ref>

Toomer wrote a small amount of fiction in this later period. Mostly he published essays in Quaker publications during these years. He devoted most of his time to serving on Quaker committees for community service and working with high school students.<ref name="NGE">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1241&hl=y Keith Hulett, "Jean Toomer"], ''New Georgia Encyclopedia Library'', accessed 8 February 2011</ref>

His last literary work published during his lifetime was ''Blue Meridian'', a long poem extolling "the potential of the American race".<ref name="NGE" /> He stopped writing for publication after 1950. He continued to write for himself, including several autobiographies and a poetry volume, ''The Wayward and the Seeking''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rehin|first=George|date=1990-01-01|title=Review of ''Cane,'' ''The Collected Poems of Jean Toomer,'' ''The Lives of Jean Toomer: A Hunger for Wholeness''|journal=Journal of American Studies|volume=24|issue=1|pages=138–139|doi=10.1017/S0021875800028929|jstor=27555288}}</ref> He died in 1967 after several years of poor health.<ref name="MAP-Toomer" />

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Jean Toomer, Margery Latimer.jpg|thumb|right|180px|alt=Toomer and Latimer|Jean Toomer and Margery Latimer]]
In 1931 Toomer married the writer [[Margery Latimer]] in Wisconsin. During their travels on the West Coast following their marriage, their marriage was covered in sensational terms by a Hearst reporter. An anti-[[miscegenation]] scandal broke, incorporating rumors about the commune they had organized earlier that year in Portage, Wisconsin. West Coast and Midwest press outlets were aroused and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine sent a reporter to interview them. Toomer was criticized violently by some for marrying a European-American woman.<ref name="time">{{cite magazine| magazine=Time| title=Races: Just Americans| date=March 28, 1932| volume=19| issue=13| pages=21}}</ref><ref name="curwood75">[https://books.google.com/books?id=CsF0gBhQdbcC&dq=obituary+Margery+Latimer+-+NY+Times&q=Jean+Toomer#v=snippet&q=Jean%20Toomer&f=false Anastasia Carol Curwood, ''Stormy Weather: Middle-Class African American Marriages between the Two World Wars''], University of North Carolina Press, 2010, p. 75</ref>

Latimer was a respected young writer known for her first two novels and short stories. Diagnosed with a heart leak, she suffered a hemorrhage and died in childbirth in August 1932, when their first child was born. Toomer named their only daughter Margery in his wife's memory.

In 1934 the widower Toomer married a second time, to [[Marjorie Content]], a New York photographer. She was the daughter of Harry and Ada Content, a wealthy German-Jewish family. Her father was a successful stockbroker.<ref name="curwood"/>

Marjorie Content had been married and divorced three times. Because Toomer was a noted writer and Content was white, this marriage also attracted notice. In 1940 the Toomers moved to [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. There he formally joined the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and began to withdraw from society. Toomer wrote extensively from 1935 to 1940 about relationships between the genders, influenced by his Gurdjieff studies, as well as [[Jung]]ian psychology.<ref name="curwood">Curwood (2010), ''Stormy Weather'', pp. 74–79</ref> He had fundamentally traditional views about men and women, which he put in symbolic terms.

In 1939 Toomer changed his name again, using "Nathan Jean Toomer", to emphasize that he was male. He may also have been reaching toward his paternal ancestry by this action. He usually signed his name N. Jean Toomer, and continued to be called "Jean" by friends.<ref name="Kerman 1989 p. 29"/>

==Racial issues==
Toomer was majority white in ancestry and his appearance was "racially indeterminate".<ref name="lee"/> As noted above, he lived in both black and white societies as he was growing up and during his life. He did not want to be bound by race and identified as an "American", representing a new mixed culture. Given his wide experiences, he resisted being classified as a Negro writer. But, his most enduring work was ''Cane'', was inspired by his time in the rural South and the imaginative exploration of the early African-American world of his absent father.

In preparing a new edition of that work, scholars [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] and Rudolph P. Byrd said in 2010 that, based on their research, they believe that Toomer [[passing (racial identity)|passed for white]] at periods in his life. He never claimed to be white or black, saying that he was simply an American.<ref name="lee"/>
<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2010/12/30/132488862/A-New-Look-At-The-Life-Of-Jean-Toomer "A new look at the life of Jean Toomer"] ''[[NPR]]'', (Robert Siegel and Professor Byrd), 30 December 2010. (Transcript and audio, 5 mins)</ref> They note that in the 1920 and 1930 censuses he was classified as white. (At that time, such data was provided by the census taker, often based on an individual's appearance, economic class, area of residence, neighbors, etc.) Toomer twice had been classified (or registered) as Negro, in draft registrations in 1917 and 1942. When Toomer married Margery Latimer, a European-American woman, in Wisconsin in 1931, the license noted both as white.<ref name="lee"/> Other scholars disagree with Gates' and Byrd's interpretation of this documentation, while acknowledging that Toomer tried to stretch racial boundaries. William Andrews said, "If people didn’t ask," he said, "I expect he didn’t tell."<ref name="lee"/>

Jean Toomer avoided identifying with clear categories of race. Instead, he wanted to be classified only as “American.”<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://amistadresearchcenter.tulane.edu/archon/?p=collections/findingaid&id=96&q=&rootcontentid=85053#id85053|title=Gorham B.

In his early twenties, he attended meetings of the Religious Society of Friends in Doylestown, a Quaker group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/toomer/life.htm|title=Jean Toomer's Life and Career|last=Jones|first=Robert B.|date=1999|website=Modern American Poetry|agency=American National Biography|access-date=August 20, 2018}}</ref> Later he joined a meeting group there.

Quakerism connects groups of different believers under the respect for everyone’s belief of a creed. They encourage each other to be able to understand themselves and their own personalities. Jean Toomer’s Quaker belief connects to his writings on the place of the African American in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://quakerinfo.org/quakerism/beliefs|title=What Do Quakers Believe? |date=May 26, 2011|publisher=Quaker Information Center |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref> He also wrote essays on [[George Fox]] and Quakerism. In his essay, “The Negro Emergent,” Toomer describes how African Americans were able to rise from those past identifications when they were portrayed only as slaves. He said they were working to find a voice for themselves.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jean Toomer: Selected Essays and Literary Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6oOGp19fSVkC&pg=PA47 |author=edited by Robert B.
