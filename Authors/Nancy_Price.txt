'''Nancy Price''', [[CBE]] (3 February 1880 – 31 March 1970), was an English [[actress]] on stage and screen, [[author]] and [[theatre director]]. Her acting career began in a [[repertory]] theatre company before progressing to the London stage, silent films, [[sound film|talkies]] and finally television. In addition to appearing on stage she became involved in theatre production and was a founder of the [[People's National Theatre (founded 1930)|People's National Theatre]].

== Personal life ==
Christened '''Lilian Nancy Bache Price''' in [[Kinver]], [[Staffordshire]], England, in 1880, Nancy was the daughter of William Henry Price (a retired farmer) and Sarah Mannix. Her mother was the granddaughter of Sir Henry Mannix. After schooling in her home village and then in nearby [[Malvern Wells]] she decided at an early age to become an actress. She married the actor Charles Maude on 17 May 1907, and they were together until his death in 1943. They had two daughters [[Joan Maude]] and Elizabeth Maude. Joan, Elizabeth, and Elizabeth's  daughter [[Jennifer Phipps]] all went on to become actresses.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia|url = http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Phipps%2C%20Jennifer|website = www.canadiantheatre.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}</ref> Soon after Charles and Nancy's daughters were born, they made the village of [[Findon, West Sussex|Findon]] in Sussex her home, living in a cottage called 'Arcana' in Heather Lane on the [[South Downs|Downs]].

She also wrote many books, including her Autobiography, 'The Gull's Way'.
At one time she managed the 'Little Theatre' in the Adelphi, off the Strand.

Findon remained her home until her death in 1970.

== Theatre career ==
Nancy joined [[F.R. Benson]]'s theatre company whilst still at school. The company specialised in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays and toured extensively in the provinces. Her first big break came when she caught the attention of [[Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], who cast her as Calypso in [[Stephen Phillips]]'s production of ''Ulysses'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], London in 1902, a role in which she enjoyed great success.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hartnoll|first=Phyllis|author2=Peter Found|title=The Concise Oxford companion to the theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/conciseoxfordcom0000unse_w9v4/page/392 392]|isbn=978-0-19-866136-8|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxfordcom0000unse_w9v4/page/392}}</ref> The part of Hilda Gunning was written for her by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] in ''Letty'' (1904),<ref>{{cite book |title=Into An Hour Glass |author=Price, Nancy |publisher=Museum Press |location=London | year=1953|page=185 }}</ref> a role in which the theatre critic [[J. T. Grein]] said: "In Letty, while others enhanced their fame, Miss Nancy Price, in the part of Hilda, the shop-girl, made her name. If we read the character aright, Miss Price realised it well-nigh to perfection".<ref>{{cite book | title=Dramatic Criticism (Volume 5) | author=J.T. Grein | publisher=General Books LLC | location=London | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-153-97084-6}}</ref> In 1909 she appeared as Mrs. D'Aquila in [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance's]] production of ''[[The Whip (play)|The Whip]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. She joined [[Edith Craig|Edith Craig's]] Pioneer Players at the [[Novelty Theatre|Kingsway Theatre]] in 1911 for a performance of [[Christabel Marshall|Christopher St. John's]] ''The First Actress''. In March 1912, she appeared as India in [[Sir Edward Elgar]]'s Imperial Masque ''[[The Crown of India]]'' at the [[London Coliseum]].

Together with the Dutch-born theatre impresario [[J.T. Grein]], Nancy Price founded the [[People's National Theatre (founded 1930)|People's National Theatre]] in 1930. Their first production was ''The Man from Blankleys'' by [[Thomas Anstey Guthrie|F. Anstey]] at the [[Fortune Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Fortune.htm The Fortune Theatre, Russell Street, London, WC2]. arthurlloyd.co.uk</ref> When Grein left the company Nancy became its honorary director, and in 1932 a permanent home was found at the [[Little Theatre in the Adelphi]] with Nancy as manager. The enterprise came to an end with the destruction of the theatre in 1941.<ref>{{cite book|last= Stanton |first= Sarah |author2=Martin Banham |title=Cambridge paperback guide to theatre|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|page=282|isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC&q=nancy+price| accessdate=10 September 2011 }}</ref> During this period, Nancy established the English School Theatre Movement, which toured productions of Shakespeare plays to [[working class]] children.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gale, Maggie Barbara.|title=West End women: women and the London stage, 1918–1962|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|page=64|isbn=0-415-08495-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1F_KttO7Gh8C&q=nancy+price+actress&pg=PA64| accessdate=10 September 2011 }}</ref>
