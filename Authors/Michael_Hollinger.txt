{{short description|American playwright (born 1962)}}
'''Michael Hollinger''' (born January 13, 1962 in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] who is currently an associate professor of theatre at [[Villanova University]] and an alumnus of [[New Dramatists]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070706030440/http://www.newdramatists.org/ndhome.htm New Dramatists]</ref> He received a Bachelor of Music in [[viola]] performance from [[Oberlin Conservatory]] in 1984 and a Master of Arts in theatre from Villanova in 1989. He has been married to Megan Bellwoar since 1990.

Because of his background as a musician, Hollinger considers his plays compositions. He is quoted as saying, "Plays are music to me; characters are instruments, scenes are movements; tempo, rhythm and dynamics are critical; and melody and counterpoint are always set in relief by rests—beats, pauses, the spaces in between."{{sfn|Baker|2007}}

Hollinger has written three short films for [[PBS]] and co-authored the feature-length ''Philadelphia Diary''.  His awards include the Roger L. Stevens Award from the Fund for New American Plays, three Barrymore Awards for Outstanding New Play, a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award, the F. Otto Haas Award for an Emerging Theatre Artist, a Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award, a commission from The Ensemble Studio Theatre/Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science and Technology Project, and fellowships from the Independence Foundation, Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation, and Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.
