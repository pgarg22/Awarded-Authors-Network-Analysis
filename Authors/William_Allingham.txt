'''William Allingham''' (19 March 1824{{snd}}18 November 1889) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] poet, diarist and editor. He wrote several volumes of lyric verse, and his poem 'The Faeries' was much anthologised; but he is better known for his posthumously published ''Diary'',<ref>''William Allingham: a Diary''; edited by H. Allingham and D. Radford (1907 and reprints)</ref> in which he records his lively encounters with Tennyson, Carlyle and other writers and artists. His wife, [[Helen Allingham]], was a well-known [[watercolourist]] and illustrator.<ref name="English 1995 p. 18">I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 18</ref>

==Biography==
William Allingham was born on 19 March 1824 in [[Ballyshannon]], a small town in the south of [[County Donegal]] in [[Ulster]] in the north of [[Ireland]], which is now in the Republic of Ireland; he was the son of the manager of a local bank who was of English descent.<ref name="Literature 1 1971 p. 19">D. Daiches ed., ''The Penguin Companion to Literature 1'' (1971) p. 19</ref> His younger brothers and sisters were Catherine (born 1826), John (born 1827), Jane (born 1829), Edward (born 1831, and lived only a few months) and a still-born brother (born 1833). During his childhood his parents moved twice within the town, where the boy enjoyed the country sights and gardens, learned to paint and listened to his mother's piano-playing. When he was nine, his mother died.<ref>H. Allingham and D. Radford (eds), ''William Allingham, A Diary'' (1907)</ref>

He was educated at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] until the age of 14,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Book of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution|last=Robb|first=John|publisher=McCaw, Stevenson & Orr|year=1913|location=Belfast|pages=170}}</ref> when he obtained a post in the [[custom-house]] of his native town, and held several similar posts in Ireland and England until 1870.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Allingham, William|volume=1|page=696}}</ref> During this period were published his ''Poems'' (1850; which included his well-known poem, 'The Fairies') and ''Day and Night Songs'' (1855; illustrated by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and others).  ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]'s ''Letters to Allingham'' (1854–1870), edited by [[George Birkbeck Norman Hill|Dr. Birkbeck Hill]], were published in 1897.) ''Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland'', his most ambitious, though not his most successful work, a narrative poem illustrative of Irish social questions, appeared in 1864.<ref name="EB1911"/>  He also edited ''The Ballad Book'' for the ''Golden Treasury'' series in 1864, and ''Fifty Modern Poems'' in 1865.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In April 1870 Allingham retired from the customs service, moved to London and became sub-editor of ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', eventually becoming editor in succession to [[James Froude]] in June 1874, a post he would hold till 1879.<ref name="English 1995 p. 18"/> On 22 August 1874 he married the illustrator, Helen Paterson, who was twenty-four years younger than he. His wife gave up her work as an illustrator and would become well known under her married name as a water-colour painter.<ref name="EB1911"/> At first the couple lived in London, at 12 Trafalgar Square, Chelsea, near Allingham's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], and it was there that they had their first two children: Gerald Carlyle (born 1875 November) and Eva Margaret (born 1877 February). In 1877 appeared Allingham's ''Songs, Poems and Ballads''. In 1881, after the death of Carlyle, the Allinghams moved to Sandhills near [[Witley]] in Surrey, where their third child, Henry William, was born in 1882. At this period Allingham published ''Evil May Day'' (1883), ''Blackberries'' (1884) and ''Irish Songs and Poems'' (1887).

[[John George Adair]] was known for the evictions of forty-seven families in Derryveagh, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1861. Overnight, 244 men, women and children were evicted from their homes and left to wander the roads seeking shelter. This terrible event earned him the title "Black Jack Adair".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Derryveagh Evictions – 'Black Jack Adair|url=https://ireland-calling.com/derryveagh-evictions-cruelty-of-black-jack-adair/|access-date=2020-12-27|website=Ireland Calling|language=en-gb}}</ref> It triggered William Allingham to write the poem ''The Eviction''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://internetpoem.com/william-allingham/the-eviction-poem/|title=The Eviction Poem by William Allingham|website=internetpoem.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/E850006-001/text019.html|title=Part 19 of Poems by William Allingham|website=celt.ucc.ie}}</ref><ref name="irishevents4u">{{Cite web|title=John George Adair.|url=http://irishevents4u.com/Ireland/people/adair-john-george.htm|access-date=2020-12-27|website=irishevents4u.com}}</ref>

In 1888, because of William's declining health, they moved back to the capital, to the heights of [[Hampstead]] village. But in 1889, on 18 November, William died at Hampstead.  According to his wishes he was cremated. His ashes are interred at St. Anne's church in his native Ballyshannon.

Posthumously Allingham's ''Varieties in Prose'' was published in 1893. ''William Allingham A Diary'', edited by Mrs Helen Allingham and D. Radford, was published in 1907. It contains Allingham's reminiscences of [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and other writers and artists.

==Assessment and influence==

Working on an un-ostentatious scale, Allingham produced much lyrical and descriptive poetry, and the best of his pieces are thoroughly national in spirit and local colouring.<ref name="EB1911"/> His verse is clear, fresh, and graceful. His best-known poem remains his early work, "The Faeries".<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-fairies-enhanced-edition/id531867633?mt=11 ''The Fairies''], multimedia eBook.</ref>

Allingham had a substantial influence on [[W.B. Yeats]];<ref name="Literature 1 1971 p. 19"/> while the [[Ulster]] poet [[John Hewitt (poet)|John Hewitt]] felt Allingham's impact keenly, and attempted to revive his reputation by editing, and writing an introduction to, ''The Poems of William Allingham ''(Oxford University Press/ Dolmen Press, 1967).  Allingham's wide-ranging anthology of poetry, ''Nightingale Valley'' (1862) was the inspiration for the 1923 collection ''[[Walter de la Mare#''Come Hither''|Come Hither]]'' by Walter de la Mare.<ref>T Whistler, ''Imagination of the Heart'' (1993) p. 322</ref>

''We daren't go a-hunting/For fear of little men...'' was quoted by the character of The Tinker near the beginning of the movie ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', as well as in [[Mike Mignola]]'s comic book short story ''[[Hellboy: The Corpse]]'', plus the 1973 horror film ''[[Don't Look in the Basement]]''. The lines ''Up the airy mountain/Down the rushy glen...'' form part of the character [[Magrat]]'s internal monologue in the [[Discworld]] novel ''Lords and Ladies''. Several lines of the poem are quoted by Henry Flyte, a character in issue No. 65 of the ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' comic book, August 2011. This same poem was quoted in Andre Norton's 1990 science fiction novel ''Dare To Go A-Hunting'' ({{ISBN|0-812-54712-8}}).

''Up the Airy Mountain'' is the title of a short story by [[Debra Doyle]] and [[James D. Macdonald]]; while the working title of [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[The Wee Free Men]]'' was "For Fear of Little Men".

The Allingham Arms Hotel in [[Bundoran]], [[Co. Donegal]] is named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allinghamarmshotel.ie/ |title=Allingham Arms Hotel &#124; Bundoran |publisher=Allinghamarmshotel.ie |date=2013-11-21 |access-date=2014-04-01}}</ref>
