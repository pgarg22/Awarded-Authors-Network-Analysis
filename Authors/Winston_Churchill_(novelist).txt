'''Winston Churchill''' (November 10, 1871 – March 12, 1947) was an American best-selling novelist of the early 20th century.

He is nowadays overshadowed, even as a writer, by the more famous [[Winston Churchill|British statesman of the same name]], to whom he was not related.

==Early life==
Churchill was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the son of Edward Spalding Churchill by his marriage to Emma Bell Blaine. He attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]] in Missouri and the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he graduated in 1894. At the Naval Academy, he was conspicuous in scholarship and also in general student activities. He became an expert fencer and he organized at Annapolis the first eight-oared [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], which he captained for two years. After graduation he became an editor of the ''[[Army and Navy Journal]]''. He resigned from the [[United States Navy|navy]] to pursue a writing career. In 1895, he became managing editor of the ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]'', but in less than a year he retired from that, to have more time for writing.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Churchill, Winston}}</ref> While he would be most successful as a [[novelist]], he was also a published [[poet]] and [[essayist]].

==Career==
His first novel to appear in book form was ''The Celebrity'' (1898). However, ''[[Mr. Keegan's Elopement]]'' had been published in 1896 as a magazine serial and was republished as an illustrated hardback book in 1903. Churchill's next novel—''[[Richard Carvel]]'' (1899) — was a phenomenal success. The novel was the third best-selling work of American fiction in 1899 and eighth-best in 1900, according to Alice Hackett's ''70 Years of Best Sellers''. It sold some two million copies in a nation of only 76 million people, and made Churchill rich. His other commercially successful novels included  ''The Crisis'' (1901), ''The Crossing'' (1904), ''Coniston'' (1906), ''Mr. Crewe's Career'' (1908) and ''The Inside of the Cup'' (1913), all of which ranked first on the best-selling American novel list in the years indicated.<ref>Alice Hackett's ''70 Years of Best Sellers'', pp 95-110</ref>

Churchill's early novels were historical, but his later works were set in contemporary America.  He often sought to include his political ideas into his novels.

In 1898, a mansion designed by [[Charles A. Platt|Charles Platt]] was built for Churchill in [[Cornish, New Hampshire|Cornish]], New Hampshire. In 1899, Churchill moved there and named it [[Harlakenden|Harlakenden House]].  The house was also used as the summer home of Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1915 (he leased it from Churchill). He became involved in the [[Cornish Art Colony]] and went into politics, being elected to the state legislature in 1903 and 1905.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=CHURCHILL, Winston|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA335}}</ref> In 1906 he unsuccessfully sought the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] nomination for [[List of New Hampshire Governors|governor of New Hampshire]]. In 1912, he was nominated as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]] candidate for governor but did not win the election and did not seek public office again. In 1917, he toured the battlefields of [[World War I]] and wrote about what he saw, his first non-fiction work.

Sometime after the move to Cornish, he took up painting in watercolors and became known for his landscapes. Some of his works are in the collections of the [[Hood Museum of Art]] (part of [[Hopkins Center for the Arts]] at [[Dartmouth College]]) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], New Hampshire, and the [[Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site]] in [[Cornish, New Hampshire|Cornish]], New Hampshire.

In 1919, Churchill decided to stop writing and withdrew from public life. As a result of this he was gradually forgotten by the public. In 1923, Harlakenden House burned down.  The Churchills moved to an 1838 Federal estate, part of the Cornish Colony called Windfield House (now called Hillside) at 23 Freeman Road in Plainfield, NH, furnishing it with items saved from the fire.<ref>[http://www.cowhampshireblog.com/2008/02/16/the-american-winston-churchill-1871-1947/ The American Winston Churchill 1871-1947]</ref>  In 1940, ''The Uncharted Way'', his first book in twenty years, was published. The book examined Churchill's thoughts on religion. He did not seek to publicize the book and it received little attention. Shortly before his death he said, "It is very difficult now for me to think of myself as a writer of novels, as all that seems to belong to another life."

==Death==
Churchill died in [[Winter Park, Florida]], in 1947 of a heart attack.  He was predeceased in 1945 by his wife of fifty years, the former Mabel Harlakenden Hall.<ref name="spouse1">(28 May 1945).

Churchill and his wife had three children, including their son Creighton Churchill, a well-known writer on wines.<ref name="cray1">(1 December 1984).

==The British statesman==
In the 1890s, Churchill's writings first came to be confused with those of the British writer with the same name. At that time, the American was the much better known of the two, and it was the Englishman who wrote to his American counterpart about the confusion their names were causing among their readers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dockter|first=Warren|title=The Tale of Two Winstons|journal=The Historian|date=Oct 2011|volume=111|pages=10–13|url=https://cambridge.academia.edu/AWarrenDockter}}</ref>

They agreed that the British Churchill should adopt the [[pen name]] "Winston Spencer Churchill", using his full [[surname]], "Spencer-Churchill". After a few early editions this was abbreviated to "[[Winston Churchill as writer|Winston S. Churchill]]"—which remained the British Churchill's pen name. The two men arranged to meet on two occasions when one of them happened to be in the other's country, but were never closely acquainted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two Winston Churchills|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19401019&id=QJZVAAAAIBAJ&pg=4893,3645349|work=The Age|date=19 October 1940|access-date=25 October 2013|via=Google News}}</ref>

Their lives had some other coincidental parallels. They both gained their tertiary education at service colleges and briefly served (during the same period) as officers in their respective countries' armed forces (one was a naval, the other an army officer). Both Churchills were keen amateur painters, as well as writers. Both were also politicians, although here the comparison is far more tenuous, the British Churchill's political career being far more illustrious.<ref>{{cite book|title=My Early Life – 1874–1904|last=Churchill|first=Winston|chapter=Oldham|date=11 May 2010|isbn=9781439125069|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2EK2khQWfsC&q=%22mr.+winston+churchill+makes+haste+to+add%22&pg=PA218|access-date=25 October 2013|via=Google Books}}</ref>
