'''Ginés Pérez de Hita''' (1544? &ndash; 1619?) was a Spanish [[novelist]] and [[poet]], born at [[Mula, Spain|Mula]] ([[Murcia]]) about the middle of the 16th century.

It is likely that he joined the [[Morisco revolt|campaign against the "Moriscos" in the Alpujarra]] in 1560.

==''Guerras civiles de Granada''==
He owes his wide celebrity to the ''Historia de los bandos de los Zegríes y Abencerrajes'' (1595–1619), better known as the ''Guerras civiles de [[Granada]]'', which purports to be a chronicle based on an Arabic original ascribed to a certain Aben-Hamin.

Abed-Hamin is a fictitious character, and the "Wars of Granada" is, in reality, a [[historical novel]], perhaps the earliest example of its kind, and certainly the first historical novel that attained popularity.

In the first part, the events which led to the downfall of [[Granada]] are related with uncommon brilliancy, and Pérez de Hita's sympathetic transcription of life at the [[Emir]]'s court has clearly suggested the conventional presentation of the picturesque, chivalrous [[Moors|Moor]] in the pages of Mlle de [[Madeleine de Scudéry|Scudéry]], Mme de [[Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette|Lafayette]], [[Châteaubriand]] and [[Washington Irving]].

The second part is concerned with the author's personal experiences and the treatment is effective; yet, though [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]]'s play, ''Amar después de la muerte'', is derived from it, this less picturesque second part has never enjoyed the vogue or influence of the first. The exact date of Pérez de Hita's death is unknown. His [[blank verse]] rendering of the ''Crónica Troyana'', written in 1596, exists in manuscript.
