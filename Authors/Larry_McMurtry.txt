'''Larry Jeff McMurtry''' (June 3, 1936{{spnd}}March 25, 2021) was an American novelist, essayist, bookseller, and screenwriter whose work was predominantly set in either the [[American frontier|Old West]] or contemporary [[Texas]].<ref name="Rawson">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_15.shtml Hugh Rawson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829172935/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_15.shtml |date=August 29, 2008 }} "Screenings," ''American Heritage'', April/May 2006.</ref> His novels included ''[[Horseman, Pass By]]'' (1962), ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1966), and ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1975), which were adapted into films. Films adapted from McMurtry's works earned 34 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations (13 wins).

His 1985 [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize-winning]] novel, ''[[Lonesome Dove]],'' was adapted into a television miniseries that earned 18 [[Emmy Award]] nominations (seven wins). The subsequent three novels in his [[Lonesome Dove series|''Lonesome Dove'' series]] were adapted as three more miniseries, earning eight more Emmy nominations. McMurtry and cowriter [[Diana Ossana]] adapted the screenplay for ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), which earned eight Academy Award nominations with three wins, including McMurtry and Ossana for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. In 2014, McMurtry received the [[National Humanities Medal]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Larry McMurtry|url=https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/larry-mcmurtry|access-date=December 9, 2020|website=The National Endowment for the Humanities|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
McMurtry was born in [[Archer City, Texas]], 25 miles from [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], the son of Hazel Ruth ([[married and maiden names|née]] McIver) and William Jefferson McMurtry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Larry-Jeff-McMurtry.html|title=Larry (Jeff) McMurtry Biography (1936-)|website=www.filmreference.com}}</ref> He grew up on his parents' ranch outside Archer City. The city was the model for the town of Thalia which is a setting for much of his fiction.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Life After 'The Last Picture Show' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/magazine/new-life-after-the-last-picture-show.html |work=The New York Times |date=April 4, 1982}}</ref> He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of North Texas]] in 1958 and a Master of Arts from [[Rice University]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Judkins|first1=Julie|date=June 3, 2015|title=Happy birthday to our distinguished alumni Larry McMurtry!|url=https://blogs.library.unt.edu/unt125/2015/06/03/happy-birthday-to-our-distinguished-alumni-larry-mcmurtry/|publisher=UNT Special Collections|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Falk |first1=Jeff |title=Rice alum, author Larry McMurtry receives National Humanities Medal |url=https://news.rice.edu/2015/09/03/rice-alum-author-larry-mcmurtry-receives-national-humanities-medal/ |publisher=Rice University |date=September 3, 2015}}</ref>

In his memoir, McMurtry said that during his first five or six years in his grandfather's ranch house, there were no books, but his extended family would sit on the front porch every night and tell stories. In 1942, when his cousin Robert Hilburn was on his way to enlist for World War II, he stopped by the ranch house and left a box containing 19 boys' adventure books from the 1930s. The first book he read was ''Sergeant Silk: The Prairie Scout''.<ref>{{cite book |last=McMurtry |first=Larry  |date=2008 |title=Books: A Memoir |pages=1–8}}</ref>

==Career==

===Writer===
During the 1960–1961 academic year, McMurtry was a Wallace Stegner Fellow at the [[Stanford University]] Creative Writing Center, where he studied the craft of fiction under [[Frank O'Connor]] and [[Malcolm Cowley]],<ref name="MothJon_">{{Cite web |title=Novelist Larry McMurtry's last kind words: "Lonesome Dove" author on closeted cowboys, pointless Pulitzers, and his latest Old West novel. |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=May 2014 |access-date=March 27, 2021 |url= https://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/05/larry-mcmurtry-brokeback-mountain-last-kind-words/ }}</ref> alongside other aspiring writers, including [[Wendell Berry]], [[Ken Kesey]], [[Peter S.

McMurtry and Kesey remained friends after McMurtry left California and returned to Texas to take a year-long composition instructorship at [[Texas Christian University]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A Guide to the Larry McMurtry Papers, 1968, 1987–1991 |url=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tsusm/00048/tsu-00048.html |publisher=The Witcliff Collections |access-date=March 26, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> In 1963, he returned to Rice University, where he served as a lecturer in English until 1969.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guide to the Larry McMurtry and Diana Osanna Papers, 1890–2008, bulk dates 1980-2008 MS 276 |url=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/ricewrc/00133/rice-00133.html |publisher=Woodson Research Center |access-date=March 26, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> He entertained some of his early students with accounts of Hollywood and the filming of ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'', for which he was consulting. In 1964, Kesey and his [[Merry Pranksters]] conducted their noted cross-country trip, stopping at McMurtry's home in Houston. The adventure in the day-glo-painted school bus ''[[Further (bus)|Furthur]]'' was chronicled by [[Tom Wolfe]] in his book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''. That same year, McMurtry was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].<ref name="Guggenheim_Foundation_1964">{{Cite web |title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation: Larry McMurtry |work=[[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] |access-date=March 27, 2021 |url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/larry-mcmurtry/ }}</ref>

McMurtry won numerous awards from the [[Texas Institute of Letters]]: three times the [[Jesse H. Jones]] Award—in 1962, for ''Horseman, Pass By''; in 1967, for ''The Last Picture Show'', which he shared with Tom Pendleton's ''The Iron Orchard''; and in 1986, for ''Lonesome Dove''. He won the [[Amon G.

McMurtry described his method for writing novels in ''Books: A Memoir''. He said that from his first novel on, he would get up early and dash off five pages of narrative. When he published the memoir in 2008, he said this was still his method, although by then, he wrote 10 pages a day. He also wrote every day, ignoring holidays and weekends.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMurtry|first1=Larry|title=Books : a memoir|date=2008|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781416583349|page=[https://archive.org/details/booksmemoir00mcmu/page/49 49]|edition=1st Simon & Schuster hardcover|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/booksmemoir00mcmu/page/49}}</ref> McMurtry was a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref name="NYRB_McMurtry">{{Cite web |title=Larry McMurtry |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=March 27, 2021 |url= https://www.nybooks.com/contributors/larry-mcmurtry/ }}</ref>

McMurtry was a vigorous defender of free speech, and while serving as president of [[PEN American Center|PEN]] from 1989 to 1991, led the organization's efforts to support the writer [[Salman Rushdie]],<ref name="Ransom_Center">{{Cite web |url=https://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingaid.cfm?eadid=00470 |title=Larry McMurtry: Biographical Sketch |publisher=[[Harry Ransom Center]] at the University of Texas at Austin |access-date=March 27, 2021}}</ref> whose novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1988) caused [[The Satanic Verses controversy|a major controversy]] among some [[Muslims]], with the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], issuing a ''[[fatwā]]'' calling for Rushdie's assassination, after which attempts were made on his life.<ref name="Tomb">{{cite news |date=June 8, 2005 |title=Tomb of the unknown assassin reveals mission to kill Rushdie |last=Loyd |first=Anthony |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531110.ece |url-status=dead |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171205/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531110.ece|archive-date=June 1, 2010 |access-date=March 27, 2021 }}</ref>

In 1989, McMurtry testified on behalf of PEN America before the [[U.S. Congress]] in opposition to immigration rules in the 1952 [[McCarran–Walter Act]] that for decades permitted the visa denial and deportation of foreign writers for ideological reasons.<ref name="Guardian_Flood_2021-03-27">{{Cite web |title=Lonesome Dove author and Brokeback Mountain screenwriter Larry McMurtry dies at 84 |author=Flood, Alison |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 27, 2021 |access-date=March 27, 2021 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/26/lonesome-dove-author-and-brokeback-mountain-screenwriter-larry-mcmurtry-dies-at-84 }}</ref> He recounted how before American PEN was to host the 1986 International PEN Congress, "there was a serious question as to whether such a meeting could in fact take place in this country... the McCarran–Walter Act could have effectively prevented such a gathering in the United States." He denounced the relevant rules as "an affront to all who cherish the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and association. To a writer whose living depends upon the uninhibited interchange of ideas and experiences, these provisions are especially appalling." Subsequently, some provisions that excluded certain classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs were revoked by the [[Immigration Act of 1990]].<ref name="PEN_America_2021-03-26">{{Cite web |title=PEN America Mourns Death of Novelist, Former PEN America President Larry McMurtry |work=PEN America |date=March 26, 2021 |access-date=March 27, 2021 |url=https://pen.org/press-release/pen-america-mourns-death-of-novelist-former-pen-america-president-larry-mcmurtry/ }}</ref>

===Antiquarian bookstore businesses===
While at Stanford, McMurtry became a rare-book scout.<ref>{{cite news |last1=West |first1=Richard |title=Working Book Bound |url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1985/june/working-book-bound/ |work=D Magazine |date=June 1985 |language=en}}</ref> During his years in [[Houston]], he managed a book store called the Bookman. In 1969, he moved to the [[Washington, D.C.]], area. In 1970 with two partners, he started a bookshop in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], which he named Booked Up. In 1988, he opened another Booked Up in Archer City. It became one of the largest antiquarian bookstores in the United States, carrying between 400,000 and 450,000 titles. Citing economic pressures from Internet bookselling, McMurtry came close to shutting down the Archer City store in 2005, but chose to keep it open after great public support.

In early 2012, McMurtry decided to downsize and sell off the greater portion of his inventory. He felt the collection was a liability for his heirs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lindenberger|first=Michael|title=The Great Book Sale of Teas|url=http://nation.time.com/2012/08/15/the-great-book-sale-of-texas-larry-mcmurtry-gives-up-his-collection/|access-date=August 20, 2012|work=Time|date=August 15, 2012}}</ref> The auction was conducted on August 10 and 11, 2012, and was overseen by Addison and Sarova Auctioneers of [[Macon, Georgia]]. This epic book auction sold books by the shelf, and was billed as "The Last Booksale", in keeping with the title of McMurtry's ''The Last Picture Show''. Dealers, collectors, and gawkers came out ''en masse'' from all over the country to witness this historic auction. As stated by McMurtry on the weekend of the sale, "I've never seen that many people lined up in Archer City, and I'm sure I never will again."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=John |title=Wanted, Dead or Alive: Used Books |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/books/larry-mcmurtrys-book-auction-in-texas.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Film and television===
McMurtry became well known for the film adaptations of his work, which were seen by many viewers, especially ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'' (from the novel ''[[Horseman, Pass By]]''), starring [[Paul Newman]] and [[Patricia Neal]];<ref name=hud/> the [[Peter Bogdanovich]]–directed ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'';<ref name=lastpictureshow/> [[James L.

In 2006, he was co-winner (with [[Diana Ossana]]) of both the Best Screenplay [[Golden Globe]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Meghan |title=Brokeback Mountain: Interview with Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana |url=http://cinemalogue.com/2006/02/14/brokeback-interview/ |work=Cinemalogue |date=February 14, 2006}}</ref> and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay for ''Brokeback Mountain,'' adapted from a short story by [[E.
