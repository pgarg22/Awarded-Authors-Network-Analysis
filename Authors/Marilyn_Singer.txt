==Biography==
Marilyn Singer was born in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]] on October 3, 1948 and lived most of her early life in [[North Massapequa]] ([[Long Island]]), NY. She attended [[Queens College, City University of New York]], and for her junior year, the [[University of Reading]], England. She holds a B.A. in English from Queens College and an M.A. in Communications from New York University.

In 1974, after teaching English in New York City high schools for several years, Marilyn began to write – initially film notes, catalogues, teacher's guides and film strips. Then, one day, when she was sitting in the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], Marilyn penned a story featuring talking insect characters she'd made up when she was eight. Encouraged by the responses she got, Marilyn wrote more stories and in 1976 her first book, ''The Dog Who Insisted He Wasn't'', was published by [[E. P. Dutton]].

Since then, Marilyn has published over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her genres are many and varied, including realistic [[novels]], [[fantasy|fantasies]], [[non-fiction]], [[fairy tales]], [[picture books]], [[Mystery (fiction)|mysteries]] and [[poetry]].

Marilyn Singer lives in [[Park Slope]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Education ==

1971. Education: Attended [[University of Reading]], UK, 1967–68; [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] of the [[City University of New York]], B.A. (cum laude), 1969; [[New York University]], M.A., 1979.

*"I don't know if I have a single poem that defines me. A lot of people think of me as a "nature poet" because I love writing about the natural world. But I also like to create characters and use them as narrators, and I'm fond of really silly verse." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070202091151/http://www.authorsontheweb.com/features/0204-poet/kid-poet-q2.asp]
*Singer actually sits and writes with pen in hand for three to four hours a day. "But I think writing for twenty-four, it seems. I like to write in cafes, restaurants, subways—it's not fixed." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216220733/http://www.patriciamnewman.com/singer.html]
