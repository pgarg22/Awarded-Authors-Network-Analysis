She has also reported from [[Jakarta]], the [[Middle East]] and [[London]] during the [[Timeline of the 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].

From February to December 2011, Sara was based in Kabul as the ABC's Afghanistan correspondent which included numerous assignments in the field reporting on the war from both the Afghan and NATO sides of the conflict.

Despite many restrictions on the activities of women in Afghanistan, Sara said she never faced a situation where she was denied interviews with officials or religious leaders. She was permitted entrance to the private homes of women – forbidden to male reporters – which allowed her more access in her role as a foreign correspondent.<ref name="outinperth.com">{{Cite web |url=https://www.outinperth.com/sally-sara-woman-of-the-world/ |title=Sally Sara: Woman of The World |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 March 2012 |access-date=30 January 2021 }}</ref> In a society segregated by gender, Sara said that being a female reporter allowed her 'to have access to women to be able to tell their stories – and that's really important.
