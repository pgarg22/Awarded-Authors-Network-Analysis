==Personal life==
Raphael Simon was born on October 25, 1967 to writers Dyanne Asimow and Roger L. Simon.{{refn|group=note|Simon's date of birth comes from the author stating how his first professional essay was published one day after his 17th birthday.{{sfnp|Simon|2021}} According to Simon's official essay bibliography, the piece in question, “Hollywood Parents in Transit,” first appeared in the [[Los Angeles Reader]] on October 26, 1984.{{sfnp|Bosch|2021}} Based on this, Simon's date of birth is 17 years and 1 day before October 26, 1984, which makes his date of birth October 25, 1967.}}{{sfnp|Simon|2021}} He was born in [[Los Angeles County, California]].{{sfnp|Simon|2011|p=2}} His brother, Jesse, is a visual artist.{{sfnp|Simon|2021}} He also has significantly younger half-sister, Madeleine, from his father's third marriage.{{sfnmp|1a1=Simon|1y=2021|2a1=Simon|2y=2011|2p=121}}

Simon [[Coming out|came out]] as homosexual when he was 20 years old.{{sfnp|Bosch|2016}} He currently lives in [[Pasadena, California]] with his partner, Phillip de Leon.{{sfnp|Simon|2011|p=179}} They have 2 twin girls, the biological offspring of Simon, who were born around August 2008.{{sfnp|Simon|2011|p=179}}

==Professional career==

Bosch had long been suspected to be the author Raphael Simon, although Bosch disputed this until he "came out" as Simon in a May 8, 2016, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]''.{{sfnmp|1a1=Yin|1y=2012|2a1=Moore|2y=2011|3a1=Breary|3y=2011|4a1=Bosch|4y=2012|5a1=Bosch|5y=2016}}

The pseudonym plays off that of the artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}  It also may play off the fictional [[Los Angeles]] detective, [[Harry Bosch|Hieronymous "Harry" Bosch]], also named after the artist, created by the author [[Michael Connelly]], and who has appeared in several of his novels starting in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Bosch published ''Write This Book!'', a [[do it yourself]] book; he calls it "a book that readers will write for me". Bosch elaborated in an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' stating that "it is a kind of half-written, guided mystery. Parts of it are going to be multiple choice, choose-your-own adventure, parts of it will be more like [[Mad Libs]], and some silly stuff".{{sfnmp|1a1=Liu|1y=2012|2a1=Yin|2y=2012}} Furthermore, ''Galleycat'' for [[Mediabistro.com]] stated that Bosch has since "inked a deal for a new middle grade trilogy".{{sfnp|Yin|2012}}

On May 14, 2019, Bosch published ''The Unbelievable Oliver and the Four Jokers'', with illustrations by Shane Pangburn. The book is about an eight-year-old boy who longs to be a professional magician.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} A followup, ''The Unbelievable Oliver and the Sawed-in-Half Dads'', was released on May 12, 2020.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In 2021, Bosch published ''The Anti-Book'', his first book under his real name Raphael Simon.{{sfnmp|Brallier|2021}}
