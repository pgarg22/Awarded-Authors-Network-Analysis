==Early life==
Carol Ann Duffy was born to a Roman Catholic family in the [[Gorbals]],<ref name=scottishpoetrylibrary>{{cite web | url = http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/carol-ann-duffy | title=Carol Ann Duffy (b. 1955)| publisher = [[Scottish Poetry Library]] | access-date= 26 March 2015}}</ref> considered a poor part of [[Glasgow]]. She was the daughter of Mary (née Black) and Frank Duffy, an electrical fitter.<ref name=Forbes/> Her mother's parents were Irish, and her father had Irish grandparents.<ref name=scottishpoetrylibrary/> The eldest of five siblings, she has four brothers; Frank, Adrian, Eugene and Tim. The family moved to [[Stafford]], England, when Duffy was six years old. Her father worked for [[English Electric]]. A trade unionist, he stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1983 in addition to managing Stafford F.C. football club.<ref name=Forbes/>

Duffy was educated in Stafford at Saint Austin's RC Primary School (1962–1967), St. Joseph's Convent School (1967–1970), and [[King Edward VI High School, Stafford|Stafford Girls' High School]] (1970–1974), her literary talent encouraged by two English teachers, June Scriven at St Joseph's, and Jim Walker at Stafford Girls' High.<ref name=Forbes/> She was a passionate reader from an early age, and always wanted to be a writer, producing poems from the age of 11. When one of her English teachers died, she wrote:
{{poemquote|You sat on your desk,
swinging your legs, 
reading a poem by Yeats 
to the bored girls, 
except my heart stumbled and blushed
as it fell in love with the words and I saw the tree 
in the scratched old desk under my hands, 
heard the bird in the oak outside scribble itself on the air.<ref>Edemariam, Aida. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/26/carol-ann-duffy-poet-laureate "Carol Ann Duffy: I don't have Ambassadorial Talents"], ''The Guardian'', 26 May 2009.</ref>}}

 |quote  =<poem>
Some days, although we cannot pray, a prayer
utters itself. So, a woman will lift
her head from the sieve of her hands and stare
at the minims sung by a tree, a sudden gift.

Some nights, although we are faithless, the truth
enters our hearts, that small familiar pain;
then a man will stand stock-still, hearing his youth
in the distant Latin chanting of a train.
</poem>

When Duffy was 15, June Scriven sent her poems to ''Outposts'', a publisher of pamphlets, where it was read by the bookseller Bernard Stone, who published some of them. When she was 16, she met [[Adrian Henri]], one of the [[Liverpool poets]], and decided she wanted to be with him; she then lived with him for 12 years until they split in 1982. "He gave me confidence," she said, "he was great. It was all poetry, very heady, and he was never faithful. He thought poets had a duty to be unfaithful."<ref name=Winterson>[[Jeanette Winterson|Winterson, Jeanette]].

She applied to the [[University of Liverpool]] to be near him, and began a [[philosophy]] degree there in 1974. She had two plays performed at the [[Liverpool Playhouse]], wrote a pamphlet, ''Fifth Last Song'', and received an honours degree in philosophy in 1977.<ref name=Forbes/> She won the [[National Poetry Competition]] in 1983. She worked as poetry critic for ''The Guardian'' from 1988 to 1989, and was editor of the poetry magazine, [[Ambit (magazine)|''Ambit'']]. In 1996, she was appointed as a lecturer in poetry at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], and later became creative director of its Writing School.<ref name=EB/>

Duffy was almost appointed [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]] in 1999 after the death of [[Ted Hughes]], but lost out on the position to [[Andrew Motion]]. Duffy said she would not have accepted the position at that time anyway, because she was in a relationship with Scottish poet [[Jackie Kay]], had a young daughter, and would not have welcomed the public attention.<ref>Flood, Alison.

Duffy wrote a 46-line poem, "Rings," for the 2011 [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]]. The poem celebrates the rings found in nature and does not specifically mention the couple's names. It begins ''for both to say'' and continues: "I might have raised your hand to the sky / to give you the ring surrounding the moon / or looked to twin the rings of your eyes / with mine / or added a ring to the rings of a tree / by forming a handheld circle with you, thee, / ...". She wrote the verse with Stephen Raw, a textual artist, and a signed print of the work was sent to the couple as a wedding gift.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=David|title=Royal wedding: Poet laureate writes verse for big day|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8469503/Royal-wedding-Poet-laureate-writes-verse-for-big-day.html|access-date=30 April 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Poems for a wedding|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/23/wedding-carol-ann-duffy-poetry|access-date=30 April 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 April 2011}}</ref> Duffy also wrote the poem "The Throne," which she composed for the 60th anniversary of [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II's coronation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|title=Queen's coronation anniversary: Crown to leave Tower for first time since 1953 for Westminster Abbey service|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10096497/Queens-coronation-anniversary-Crown-to-leave-Tower-for-first-time-since-1953-for-Westminster-Abbey-service.html|access-date=7 October 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 June 2013}}</ref>

In ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'' magazine,<ref Name="Interview"/> Duffy said of becoming poet laureate: "There's no requirement. I do get asked to do things and so far I've been happy to do them." She also spoke about being appointed to the role by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], saying: "She's lovely! I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with [[Ted Hughes]] whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me."<ref Name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/interviews-and-profiles/interview-carol-ann-duffy|work=Stylist|title=Interview: Carol Ann Duffy|access-date=4 October 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040121/http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/interviews-and-profiles/interview-carol-ann-duffy|archive-date=7 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Poetry==

===Style===
Duffy's work explores both everyday experience and the rich fantasy life of herself and others. In dramatizing scenes from childhood, adolescence, and adult life, she discovers moments of consolation through love, memory, and language. [[Charlotte Mendelson]] writes in ''The Observer'':

<blockquote>Part of Duffy's talent&nbsp;– besides her ear for ordinary eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety&nbsp;– is her ventriloquism. Like the best of her novelist peers&nbsp;... she slides in and out of her characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from [[Troy]] to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter&nbsp;... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets&nbsp;– that is, she makes it look easy.<ref>Mendelson, Charlotte, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/13/poetry.features1 The gospel truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130210416/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/oct/13/poetry.features1 |date=30 January 2010 }}, ''The Observer'', 13 October 2002.</ref></blockquote>

Of her own writing, Duffy has said: "I'm not interested, as a poet, in words like 'plash'—[[Seamus Heaney]] words, interesting words. I like to use simple words, but in a complicated way."<ref name=Forbes>Forbes, Peter. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 "Winning Lines"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213202550/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/aug/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 |date=13 February 2013 }}, ''The Guardian'', 31 August 2002.</ref> She told ''The Observer'': "Like the sand and the oyster, it's a creative irritant. In each poem, I'm trying to reveal a truth, so it can't have a fictional beginning."<ref>Anderson, Hephzibah. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/04/poetry.features Christmas Carol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103162815/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/dec/04/poetry.features |date=3 November 2012 }}, ''The Observer'', 4 December 2005.</ref>

Duffy rose to greater prominence in UK poetry circles after her poem "Whoever She Was" won the [[Poetry Society]] National Poetry Competition in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/duffy09/ |title=The Poetry Society |publisher=The Poetry Society |date=1 July 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131724/http://poetrysociety.org.uk/content/duffy09/ |archive-date=22 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
In her first collection, ''Standing Female Nude'' (1985), she uses the voices of outsiders, for example in the poems "[[Education for Leisure]]" and "Dear Norman." Her next collection, ''Feminine Gospels'' (2002), continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery. Her 2005 publication, ''[[Rapture (poetry collection)|Rapture]]'' (2005), is a series of intimate poems charting the course of a love affair, for which she won the £10,000 [[T.S. Eliot Prize]]. In 2007, she published ''The Hat'', a collection of poems for children. Online copies of her poems are rare, but her poem dedicated to [[U A Fanthorpe]], "Premonitions," is available through ''The Guardian'',<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/premonitions-carol-ann-duffy ''Premonitions''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107185757/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/may/02/premonitions-carol-ann-duffy |date=7 November 2012 }} ''The Guardian'', 2 May 2009.

The poem begins: "Today I am going to kill something. Anything./I have had enough of being ignored and today/I am going to play God." The protagonist kills a fly, then a goldfish.

"It's an anti-violence poem," she said. "It is a plea for education rather than violence." She responded with "Mrs Schofield's GCSE", a poem about violence in other fiction, and the point of it. "Explain how poetry/pursues the human like the smitten moon/above the weeping, laughing earth ..."<ref>Duffy, Carol Ann.

For the new National Qualifications Higher English Course in Scotland, Duffy's agents, RCW Literacy Agency, refused permission for her poem, "Originally," to be reproduced in the publicly accessible version of the paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/files_ccc/EnglishCriticalReadingRedactedSQPH.pdf |title=SQ14/H/02: English Critical Reading |publisher=Sqa.org.uk |page=22|access-date=17 July 2016}}</ref>

===''Anthologise'' annual competition for schools===
In 2011 Duffy, spearheaded a new poetry competition for schools, named [[Anthologise Poetry Competition|''Anthologise'']]. The competition is administered by the [[Poetry Book Society]] and was launched by the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] in September 2011. School students aged 11–18 from around the UK were invited to create and submit their own anthologies of published poetry. The 2011 ''Anthologise'' judges were Duffy; [[Gillian Clarke]] (National Poet for Wales); [[John Agard]]; [[Grace Nichols]] and Cambridge Professor of Children's Poetry, [[Morag Styles]]. The first ever winners of ''Anthologise''  were the sixth form pupils of [[Monkton Combe School]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], with their anthology titled ''The Poetry of Earth is Never Dead'', which was described by Duffy as "assured and accomplished as any anthology currently on the bookshelves."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picador.com/poetry/prize/anthologise|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130419152819/http://www.picador.com/poetry/prize/anthologise|url-status=dead|title=Picador|date=19 April 2013|archive-date=19 April 2013|website=archive.is}}</ref>

She also participated in the [[Bush Theatre]]'s 2011 project ''[[Sixty Six Books]]'', for which she wrote a piece based on a book of the [[King James Bible]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/biography/writers/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704090950/http://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/biography/writers/ |archive-date=4 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>
