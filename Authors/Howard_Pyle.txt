'''Howard Pyle''' (March 5, 1853 – November 9, 1911) was an American [[illustrator]] and author, primarily of books for young people. He was a native of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], and he spent the last year of his life in [[Florence]], Italy.

In 1894, he began teaching illustration at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry (now [[Drexel University]]). Among his students there were [[Violet Oakley]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], and [[Jessie Wilcox Smith]].<ref name="Abbott 1935"/> After 1900, he founded his own school of art and illustration named the Howard Pyle School of Illustration Art. Scholar Henry C. Pitz later used the term [[Brandywine School]] for the illustration artists and Wyeth family artists of the Brandywine region, several of whom had studied with Pyle.<ref>{{cite book|last=McDonald |first= Edward D. |author2=Edward M.

C. Wyeth]], [[Frank Schoonover]], [[Thornton Oakley]], [[Allen Tupper True]], Stanley Arthur, and numerous others studied under him.

His 1883 classic publication ''[[The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' remains in print, and his other books frequently have medieval European settings, including a four-volume set on [[King Arthur]]. He is also well known for his illustrations of [[pirate]]s, and is credited with creating what has become the modern stereotype of pirate dress.<ref name="pirate">{{cite web

He published his first novel ''[[Otto of the Silver Hand]]'' in 1888. He also illustrated historical and adventure stories for periodicals such as ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''. His novel ''[[Men of Iron]]'' was adapted as the movie ''[[The Black Shield of Falworth]]'' (1954).

Pyle travelled to [[Florence, Italy]] in 1910 to study mural painting. He died there in 1911 of a sudden [[kidney infection]] ([[Bright's disease]]).

Pyle was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of William Pyle and Margaret Churchman Painter. As a child, he attended private schools<ref>{{cite book|author1=Willard S. Morse|author2=Gertrude Brinckle|title=Howard Pyle: A Record of His Illustrations and Writings|url=https://archive.org/details/howardpyleareco00morsgoog|year=1921|publisher=Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts|location=Wilmington, Delaware|page=v}}</ref> and was interested in drawing and writing from a very young age. He was an indifferent student, but his parents encouraged him to study art, particularly his mother.<ref name="Abbott 1935">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Abbott |first=Charles David <!--Identified as CDA on p. 390; full name at p. vii--> |author-link=:wikidata:Q109693988 |title=Howard Pyle |editor-first=Dumas |editor-last=Malone |editor-link=Dumas Malone |encyclopedia=Dictionary of American Biography |volume=V. 15 |year=1935 |oclc=1256465953 |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofamer019330mbp/page/287/mode/1up |pages=287–290}}</ref> He studied for three years at the studio of F.

 }}</ref> and this constituted the whole of his artistic training, aside from a few lessons at the [[Art Students League of New York]].<ref name="Abbott 1935"/>

In 1876, he visited the island of [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Chincoteague]] off Virginia and was inspired by what he saw. He wrote and illustrated an article about the island and submitted it to ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]''. One of the magazine's owners was Roswell Smith, who encouraged him to move to New York and pursue illustration professionally.<ref name="Abbott 1935"/> Pyle initially struggled in New York; his lack of professional experience made it difficult for him to translate his ideas into forms for publication. He was encouraged by several working artists, however, including [[Edwin Austin Abbey]], [[A. B. Frost]], and [[Frederick S. Church]].

He finally published a double-paged spread in the ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' issue of March 9, 1878 and was paid $75—five times what he had expected.<ref name="TCLC"/> He became increasingly successful and was an established artist by the time that he returned to Wilmington in 1880.<ref name="Abbott 1935"/> Pyle continued illustrating for magazines. He also collaborated on several books, particularly in American history. He wrote and illustrated his own stories, beginning with ''The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood'' in 1883. This book won international attention from critics such as [[William Morris]].<ref name="Abbott 1935"/> Over the following decades, he published many more illustrated works for children, many of which are still in print today.

Pyle married singer Anne Poole on April 12, 1881, and the couple had seven children.<ref name="TCLC"/> In 1889, he and his wife sailed to Jamaica, leaving their children in the care of relatives. While they were overseas, their son Sellers died unexpectedly. This loss likely inspired his children's book ''The Garden Behind the Moon'', which is about death and bears the dedication: "To the little Boy in the  Moon Garden This Book is dedicated by His Father."<ref name="TCLC"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/gardenbehindmoo01pylegoog/page/n12 |title = The Garden Behind the Moon|publisher = C.

From 1894 to 1900, he taught illustration at the Drexel Institute. In 1900, he created his own school in Wilmington where he taught a small number of students in depth. In 1903, Pyle painted his first murals for the Delaware Art Museum. He took up mural painting more seriously in 1906 and painted ''The Battle of Nashville'' in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], as well as two other murals for courthouses in [[New Jersey]]<ref name="Abbott 1935"/> (the Essex and Hudson County Courthouses).

Pyle developed his own ideas for illustrating pirate dress, as few examples existed of authentic pirate outfits and few, if any, drawings had been preserved. He created a flamboyant style incorporating elements of [[Romani people|Gypsy]] dress. His work influenced the design of costumes for movie pirates from [[Errol Flynn]] to [[Johnny Depp]]. It has been noted as highly impractical for working sailors.<ref name="pirate"/>

In 1910, Pyle and his family went to [[Italy]] where he planned to study the [[old masters]]. Suffering poor health, he felt depressed and drained of energy. After one year in the country, he suffered a kidney infection and died in [[Florence]] at the age of 58.<ref name="Abbott 1935"/>

==Major works==
[[File:Arthur-Pyle Sir Kay breaketh his sword at ye Tournament.JPG|thumb|right|"[[Sir Kay]] breaketh his sword at ye Tournament", one of Pyle's [[Arthurian]] illustrations]]
Pyle wrote and illustrated a number of books, in addition to numerous illustrations done for ''Harper's Weekly'', other periodical publications, and various works of fiction for children.

===''The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood''===
{{main|The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood}}
Pyle synthesized many traditional [[Robin Hood]] legends and ballads in this work, while toning them down to make them suitable for children. For instance, he modified the late 17th century ballad "[[Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham]]", changing it from Robin killing fourteen foresters for not honoring a bet to Robin defending himself against an attempt on his life by one of the foresters. Pyle has Robin kill only two men, one who shoots at him first when he was a youth, the other a hated assassin named [[Guy of Gisborne]] whom the Sheriff sent to slay him. Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried, such as "[[Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford]]", so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor.

Pyle did not have much concern for historical accuracy, but he renamed the queen in the story "[[Robin Hood and Queen Katherine]]" as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eleanor]] (of Aquitaine). This made her compatible historically with King [[Richard the Lion-Hearted]], with whom Robin eventually makes peace.

[[File:Pyle pirates treasfight.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pirate]]s fight in ''Who Shall Be Captain?'' by Howard Pyle, 1911]]
Many of the tales in the Robin Hood book dated to the late Middle Ages. His achievement was to integrate them into a unified story, which he also illustrated. For example, he included "[[Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar]]" in the narrative order to reintroduce [[Friar Tuck]]. He needed a cooperative priest for the wedding of outlaw [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan a Dale]]) to his sweetheart Ellen. In the original "[[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]", the life is saved of an anonymous wrestler who had won a bout but was likely to be murdered because he was a stranger. Pyle adapted it and gave the wrestler the identity of [[David of Doncaster]], one of Robin's band in the story "[[Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow]]." In his novelistic treatment of the tales, he thus developed several characters who had been mentioned in only one ballad, such as David of Doncaster or [[Arthur a Bland]].

===''Men of Iron''===
''[[Men of Iron]]'' is an 1891 novel about squire Myles Falworth who hopes to become a knight, thereby redeeming his family's honor. His father was falsely implicated in a plot to kill [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]. The adventure tale follows Myles through his intensive training for knighthood and ends with him becoming a knight and challenging the wicked Lord Brookhurst Alban to trial by combat.

The novel was adapted into the 1954 film ''[[The Black Shield of Falworth]]'' starring [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Janet Leigh]].

===Other works===
*''[[Otto of the Silver Hand]]'', about the son of a robber baron during the medieval period.
*''Rejected of Men:<ref>The title is from Isaiah 53:3 (KJV), "He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief:  and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not."</ref> A Story of To-day'' (1903), setting the story of [[Jesus]] as if it had occurred during early twentieth-century America.
*''The Wonder Clock'' (1887), a collection of twenty-four tales, one for each hour of the day. Each tale was prefaced by a whimsical verse telling of traditional household goings-on at that hour. His sister [[Katharine Pyle]] wrote the verses. Pyle created the tales based on traditional European folktales.  
*''Pepper and Salt, or Seasoning for Young Folk'', traditional tales for younger readers which he also illustrated.
*After his death, a publisher collected a number of his pirate stories and illustrations and published them as ''Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates'' (1921).

==Critical response==
[[File:Pyle pirate handsome.jpg|thumb|right|''Buccaneer of the Caribbean'', from ''Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates'']]
Pyle was widely respected during his life and continues to be well regarded by illustrators and fine artists. His contemporary [[Vincent van Gogh]] wrote in a letter to his brother Theo that Pyle's work "struck me dumb with admiration."<ref name="Malyon 2015">{{cite web <!--"copyright 1999-2015 by John Malyon/Specifica, Inc." so using this information for author, publisher, year--> |last=Malyon |first=John |title=Howard Pyle Online |website=Artcyclopedia |publisher=Specifica, Inc. |location=Alberta, Canada |year=2015 |url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/pyle_howard.html |access-date=2021-11-18}}</ref>

Pyle's reputation stems from his innovation in form and illustration, creating an American school of illustration and art, and for the revival of children's books. ''Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism'' notes:
<blockquote>As time passed, Pyle's historical position as the founder of a distinctly American school of illustration and art, as the innovator who introduced the total-design approach, and as the great reinventor of children's books, would outshine any single work he did, so that he is remembered less for any one project than for his total stance.<ref name="TCLC"/></blockquote>

He had a lasting influence on a number of artists who became notable in their own right. Some of his more notable students were [[N. C. Wyeth]], [[Frank Schoonover]], [[Elenore Abbott]], [[Ethel Franklin Betts]], [[Anna Whelan Betts]], [[Harvey Dunn]], [[Clyde O. DeLand]], [[Philip R. Goodwin]], [[Thornton Oakley]], [[Violet Oakley]], [[Ellen Bernard Thompson Pyle]], [[Olive Rush]], [[Blanche Grant]], Ethel Leach, [[Allen Tupper True]], [[Elizabeth Shippen Green]], [[Arthur E. Becher]], [[William James Aylward]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]], and [[Charlotte Harding]]. Pyle taught his students at his [[Howard Pyle Studios|home and studio]] in Wilmington, which is still standing and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Pyle was an early member of  [[The Franklin Inn Club]] in Philadelphia.

According to Robert Vitz, the Howard Pyle School of Art developed a common set of themes in its work: attention to [[realism (arts)|realism]] and expression of optimism and a faith in the goodness of America.<ref name="TCLC"/> His work also continued to inspire well after his death; for example, comic book artist [[Tony Harris (comics)|Tony Harris]] (born 1969) has cited Pyle as a major influence on his work.<ref>{{cite news | last = Shapiro | first= Marc | date = August 1997 | title = Wizard Profile: Tony Harris | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 208}}</ref>

Pyle is remembered primarily as an illustrator, but his books have also been analyzed for their literary qualities, particularly ''The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood''. Taimi M. Ranta and Jill P. May have examined their influence on children's literature. May writes from a feminist sensibility.<ref name="TCLC"/> Susan F. Beegel has studied his influence on [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref name="TCLC"/> Alethia Helbig has reviewed his poetry, which has not been as highly valued as in his own time.<ref name="TCLC"/>
[[File:Howard_Pyle_-_He_lost_his_hold_and_fell,_taking_me_with_him.jpg|thumb|''He lost his hold and fell, taking me with him'' from "The Grain Ship” by Morgan Robertson, in Harper's Monthly Magazine, March 1909]]
Malcolm Usrey wrote that ''Otto of the Silver Hand''
<blockquote>has all the marks of a good historical novel: it has an exciting plot, with ample conflict and believable characters; it uses language and dialect appropriate to its setting and the characters; it has a significant, universal theme, and it presents the details of daily life in Germany of the thirteenth century accurately and unobtrusively, making the period real and alive.<ref name="TCLC"/></blockquote>
