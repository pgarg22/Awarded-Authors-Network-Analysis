'''Suzanne Portnoy''', (born 1961) is the author of the best-selling explicit memoir ''[[The Butcher, The Baker, the Candlestick Maker: An Erotic Memoir]]'' (Random House, 2006), ''[[The Not-So-Invisible Woman]]'' (Random House, 2008) and the play Looser Women, which was performed in 2011 at the Edinburgh Festival.  She has been a publicist for the last twenty years.

The book charts her journey through a sexually liberated youth, largely [[sexless marriage]] then divorce and pursuit of a lifestyle of multiple partners, group sex, loss of someone close and being mother to two children.  Parallels can perhaps be drawn with ''[[The Sexual Life of Catherine M.]]'', at least in terms of its honest approach and graphic detail. 

Suzanne Portnoy lives in northwest [[London]].  She is Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-jewish-chronicle/20071228/281973193322814|title=Themumwho...|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=The Jewish Chronicle}}</ref>
