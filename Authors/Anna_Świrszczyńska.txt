'''Anna Świrszczyńska''' (also known as Anna Swir) (1909–1984) was a Polish [[poet]] whose works deal with themes including her experiences during [[World War II]], motherhood, the female body, and sensuality.

==Biography==
Świrszczyńska was born in [[Warsaw]] and grew up in poverty as the daughter of an artist.  She began publishing her poems in the 1930s.  During the Nazi occupation of [[Poland]] she joined the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]] and was a military nurse during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].  She wrote for underground publications and once waited 60 minutes to be executed.  [[Czesław Miłosz]] writes of knowing her during this time and has translated a volume of her work.<ref>Miłosz, Czesław – ''Jakiegoż to gościa mieliśmy : o Annie Świrszczyńskiej'' (1996), Kraków "Znak"</ref>  Her experiences during the war strongly influenced her poetry.  In 1974 she published ''Building the Barricade'', a volume which describes the suffering she witnessed and experienced during that time.  She also writes frankly about the female body in various stages of life.<ref>Swir, Anna.''Talking to my Body''.Trans. [[Czesław Miłosz]] & [[Leonard Nathan]].  [[Copper Canyon Press]], 1996.</ref>

Some of Swir's poems are translated into [[Nepali language|Nepali]] by [[Suman Pokhrel]] and are collected in an anthology tilled ''Manpareka Kehi Kavita''.<ref name="Manpareka 1">{{cite book|last1=Akhmatova|first1=Anna|author-link1=Anna Akhmatova|last2=Świrszczyńska|first2=Anna|author-link2=Anna Świrszczyńska|last3=Ginsberg |first3= Allen |author-link3=Allen Ginsberg|last4=Agustini |first4=Delmira |author-link4=Delmira Agustini|last5= Farrokhzad |first5=Forough |author-link5=Forough Farrokhzad|last6= Mistral |first6=Gabriela|author-link6=Gabriela Mistral| last7= Jacques |first7=Jacques |author-link7=Jacques Prévert|last8=Mahmoud |first8= Mahmoud|author-link8=Mahmoud Darwish| last9=Al-Malaika |first9= Nazik|author-link9= Nazik Al-Malaika|last10=Hikmet |first10=Nazim|author-link10=Nazim Hikmet|last11=Qabbani |first11= Nizar|author-link11=Nizar Qabbani| last12=Paz |first12=Octavio |author-link12=Octavio Paz| last13=Neruda |first13= Pablo |author-link13=Pablo Neruda|last14=Plath |first14=Sylvia |author-link14=Sylvia Plath|last15=Amichai |first15=Yehuda|author-link15=Yehuda Amichai|translator-last1=Pokhrel|translator-first1=Suman|translator-link1=Suman Pokhrel |year=2018 |title=Manpareka Kehi Kavita|script-title=ne:मनपरेका केही कविता|trans-title=Some Poems of My Choice |type=Print |language=ne |edition=First|location=Kathmandu|publisher=Shikha Books|publication-date=2018|pages=174}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/4724485-nepali-translation-of-anna-swir-s-poem-myself-and-my-person | title=Suman Pokhrel's Blog: सुमन पोखरेल Suman Pokhrel - म र मेरो म (Nepali translation of Anna Swir's poem "Myself and My Person") - August 14, 2011 20:12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/4724900-nepali-translation-of-anna-swir-s-poem-i-kn |title = Suman Pokhrel's Blog: सुमन पोखरेल Suman Pokhrel - भित्तामा टाउको बजारेँ मैले (Nepali translation of Anna Swir's poem "I Knocked My Head against the Wall") - November 05, 2012 11:09}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|script-title=ne:अनुवादमा 'मनपरेका केही कविता'|trans-title=Manpareka Kehi Kavita in Translation |first=Geeta|last=Tripathi|publisher=Kalashree |pages=358–359|year=2018|issue=7}}</ref> Siddheshwar Singh, Manoj Patel and other translators have translated many of her poems into [[Hindi]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://padhte-padhte.blogspot.com/2012/08/blog-post_22.html | title=अन्ना स्विर : समुद्र तट पर शरीर और आत्मा| date=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://karmnasha.blogspot.com/2010/12/blog-post_30.html |title = कर्मनाशा: समुद्र , हँसी और किताबों का स्पन्दन : अन्ना स्विर}}</ref> Nine of Swir's poems were posthumousely published by family, earlier translated in Dutch by Gerard Rasch, in his work ''Memento'' in 2005.
