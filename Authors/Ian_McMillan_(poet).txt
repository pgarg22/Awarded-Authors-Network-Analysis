==Yorkshire dialect work==
In 2007, McMillan published a book named ''Collins Chelp and Chunter: a Guide to the Tyke Tongue''. This was a compilation of words that are used in the Yorkshire dialect as well as a few pieces of Yorkshire humour and illustrations.  The book received a negative review in the Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society in 2019, which noted that the work had an inconsistent orthography, assigned words to very specific locations when they were spread over wider areas and did not take account of the historical development of the dialect.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stevenson |first1=Ian |date=2019 |title=Review of Ian McMillan's ''Chelp and Chunter'' |journal=Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society |volume=119 |issue=23 |pages=75–78 }}</ref>
