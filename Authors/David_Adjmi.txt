==Career==
Adjmi's play ''The Evildoers'' was developed at the [[Sundance Institute]] and the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]]. It premiered in January 2008 at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "an anxiety attack of a play" and, of Adjmi, noted that he is "clearly a writer with a distinct voice, ambition and style."<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935952.html?categoryid=1265&cs=1 | title = Review: The Evildoers | work = Variety | first = Frank | last = Rizzo | date = January 27, 2008}}</ref> His play ''Stunning'' opened a month later at [[Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company]] in [[Washington DC]] where it was selected as one of the top ten plays of the year by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and was published in ''American Theatre'' magazine. ''Stunning'' premiered in New York at [[Lincoln Center Theater]] in June 2009 where it played an extended run to sold-out houses. Adjmi's play ''Marie Antoinette'' was developed at the Goodman Theatre's New Stages Series and the Sundance Institute's Residency at the Public Theatre. It will premiere in a coproduction between the [[American Repertory Theater]] and Yale Repertory Theatre in Fall 2012. His play "3C" premieres at Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre in June 2012. His monologue ''Elective Affinities'' was commissioned by the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and later premiered at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schreck|first=Heidi|title=In Dialogue: suffer little children: The Sturm und Drang of David Adjmi|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2005|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2005/10/theater/in-dialogue-suffer-little-children-the-sturm-und-drang-of-david-adjmi}}</ref>  In November, 2011 it received its U.S. Premiere at Soho Repertory Theatre, featuring Tony Award-winning actress Zoe Caldwell, and directed by OBIE winner Sarah Benson. His play ''Marie Antoinette'', which was presented at Yale Rep. in 2012 and received three Connecticut Critics Circle Awards including Best Play, opened the 2013–2014 season at [[Soho Repertory Theatre|Soho Rep.]] under the direction of Rebecca Taichman and with many members of the original cast. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' recently named Adjmi at one of the Top Ten in Culture for 2011, and described him as an artist who is part of "a new trend in the American theatre."<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/theatre/2009/01/26/090126crth_theatre_als | title = By the Skin of Our Teeth | work = The New Yorker | first = Hilton |last = Als | date = January 26, 2009}}</ref>

Other plays include ''Strange Attractors'', ''Caligula'' and the controversial hit ''3C'' which put Adjmi in the center of a media firestorm and a legal battle with DLT Entertainment, the rights holders of the television series "Three's Company" which Adjmi satirized in his play. DLT issued a Cease and Desist to the playwright on Adjmi's opening night. In 2014, Adjmi sued for a declaratory judgment that he had not infringed DLT's copyright. On March 31, 2015, three years after its premiere, United States District Judge Loretta Preska ruled in a 56-page decision that the play deconstructed rather than repeated the sitcom, turning it into “a nightmarish version of itself” and was protected as a fair use.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-rules-threes-company-parody-785689 | title = Judge Rules 'Three's Company' Parody Play to Be Fair Use | work = The Hollywood Reporter | first = Eriq |last = Gardner | date = March 31, 2015}}</ref>  3C  made Year's Best lists in Time Out New York, the New York Post and The Advocate.

Adjmi is the recipient of numerous awards for his work, including the Helen Merrill Award, the Marian Seldes-Garson Kanin Fellowship, and McKnight and Jerome Fellowships from  [[The Playwrights' Center]]. A collection of his work, ''Stunning and Other Plays'', was published by Theatre Communications Group in 2011, and a second collection, ''1789/1978'',  was published in October 2017. Adjmi is currently at work on ''The Stumble'', a commission for Lincoln Center Theatre, and ''Stereophonic'', a co-commission for Second Stage Theatre and Center Theater Group. His memoir entitled ''Lot Six'' will be published in June 2020 by HarperCollins.
