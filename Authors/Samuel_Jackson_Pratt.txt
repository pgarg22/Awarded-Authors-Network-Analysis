'''Samuel Jackson Pratt''' (25 December 1749 – 4 October 1814) was a prolific English poet, dramatist and novelist, writing under the pseudonym of "Courtney Melmoth"<ref name = "Notes">[https://books.google.com/books?id=UFkCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA200&dq=samuel+jackson+pratt&hl=en&ei=AGQpTs_gM8fLtAb7h_WaDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=samuel%20jackson%20pratt&f=false "Notes and Queries" – Oxford Journals]</ref> as well as under his own name.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Samuel Jackson Pratt was born "to a very respectable family"<ref name = "Litanec">[https://books.google.com/books?id=-18dAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA722&dq=samuel+jackson+pratt&hl=en&ei=TGMpToSyBIjCtAa4l9GXDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=samuel%20jackson%20pratt&f=false Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century: John Nichols]</ref> on 25 December 1749, in [[St Ives, Huntingdonshire|St Ives]], Huntingdonshire.<ref name= "GQ">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubPPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA398&dq=samuel+jackson+pratt&hl=en&ei=TGMpToSyBIjCtAa4l9GXDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=samuel%20jackson%20pratt&f=false 'A Memoir of Samuel Jackson Pratt' – The Gentleman's Magazine]</ref> His father was a brewer,<ref name = "DNB">Dictionary of National Biography 1921–1922 Vols 1–20</ref> who twice served as High Sheriff of Huntingdonshire.<ref name=Litanec /> Pratt was educated at [[Felsted School|Felsted]], in Essex and was later ordained as a Church of England clergyman. His first published writing, as "Rev Mr Pratt of Peterborough" was an elegy, entitled ''Partridges'', published in 1771, which appeared in popular poetry collections through most of the 19th century.<ref name=DNB /> He was described as 'an esteemed and popular preacher'<ref name=DNB /> but by 1773 had become entangled in a scandalous love affair and left the church to become an actor under the stage name 'Courtney Melmoth"<ref name=DNB /><ref name= "Chalmers">[http://words.fromoldbooks.org/Chalmers-Biography/p/pratt-samuel-jackson.html Chalmers' "General Biographical Dictionary" (1817) ]</ref>

=== "Sham marriage" ===

Some time in the early 1770s, Pratt entered into a marital-like relationship with a lady who thereafter referred to herself as "Mrs [[Charlotte Melmoth]]" (Melmoth being Pratt's stage-name). Her maiden name is unknown.<ref name = "AMDICTHeatre">Oxford Companion to American Theatre : Mrs Charlotte Melmoth</ref> According to ''A History of The City of Brooklyn'', Charlotte "had been duped into a sham marriage, while at boarding school, by a Mr. Pratt (known in the literary and theatrical circles of that day as Courtney Melmoth ), and with him went upon the stage, playing in several companies both in England and Ireland.".<ref name = "Brooklyn">A History of the City of Brooklyn. Including The Old Town And Village of Brooklyn, The Town of Bushwick, And The Village And City of Williamsburgh. Vol.II. Chapter II.</ref> Pratt's parents strongly disapproved of the relationship<ref name=DNB /> and it is not known whether or not the marriage was ever legally formalised. The couple toured together in theatrical productions, unsuccessfully, and eventually had to resort to [[Fortune-telling|telling fortunes]] to make their living.<ref name=DNB />

By 1777 the couple were briefly in Paris, where they met [[Benjamin Franklin]] who lent the couple money which they struggled to repay.<ref>[http://www.franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedNames.jsp?ssn=001-32-0140 Franklin Papers 22 June 1778]</ref> Charlotte, like Pratt, considered herself a poet, and Pratt sent Franklin copies of some of his wife's poetry.<ref name ="Franklin">[http://www.franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedNames.jsp?ssn=001-32-0140 Franklin Papers 28 January 1778]</ref>

In 1781 the couple separated and Charlotte embarked on a solo acting career. In 1793 she emigrated to America where she gained a reputation as  "The Grande Dame of Tragedy on the Early American Stage".<ref name=AMDICTHeatre /> The couple would never meet again.

The relationship was to taint Pratt's reputation with the reading public as indicating a dubious moral character;<ref>[http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/authorrecord.php?action=GET&recordid=33231 English Poetry 1579–1830]</ref> one obituary published after his death tactfully refers to the relationship as "such indiscretions as too frequently accompany genius";<ref name=GQ /> others simply omit any reference to his marriage altogether.<ref name=Notes />

=== Stage career ===

In 1773, having abandoned his Church career, Pratt made his first appearance as an actor under the name 'Courtney Melmoth' at the [[Smock Alley Theatre]], in Dublin, playing Marc Antony in John Dryden's ''[[All For Love (play)|All For Love]]'' but with no great success. He then took a theatre company to [[Drogheda]], again with no success, and the theatre closed after three months.<ref name=DNB /> In 1774 he appeared as [[Hamlet]] at the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] but his performance was again judged a failure.<ref name=Notes /><ref name=DNB /> One critic wrote that he walked with "a kind of airy swing that rendered his acting at times rather ludicrous."<ref name=DNB /> After this he gave up the stage and took to writing full-time although he still continued to take occasional parts opposite his "wife" until around 1781.<ref name = "Biog Actor">[https://books.google.com/books?id=xE2a06VfoogC&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=mrs+charlotte+melmoth&source=bl&ots=Y0Ha9YdZWP&sig=PwwYny_8iL-6s13yv2f34xsaQ_M&hl=en&ei=qxLRTtPhHIXr8QPmssQG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=mrs charlotte melmoth&f=false Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians ]</ref>

=== Later life ===

In 1774, having given up the stage, he had his first literary success – a poem entitled ''The Tears of A Genius, occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith'' which attracted the attention of the reading public, and from then onwards he was able to make a living by writing.<ref name=Notes /><ref name=Litanec /><ref name=DNB /> By 1776 he had moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he entered into a part-ownership of a book-shop in [[Milsom Street, Bath|Milsom Street]]<ref>Baileys British Directory, 1784</ref> with a partner of the name of Clinch.<ref name=DNB /> As with his previous professions, he soon decided that he was not suited to the life of a book-seller and returned to London within a few years.<ref name=DNB /> However he made many friends in Bath and became part of the fashionable Bath society, making the acquaintance of the famous actress [[Mrs Siddons]], for whom he would later write leading character parts in his plays.<ref name=Notes /> He later fell out with Mrs Siddons after borrowing £500 from her husband and becoming offended when she asked him to repay it.<ref name="Biog Actor" />

By 1802 he was in [[Birmingham]], a well-known literary figure with a reputation for being willing to help and advise aspiring writers, including a young [[George Mogridge (Old Humphrey)|George Mogridge]], who would later find fame as "Old Humphrey". In 1814 he fell from his horse, resulting in a long illness,<ref name=DNB /> from which he died on 4 October 1814 in his home at Colmore Row, Birmingham.<ref name=Notes /><ref name=Litanec /><ref name=DNB />

== Literary career==
Pratt's first poem, written while he was still a clergyman,<ref name=GQ /> was ''The Partridges – an elegy''. Published in [[The Annual Register]] in 1771, it was a 10-verse tale of a mother partridge praying for the safety of her chicks during the shooting season, and revealed Pratt's concern for animal welfare which would be reflected in later writings.<ref name = "works">[http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ecco/K069951.000.tei An online OCR-scanned copy of a selection of Pratt's writings]</ref> It was included in many collections of popular poetry throughout the 19th Century.<ref name=DNB />

However, it was his ''The Tears of A Genius, occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith'' (1774) which first caught the public's attention: written within a few hours of Goldsmith's death, it contained poetry written in imitation of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]]'s style<ref name=DNB /> and was published under Pratt's pseudonym of 'Courtney Melmoth'.<ref name=Notes />

Over the next six years he produced twelve further works as 'Courtney Melmoth' including ''An Apology for the Life and Writings of David Hume'' (1777); ''Shenstone Green, or the New Paradise Lost'' (1779); ''Emma Corbett'' (1780) and ''Shadows of Shakespeare, a Monody on Death of Garrick'' (1779): lines from the latter are quoted on [[David Garrick|Garrick]]'s memorial in Westminster Abbey.<ref name=DNB /> In 1781 he began writing under his own name, with a tragic play entitled ''The Fair Circassian'', and most of his following works were published as by Samuel Jackson Pratt. In total he penned seven novels (in twenty-three volumes), ten plays and twenty-three volumes of poems, 'miscellanies' and travel journals.<ref name=Notes /><ref name="The Spencerians">[http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/authorrecord.php?action=GET&recordid=33231 The Spencerians]</ref>

=== The Pupil of Pleasure ===

In 1776 he scandalised the literary world with a novel, satirising [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], entitled ''The Pupil of Pleasure or The New System (Lord Chesterfield's) Illustrated'', describing a fictional series of seductions in [[Buxton]]. Its licentious tone evoked letters of complaints, the author being described as "a dissipated clergyman"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FnPer1w6M18C&pg=PA388&lpg=PA388&dq=The+Pupil+of+Pleasure&source=bl&ots=5GdpaLqdQ8&sig=LTqmy7sHeVq6ZMzsmnAJ3vs8JnM&hl=en&ei=gXswTp_1NtSYhQfGzuQo&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Pupil%20of%20Pleasure&f=false Silhouettes (Edmund Grosse)]</ref> and the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'' magazine said of it "It is unnatural and shocking – it cannot be read without disgust.'<ref name=Notes /> Pratt's reputation suffered as a result, and, in an attempt to repair the damage he wrote a moral work, ''The Tutor of Truth''', two years later, of which the ''Monthly Review'' conceded "it is more inoffensive than any of the previous productions of this writer."<ref name=Notes />

[[File:Emma Corbett.jpg|thumb|Illustration from a 1788 edition of "Emma Corbett"]]

=== Emma Corbett===
In 1780 Pratt, still using the name Courtney Melmoth, published his most historically significant novel: ''Emma Corbett or, The miseries of civil war. Founded on some recent circumstances which happened in America''. In the novel, the title-character, Emma, travels to America to find her lover, Henry, a British soldier. She is captured by American rebels, but released on [[George Washington]]'s orders. She finds Henry, wounded by a [[poisoned arrow]] fired by an American '[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Indian]]', and sucks out the venom, poisoning herself in the process. Henry dies and the fatally ill Emma travels back to England with their child, to die.<ref>[http://legacy.lclark.edu/~jhart/mezzo1790/mezzodated1794.html Summary of Emma Corbett]</ref> The novel was highly praised on its release and passed through many editions in several languages.<ref name=DNB /> Today, however, its principal significance is, firstly, its depiction of Anglo-American relations during the [[American War of Independence]], and, secondly, that it was the first English novel to address the subject of the American Revolution.<ref name = "flynn">[http://www.humanities-ebooks.co.uk/pdf/Pages_from_92_Flynn.pdf Dismembering Anglo-America]</ref>

=== Dramatic works ===

As well as his poems, novels and 'miscellanies', Pratt drew upon his theatre experience to write ten plays, although three were never performed or published. His first play, ''Joseph Andrews'', was an adaptation of [[Henry Fielding]]'s [[Joseph Andrews|novel of the same name]], and was acted at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on 20 April 1778, with the role of Fanny being played by [[Mary Robinson (poet)|Mary Robinson]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150602013942/http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/11/416.extract Oxford Journals]</ref> Pratt would eventually write the epitaph for Mary Robinson's tombstone. The play has never been published.<ref name=DNB /> His most successful dramatic work was ''[[The Fair Circassian]]'', an adaptation of [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]]'s novel ''[[Almoran and Hamet]]'', and was first performed at Drury Lane on 27 November 1781.<ref name=DNB /> The leading part was written for Pratt's friend, the actress [[Mrs Siddons]], but she was unavailable and the part was played by [[Elizabeth Farren]] (later Countess of Derby) instead.<ref name=Litanec />  ''The Fair Circassian'' was published in many editions, and is still in print today.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Circassian-tragedy-Sympathy-Hawkesworths-%C3%A2oeAlmoran/dp/B003OA3F6Y Amazon's page for this play]</ref> His 1783 comedy ''[[The School for Vanity]]'' was also staged at Drury Lane.

=== Animal welfare ===

Pratt was a campaigner against [[cruelty towards animals]] and an opponent of hunting and blood-sports. Many of his writings reflect this concern, including his most famous poem, ''Sympathy'' (1788) which argues that man was "born to share" the earth with all other living creatures and asks "Why must man subsist by prey?". In ''Humanity, or the Rights of Nature'' he attacks hunting, demanding "For hunger kill, but never sport with life". A review in  ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of [[Lord Erskine]]'s speech in support of the Bill for Preventing Malicious and Wanton Cruelty to Animals" (1809) said of Pratt, "Certainly [no living author has] expatiated more on this subject [cruelty to animals] than the Author of "Sympathy," both in his poetical and prose writings. Indeed, nearly a third of a volume of the "Gleanings" of that Writer has been consecrated to this subject."<ref>[http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-c1785-1837/romantic-p/pra-samuel-jackson-pratt/biography-commentary-review.htm Animal Rights History ]</ref>

== Critical reception ==

Critical reception to Pratt's works was mixed during his lifetime. His scandalous "sham marriage" and the public furore over his "unnatural and shocking" novel ''The Pupil of Pleasure'' damaged his reputation, giving him a 'dubious moral character' which deterred respectable readers.<ref name="The Spencerians"/> His poem ''Sympathy'', however, was noted for its 'feeling, energy and beauty'<ref name=DNB /> and the [[Gentleman's Magazine]] remarked <blockquote>
"It is a just tribute to his character to say that all his works strongly tended to promote the interests of benevolence and virtue. Though his literary fame has been somewhat overcast by the extraordinary success of several contemporary poets, yet it is probable that many of his works will be admired when most of theirs has sunk into oblivion."
<ref name=Notes /></blockquote> However the same publication also noted that "his chief error was not knowing how to check the exuberance of his feeling and imagination; and therefore he sometimes diffused his sentiments to a tedious extent."<ref name=Notes /> [[Charles Lamb]] lambasted his ''Gleanings'' as "A wretched assortment of vapid feelings", although the same volume was popular enough with readers to pass through many editions.<ref name=DNB /> [[The London Magazine]] said of ''The Tutor of Truth'', "We can recommend this sprightly and at the same time instructive romance in the warmest terms."<ref name=Notes /> The ''Catalogue of Five Hundred Authors Now Living ''(1788) summarised his works with the succinct phrase "There are people now living who believe that they possess a degree of merit."

The ''Gentleman's Magazine'' obituary of Pratt summarised his life with the words <blockquote>"No man who ever attained public distinction was more exempt from envy; and though he may, in the vicissitudes of a life unsupported by fortune and exposed to all the casualties of a precarious subsistence, have fallen into errors, nothing of malice or ill-nature can justly be imputed to him; and as his works are all intended to promote the interests of virtue, none of these errors should be remembered in his epitaph."<ref name=GQ /></blockquote>
