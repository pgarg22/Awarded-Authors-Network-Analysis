Count '''István II. Koháry''' ([[Čabraď Castle|Csábrág]],<ref>http://szelence.com/kohary/index.html</ref> 1649–1731), the poet, politician and general was a member of the Hungarian [[House of Koháry]].

==Life==
István Koháry was the eldest son of István Koháry (1616–1664) and the Hungarian noble woman Judith of Balsassa. His father died when he was 15. After studying at the Jesuit university of [[Trnava]] he became the hereditary commander of [[Fiľakovo|Fülek castle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msa.sk/en/expositions/art-and-history/house-of-kohary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927113545/http://www.msa.sk/en/expositions/art-and-history/house-of-kohary.html |archivedate=2015-09-27 }}</ref> During the uprise of [[Imre Thököly]] he was sieged there in the year 1682 for several weeks and finally taken hostage by Thököly. Koháry refused to side with him and stayed loyal to the Habsburg king [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]]. For the next three years he remained imprisoned by the [[Kuruc]]. After the [[Battle of Vienna]] 1683 the Turks and with them also Thököly were driven out of Hungary and 1685 István became free. He was received with all honours at the Imperial court of Vienna. Emperor Leopold called him ''Speculum Fidelitatis'', the mirror of loyalty <ref>Oswald Redlich, Weltmacht des Barock: Österreich in der Zeit Kaiser Leopolds I., Seite 285</ref> and awarded him the title Count and the hereditary headship of [[Hont County]]. 1714 he became [[Judge royal]], the second-highest judge, preceded only by the [[Palatine of Hungary|palatine]], in the Kingdom of Hungary.<ref>Markó 2006, p. 284.</ref>

==Work==
During his captivity István began to write poems, unusual for his time not in Latin, but in Hungarian language.<ref>http://szelence.com/kohary/</ref>

==Death and legacy==
István Koháry remained unmarried and died highly honoured at the age of 82 at Csábrág castle.  In his testament he founded a [[Fideicommis]] and stated that every head of it have to be a catholic.<ref>August Wilpert, Bayerische Bibliographie .Kurze Geschichte der katholischen, sog. "Koháry"-Linie des Herzoglichen Hauses Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, http://gateway-bayern.de/BV014584282 Seite 3f.</ref> His nephew  Andreas Josef Koháry (1694–1757) became his heir.
István Koháry was buried in the family crypt at the abbey of [[Hronský Beňadik]]. 1909 [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] commissioned a marble monument for the church to honour his famous ancestor.
