== Biography ==
Buson was born in the village of Kema in [[Settsu Province]] (now Kema-chō, [[Miyakojima-ku, Osaka|Miyakojima Ward]] in [[Osaka]] city). His original family name was Taniguchi.

Around the age of 20, Buson moved to [[Edo]] (now [[Tokyo]]) and learned poetry under the tutelage of the [[haikai]] master Hayano Hajin.  After Hajin died, Buson moved to [[Shimōsa Province]] (modern-day [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]).  Following in the footsteps of his idol, Matsuo Bashō, Buson travelled through the wilds of northern [[Honshū]] that had been the inspiration for Bashō's famous travel diary, ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (''The Narrow Road to the Interior''). He published his notes from the trip in 1744, marking the first time he published under the name Buson.  

After travelling through various parts of Japan, including [[Tango Province|Tango]] (the northern part of modern [[Kyoto Prefecture]]) and [[Sanuki Province|Sanuki]] ([[Kagawa Prefecture]] in [[Shikoku]]), Buson settled down in the city of [[Kyoto]] at the age of 42.  Around this time, he began to write under the name of Yosa, which he took from his mother's birthplace ([[Yosa District, Kyoto|Yosa]] in the province of Tango).<ref>Henry Trubner, Tsugio Mikami, Idemitsu Bijutsukan. ''Treasures of Asian art from the Idemitsu Collection''. Seattle Art Museum, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-932216-06-9}} p174</ref>

Buson married at the age of 45 and had one daughter, Kuno. 

At the age of 51, he left his wife and children in Kyoto and went to [[Sanuki Province|Sanuki province]] (now,[[Kagawa Prefecture]] in [[Shikoku]]) to work on many works.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shin 'chi|first=Fujita|title=別冊太陽 与謝蕪村 画俳ふたつの道の達人|publisher=平凡社|year=2012|isbn=978-4-582-92202-8|location=Japan|pages=170|language=Japanese}}</ref>

After returning to Kyoto again, he wrote and taught poetry at the ''[[Sumiya]]''.  As models for his pupils, he singled out four of Bashō's disciples: [[Takarai Kikaku|Kikaku]], [[Mukai Kyorai|Kyorai]], [[Hattori Ransetsu|Ransetsu]], and Sodō.<ref>S Addiss, ''The Art of Haiku'' (2012) p. 192</ref> In 1770, he assumed the ''haigō'' ({{lang|ja|俳号}}, haiku [[pen name]]) of YahanteiⅡ ({{lang|ja|夜半亭}}二世, "Midnight Studio"), which had been the pen name of his teacher Hajin.

Buson died at the age of 68 and was buried at [[Konpuku-ji]] in Kyoto.

The cause of death was previously diagnosed as severe diarrhea, but recent investigations indicate that it was myocardial infarction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sugiura|first=Morikuni|title=江戸期文化人の死因|publisher=思文閣出版|year=2008|isbn=978-4-7842-1422-8|location=Japan|language=Japanese}}</ref>
