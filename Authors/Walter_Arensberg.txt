==Early life and career==
Walter Arensberg was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the oldest child of Conrad Christian Arensberg and his second wife, Flora Belle Covert. Walter's father was President and partial owner of a successful Pittsburgh crucible steel company. Between 1896 and 1900, Walter attended [[Harvard University]]. Following graduation, he traveled to Europe, where he spent at least two years. In 1903, he returned to Harvard, as a graduate student. He did not complete his degree, but rather moved to New York City to work as a cub reporter from 1904-1906.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Arensberg's first major book, ''The Cryptography of Dante'' (1921) was greeted as a literary scandal because of its deeply Freudian interpretation of the text. A full-page review appeared in ''The New York Evening Journal'' with the title "A Shocking Attack on Dante's immortal 'Inferno'."<ref>" A Shocking Attack on Dante's Immortal 'Inferno'," The New York Evening Journal, January 21, 1922.</ref>  This book was followed by ''The Cryptography of Shakespeare'' (1922), which finds [[acrostic]]s and [[anagram]]s in the published works of Shakespeare that reveal the embedded name of Francis Bacon. In ''The secret grave of Francis Bacon and his mother in the [[Lichfield]] chapter house'' (1923) and ''The Shakespearean mystery'' (1928) he used a "key cipher" to find further messages connected with the Rosicrucians. Analysis by [[William Friedman]] and [[Elizebeth Friedman]]<ref>William and Elizebeth Friedman, ''The Shakespearean ciphers examined'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1957. Chapter X.</ref> shows that none of the methods has [[cryptographic]] validity.

Several volumes of his Symbolist-influenced verse were also published, including 1914's ''Poems'' and 1916's ''Idols''. His poem ''Voyage a l'Infini'' was anthologized by [[Edmund Clarence Stedman]]. His far more adventurous, avant-garde poetry appeared in Dada magazines between 1917 and 1919: ''Rogue'', ''The Blind Man'', ''391'', ''TNT''.<ref>Francis M. Naumann, "Walter Conrad Arensberg: Poet, Patron, and Participant in the New York Avant-Garde, 1915-20, The Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin, vol. 76, no. 328 (Spring 1980).</ref>

==Art collector==
Between 1913 and 1950 the couple collected the works of Modern artists such as [[Jean Metzinger]],<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51056.html Philadelphia Museum of Art, Jean Metzinger, ''Tea Time'' (Woman with a Teaspoon), 1911]</ref> [[Marcel Duchamp]],<ref name="AAA"/> [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Walter Pach]], and [[Beatrice Wood]],<ref name="AAA"/> as well as [[Pre-Columbian]] art; they were assisted by dealer [[Earl L. Stendahl]]. The Arensbergs became particularly close with Duchamp, who lived in their apartment during the summer of 1915 while they vacationed at their summer home in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]]. They would become the artist's lifelong patrons and form the largest, most significant collection of his work.<ref name="Arensberg Archives: Historical Note">[http://www.philamuseum.org/pma_archives/ead.php?c=WLA&p=hn Arensberg Archives: Historical Note] [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].</ref> When Duchamp's idea to dispatch his 1917 work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', an ordinary bathroom urinal signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt," to the first show of the [[Society of Independent Artists]] was rejected, both he and Arensberg felt obliged to resign from the society.<ref>Souren Melikian (November 20, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/20/style/20iht-york.t.html Outraging the Bourgeoisie, Part II] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> The circle of friends and artists frequented the Arensberg Salon in Manhattan has been represented in a visual reconstruction <i>Chez Arensbergs</i> by the French painter André Raffray (1925-2010), created upon a commission by the New York art dealer and dada specialist Francis M.

==California years==
In 1921, for health and financial reasons and upon Louise's insistence, the couple relocated to [[Hollywood, California]]. While the move was originally intended to be temporary, the Arensbergs remained in California for the rest of their lives, returning to New York for only a year between 1925 and 1926. They first lived in Residence A, a guest house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on Olive Hill, a property owned by [[Aline Barnsdall]]. for a time. In September 1927, the Arensbergs purchased their permanent home on 7065 Hillside Avenue, an example of Mediterranean Revival architecture built in 1920 for Lee B. Memefee and designed by architect [[William Lee Woollett (Architect)|William Lee Woollett]]; they later commissioned architect [[Richard Neutra]] to build an addition to house [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s bronze version of ''[[Bird in Space|L'Oiseau dans l'espace]]'' (1924). In 1946, [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]] were married at the home in a double wedding with [[Juliet Browner]] and [[Man Ray]].<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/93232.html http://www.philamuseum.org/pma_archives/ead.php?c=WLA&p=hn Dorothea Tanning, ''Birthday'' (1942)] [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].</ref> Walter served as a board member of the [[Los Angeles Art Association]] (1937), [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (1938–1939), and the [[Southwest Museum]] (1944–1954). In addition, he was a founding board member of the short-lived American Arts in Action (1943) and the Modern Institute of Art, Beverly Hills (1947–1949), organizations dedicated to showing modern art in California.<ref name="Arensberg Archives: Historical Note"/>

==Francis Bacon Foundation==
Intrigued with writer [[Francis Bacon]], particularly the aspects of [[alchemy]], [[cryptography]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and, inevitably, the [[Shakespearean authorship|Shakespeare-Bacon]] debate, the Arensbergs researched his work. In 1937 they established the [[Francis Bacon Foundation]] in [[Los Angeles]] intending to promote "research in history, philosophy, science, literature, and art, with special reference to the life and works of Francis Bacon" and in 1954 endowed it with funds and their collection of Baconiana. The Foundation's library was housed in its own small brick building at the [[Claremont Colleges]] beginning in 1960. In the intervening years, the collection grew from its original 3,500 volumes to over 16,000 volumes. With the failing health of the collection's longtime librarian and curator, Elizabeth Wrigley, the Foundation decided to transfer it to the [[The Huntington Library|Huntington Library]] in San Marino. The collection is now known as the Francis Bacon Foundation Arensberg Collection.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

==Legacy==
In the 1940s the Arensbergs began to look for a permanent home for their collection. In 1941, a group around actors [[Vincent Price]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Fanny Brice]], and [[Sam Jaffe]] tried to get the collection to stay on the West Coast, for the Modern Institute of Art in Beverly Hills.<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-vincent-price-13227 Oral history interview with Vincent Price, 1992 Aug. 6-14] Archives of American Art Oral History Program.</ref> In 1944, the Arensbergs signed a deed of gift with the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], which included the stipulation that the University build an appropriate museum to house the collection in a specified time frame; their friend and fellow collector [[Galka Scheyer]] subsequently signed a similar agreement. By the fall of 1947 it was obvious that this condition would not be met and the contract was nullified. In 1939, the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]'s board turned down a gift of avant-garde works from the collection.<ref>D.J. Waldie (September 18, 2011), [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/18/entertainment/la-ca-pst-waldie-20110918 L.A.'s postwar art scene: Hot rods and hedonism] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

The Arensbergs then began negotiations with numerous other institutions, including the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[Denver Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Honolulu Academy of Arts]], the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]] (Mexico, D.F.), the [[National Gallery]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[San Francisco Museum of Art]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[University of Minnesota]]. The Arensbergs eventually dropped their demand that the recipient of the collection also provide for the continuance of the Francis Bacon Foundation. After protracted discussions and many visits from Director [[Fiske Kimball]] and his wife Marie, the Arensbergs presented their collection of over 1000 objects, including correspondence, ephemera, clippings, writings, personal and art collection records, and photographs documenting the couple's art collecting activities as well as their friendship with many important artists, writers and scholars, to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] on December 27, 1950.<ref name="Arensberg Archives: Historical Note"/>

In 1949, Daniel Catton Rich and Katherine Kuh organized the first public exhibition of the Arensberg collection, held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1949.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (January 12, 1994), [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/obituaries/katherine-kuh-art-connoisseur-and-writer-89.html Katherine Kuh, Art Connoisseur And Writer, 89] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> For the exhibition ''Making Mischief: Dada Invades New York'' in 1996, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] partially recreated the interior of the Manhattan apartment of the Arensbergs.<ref>Stephen Birmingham (September 8, 1996), [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/18/entertainment/la-ca-pst-waldie-20110918 L.A.'s postwar art scene: Hot rods and hedonism] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

'Hollywood Arensberg', by Mark Nelson, William H. Sherman, and Ellen Hoobler, provides a room-by-room, wall-by-wall, and object-by-object reconstruction of the couple’s Los Angeles home and art collection. Published by the Getty Research Institute in 2020, the book provides detailed context for the Arensbergs’ massive accumulation of modern and pre-Columbian art as well as Renaissance books and manuscripts. It recovers the intellectual world of a collector obsessed with chess and devoted to [[Baconian_theory_of_Shakespeare_authorship|Baconian research]], and sheds significant light on the couple's relationships with [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Earl_L._Stendahl|Earl Stendahl]], [[Robert Woods Bliss]], [[Marius de Zayas]], [[Walter Pach]], [[William_F._Friedman|William Friedman]], and others.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}
