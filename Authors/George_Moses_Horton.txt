[[File:Georgemoseshortonplaque.jpg|thumb|right|A marker in [[North Carolina]] commemorating the life of George Moses Horton]]

'''George Moses Horton''' (1798&ndash;after 1867), "the Black [[bard]] of North Carolina", was an  [[African-American]] poet from North Carolina who was enslaved. His first collection, ''The Hope of Liberty'' (1829), was intended to earn enough to purchase his freedom, but failed to do so. He did not become free until 1865, when [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] reached North Carolina.

Horton is author of the first book of literature published in North Carolina. Except for [[Phillis Wheatley]], who published in London after Boston publishers turned her down, and before the U.S. existed, he is the first African-American author.

==Biography==
Horton was born into [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] on William Horton's plantation in 1798 in [[Northampton County, North Carolina]].<ref name=Johnson239>Johnson, Lonnell E. "George Moses Horton" in ''African American Authors, 1745-1945: Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'' (Emmanuel S. Nelson, editor). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2000: 239. {{ISBN|0-313-30910-8}}</ref> He was the sixth of ten children; the names of his parents are lost to history.<ref name=Page45>Page, Amanda. "George Moses Horton" in ''The North Carolina Roots of African American Literature: An Anthology '' (William L. Andrews, editor). The University of North Carolina Press, 2006: 45. {{ISBN|0-8078-2994-3}}</ref> His owner relocated when Horton was a very young child; in 1800, he and several family members were moved with the master to a tobacco farm in rural [[Chatham County, North Carolina|Chatham County]]. In 1814 William Horton gave the youth as property to his relative James Horton.<ref name=Johnson239/> In 1819, the estate was broken up, and George Horton's family was separated. His poem "Division of an Estate", written years later, reflected on this experience.<ref name=Page45/>

Horton became known as a poet and attempted unsuccessfully to earn from his poetry writing enough to purchase his freedom. Sometime in the 1830s, he "married" (legal marriages were not permitted) Martha Snipes, an enslaved woman owned by Franklin Snipes in Chatham County.<ref name=Pitts/>{{rp|146}} The couple had two children, Free and Rhody. Little else is known about the family.<ref name=Page46>Page, Amanda. "George Moses Horton" in ''The North Carolina Roots of African American Literature: An Anthology '' (William L. Andrews, editor). The University of North Carolina Press, 2006: 46. {{ISBN|0-8078-2994-3}}</ref>

At age 60, which means about 1858, he described himself as "Belonging to Hal Horton living now in Chatham County".<ref name=Individual/>{{rp|1248}}

The editorial "Explanation" that opens ''The Hope of Freedom'' speaks of Horton's desire to emigrate to the new colony of [[Liberia]]; the collection was published so as to encourage donations. A few of the abolitionist papers{{which|date=July 2020}} also suggested raising money to buy his freedom and pay for his passage. These efforts were unsuccessful and he was not freed until 1865, when [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops arrived, liberating, according to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], all the enslaved in the seceding states. He made friends with the young officer with that group, William H. S. Banks. He left Chapel Hill with this man, eventually arriving in Philadelphia. Banks helped Horton get his collection ''Naked Genius'' published the same year.<ref name=Johnson240/>

Now a free man, at the age of 68 Horton lived in Philadelphia, where he continued to write poetry for local newspapers. His poem "Forbidden to Ride on the Street Cars" expressed his disappointment in the unjust treatment of Blacks after emancipation.<ref name=Page46/> Arriving in Philadelphia before the summer of 1866,<ref>{{cite news

==The Black bard of North Carolina==
Horton disliked farm work, and while young, in his limited free time he taught himself to read using spelling books, the Bible, and hymnals.<ref name=Page45/> Learning poetry and snippets of literature, Horton composed poems in his mind, since he did not learn to write until much later. The [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], was only {{convert|8|mi}} from his home, and as a young adult, Horton delivered produce to the university students and kitchens.<ref name=Bard>{{cite book

By 1832, Horton had learned to write, helped by [[Caroline Lee Hentz]], who was a writer and the wife of a professor; [[education during the slave period|teaching Blacks to read and write]] was legal in North Carolina until 1836. She also helped get at least two of his poems published in a newspaper.<ref name=Johnson239/> Horton had composed a poem on the death of Hentz's first child. As he recalled: "She was extremely pleased with the dirge which I wrote on the death of her much lamented primogenial infant, and for which she gave me much credit and a handsome reward. Not being able to write myself, I dictated while she wrote."<ref name=Hager69/> She sent another of Horton's poems to her hometown newspaper in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]], where it was published on April 8, 1828, as "Liberty and Slavery".<ref name=Page45/>

Horton's first book was republished under the title ''Poems by a Slave'' in 1837. It was reprinted with a biography and poetry by [[Phillis Wheatley]] a year later.<ref name=Johnson240>Johnson, Lonnell E.

==Writing==
[[File:Gmhortonsig.jpg|right|thumb|George Moses Horton's signature]]
After Horton's first poem was published in the Lancaster, Massachusetts, ''Gazette'', his works were published in  other newspapers, such as the ''Register'' in Raleigh, North Carolina, and ''[[Freedom's Journal]]'' in New York City.<ref name=Page45/> Horton's poetic style was typical of contemporary European poetry and was similar to poems written by free white contemporaries, likely a reflection of his reading and his work for commission.<ref name=Obrien181/> He wrote both sonnets and ballads. His earlier works focused on his life in slavery. Such topics, however, were more generalized and not necessarily based on his personal experience. He referred to his life on "vile accursed earth" and the "drudg'ry, pain, and toil" of life, as well as his oppression "because my skin is black".<ref name=Obrien181>O'Brien, Michael. ''Intellectual Life and the American South, 1810-1860''. The University of North Carolina Press, 2010: 181. {{ISBN|978-0-8078-3400-8}}</ref>

His first collection was focused on the issues of slavery and bondage. He did not gain enough in sales from that book to purchase his freedom; in his second book, he mentions slavery only twice.<ref name=Johnson241>Johnson, Lonnell E. "George Moses Horton" in ''African American Authors, 1745-1945: Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'' (Emmanuel S. Nelson, editor). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2000: 241. {{ISBN|0-313-30910-8}}</ref> The change in theme is also likely due to the more restrictive climate in the South in the years leading up to the Civil War.<ref name=Page46/>

His later works, especially those written after his emancipation, expressed rural and pastoral themes. Like other early Black American writers such as [[Jupiter Hammon]] and Phillis Wheatley, Horton was deeply influenced by the Bible and African-American religion.<ref name=Johnson241/>

The earliest known critical commentary on Horton's writing is from 1909 by University of North Carolina professor Collier Cobb. He dismissed Horton's antislavery themes, saying: "George never really cared for more liberty than he had, but was fond of playing to the grandstand.".<ref>Johnson, Lonnell E. "George Moses Horton" in ''African American Authors, 1745-1945: Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'' (Emmanuel S. Nelson, editor). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2000: 242. {{ISBN|0-313-30910-8}}</ref>
