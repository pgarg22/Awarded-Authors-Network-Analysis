'''Napoleon Stanisław Adam Feliks Zygmunt Krasiński''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈzɨɡmunt kraˈɕiɲskʲi}}; 19 February 1812 – 23 February 1859) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] poet traditionally ranked with [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Juliusz Słowacki]] as one of [[Poland]]'s [[Three Bards]] – the Romantic poets who influenced national consciousness in the [[Partitions of Poland|period of Partitions of Poland]]. Of the three, he is considered the least influential.

Krasiński was the most famous member of the [[Krasiński family]]. He was born in Paris to Count [[Wincenty Krasiński]] and [[Radziwiłł family|Maria Urszula Radziwiłł]], and became the close companion of his father after his mother's early death from [[tuberculosis]]. He was educated by tutors prior to attending the [[Warsaw Lyceum]], where he graduated in 1827. He then started to study [[law]] and [[Public administration|administration]] at the [[University of Warsaw|Imperial University of Warsaw]], but was expelled from the university in 1829.

In 1829 Krasiński left Poland to study in [[Geneva]]. He met Mickiewicz, who dazzled the young writer and played an important part in shaping his literary techniques. In Rome, Krasiński received news about the [[November Uprising]] and broke off his trip with the intention of returning to Poland to fight, but in the end, did not participate. In 1833 he travelled from Saint Petersburg to Italy, where he would stay until April 1834. This period saw the creation of probably his most famous work, the tragic drama ''{{lang|pl|Nie-Boska komedia}}'' (''[[The Undivine Comedy]]''). By 1850 his health had worsened, but that did not stop his constant travels around Europe. Through letters and audiences with European figures, including [[Napoleon III]] of France, he sought to gain support for the [[Polish Question|Polish cause]]. To avoid political repercussions, he published his works anonymously, which led to him being known as the Anonymous Poet of Poland.

Krasiński's early works were influenced by [[Walter Scott]] and [[Lord Byron]] and extolled [[Chivalry|medieval chivalry]]. In 1845 he published ''{{ill|Psalmy przyszłości|pl|Psalmy przyszłości}}'' (''Psalms of the Future''). He is best known for ''The Undivine Comedy'' as well as for the large body of well-received letters. His writings explore [[conservatism]], Christianity, the necessity of sacrifice and suffering to moral progress, and [[providentialism]]. ''The Undivine Comedy'' and another major work, ''[[Irydion]]'' (1834), explore the concept of [[Class conflict|class struggle]], contemplating [[social revolution]], and predicting the destruction of the [[nobility]]. His later writings showed his opposition to romantic militant ventures. He wrote letters, poetry, and "treatises in the philosophy of history", such as ''Psalms of the Future'' and ''{{ill|Przedświt (poemat)|lt=Przedświt|pl|Przedświt (poemat)|WD=}}'' (''Predawn''). ''The Undivine Comedy'' is perhaps the most important Polish drama of the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]].

== Life ==
===Childhood===
Napoleon Stanisław Adam Feliks Zygmunt Krasiński was born in Paris on 19 February 1812 to Count [[Wincenty Krasiński]], a Polish aristocrat and military commander, and Countess [[Radziwiłł family|Maria Urszula Radziwiłł]].<ref name=":0" /> He spent his first years in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], where [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard Regiment]] was stationed, and the [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] attended his [[baptism]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1814 his parents moved to [[Warsaw]], then part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], ruled by [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]], as a client state of the [[First French Empire]].<ref name=":0" /> Krasiński's cultivated and doting father employed prominent tutors, including Baroness [[Helena de la Haye]], {{ill|Józef Korzeniowski (1797–1863)|lt=Józef Korzeniowski|pl|Józef Korzeniowski (1797–1863)|}}, and {{ill|Piotr Chlebowski|pl|Piotr Chlebowski}}, to educate Zygmunt.<ref name=":0" />

Following the stabilization brought by the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which saw the end of the Duchy of Warsaw and the creation of [[Congress Poland]], the Krasiński family spent most summer holidays on their estates in [[Podolia|Podole]] and [[Opinogóra Górna|Opinogóra]]. On 12 April 1822 Zygmunt's mother died of [[tuberculosis]], and the 10-year-old boy became a precocious close companion to the family head, who instilled in Zygmunt a reverence for [[chivalry]] and honor.<ref name=":0" /> Zygmunt's fascination with his father's personality, and their mutual hopes for a free Poland, led to an excessive, onerous mutual idealization.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Sudolski |first=Zbigniew |date=2016 |title=Zygmunt Krasiński |website=Internetowy Polski Słownik Biograficzny |language=pl |url=http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/napoleon-stanislaw-adam-feliks-zygmunt-krasinski |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812023233/https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/napoleon-stanislaw-adam-feliks-zygmunt-krasinski |archive-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> Over the years, their "intimate and difficult" relationship would be very influential on Zygmunt, whom Victor Erlich described as  "weak and hypersensitive", compared to his "affectionate but domineering" father.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erlich|first=Victor|date=1962|title=The Conception of the Poet in Krasiński and the Romantic Myth of the Artist|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25599560|journal=Studies in Romanticism|language=en|volume=1|issue=4|pages=193–208|doi=10.2307/25599560|jstor=25599560}}</ref>

In September 1826 Zygmunt entered the [[Warsaw Lyceum]] (a secondary school which [[Chopin]] had attended in 1823–1826), graduating in autumn 1827.<ref name=":0" /> He began studies in [[law]] and [[Public administration|administration]] at the [[University of Warsaw|Imperial University of Warsaw]]. On 9 March 1829 an incident occurred, stemming from Krasiński's attendance at classes instead of at a patriotic demonstration during the funeral of Marshal {{ill|Piotr Bieliński|pl|Piotr Bieliński}}. Krasiński had boycotted the funeral at the urging of his father, who the previous year had clashed politically with Bieliński, who was widely seen as a national hero. Krasiński was one of only two students to remain in class. On 14 March 1829 he was publicly criticized by a fellow student, {{ill|Leon Łubieński|pl|Leon Łubieński}}; this led to an altercation serious enough to involve the university administration and to eventuate in Krasiński's expulsion.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Milosz1983-243">{{cite book |first=Czesław |last=Miłosz |date=24 October 1983 |title=The History of Polish Literature, Updated Edition |publisher=University of California Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&pg=PA243 |page=243 |isbn=978-0-520-04477-7}}</ref><ref name="Winkler20182">{{cite book |first=Markus|last=Winkler |date=31 August 2018 |title=Barbarian: Explorations of a Western Concept in Theory, Literature, and the Arts: Vol. I: From the Enlightenment to the Turn of the Twentieth Century |publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXVsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA203 |page=203 |isbn=978-3-476-04485-3}}</ref>

From late May to mid-June 1829 Krasiński, accompanying his father, took his first journey abroad, visiting Vienna, capital of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref name=":0" /> In October 1829 he left Poland again, this time to study abroad.<ref name=":0" /> Travelling through [[Prague]], [[Plzen]], [[Regensburg]], [[Zürich]], and [[Bern]], 17-year-old Krasiński arrived on 3 November 1829 in [[Geneva]].<ref name=":0" />

===Literary travels===
Much of Krasiński's time in Geneva was divided between attendance at university lectures,&nbsp;being tutored, and his social life.<ref name=":0" /> He soon became fluent in French.<ref name="Milosz1983-244">{{cite book |first=Czesław |last=Miłosz |date=24 October 1983 |title=The History of Polish Literature, Updated Edition |publisher=University of California Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&pg=PA243 |page=244 |isbn=978-0-520-04477-7}}</ref>
His Geneva stay helped shape his personality.<ref name=":0" /> Soon after arrival in Geneva, at the beginning of November 1829, Krasiński met [[Henry Reeve (journalist)|Henry Reeve]], a physician's son who was in Switzerland to study philosophy and literature. The talented young Englishman, who composed overwrought [[Romanticism|romantic]] poetry, greatly inspired young Krasiński. They became fast friends and exchanged letters discussing their love of classical and romantic literature.<ref name=":0" />

At the beginning of 1830, Krasiński developed romantic feelings for Henrietta Willan, the daughter of a wealthy English merchant and tradesman. This relationship inspired future works by Krasiński.<ref name=":0" /> On 11 August 1830 Krasiński met [[Adam Mickiewicz]], a principal figure in [[Polish Romanticism]], and Poland's greatest poet.<ref name=":0" /> Krasiński's wide-ranging conversations with Mickiewicz, who dazzled Krasiński with the breadth of his knowledge, were vital in inspiring Krasiński's to improve his literary techniques.<ref name=":0" /> From 14 August to 1 September 1830 they traveled together to the [[High Alps]]; Krasiński described this in his diary; being also a prolific written or letters, he also wrote of the trip in a letter to his father, dated 5 September 1830.<ref name=":0" />

[[File:Kazimierz Mordasewicz, Portret Joanny Bobrowej według miniatury z epoki.jpg|thumb|Joanna Bobrowa, one of Krasiński's romantic interests]]
Around early November 1830 Krasiński left Geneva and traveled to Italy, visiting [[Milan]], [[Florence]], and [[Rome]].<ref name=":0" /> In Rome, receiving news about the outbreak of the [[November Uprising]] in Poland, he broke off his trip and returned to Geneva. He had been finishing a [[historical novel]], ''{{ill|Agaj-Han|pl|Agaj-Han}}'', recounting the story of Tsaritsa and warlord [[Marina Mniszech]], considered his most significant work of that period.<ref name=":0" /> On the advice of his father, who opposed rebellion against the Russian Empire (he had become a Russian general), he did not go to Poland to participate in the Uprising – to his later everlasting regret. In May 1832 he set out for Poland, on the way again visiting Italy (Milan, [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]], [[Padua]], [[Venice]]), then [[Innsbruck]] and Vienna, finally by mid-August 1832 arriving in Warsaw. During that trip, in Venice, he consulted with [[ophthalmologist]] [[Friedrich Jäger von Jaxtthal|Friedrich Jäger]] regarding his surfacing eye disease, which would continue over the years to come, becoming one of the reasons for his growing introspection.<ref name=":0" />

Having reunited with his father shortly afterward, they traveled together to Saint Petersburg, where in October he received an audience with the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. The elder Krasiński tried to arrange a diplomatic career for his son with the Russian Empire, but Zygmunt was not interested and was content to travel abroad again. In March 1833 he left Saint Petersburg and, visiting Warsaw and Kraków, traveled once more to Italy, where he would stay until 19 April 1834.<ref name=":0" /> This period saw the creation of what is likely his most famous work, the drama ''[[The Undivine Comedy]]'' (''Nie-Boska komedia''), written probably between summer and fall 1834.<ref name=":0" /> 

In Rome, Krasiński fell in love with {{ill|Joanna Bobrowa|pl|Joanna Bobrowa}}. Though the relationship lasted for a few years, it did not result in marriage (in any case, Bobrowa was already married).<ref name=":0" /> With her and her husband Teodor, in the spring of 1834, Krasiński took another trip to Italy. That summer he met his father in [[Kissingen]], then traveled to [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Bad Ems|Ems]]. Autumn saw him visit [[Frankfurt]] and Milan, and by November he returned to Rome. In spring the following year he visited [[Naples]], [[Pompeii]], [[Sorrento]], then Florence. In this period he finished another major work, the drama ''[[Irydion]]'', which he had begun earlier, around 1832 or 1833.<ref name=":0" />
Departing Florence in June 1835, he met Bobrowa in Kissingen, then traveled with her to Ischl and Trieste, and then on alone to Vienna, which he reached in January 1836. Then he went to Milan and Florence, and again to Rome. In Rome, in May that year, he would meet and befriend another major Polish literary figure, [[Juliusz Słowacki]]. In summer 1836 he returned to Kissingen and visited [[Lázně Jeseník|Gräfenberg]], where he once more met his father. In November he returned to Vienna, where he stayed until June 1837.&nbsp;That summer he visited Kissingen and [[Frankfurt am Main]], then returned by September to Vienna.<ref name=":0" />

Worsening health prevented him from resuming his travels until May 1838, when he traveled to [[Olomouc]] and [[Salzbrunn]], then returned to Poland, in June visiting family estates in Opinogóra Górna. Shortly after, he traveled to Warsaw and then [[Gdańsk]]. September marked the end of his romance (which his father had opposed) with Joanna Bobrowa.<ref name=":0" /> On 1 September 1838, together with his father, he again departed for Italy (Venice, Florence, Rome, and Naples). In Rome he once again met Juliusz Słowacki.<ref name=":0" />

===Later life===
[[Image:Scheffer Zygmunt Krasiński.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Krasiński, 1850]]For over a decade, Krasiński's [[muse]] was Countess [[Delfina Potocka]] (likewise a friend of composer [[Frédéric Chopin]]), with whom he conducted a romance from 1838 to 1848.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Milosz1983-244" /> In the first half of 1839 he traveled to [[Sicily]], meeting Potocka in Switzerland, and his father in [[Dresden]]. He spent much of that time traveling with Potocka and writing poems and other works dedicated to her.<ref name=":0" /> In July 1840 his father informed the 28-year-old of plans that he had made for Zygmunt to marry Countess [[House of Branicki (Korczak)#Notable members|Eliza Branicka]] (1820–1876). The marriage eventuated on 26 July 1843 in Dresden.<ref name=":0" /> The couple would have four children: sons [[Władysław Krasiński|Władysław]] and Zygmunt, and daughters [[Maria Beatrix Krasińska|Maria Beatrix]] and Elżbieta.<ref name=":0" />

As usual, much of Krasiński's time was divided between traveling and writing.<ref name=":0" /> The year 1843 also saw the publication of his poem ''{{ill|Przedświt (poemat)|lt=Przedświt|pl|Przedświt (poemat)|WD=}}'' (Predawn).<ref name=":0" /> In 1845 he published another major work, ''{{ill|Psalmy przyszłości|pl|Psalmy przyszłości}}'' (Psalms of the Future).<ref name=":0" /> Tirelessly continuing his travels through Central Europe, in January 1848, in Rome, he met another Polish literary figure, the struggling poet [[Cyprian Norwid]] (sometimes considered a fourth Polish bard), whom he would aid financially. He also met Mickiewicz again and endorsed Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]]'s political faction. A conservative, Krasiński was critical of the revolutionary upheavals known as the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]].<ref name=":0" />

In 1850 his health worsened, but that did not stop his constant travels, including to France. Through letters and audiences with European figures, including [[Napoleon III]], whom he met in 1857 and 1858, he sought to gain support for the [[Polish Question|Polish cause]]. In 1856, in Paris, he took part in the funeral of Adam Mickiewicz. On 24 November 1857, in a major blow to Krasiński, his father died.<ref name=":0" />

Krasiński himself shortly died, in Paris, on 23 February 1859.<ref name=":0" /> His body, like his father's, was transported to Poland and laid to rest in the family crypt at Opinogóra.<ref name=":0" /> Today the former family estate of the Krasiński family is the home of a {{ill|Museum of Romantism|pl|Muzeum Romantyzmu w Opinogórze}}.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Floryńska-Lalewicz |first=Halina |date=2004 |title=Zygmunt Krasiński |website=Culture.pl |language=pl |url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/zygmunt-krasinski |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Themes ===
Key themes in his writings include [[conservatism]], [[Messianism|Messianist]] [[Christianity]], the necessity of sacrifice and suffering to moral progress, and [[providentialism]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Segel2014" /> His relation to his father, who strongly influenced – indeed, controlled – many aspects of his life, is also seen as a major influence in his writings.<ref name="Milosz1983-243" /><ref name="LerskiLerski1996" />

Some of Krasiński's work contains [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] motifs. Political scientist [[Stephen Bronner]] argues that the ''Comedy'' is probably "the first work in which a Jewish conspiracy against a Christian society figured as the prominent theme".<ref name="Bronner">{{Cite book|last=Bronner|first=Stephen Eric|title=A Rumor about the Jews|date=2019|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-95396-0|location=Cham|page=81|chapter=The Tale of a Forgery: Inventing the Protocols|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-95396-0_4|chapter-url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-95396-0_4}}</ref> According to theatre critic [[Agata Adamiecka-Sitek]], this aspect of the piece is still a sensitive topic in Poland, as the piece is "both canonical and profoundly embarrassing for Polish culture, on par perhaps with ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in the [[Western canon#Literary canon|western theatre canon]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adamiecka-Sitek|first=Agata|year=2016|title=Poles, Jews and Aesthetic Experience: On the Cancelled Theatre Production by Olivier Frljić|url=https://www.polishtheatrejournal.com/index.php/ptj/article/view/43/146|journal=Polish Theatre Journal|volume=1}}</ref>[[Image:Winterhalter Eliza Krasińska with children.jpg|thumb|upright|Krasiński's wife [[House of Branicki (Korczak)#Notable members|Eliza]] and their children]]He differed from his major peers, Mickiewicz and Słowacki, in his vision of the future. Accepting the likelihood of [[Democracy|democratic]] social revolution, he was much less sanguine about it than they; and so were his works, when they touched on the future. All Three Bards agreed the future would see major, likely violent changes. For Krasiński, the future held little hope for a better, new world, though his later works suggested the possibility of salvation – and of [[Polish question|restoration of Polish independence]] – through a return to conservative [[Christian values]].<ref name="Segel2014" />

The ''Undivine Comedy'' discussed the concept of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] before [[Karl Marx]] had coined the phrase.<ref name="Milosz1983-244" /><ref name="Milosz1983-246" /> ''The Undivine Comedy'' appears to have been inspired by the author's reflections on the Polish November 1830 Uprising and on the French [[July Revolution|July 1830 Revolution]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Milosz1983-244" /> It contemplated [[social revolution]], predicted the destruction of the [[nobility]], and commented on societal changes wrought by western Europe's burgeoning [[capitalism]]. The play was critical both of the aristocracy and of the revolutionaries, the former depicted as cowardly, and the latter, as destructive; neither morally superior. Also addressed were such themes as the poet's identity, the nature of [[poetry]], and Romantic myths of perfect love, fame, and happiness.<ref name=":0" />[[Image:Portret pośmiertny Zygmunta Krasińskiego.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Posthumous photo, 1859]]In another prose drama, ''Irydion'', Krasiński again took up the theme of societal decay.<ref name="LerskiLerski1996" /><ref name="Milosz1983-246" /> He condemned the excesses of revolutionary movements, arguing that motives such as [[retributive justice|retribution]] had no place in the [[Christian ethics|Christian ethic]]; many contemporaries, however, saw the play as an endorsement of militant struggle for Poland's independence, while Krasiński's intent was to advocate for [[organic work]] as a means to society's advancement.<ref name=":0" /> His later writings more clearly showed his opposition to romantic militant ventures and his advocacy of peaceful, organic educational work; this was particularly so in his ''Psalms of the Future'', which expressly criticized the concept of revolution.<ref name=":0" /> Krasiński began writing ''Irydion'' before ''The Undivine Comedy'', but published it after the latter. Miłosz commented that, while ''Irydion'' is a work of considerable talent, especially in its insightful analysis of the [[Roman decadence|decadence]] of [[Roman Empire]], it is not on a par with ''The Undivine Comedy'';<ref name="Milosz1983-247">{{cite book |first=Czesław |last=Miłosz |date=24 October 1983 |title=The History of Polish Literature, Updated Edition |publisher=University of California Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&pg=PA243 |page=247 |isbn=978-0-520-04477-7}}</ref> and Segel wrote that ''Irydion'' "attracts no great attention today".<ref name="Segel2014" />

Krasiński's later work includes a body of poetry, but his [[lyrical poetry]] is not particularly notable; indeed, he himself remarked that he was not a particularly gifted poet.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Milosz1983-247" /> More memorable are his "treatises in the [[philosophy of history]]", especially ''Predawn'' and ''Psalms of the Future'', influenced by philosophers including [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], [[August Cieszkowski]], and [[Bronisław Trentowski]].<ref name="Milosz1983-247" /> Krasiński's rejection of Romantic ideals and democratic slogans which he felt inspired futile bloody rebellions, brought a [[Polemic|polemical]] reply from fellow poet Juliusz Słowacki in the form of the poem, ''{{ill|Odpowiedź na Psalmy przyszłości|pl|Odpowiedź na Psalmy przyszłości}}'' (''A reply to "Psalms of the Future"'').<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Milosz1983-247" />

Most, if not all, of his works, were published anonymously or under pseudonyms, to protect his family – particularly his father, a politician and administrator in [[Russian Partition|Russian-controlled]] Congress Poland – from retribution by the [[Russian Empire]], as his works were often outspoken and contained thinly veiled references to the political situation of contemporary Europe (in particular, of the [[partitions of Poland]]).<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Milosz1983-244" /><ref name="Lednicki1964-2">{{cite book|author=Wacław Lednicki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0JiAAAAMAAJ|title=Zygmunt Krasiński, Romantic Universalist: An International Tribute, Edited by Wacław Lednicki|publisher=Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America|year=1964|pages=14–15}}</ref><ref name="Lednicki1964">{{cite book|author=Wacław Lednicki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0JiAAAAMAAJ|title=Zygmunt Krasiński, Romantic Universalist: An International Tribute, Edited by Wacław Lednicki|publisher=Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America|year=1964|page=190|quote=Out of respect for the position of his father, a deserter from the national cause, Krasiński published all his works anonymously, most of them without even a pseudonym: during his lifetime he was the Anonymous Poet of Poland}}</ref><ref name="Gutthy2009">{{cite book|author=Agnieszka Gutthy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88Fh3scR-U0C&pg=PA71|title=Literature in Exile of East and Central Europe|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4331-0490-9|page=71|quote=Krasiński wrote most of his poetry anonymously}}</ref> Due to his decision to publish anonymously, to the end of his life he was able to travel freely between his family manor in Russian-controlled lands and centers of Polish emigré life in Western Europe (the [[Great Emigration]]), while others, including Mickiewicz and Słowacki, were forced to remain in exile in the West, banned from returning to Polish lands by the occupying powers.<ref name="Winkler20183">{{cite book|author=Markus Winkler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXVsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA202|title=Barbarian: Explorations of a Western Concept in Theory, Literature, and the Arts: Vol. I: From the Enlightenment to the Turn of the Twentieth Century|date=31 August 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-476-04485-3|page=202|quote=Krasiński traveled freely between the centers of European and Polish emigre cultural life and his family manor in the Russian part of Poland.

== Critical assessment ==
[[File:POL Opinogóra Krasiński.jpg|thumb|Monument to Zygmunt Krasiński in Opiniogóra]]
Polish literary scholar {{ill|Zbigniew Sudolski|pl|Zbigniew Sudolski}} writes, in the ''[[Polish Biographical Dictionary]]'', that Krasiński has traditionally been ranked with Mickiewicz and Słowacki as one of Poland's [[Three Bards|Three National Bards]].<ref name=":0" /> Of the three, however, Krasiński is considered the least influential.<ref name="Winkler2018">{{cite book|author=Winkler|first=Markus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXVsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA202|title=Barbarian: Explorations of a Western Concept in Theory, Literature, and the Arts: Vol. I: From the Enlightenment to the Turn of the Twentieth Century|date=31 August 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-476-04485-3|page=202}}</ref> Miłosz wrote that Krasiński, popular in the mid-19th century, remains an important figure in the history of Polish literature but is not on a par with Mickiewicz and Słowacki.<ref name="Milosz1983-247" /> 

Modern scholars generally agree that while Krasiński was in his time admired for his poetry, these did not age well.<ref name="Segel2014" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Giergielewicz |first1=Mieczysław|last2=Wallace|first2=Stanley H.|date=1959|title=Zygmunt Krasinski 1812–1859: A Biographical Sketch |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25776258|journal=The Polish Review|volume=4|issue=3|pages=81–89|jstor=25776258|issn=0032-2970}}</ref> Polish historian of literature, {{ill|Mieczysław Giergielewicz|pl|Mieczysław Giergielewicz}}, observes the contradiction regarding Krasiński's dramas and poems, the former which gained popularity with the critics, but not the public, while for the later, a reverse was true. He subsequently notes that over time, assessment of his dramas (and letters) overshadowed that of his poetry, which proved to be much less enduring.<ref name=":2" /> Segel likewise agreed that both Krasiński's poetry, as early as during the turn-of-the-century [[Young Poland]] period, came to be criticized as "vehicles for [an] embarrassing messianism" and as "amateur and shallow Romantic philosophizing". Krasiński's popularity further waned under the [[People's Republic of Poland]], when his conservative religious themes met with disapproval by the [[communist]] authorities; new editions of his works were not published in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name="Segel2014" /> 

Today most of Krasiński's Romantic tales and poetry are still considered relatively weak. On the other hand, he has come to be recognized as "a superb prose stylist and easily the outstanding [[Epistle|epistolary]] artist of Polish romanticism", and his ''Undivine Comedy'' remains one of the most important dramas, if not ''the'' most important Polish drama, of the Romantic period.<ref name="Segel2014" />
