'''Antonio Coello''' (26 October 1611, [[Madrid]]{{snd}}20 October 1652, Madrid) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] dramatist and poet. He entered the household of the [[Duke of Alburquerque]]<!-- which? -->, and after some years of service in the army received the [[Order of Santiago]] in 1648. He was a favorite of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], who is reported to have collaborated with him; this rumour is not confirmed, but there is ample proof of Coello's collaboration with [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]], [[Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla|Rojas Zorrilla]], [[Antonio de Solís y Ribadeneyra|Solis]] and [[Luís Vélez de Guevara|Velez de Guevara]], the most distinguished dramatists of the age.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Coello, Antonio|volume=6|page=642}}</ref>

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], the best of his original plays, ''Los Empenos de seis horas'', "is an excellent example of stagecraft and animated dialogue." It has been wrongly ascribed to Calderón; it was adapted by [[Sir Samuel Tuke, 1st Baronet|Samuel Tuke]], under the title of ''[[The Adventures of Five Hours]]'', and was described by [[Pepys]] as superior to ''[[Othello]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Pepys' Diary: August 20th, 1666 | url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1666/08/20/}}</ref>  Coello died on 20 October 1652, shortly after his nomination to a post in the household of Philip IV.<ref name="EB1911"/>
