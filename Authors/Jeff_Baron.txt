In 2013, Greenwillow/HarperCollins published Baron's first novel, ''I Represent Sean Rosen''. Sean Rosen, the first-person narrator, is a thirteen-year-old aspiring writer/screenwriter and idea man.

needs an agent or a manager. Since nobody wants to represent a 13-year-old boy, he moves to plan B: he invents Dan Welch to represent him.<ref>Cherry, Wayne R., "Book Review Grades 5 and up", ''School Library Journal'', April 2013.</ref> Sean is entrepreneurial in a variety of ways, one of which is that he creates podcasts on varying themes from donuts to hair for which he interviews people.
