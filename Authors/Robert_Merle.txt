==Biography==
Merle was born in 1908 in [[Tébessa]], [[French Algeria]]. His father Félix, who was an interpreter "with a perfect knowledge of literary and spoken Arabic", was killed in 1916 in the [[Dardanelles]]. Young Merle and his mother moved to Paris, where he attended three [[lycée]]s and the [[Sorbonne]].<ref name="Obit Independent">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-merle-549687.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808152230/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-merle-549687.html |title=Obituaries: Robert Merle |first=James |last=Kirkup |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2 April 2004 |archivedate=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="Obit Guardian">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |title=Obituary: Robert Merle |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Douglas |last=Johnson |date=8 April 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>

A professor of English Literature at several universities, in 1939 during [[World War II]] Merle was conscripted in the French army and assigned as an interpreter to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. In 1940 he was in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] on the beach of [[Zuydcoote]]—which he called a "blind and abominable lottery"—and was captured by the Germans. Merle was taken prisoner to [[Stalag]] VID at [[Dortmund]], and escaped, but was recaptured at Belgian customs. He was repatriated in July 1943, and after the war was awarded the [[Croix du Combattant]].<ref name="Obit Independent"/><ref name="Obit Guardian"/>

Merle used his experiences at Dunkirk in his 1949 novel ''[[Week-end at Zuydcoote]]'', which became a "sensational success" and won the [[Prix Goncourt]]. A 1964 feature film adaptation, ''[[Weekend at Dunkirk]]'', was directed by [[Henri Verneuil]] and starred [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]. It was a box office hit and made both men famous.<ref name="Obit Independent"/><ref name="Obit Guardian"/>

Merle's 1967 novel ''[[The Day of the Dolphin (book)|Un animal doué de raison]]'' (lit. ''A Sentient Animal''), a stark [[Cold War]] [[satire]] inspired by [[John C. Lilly|John Lilly]]'s studies of [[dolphins]] and the [[Caribbean Crisis]], was translated into English and filmed as ''[[The Day of the Dolphin]]'' (1973) starring [[George C. Scott]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2004/03/31/robert_merle_95_french_writer/|title=Robert Merle, 95, French writer - The Boston Globe|website=archive.boston.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> Merle's [[post-apocalyptic]] novel ''[[Malevil]]'' (1972) was also adapted into [[Malevil (film)|a 1981 film]].<ref name="Obit Independent"/> His 1952 novel ''[[Death Is My Trade|La mort est mon métier]]'' was adapted into [[Death is My Trade (film)|a 1977 film]], his 1962 novel ''L'île'' was filmed as a 1987 [[miniseries]] and ''Le propre de l'homme'' (1989) was adapted into a 1996 TV movie.

Among Merle's other works are the 1950 play ''Flamineo'', based on [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'', the 1948 biography ''Oscar Wilde'' (extended in 1955 as ''Oscar Wilde, or The Destiny of Homosexuality''), and various translations including [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. In 1965 Merle wrote ''Moncada: premier combat de Fidel Castro'' and ''Ahmed Ben Bella'', and around this time translated the diaries of [[Che Guevara]]. Until the invasion of Afghanistan by the [[Red Army]], Merle was a sympathizer of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]].<ref name="Obit Independent"/> He said:
{{Quote|I was just a minor militant, and my fellow Reds did not approve of what I wrote. As for the student riots of May 1968, I never believed in the reality of that revolution. The only thing of value that came out of it was the liberation of sexual relationships.<ref name="Obit Independent"/>}}

Merle's "major achievement" was his 13-book series of [[historical novel]]s, ''[[Fortune de France]]'' (1977–2003), which recreate 16th and 17th century France through the eyes of a fictitious [[Protestant]] doctor turned spy. A "genuine scholar of language", Merle wrote the novels using many of the appropriate French speech rhythms and idioms of the historical period.<ref name="Obit Independent"/><ref name="Obit Guardian"/><ref name="WSJ">{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/historical-fiction-maurice-druons-accursed-kings-series-robert-merles-fortune-de-france-saga-1427483928 |title=The Original ''Game of Thrones'' |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Allan |last=Massie |date=27 March 2015 |accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref> The series made Merle a household name in France, with the author repeatedly called the [[Alexandre Dumas]] of the 20th century.<ref name="Obit Guardian"/><ref name="Telegraph 2014-12">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11272930/The-Brethren-by-Robert-Merle.html |title=''The Brethren'' by Robert Merle, review: 'a lively adventure' |first=Toby |last=Clements |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==
Kirkup called the ''Fortune de France'' series "spectacular" and dubbed it Merle's "major achievement".<ref name="Obit Independent"/> Douglas Johnson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the author as "a master of the historical novel".<ref name="Obit Guardian"/> The series made Merle a household name in France, and he has been repeatedly called the [[Alexandre Dumas]] of the 20th century.<ref name="Telegraph 2014-12"/><ref name="Guardian 2014-08 Channel">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/16/historical-epic-by-frances-hilary-mantel-crosses-the-channel-robert-merle |title=Modern-day Dumas finally crosses Channel |first=Dalya |last=Alberge |work=The Guardian |date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref> ''[[Le Monde]]'' dubbed Merle "France's greatest popular novelist", and ''[[Le Figaro]]'' observed, "Robert Merle is one of the very few French writers who have attained both popular success and the admiration of critics."<ref name="Guardian 2014-08 Channel"/>

Writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Allan Massie praised Merle's "thorough research, depth of understanding and popular touch", noting that "one of the strengths of Merle’s novels in his ability to evoke the feeling and texture of everyday life as well as high politics".<ref name="WSJ"/> Massie compared the first novel in Merle's series to [[Maurice Druon]]'s ''[[The Accursed Kings]]'' (''Les Rois maudits''), another famed French historical novel series, writing "There is a philosophical depth to the novel absent from Druon, for the Brethren are attracted to the Reformed Protestant (or Huguenot) faith ... Though not as gripping as ''The Accursed Kings'', ''The Brethren'' never strays, as Druon sometimes does, into the grotesque. It has a credibly human solidity."<ref name="WSJ"/> Toby Clements of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote, "There are set-piece discussions on the dilemmas of faith that are informative if not the stuff of high drama, and passages on the history of France that can only be made sense of with the aid of a map and a memory for names. But elsewhere there is much colour, and, overall, ''The Brethren'' gives a salty and plausible idea of just how different, odd and parlous life might have been."<ref name="Telegraph 2014-12"/>

As of 2014, ''Fortune de France'' had sold over five million copies in France.<ref name="Guardian 2014-08 Channel"/>
