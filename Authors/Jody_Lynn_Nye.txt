'''Jody Lynn Nye''' (born 1957 in Chicago, Illinois)<ref name=isfdb/> is an American [[science fiction]] writer. She is the author or co-author of approximately forty published novels and more than 100 short stories. She has specialized in science fiction or fantasy [[action (genre)|action novel]]s and humor.{{clarify|date=December 2014|reason=is the humor all SF or F, like the action? all fiction? or broader yet?}} Her humorous series range from [[contemporary fantasy]] (''The Magic Touch'' and ''Mythology 101'') to [[military science fiction]] (''Strong Arm Tactics'' and a new series beginning with ''View from the Imperium''). About one-third of her novels are collaborations, either as a co-author or as the author of a sequel. She has been an instructor of the Fantasy Writing Workshop at [[Columbia College Chicago]] (2007) and she teaches the annual Science Fiction Writing Workshop at [[DragonCon]].<!--since when?-->

Nye began collaborating with [[Robert Lynn Asprin]] on the [[MythAdventures]] series in 2003 with the publication of the collection ''Myth-told Tales'' and the novel ''Myth Alliances''. Since Asprin's death in 2008 she has continued that humorous fantasy series and she is now also writing sequels to his Dragons, or Griffen McCandles, contemporary fantasy series.

In 2008 she donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at [[Northern Illinois University]] Libraries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm |title="Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) Collection" |access-date=2009-09-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603071546/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm |archive-date=June 3, 2012 }}.

==Career==
Nye says that she "always told stories" to her younger brothers, cousins, and friends, and as a junior camp counselor. Her first published writings were technical articles on broadcasting in the magazine "Video Action" during the 1980s. She first wrote fiction for the "Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine game" and the [[Role-Aids]] line of game supplements published by [[Mayfair Games]].<ref name=FAQ>[http://www.sff.net/people/jodynye/faq.htm "Frequently Asked Questions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712085445/http://www.sff.net/people/JodyNye/faq.htm |date=2010-07-12 }}. Jody Lynn Nye. SFF Net (sff.net). Retrieved 2011-07-29.</ref>

Late in the eighties Nye wrote six companion books for the ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'' series by [[Anne McCaffrey]] and the ''[[Xanth|Magic of Xanth]]'' series by [[Piers Anthony]]. The first four were [[gamebooks|"branching-path" gamebooks]] in the ''Crossroads Adventure'' series, two set on Pern and two in Xanth.<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pubseries.cgi?2663 "Publication Series Crossroads Adventure – Bibliography"]. ISFDB.</ref>
Then simultaneously November 1989, [[Ballantine Books]] published ''[[The Dragonlover's Guide to Pern]]'' by Nye with McCaffrey and [[Avon Books]] published ''Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth'' by Nye and Anthony.<ref name=isfdb/>
Todd Cameron Hamilton and James Clouse were the illustrators for both Guides, as Hamilton had been for ''Roger Zelazny's Visual Guide to Amber'' published by Avon one year earlier.<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?2186 "Todd Cameron Hamilton"]. ISFDB.</ref><ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?8160 "James Clouse"]. ISFDB.</ref>

For the Pern guide, Nye explained in its introduction, her team (without Clouse) had visited McCaffrey two years earlier, for ten days during October 1987. In the living room Nye, editor [[Bill Fawcett (writer)|Bill Fawcett]] (Nye's husband),<ref>{{cite book |last=Asprin|first=Robert|title=Myth-told Tales |year=2007|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-441-01486-6 |author-link=<!--what?

They produced "a companion volume to her work, intended to help you visualize the setting and background for her chronicles."<ref>

</ref><!--CHECK whether she acknowledged Dr. Jack Cohen.-->

Before ''The Dragonlover's Guide'' was finished, McCaffrey and Nye were working together on a novel, presumably ''[[The Death of Sleep]]'' (1990) in the [[Planet Pirates Series|Planet Pirates trilogy]]. In the early 1990s they collaborated in three series based on McCaffrey stories from the 1960s and 1970s. Meanwhile, McCaffrey completed five more Pern books, after which they revised ''The Dragonlover's Guide''.<ref name=isfdb/><ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?176 "Anne McCaffrey"]. ISFDB.</ref>

Late in the 1990s Nye began work with [[Robert Asprin]] to extend the [[Myth Adventures]] series he had started in 1978. After his 2008 death she continued to write books they had planned. Meanwhile, three of Nye's book series were "adrift" since [[Meisha Merlin Publishing]] went out of business in 2007.<ref name=FAQ />

Among other projects, Nye is continuing to write the Myth Adventures series and her military sf/humor series begun with ''View from the Imperium'' (2011).
