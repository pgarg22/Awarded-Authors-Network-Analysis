'''Jasper Mayne''' (1604 – 6 December 1672) was an [[England|English]] clergyman, translator, and a minor poet and dramatist.

Mayne was baptized at [[Hatherleigh]], [[Devon]], on 23 November 1604, and educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/alumni-oxon/1500-1714/pp921-955 Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Mascall-Meyrick]</ref> He then entered the Church, was given two college livings in [[Oxfordshire]] (the vicarages of Cassington near Woodstock, and Pyrton near Watlington), and in 1646 was made a [[Doctor of Divinity]] (D.D.). These livings ended under the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] (1649–1660), when he was turned out of office to become chaplain to the [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], he was made [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of Christ Church (1660–1672), [[Archdeacon of Chichester]] (1660–1672), and chaplain in ordinary to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Burke records that Dr. Mayne gave £500 towards the rebuilding of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] after the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.

Mayne wrote two plays before giving up poetry as unbefitting his station: ''[[The City Match]]'' (1639), a domestic farce acted at Whitehall by the command of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]; and ''[[The Amorous War]]'' (1648), a [[tragicomedy]]. His other works include a number of poems and sermons; translations of [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] (1638, 1664), and [[John Donne]]'s ''Latin Epigrams''; and the preface to the 1647 [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] first folio.

In an amusing anecdote recounted in Blackwood's Magazine, Dr. Mayne is said to have bequeathed a trunk to an old servant, noting that it contained something that would make him drink. When opened, it was found to contain a red herring.

Shakespeare scholar [[Sidney Lee]] proposed Jasper Mayne as a possible identity of the "I. M." who wrote the fourth [[commendatory verse]] in the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays (1623). Yet since Mayne was only nineteen years old at the time the Folio was published, scholars have tended to favor [[James Mabbe]].<ref>F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 294.</ref>

Mayne died on 6 December 1672 at Oxford, and was interred on the north side of the choir at Christchurch.
