'''Kenneth Lewis Roberts''' (December 8, 1885 – July 21, 1957) was an American writer of [[historical novel]]s. He worked first as a journalist, becoming nationally known for his work with the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' from 1919 to 1928, and then as a popular novelist. Born in [[Kennebunk, Maine]], Roberts specialized in [[American literary regionalism|regionalist]] historical fiction, often writing about his native state and its terrain and also about other upper New England states and scenes. For example, the main characters in ''Arundel'' and ''Rabble in Arms'' are from Kennebunkport (then called [[Arundel, Maine|Arundel]]), the main character in ''Northwest Passage'' is from [[Kittery, Maine]] and has friends in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and the main character in ''Oliver Wiswell'' is from [[Milton, Massachusetts]].

==Early life==
Roberts graduated in 1908 from [[Cornell University]], where he wrote the lyrics for two Cornell [[fight song]]s, including ''Fight for Cornell''.<ref>Studwell, William Emmett; Schueneman, Bruce R. ''College Fight Songs II: A Supplementary Anthology''. p. 8.</ref> He was also a member of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society. He was later awarded [[honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] from three New England colleges: [[Dartmouth College]], in Hanover, New Hampshire; [[Colby College]], in Waterville, Maine; and [[Middlebury College]], in Middlebury, Vermont.<ref name="p. 571">Brennan, Elizabeth; Clarage, Elizabeth (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=63nvmt4HqTEC&pg=PA571 ''Who's Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners''. p. 571].</ref>

==Journalism==
After graduation, Roberts spent eight years working as a newspaperman for the ''[[Boston Post]]''. In 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. army for [[World War I]], but he ended up as a lieutenant in the intelligence section of the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] instead of at the front in Europe. The contacts that he made in that role enabled him to become a European correspondent for the ''Saturday Evening Post'' after the war, where he became the first American journalist to cover the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]], [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed attempt to seize power. Roberts described working for the ''Post'''s legendary editor [[George Horace Lorimer]] as follows: "I told him my ideas, which he instantly rejected or accepted&nbsp;... The price to be paid for a story was never discussed, and Lorimer was always generous."<ref>Cohn, January (1990). ''Creating America: George Horace Lorimer and the Saturday Evening Post''. University of Pittsburgh Press. p. 282.</ref>

==Historical fiction==
{{More footnotes needed|section|date=October 2020}}
[[Booth Tarkington]], a neighbor of Roberts in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]], convinced him that he would never find the time to succeed as a novelist while he worked as a journalist, and Tarkington agreed to help by editing Roberts's early novels. Although Roberts continued to sell a few essays to the ''Post'', his next few years were largely dedicated to historical fiction. Ultimately, Tarkington edited all of his historical novels through ''Oliver Wiswell'' (1940), and Roberts said in his autobiography that he offered Tarkington co-writing credit on both ''[[Northwest Passage (novel)|Northwest Passage]]'' and ''Oliver Wiswell'' in acknowledgement of Tarkington's extensive revisions to each. Both of those novels and also ''Rabble in Arms'' are dedicated to Tarkington, and Tarkington continued to assist Roberts until his death in 1946.

Roberts's historical fiction often focused on rehabilitating unpopular persons and causes in American history. A key character in ''Arundel'' and ''Rabble in Arms'' is the American officer and eventual traitor [[Benedict Arnold]], with Roberts focusing on [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec]] and the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]] in the first novel and the [[Battle of Valcour Island]], the [[Saratoga campaign]] and the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in the second. Meanwhile, the hero of ''Northwest Passage'' was Major [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] and his company, [[Rogers' Rangers]], although Rogers fought for the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. ''Oliver Wiswell'' focuses on a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] officer during the American Revolution and covers the entire war, from famous events such as the [[Siege of Boston]], the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]] through the [[Battle of Fort Washington]], and the [[Franco-American alliance]], to less-remembered events such as the [[Convention Army]], the exodus to [[Kentucky County]], the [[Siege of Ninety-Six]], and the resettlement of the [[United Empire Loyalists]], as well as providing a later look at both a dissolute Rogers and a frustrated Arnold among the British.

[[George Orwell]] reviewed ''The Lively Lady'' in the ''[[New English Weekly]]'' in 1936, describing it as "[[wikt:blood and thunder|blood-and-thundery]] stuff ... chiefly interesting as showing that the old-fashioned nineteenth-century type of American bumptiousness ... is still going strong."<ref>{{cite book|first=George|last=Orwell|author-link=George Orwell|chapter=Review|orig-year=1936|page=185|title=The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, Volume 1: An Age Like This 1920–1940|editor1-first=Sonia|editor1-last=Orwell|editor1-link=Sonia Orwell|editor2-first=Ian|editor2-last=Angus|editor2-link=Ian Angus (librarian)|publisher=Penguin|year=1968}}</ref>

As a result of his research into the Arnold expedition, Roberts published a work of nonfiction, ''March to Quebec: Journals of the Members of Arnold's Expedition'', a compilation of journals and letters written by participants in the march. During Roberts's research into Major Rogers, his researcher uncovered transcripts of both of Rogers's courts-martial (once as the accuser and once as the accused), which had been thought lost for over a century, and these were published in the second volume of a special two-volume edition of ''Northwest Passage''. He and his wife Anna translated into English the French writer [[Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry]]'s account of his journey through America in the 1790s. His last published work was ''[[The Battle of Cowpens (small volume)|The Battle of Cowpens]]'', a brief history of that battle, issued after his death, in 1958.

One of Lorimer's last acts as editor of the ''Saturday Evening Post'' was to serialize ''Northwest Passage'' in 1936 and 1937. As a result of the success of the serialization, the book, when published, became the [[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1930s|second-best-selling novel in 1937]] and fifth best for the year 1938. ''Oliver Wiswell'' also spent two years in the [[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1940s|top ten]] (1940 and 1941), and ''[[Lydia Bailey (novel)|Lydia Bailey]]'' reached the top ten in 1947.  One of Roberts's closest friends and neighbors, the novelist [[A. Hamilton Gibbs]], later stated that he believed that Roberts probably "wrote himself out" after ''Oliver Wiswell'' and certainly had done so after ''Lydia Bailey''.<ref name=Bales>{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Apr1990/LB-A90-Bales.html |first=Jack |last=Bales |title='At the Nadir of Discouragement': The Story of Dartmouth's Kenneth Roberts Collection |work=Dartmouth College Library Bulletin, n.s., 30|pages=45–53 |date=April 1990 |access-date=2014-11-03}}</ref>

''The Pulitzer Prizes''. Retrieved 2013-11-02.</ref> He died, aged 71, in Kennebunkport.

==Controversies==
===Immigration===
While a reporter for the ''Saturday Evening Post'' in the early 1920s, Roberts wrote many magazine articles and a book during the period immediately following [[World War I]] that urged strong legal restrictions on immigration from eastern and southern Europe and from Mexico, warning of the dangers of immigration from places other than northwestern Europe. He became a leading voice for stricter immigration laws and testified before a congressional committee on the subject.<ref>Bagger, Eugene S. (May 17, 1922). [https://books.google.com/books?id=850vAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA349&lpg=PA349&dq=kenneth+roberts+immigration&source=bl&ots=pHLAiCwZjG&sig=bO3fupSv2YMJKdDO17EyUb9Qie0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zIngVM7sDpWfyASW-oDQCA&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22kenneth%20roberts%22%20immigration&f=false “Ethnology by Ear”]. Book review of ''Why Europe Leaves Home''. ''New Republic''. p. 349.</ref> He wrote:

:“If America doesn’t keep out the queer alien mongrelized people of Southern and Eastern Europe, her crop of citizens will eventually be dwarfed and mongrelized in turn.”<ref>Quoted in Simon, Rita James (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=GN54aY1YVigC&pg=PA15&dq=immigration+%22kenneth+roberts%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H6PbVIvzK5GlyQTgkIGoBQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=immigration%20%22kenneth%20roberts%22&f=false In the Golden Land: A Century of Russian and Soviet Jewish Immigration]. pp. 15–16.</ref>

In ''Why Europe Leaves Home,'' derived from his ''Post'' articles, Roberts further referred to Jews as "human parasites"<ref>[http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/167985 Trump’s “Shithole” Comment Is Right Out of the Anti-Semite’s Playbook]</ref> and was separately quoted warning against further "Semitic" immigration to America, which he feared would turn the U.S. population into a "worthless and futile" hybrid race.<ref>[https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/steinberg17/files/2017/01/How-Did-Jews-Become-White-Folks.pdf How Did Jews Become White Folks?]</ref>

===Florida land boom===
Three of Roberts's first books were written at least in part to promote the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]]. They were ''Sun Hunting'' (1922), ''Florida Loafing'' (1925), and ''Florida'' (1926). Many people lost a lot of money in the bust that followed. These books were usually omitted from the lists of “other books by this author” published in the front pages of his later works.

===Dowsing===
In the 1940s, Roberts became acquainted with [[Henry Gross (dowser)|Henry Gross]], a retired Maine game warden and amateur water [[Dowsing|dowser]]. He and Gross began a long association to use Gross's claimed dowsing abilities to find deposits of water, [[petroleum]], [[uranium]], and [[diamonds]], through a corporation named Water Unlimited, Inc. Roberts documented his experiences in three nonfiction books that were popular successes but received much criticism from the scientific community. He joked that he should have given ''The Seventh Sense'' the subtitle ''Or How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.''<ref name=Bales />

===Maine cooking===
When Roberts was working on ''Trending Into Maine'', he published a chapter in the ''Saturday Evening Post'' which was dedicated to dishes he remembered having as a boy growing up in Maine. Several months after the chapter was published he began to receive mail from residents and ex-residents who were troubled that he neglected to mention many of the dishes they knew and loved from the Pine Tree State. Roberts was distressed by the letters but decided to keep them, and they were eventually compiled by his secretary, Marjorie Mosser, and eventually included in the cookbook ''Good Maine Food'', which was first published in 1939. Roberts wrote the introduction to the book and a chapter on diet.<ref>Mosser, Marjorie (1939). ''Good Maine Food''. Doubleday, Doran.</ref>
