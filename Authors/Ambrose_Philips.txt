'''Ambrose Philips''' (1674{{snd}}18 June 1749) was an [[England|English]] poet and politician. He feuded with other poets of his time, resulting in [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]] bestowing the nickname "[[Namby-Pamby]]" upon him, which came to mean affected, weak, and maudlin speech or verse.

==Life==
He was born in [[Shropshire]] of a [[Leicestershire]] family.  He was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], of which he became a fellow in 1699.<ref>{{acad|id=PHLS693A|name=Philips, Ambrose}}</ref> He seems to have lived chiefly at [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] until he resigned his fellowship in 1708, and his [[pastoral]]s were probably written in this period. He worked for [[Jacob Tonson]] the bookseller, and his ''Pastorals'' opened the sixth volume of Tonson's ''Miscellanies'' (1709), which also contained the pastorals of [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Philips, Ambrose|volume=21|page=401}}</ref>

Philips was a staunch [[British Whig Party|Whig]], and a friend of [[Richard Steele]] and [[Joseph Addison]]. In Nos. 22, 23, 30 and 32 (1713) of ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' he was rashly praised as the only worthy successor to [[Edmund Spenser]]. The writer, probably [[Thomas Tickell]], pointedly ignored Pope's pastorals. In ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' Addison applauded Philips for his simplicity, and for having written English [[eclogue]]s unencumbered by the machinery of classical [[mythology]]. Pope's jealousy resulted in an anonymous contribution to the ''Guardian'' (No. 40), in which he drew an ironic comparison between his own and Philips's pastorals, censuring himself and praising Philips's worst passages. Philips is said to have threatened to hit Pope with a rod he kept hung up at Button's [[coffee house]] for the purpose.<ref name="EB1911"/>

At Pope's request, [[John Gay]] [[burlesque]]d Philips's pastorals in his ''Shepherd's Week'', but the parody was admired for the very quality of simplicity which it was intended to ridicule. [[Samuel Johnson]] describes the relations between Pope and Philips as a perpetual reciprocation of malevolence. Pope lost no opportunity of mocking Philips, who figured in the ''Bathos'' and the ''Dunciad'', as Macer in the ''Characters''; and in the instructions to a porter how to find [[Edmund Curll]]'s authors, Philips is a [[Pindar]]ic writer in red stockings.<ref name="EB1911"/> Others who ridiculed him included [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]], who coined the nickname "[[Namby-Pamby]]" in the 1725 poem of that name:

<poem style="margin-left:5px;">
All ye poets of the age,
All ye witlings of the stage …
Namby-Pamby is your guide,
Albion's joy, Hibernia's pride.
Namby-Pamby, pilly-piss,
Rhimy-pim'd on Missy Miss
Tartaretta Tartaree
From the navel to the knee;
That her father's gracy grace
Might give him a placy place.
</poem>

Pope's poem ''[[The Dunciad]]'' (1728) follows: "Beneath his reign, shall ... Namby Pamby be prefer'd for Wit!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/namby-pamby.html|title='Namby-pamby' – the meaning and origin of this phrase|first=Gary|last=Martin|website=Phrasefinder|access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref>  Gay and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]] also picked up the nickname, which became a general term for affected, weak, and maudlin speech or verse.

In 1718, Philips started a Whig paper, ''The Free-Thinker'', in conjunction with [[Hugh Boulter]], then vicar of St Olave's, [[Southwark]]. Philips had been made justice of the peace for [[Westminster]], and in 1717 a commissioner for the lottery, and when Boulter was made Archbishop of Armagh, Philips accompanied him as secretary. Between 1727 and 1749, he sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[Armagh Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Armagh Borough]], was secretary to the lord chancellor in 1726, and in 1733 became a judge of the prerogative court. His patron died in 1742, and six years later Philips returned to London, where he died on 18 June 1749.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Works==
His contemporary reputation rested on his pastorals and epistles, particularly the description of winter addressed by him from [[Copenhagen]] (1709) to the Earl of Dorset. In [[Thomas Humphry Ward|T. H. Ward]]'s ''English Poets'', however, he is represented by two of the simple and charming pieces addressed to the infant children of [[John Carteret, 2nd Lord Carteret]], and of [[Daniel Pulteney]]. These were scoffed at by [[Jonathan Swift]], and earned for Philips the nickname of "Namby-Pamby" as described above.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Philips's works include an abridgment of Bishop [[John Hacket]]'s ''Life of John Williams'' (1700); ''The Thousand and One Days: Persian Tales'' (1722), from the French of [[François Pétis de la Croix|F Pétis de la Croix]]; three plays: ''The Distrest Mother'' (1712), an adaptation of [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s ''[[Andromaque]]''; ''[[The Briton]]'' (1722); ''[[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (play)|Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]]'' (1723). Many of his poems, which included some translations from [[Sappho]], [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Pindar]], were published separately, and a collected edition appeared in 1748.<ref name="EB1911"/>
