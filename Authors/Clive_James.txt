'''Clive James''' {{postnom|country=GBR|AO|CBE|FRSL}} (born '''Vivian Leopold James'''; 7 October 1939 – 24 November 2019) was an Australian critic, [[journalist]], broadcaster and writer who lived and worked in the United Kingdom from 1962 until his death in 2019.<ref name="McCrum"/><ref name="ABCobit">[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-28/clive-james-dies-aged-80/5751522 Clive James — writer, TV broadcaster and critic — dies aged 80] ''ABC News'', 28 November 2019. Retrieved 28 November 2019.</ref> He began his career specialising in literary criticism before becoming television critic for ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1972, where he made his name for his wry, [[deadpan]] humour.

During this period, he earned an independent reputation as a poet and [[satire|satirist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/27/clive-james-writer-broadcaster-and-tv-critic-dies-aged-80|title=Clive James, writer, broadcaster and TV critic, dies aged 80|first1=Jim|last1=Waterson|first2=Sian|last2=Cain|date=27 November 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref> He achieved mainstream success in the UK first as a writer for television, and eventually as the lead in his own programmes, including ''[[...on Television]]''.

==Early life==
James was born Vivian Leopold James in [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]], a southern suburb of [[Sydney]]. He was allowed to change his name as a child because "after [[Vivien Leigh]] played [[Scarlett O'Hara]] the name became irrevocably a girl's name no matter how you spelled it".<ref name="James, C. 1981, p.29">James, C., ''Unreliable Memoirs'', Pan Books, 1981, p. 29.</ref> He chose "Clive", the name of [[Tyrone Power]]'s character in the 1942 film ''[[This Above All (film)|This Above All]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Writer Whose Pen Never Rests, Even Facing Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/europe/prolific-writer-clive-james-facing-death-reflects-on-getting-a-few-things-done.html?_r=0|access-date=1 November 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 October 2014}}</ref>

James's father, Albert Arthur James, was taken prisoner by the Japanese during [[World War II]]. Although he survived the [[prisoner-of-war camp]], he died when the American [[B-24]] carrying him and other freed allied POWs ran into the tail of a typhoon en route from Okinawa to Manila, and crashed into the mountains of southeastern Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turton |first1=Michael |title=Forgotten WWII Plane Crash in Taitung |url=https://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2017/09/forgotten-wwii-plane-crash-in-taitung.html |website=The View from Taiwan |access-date=28 November 2019 |date=6 September 2017 }}</ref> He was buried at [[Sai Wan War Cemetery]] in [[Hong Kong]].<ref name="Guardian obituary">{{cite news|last= Jeffries| first= Stuart| title= Clive James Obituary| url=  https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/27/clive-james-obituary| work= [[The Guardian]]| date= 27 November 2019| access-date= 27 November 2019}}</ref> James would later state that his life's works originated in his father's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/clive-james-still-haunted-by-death-of-father-after-world-war-1.2655374|title=Clive James still haunted by death of father after world war|last=McGreevy|first=Ronan|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

James, an only child, was brought up by his mother (Minora May, née Darke), a factory worker,<ref name="Aitkenhead">Decca Aitkenhead [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/25/g2-interview-clive-james-television "Clive James: 'I would have been an obvious first choice for cocaine death.

He was educated at [[Sydney Technical High School]] (despite winning a [[Bursary|bursary award]] to [[Sydney Boys High School]]) and the [[University of Sydney]], where he studied English and psychology from 1957 to 1960, and became associated with the [[Sydney Push]], a [[libertarian]] intellectual subculture. At the university, he contributed to the student newspaper, ''[[Honi Soit]]'', and directed the annual [[Sydney University Dramatic Society|students' union revue]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with Honours in English in 1961. After graduating, James worked for a year as an assistant editor for the magazine page at ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref name="Guardian obituary"/>

In 1962, James moved to England, which became his home for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/09/bruce-beresford-at-last-making-the-film-that-obsessed-me-for-30-years|title=Bruce Beresford: At last, making the film that obsessed me for 30 years|last=Beresford|first=Bruce|date=8 September 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 November 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> During his first three years in London, he shared a flat with the Australian film director [[Bruce Beresford]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vd4_Vt87o8IC&pg=PA134|title=Madeleine: A Life of Madeleine St John|last=Trinca|first=Helen|date=20 March 2013|publisher=Text Publishing|isbn=978-1-921961-13-7|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> (disguised as "Dave Dalziel" in the first three volumes of James's memoirs), was a neighbour of Australian artist [[Brett Whiteley]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51184704 |title=Kogarah revisited: author Clive James returns |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=48|issue=28 |location=Sydney, Australia |date=10 December 1980 |access-date=29 November 2019 |page=21 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> became acquainted with [[Barry Humphries]] (disguised as "Bruce Jennings") and had a variety of occasionally disastrous short-term jobs – sheet metal worker, library assistant, photo archivist and market researcher.<ref name="Guardian obituary"/>

James gained a place at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], to read [[English literature]]. While there, he contributed to all the undergraduate periodicals, was a member and later President of the [[Footlights|Cambridge Footlights]], and appeared on ''[[University Challenge]]'' as captain of the Pembroke team, beating [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], but losing to [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] on the last question in a tied game.

During one summer vacation, he worked as a circus [[Roustabout#Other employment|roustabout]] to save enough money to travel to Italy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPwgAQAAIAAJ&q=University+Challenge|title=May week was in June|last=James|first=Clive|date=1990|publisher=Cape|isbn=9780224027878|series=Volume 3 of ''Unreliable Memoirs''|location=London|pages=49, 107–10|language=en}}</ref> His contemporaries at Cambridge included [[Germaine Greer]] (known as "Romaine Rand" in the first three volumes of his memoirs), [[Simon Schama]] and [[Eric Idle]]. Having, he claimed, scrupulously avoided reading any of the course material (but having read widely otherwise in English and foreign literature), James graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|2:1]]—better than he had expected—and began a PhD thesis on [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].<ref name="Guardian obituary" />

==Career==

===Critic and essayist===
James became the television critic for ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1972,<ref name="Aitkenhead"/> remaining in the role until 1982. [[Mark Lawson]] described a James review as "so funny it was dangerous to read while holding a hot drink".<ref name="BBC obituary">{{cite web|title= Clive James obituary: 'A man of substance'| url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13437293| website= [[BBC Online]]| date= 27 November 2019| access-date= 27 November 2019}}</ref>  He was at times merciless.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=My debt to Clive James, the howlingly funny critic who made TV-writing sing |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/28/my-debt-to-clive-james-the-howlingly-funny-critic-who-made-tv-writing-sing|last=Mangan|first=Lucy|date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=London Review of Books|title=A Blizzard of Tiny Kisses|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v02/n11/clive-james/a-blizzard-of-tiny-kisses|last=James|first=Clive|date=5 June 1980|volume=2|issue=11}}</ref> Selections from the column were published in three books – ''[[Visions Before Midnight]]'', ''The Crystal Bucket'' and ''[[Glued to the Box]]'' – and finally in a compendium, ''On Television''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/clive-james/clive-james-on-television/9781509832439|title=Clive James on Television|publisher=Pan Macmillan|access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>  He wrote literary criticism for newspapers, magazines and periodicals in Britain, Australia and the United States, including, among many others, the ''[[Australian Book Review]]'', ''[[The Monthly]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Liberal]]'' and ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/clive-james-waking-up-in-europa/|title=Waking up in Europa|website=TLS|location=London}}</ref> [[John Gross]] included James's essay "A Blizzard of Tiny Kisses" in the ''Oxford Book of Essays'' (1992, 1999).<ref>{{Cite document|title=The Oxford book of essays|first=John|last=Gross|date=28 November 1991|oclc = 21335450}}</ref>

He also published ''Flying Visits'', a collection of [[travel writing]] for ''[[The Observer]]''. For many years, until mid-2014, he wrote the weekly television critique page in the "Review" section of the Saturday edition of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name="Guardian obituary"/>

===Poet and lyricist===
James published several books of poetry, including  ''Poem of the Year'' (1983), a verse-diary; ''Other Passports: Poems 1958–1985'', a first collection; and ''The Book of My Enemy'' (2003), a volume that takes its title from his poem "The Book of My Enemy Has Been Remaindered".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/the-book-of-my-enemy/ | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Dwight | last=Garner | title=The Book of My Enemy | date=24 July 2007}}</ref>

He published four [[mock-heroic]] poems – ''The Fate of Felicity Fark in the Land of the Media: a moral poem'' (1975), ''Peregrine Prykke's Pilgrimage Through the London Literary World'' (1976), ''Britannia Bright's Bewilderment in the Wilderness of Westminster'' (1976) and ''Charles Charming's Challenges on the Pathway to the Throne'' (1981) – and one long autobiographical epic, ''The River in the Sky'' (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panmacmillan.com/%20/authors/clive-james/the-river-in-the-sky/9781509887231|title=The River in the Sky by Clive James|website=Pan Macmillan}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

During the 1970s he also collaborated on six albums of songs with [[Pete Atkin]]:<ref name="Atkin"/>

* ''Beware of the Beautiful Stranger'' (1970)
* ''Driving Through Mythical America'' (1971)
* ''A King at Nightfall'' (1973)
* ''The Road of Silk'' (1974)
* ''Secret Drinker'' (1974)
* ''Live Libel'' (1975)

Atkin and James toured together to promote both the final album – a "contractual obligation" collection consisting of parodies and humour numbers written over the years - and James's own ''Felicity Fark'' epic poem.  James wrote the album sleeve notes, which mostly linked the songs with thinly disguised jibes at popular artists and trends.  On stage James both read from his poem, and introduced the album songs.  Despite the success of the tour, there were no more recordings by Atkin, who pursued other opportunities and eventually became a BBC radio producer.

A revival of interest in the songs in the late 1990s, triggered largely by the creation by Steve Birkill of an Internet mailing list "Midnight Voices" in 1997, led to the reissue of the six albums on CD between 1997 and 2001, as well as live performances by the pair. A double album of previously unrecorded songs written in the seventies and entitled ''The Lakeside Sessions: Volumes 1 and 2'' was released in 2002 and ''Winter Spring'', an album of new material written by James and Atkin was released in 2003.<ref name="Atkin"/> This was followed by ''Midnight Voices'', an album of remakes of the best Atkin/James songs from the early albums, and, in 2015, by ''The Colours of the Night'', which included several newly completed songs.<ref name="Atkin">{{cite web |url=https://www.peteatkin.com/disworks.htm|title=Pete Atkin discography| publisher=PeteAtkin.com |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

James acknowledged the importance of the ''Midnight Voices'' group in bringing to wider attention the lyric-writing aspect of his career. He wrote in November 1997, "That one of the midnight voices of my own fate should be the music of Pete Atkin continues to rank high among the blessings of my life".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peteatkin.com/mvdig013.htm|title=Midnight Voices|date=27 November 1997|access-date=11 December 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, he issued his translation of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. The work, adopting [[quatrain]]s to translate the original's [[terza rima]], was well received by Australian critics.<ref>[[Peter Craven (literary critic)|Craven, Peter]], [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/master-craftsmans-crowning-glory-20130530-2nehs.html "Master craftsman's crowning glory"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 1 June 2013.</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Peter.

Retrieved 2 December 2019.</ref>

===Novelist and memoirist===
In 1980 James published his first book of autobiography, ''[[Unreliable Memoirs]]'', which recounted his early life in Australia and extended to over 100 reprintings. It was followed by four other volumes of autobiography: ''Falling Towards England'' (1985), which covered his London years; ''May Week Was in June'' (1990), which dealt with his time at [[Cambridge]]; ''North Face of Soho'' (2006); and ''The Blaze of Obscurity'' (2009), concerning his subsequent career as a television presenter. An omnibus edition of the first three volumes was published under the generic title of ''Always Unreliable''. James also wrote four novels: ''Brilliant Creatures'' (1983); ''The Remake'' (1987); ''Brrm! Brrm!'' (1991), published in the United States as ''The Man from Japan''; and ''The Silver Castle'' (1996).<ref>Wallace, Arminta.

===Television===
James developed his television career as a guest commentator on various shows, including as an occasional co-presenter with [[Tony Wilson]] on the first series of ''[[So It Goes (television series)|So It Goes]]'', the [[Granada Television]] pop music show. On the show when the [[Sex Pistols]] made their TV debut, James commented: "During the recording, the task of keeping the little bastards under control was given to me. With the aid of a radio microphone, I was able to shout them down, but it was a near thing ... they attacked everything around them and had difficulty in being polite even to each other".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/odds2.html|title=The Observer, November 1976|access-date=24 December 2007}}</ref>

James subsequently hosted the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] show ''[[...on Television|Clive James on Television]]'', in which he showcased unusual or (often unintentionally) amusing television programmes from around the world, notably the Japanese TV show ''[[Za Gaman|Endurance]]''. After his move to the [[BBC]] in 1988, he hosted a similarly-formatted programme called ''Saturday Night Clive'' (1989–1991), which began on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] but was popular enough to move to [[BBC One|BBC1]] in 1991. It returned in 1994 on Sunday nights, under the title ''Sunday Night Clive''.

In 1995 he set up Watchmaker Productions to produce ''The Clive James Show'' for ITV, and a subsequent series launched the British career of singer and comedian [[Margarita Pracatan]]. James hosted one of the early chat shows on [[Channel 4]] and fronted the BBC's ''Review of the Year'' programmes in the late 1980s (''Clive James on the '80s'') and 1990s (''Clive James on the '90s''), which formed part of the channel's New Year's Eve celebrations.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-28/clive-james/|title=Andrew Collins on working with Clive James: "to collaborate with him was like winning a competition"|magazine=Radio Times|access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, James featured in a travel programme called ''Clive James in...'' (beginning with ''Clive James Live in Las Vegas'') for [[LWT]] (now [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) and later switched to [[BBC]], where he continued producing travel programmes, this time called ''[[Clive James's Postcard from...]]'' (beginning with ''Clive James's Postcard from Miami'') – these also eventually transferred to ITV. He was also one of the original team of presenters of the BBC's ''[[The Late Show (BBC TV series)|The Late Show]]'', hosting a round-table discussion on Friday nights.<ref name="GuardianObit">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/27/clive-james-obituary|title=Clive James obituary|newspaper=Guardian|access-date=28 November 2019|date=27 November 2019|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart}}</ref>

His major documentary series ''[[Fame in the 20th Century]]'' (1993) was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the [[BBC]], in Australia by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and in the United States by the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network. This series dealt with the concept of "fame" in the 20th century, following over a course of eight episodes (each one chronologically and roughly devoted to one decade of the century, from the 1900s to the 1980s) discussions about world-famous people of the 20th century. Through the use of film footage, James presented a history of "fame" which explored its growth to today's global proportions. In his closing monologue he remarked, "Achievement without fame can be a rewarding life, while fame without achievement is no life at all."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruber |first1=Fiona |title=A late afternoon with Clive James |url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/a-late-afternoon-with-author-and-broadcaster-clive-james/6797740 |access-date=28 November 2019 |publisher=ABC |date=25 September 2015}}</ref>

Clive also participated as a contestant on the 42nd episode of Japanese game show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'' and made a short documentary about it.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

A well known fan of [[motor racing]], James presented the {{f1|1982}}, {{f1|1984}} and {{f1|1986}} official [[Formula One]] season review videos produced by the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], more commonly known as FOCA. James, who attended most F1 races during the 1980s and was a friend of former FOCA boss [[Bernie Ecclestone]], added his own humour to the reviews which became popular with fans of the sport. He also presented ''The Clive James Formula 1 Show'' for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] to coincide with their [[Formula One]] coverage in {{F1|1997}}.<ref name="GuardianObit"/>

He summed up the medium in the introduction to ''Glued to the Box'': "Anyone afraid of what he thinks television does to the world is probably just afraid of the world."<ref>{{cite book|title=Glued to the Box|first=Clive|last=James|date=25 November 1982|publisher=Jonathan Cape Ltd|isbn=0224020668|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gluedtoboxtelevi0000jame_w4e5}}</ref>

== Political views ==
James's political views were prominent in much of his later writing. While [[critic]]al of [[communism]] for its tendency towards [[totalitarianism]], he identified with the left for much of his life. In a 2006 interview in ''The Sunday Times'', James said of himself: "I was brought up on the proletarian left, and I remain there. The fair go for the workers is fundamental, and I don't believe the [[free market]] has a mind."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2442961,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=Interview Clive James | first=Bryan | last=Appleyard | date=12 November 2006 | access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref> In a speech given in 1991, he criticised privatisation: "The idea that Britain's broadcasting system—for all its drawbacks one of the country's greatest institutions—was bound to be improved by being subjected to the conditions of a free market: there was no difficulty in recognising that notion as politically illiterate. But for some reason people did have difficulty in realising that it was economically illiterate too."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clivejames.com/lectures/eve-disaster|title=On the Eve of Disaster|access-date=28 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624183837/http://www.clivejames.com/lectures/eve-disaster|archive-date=24 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2001, James identified as a liberal [[social democrat]].<ref name=artstoday>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/legacy/programs/atoday/stories/s351989.htm|title=Clive James|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>

His later views were more commonly aligned with the political right. James strongly supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], saying in 2007 that "the war only lasted a few days" and that the continuing conflict in Iraq was "the Iraq peace".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/08032007/transcript2.html|access-date=7 May 2009|title=Bill Moyers talks with Cultural Critic, Clive James.|website=[[PBS]]}}</ref> He also wrote that it was "official policy to rape a woman in front of her family" during [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime and that women have enjoyed more rights since the invasion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8064449.stm|access-date=23 May 2009|title=Still looking for the western feminists | work=BBC News | date=22 May 2009}}</ref> 
In 2017, James contributed a chapter to a book on climate change published by the [[Institute of Public Affairs]], advocating [[climate denialism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ipa.org.au/ipa-today/clive-james-chapter-in-climate-change-the-facts-2017|title=Clive James' Chapter in Climate Change: The Facts 2017|date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

Describing religions as "advertising agencies for a product that doesn't exist", James was an [[atheist]] and saw it as the default and obvious position.<ref name="abc.net.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1404736.htm|access-date=16 September 2008|title=Enough Rope with Andrew Denton – episode 84: Clive James (04/07/2005)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010152936/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1404736.htm|archive-date=10 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/audio/3123-discussion-between-richard-dawkins-and-clive-james|access-date=27 August 2010|title=Discussion between Richard Dawkins and Clive James at the Edinburgh Book Festival}}</ref>
