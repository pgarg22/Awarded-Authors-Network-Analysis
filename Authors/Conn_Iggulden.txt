==Career==

===Historical fiction===
Iggulden's debut book was ''[[The Gates of Rome]]'', the first in a currently five-part series entitled [[Emperor (book series)|''Emperor'']]. The series is based around the life of [[Julius Caesar]], from childhood (''The Gates of Rome'') to his eventual betrayal and death (''The Gods of War''). The [[Option (films)|film option]] has been sold to Spitfire Productions (an Intermedia company).

The author has written a fifth book in the series, ''Emperor: The Blood of Gods'', which deals with the rise of [[Augustus]] and events after the end of ''[[The Gods of War]]''. This book was published on 26 September 2013.

After completing the fourth book in the ''Emperor'' series, Iggulden began research for his next series of books, the [[Conqueror (book series)|''Conqueror'' series]], based on the life of [[Mongol]] warlords [[Genghis Khan|Genghis]], [[Ögedei Khan|Ogedai]] and [[Kublai Khan]]. His first book, ''[[Wolf of the Plains|Wolves of the Plains]],'' was available from 2 January 2007. Then followed his second book, ''[[Lords of the Bow|Lord of the Bows]]'', on 2 January 2008. ''[[Bones of the Hills]]'', the third book in the series, was released on 1 September 2008. In September 2010 ''[[Empire of Silver (novel)|Empire of Silver]]'' was released, which revolves around the life of Genghis Khan's son, Ogedai. Whilst Iggulden had initially confirmed on his official website that he would be writing two more books after ''Empire of Silver'' on Kublai Khan, the author's note at the end of ''Conqueror'' states that it would be the last in the series. Iggulden explains his desire to leave the character when he still had much left to accomplish, rather than tracing him through to his eventual downfall, as he did with [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Genghis Khan]].

Iggulden released a four-book series, the ''Wars of the Roses'' series,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/434231/War-Of-The-Roses-Stormbird-by-Conn-Iggulden-review|title=War of the Roses: Stormbird by Conn Iggulden – review|date= 4 October 2013|author= Harry Hodges|work=[[Daily Express]]|access-date=22 January 2015}}</ref> starting with ''Stormbird'' in 2013, ''Margaret of Anjou''<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314120/wars-of-the-roses-margaret-of-anjou-by-conn-iggulden/9780425282427/|title=Wars of the Roses: Margaret of Anjou by Conn Iggulden {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com|language=en-US}}</ref> (called ''Trinity'' in the United Kingdom) in 2014, ''Bloodline''<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314121/wars-of-the-roses-bloodline-by-conn-iggulden/9780399165382|title=Wars of the Roses: Bloodline by Conn Iggulden {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com|language=en-US}}</ref> in 2015, and ''Ravenspur''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ravenspur-conn-iggulden/1123918446#/|title=Ravenspur: Rise of the Tudors|last=Noble|first=Barnes &|website=Barnes & Noble|language=en|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref> in 2016.

In 2017, Iggulden published a historical fiction novel called ''Dunstan'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/284629/dunstan/|title=Dunstan, One Man Will Change the Fate of England by Conn Iggulden|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref> chronicling the life of the 10th century monk and political adviser to the [[House of Wessex|Saxon Kings]] of England, [[Dunstan|St. Dunstan.]]

In 2018, Penguin Books released a historical novel called ''[[The Falcon of Sparta]]'', about the effort of Prince Cyrus to become King of Persia and the stranded 10,000 Greek mercenaries who walked out of Persia while pursued by the King's armies following the [[Battle of Cunaxa]].

===Children's books===
Iggulden co-wrote a book with his brother Hal, ''[[The Dangerous Book for Boys]]''. It covers around eighty topics, from building a [[Gravity racer|soapbox]] racer and tying [[knot]]s, to learning about famous battles and how to make [[Potassium alum|potassium aluminium sulphate]] crystals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6290333.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Conn who? |work=BBC News |date=24 January 2007 |access-date=27 July 2009}}</ref> It was released in the UK in June 2006, reprinted a month later and was voted [[British Book of the Year]] at the Galaxy British Book Awards.

In September 2009 he wrote a children's book ''Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children'' through HarperCollins. Iggulden has since written three stories to accompany the story of the Tollins.<ref>[http://www.savethetollins.com Save The Tollins website]

===Other works===
In March 2006, Iggulden released a novelette entitled ''[[Blackwater (novelette)|Blackwater]]'', part of the ''Quick Reads'' initiative of [[World Book Day]] 2006. Being a thriller, ''Blackwater'' was a change in genre for Iggulden who had mainly written historical fiction.

In 2012 Iggulden added a further quickreads book to the list ''Quantum of Tweed – The Man with a Nissan Micra'' – a comedy about an unwitting hitman.

=== Fantasy novels ===
In 2017, Conn Iggulden released the first book in his first fiction fantasy series, ''Darien: Empire of Salt''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33245839-darien|title=Darien (Empire of Salt #1)|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref> This series is being published under the pen name C.F. Iggulden to avoid confusion with Iggulden's historical fiction novels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} The second book in the series, Shiang, was released on 2018 followed by The Sword Saint in 2019.

===Emperor series film adaptation===
In 2010, there was media coverage toward a proposed epic film ''Emperor: Young Caesar'' to be about the early life of [[Julius Caesar]] covering the years from 92 BC to 71 BC and based on the first two novels of Iggulden's Emperor series, ''[[The Gates of Rome]]'' and ''[[The Death of Kings]]''.  [[Exclusive Media Group]] hired [[Burr Steers]] to direct after they had an adaptation penned by [[William Broyles]] and [[Stephen Harrigan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Bettinger|first=Brendan|title=17 AGAIN Director Burr Steers Will Depict a Teenage Julius Caesar in EMPEROR: YOUNG CAESAR|url=https://collider.com/emperor-young-caesar-burr-steers-conn-iggulden-william-broyles-stephen-harrigan/|access-date=26 May 2010|newspaper=Collider|date=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Burr Steers To Direct Julius Caesar Film Based on Conn Iggulden Novels|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/05/burr-steers-to-direct-julius-caesar-film-based-on-conn-iggulden-novels/|date=26 May 2010|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hazelton|first=John|title=Steers signs to direct Young Ceasar &#91;sic&#93;|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/steers-signs-to-direct-young-ceasar/5014409.article#|access-date=26 June 2013|newspaper=[[Screen Daily]]|date=27 May 2010}}</ref>
