The literary scholar [[Nili Rachel Scharf Gold|Nili Gold]] has described Dan Pagis as an example of a writer whose work reveals the influence of "Mother Tongue" oral and written culture on their Hebrew writing.  She has situated Pagis in this way among a group of Hebrew-language writers that includes [[Yoel Hoffmann|Yoel Hoffman]], [[Yehuda Amichai]], [[Nathan Zach|Natan Zach]], and [[Aharon Appelfeld]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gold|first=Nili|title="Betrayal of the Mother Tongue in the Creation of National Identity," in Ideology and Jewish Identity in Israeli and American Literature, ed.
