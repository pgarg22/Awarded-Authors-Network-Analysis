'''Johann Christoph Friedrich''' ('''von''') '''Schiller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjoːhan ˈkʁɪstɔf ˈfʁiːdʁɪç fɔn ˈʃɪlɐ|lang}}<small>, short:</small> {{IPA-de|ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈʃɪlɐ||De-Friedrich Schiller.ogg}}; 10 November 1759{{spaced ndash}}9 May 1805) was a [[Germans|German]] [[playwright]], [[poet]], and [[philosopher]]. During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller developed a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. They frequently discussed issues concerning [[aesthetics]], and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works that he had left as sketches. This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as [[Weimar Classicism]]. They also worked together on ''[[Xenien]]'', a collection of short [[satirical]] poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents of their philosophical vision.

==Early life and career==
Friedrich Schiller was born on 10 November 1759, in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]], [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]], as the only son of military doctor {{interlanguage link|Johann Kaspar Schiller|de}} (1733–1796) and {{interlanguage link|Elisabetha Dorothea Schiller|de|lt=Elisabeth Dorothea Kodweiß}} (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including [[Christophine Reinwald|Christophine]], the eldest. Schiller grew up in a very religious family and spent much of his youth studying the [[Bible]], which would later influence his writing for the theatre.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoflite00jame_1|title = Frederich Schiller|last = Simons|first = John D|journal = Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 94: German Writers in the Age of Goethe: Sturm und Drang to Classicism|date = 1990|isbn = 978-0-8103-4574-4|url-access = registration}}</ref> His father was away in the [[Seven Years' War]] when Friedrich was born. He was named after king [[Frederick the Great]], but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=18}} Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=20}} When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]]. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to the nearby town of [[Lorch (Württemberg)|Lorch]].{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|pp=20–21}}

Although the family was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He sometimes took his son with him.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=23}} In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=24}} Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a [[priest]], they had the priest of the village instruct the boy in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Father Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play ''Die Räuber'' (''[[The Robbers]]'') after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited by the idea of becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=25}}

In 1766, the family left Lorch for the Duke of Württemberg's principal residence, [[Ludwigsburg]]. Schiller's father had not been paid for three years, and the family had been living on their savings but could no longer afford to do so. So Kaspar Schiller took an assignment to the garrison in Ludwigsburg.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=27}}
[[File:Gerhard von Kügelgen 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Friedrich Schiller by [[Gerhard von Kügelgen]]]]
There the boy Schiller came to the attention of [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg|Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]]. He entered the [[Karlsschule Stuttgart]] (an elite military academy founded by the Duke), in 1773, where he eventually studied medicine. During most of his short life, he suffered from illnesses that he tried to cure himself.

While at the Karlsschule, Schiller read [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and Goethe and discussed [[Classics|Classical]] ideals with his classmates. At school, he wrote his first play, ''The Robbers'', which dramatizes the conflict between two aristocratic brothers: the elder, Karl Moor, leads a group of rebellious students into the Bohemian forest where they become Robin Hood-like bandits, while Franz Moor, the younger brother, schemes to inherit his father's considerable estate. The play's critique of social corruption and its affirmation of proto-revolutionary republican ideals astounded its original audience. Schiller became an overnight sensation. Later, Schiller would be made an honorary member of the French Republic because of this play. The play was inspired by [[Johann Anton Leisewitz|Leisewitz']] earlier play ''[[Julius of Taranto]]'', a favourite of the young Schiller.<ref name="britannica-Leisewitz" />

In 1780, he obtained a post as regimental doctor in [[Stuttgart]], a job he disliked. In order to attend the first performance of ''The Robbers'' in [[Mannheim]], Schiller left his regiment without permission. As a result, he was arrested, sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, and forbidden by Karl Eugen from publishing any further works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studiocleo.com/librarie/schiller/biography.html |title=Friedrich Schiller biography |publisher=Studiocleo.com |access-date=6 November 2013}}</ref>

He fled Stuttgart in 1782, going via [[Frankfurt]], Mannheim, [[Leipzig]], and [[Dresden]] to [[Weimar]]. Along this journey he had an affair with an army officer's wife, [[Charlotte von Kalb]]. She was at the centre of an intellectual circle, and she was known for her cleverness and instability. Schiller needed help from his family and friends to extricate himself from his financial situation and attachment to a married woman.<ref name=brit>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Schiller Friedrich Schiller], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', retrieved 1 May 2021</ref> Schiller settled in Weimar in 1787. In 1789, he was appointed professor of [[Philosophy of history|History and Philosophy]] in [[Jena]], where he wrote only historical works.

==Marriage and family==

On 22 February 1790, Schiller married [[Charlotte von Lengefeld]] (1766–1826). Two sons (Karl Friedrich Ludwig and Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm) and two daughters (Karoline Luise Henriette and Luise Henriette Emilie) were born between 1793 and 1804. The last living descendant of Schiller was a grandchild of Emilie, Baron [[Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm]], who died at [[Baden-Baden]], Germany, in 1947.<ref>[https://www.schillersgeburtshaus.de/seite/315883/schillers-familie.html Shillers familie] at the Schiller Birth House Museum's site (in German)</ref>

==Weimar and later career==
Schiller returned with his family to Weimar from Jena in 1799. Goethe convinced him to return to playwriting. He and Goethe founded the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Weimar Theater]], which became the leading theater in Germany. Their collaboration helped lead to a renaissance of drama in Germany.

For his achievements, Schiller was [[Nobility|ennobled]] in 1802 by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, adding the nobiliary particle "[[von]]" to his name.<ref name=brit /> He remained in Weimar, [[Saxe-Weimar]] until his death at 45 from [[tuberculosis]] in 1805.

==Legacy and honors==
[[File:Schiller edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lithography|Lithograph]] portrait from 1905, captioned "Friedrich von Schiller" in recognition of his 1802 ennoblement]]
The first authoritative biography of Schiller was by his sister-in-law [[Caroline von Wolzogen]] in 1830, ''{{Lang|de|Schillers Leben}}'' (Schiller's Life).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharpe|first=Lesley|date=April 1999|title=Female Illness and Male Heroism: The Works of Caroline von Wolzogen|journal=German Life and Letters|volume=52|issue=2|pages=184–196|doi=10.1111/1468-0483.00129|pmid=20677404}}</ref>

The coffin containing what was purportedly Schiller's skeleton was brought in 1827 into the [[Weimarer Fürstengruft]] (Weimar's Ducal Vault), the burial place of the house of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in the [[Klassik Stiftung Weimar|Historical Cemetery of Weimar]] and later also Goethe's resting place. On 3 May 2008, scientists announced that DNA tests have shown that the [[Friedrich Schiller's skull|skull of this skeleton]] is not Schiller's, and his tomb is now vacant.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/0,1518,551284,00.html "Schädel in Schillers Sarg wurde ausgetauscht" (Skull in Schiller's coffin has been exchanged)], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 3 May 2008.<br />[https://www.welt.de/kultur/article1962670/Schaedel_in_Weimar_gehoert_nicht_Schiller.html "Schädel in Weimar gehört nicht Schiller" (Skull in Weimar does not belong to Schiller)], ''[[Die Welt]]'', 3 May 2008.</ref> The physical resemblance between this skull and the extant [[death mask]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sammlungen.hu-berlin.de/dokumente/7882/ |title=Death Mask |publisher=Sammlungen.hu-berlin.de |access-date=6 November 2013}}</ref> as well as to portraits of Schiller, had led many experts to believe that the skull was Schiller's.

[[File:Stuttgart-schillerplatz-2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Germany's oldest Schiller memorial (1839) on Schillerplatz, Stuttgart]]
The city of Stuttgart erected in 1839 a statue in his memory on a square renamed [[Schillerplatz (Stuttgart)|Schillerplatz]]. A [[Schiller Monument (Berlin)|Schiller monument]] was unveiled on Berlin's [[Gendarmenmarkt]] in 1871.

The German-American community of New York City donated a bronze sculpture of Schiller to [[Central Park]] in 1859. It was Central Park's [[List of sculptures in Central Park|first installed sculpture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/central-park/highlights/13316|title=New York City Department of Parks and Recreation Website|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>

Schiller Park in Columbus, Ohio is named for Schiller, and has been centered on a statue of his likeness since it was donated in 1891. During the First World War, the name of the park was changed to Washington Park in response to anti-German sentiment, but was changed back several years later. It is the primary park for the South Side neighborhood of German Village. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://germanvillage.com/visitors-center/stroll/schiller-park/|title = Schiller Park}}</ref>

There is a Friedrich Schiller statue on [[Belle Isle Park (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] in Detroit Michigan. This statue of the German playwright was commissioned by Detroit's German-American community in 1908 at a cost of $12,000; the designer was Herman Matzen.

His image appeared on the [[German Democratic Republic]] 10 Mark banknotes of the 1964 emission.<ref>[http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/EUR/GDR/GDR0023.htm German Democratic Republic, 10 Mark der DDR 1964], Banknote.ws</ref>

In September 2008, Schiller was voted by the audience of the TV channel [[Arte]] as the second most important playwright in Europe after [[William Shakespeare]].

On 10 November 2019, [[Google]] celebrated his 260th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/friedrich-von-schillers-260th-birthday|title=Friedrich von Schiller's 260th Birthday|website=Google|date=10 November 2019}}</ref>

===Freemasonry===
Some Freemasons speculate that Schiller was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], but this has not been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/schiller_f/schiller_f.html |title=Friedrich von Schiller |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |access-date=6 November 2013}}</ref>

In 1787, in his tenth letter about ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'', Schiller wrote:
{{quote|I am neither [[Illuminati]] nor Mason, but if the fraternization has a moral purpose in common with one another, and if this purpose for human society is the most important, ...<ref name=IFL>Eugen Lennhoff, Oskar Posner, Dieter A. Binder: ''Internationales Freimaurer Lexikon''. Herbig publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7766-2478-6}}</ref>}}

In a letter from 1829, two Freemasons from [[Rudolstadt]] complain about the dissolving of their Lodge ''Günther zum stehenden Löwen'' that was honoured by the initiation of Schiller. According to Schiller's great-grandson Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm, Schiller was brought to the Lodge by ''Wilhelm Heinrich Karl von Gleichen-Rußwurm''. No membership document has been found.<ref name=IFL />

===Philosophical papers===

The statue is on a stone pedestal, which has a plaque that reads "Dem Dichterpaar/Goethe und Schiller/das Vaterland".]]
Schiller wrote many philosophical papers on ethics and [[aesthetics]]. He synthesized the thought of [[Immanuel Kant]] with the thought of the [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]]. He elaborated upon [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s concept of ''{{Lang|de|die schöne Seele}}'' (the beautiful soul), a human being whose emotions have been educated by reason, so that ''{{Lang|de|Pflicht und Neigung}}'' (duty and inclination) are no longer in conflict with one another; thus beauty, for Schiller, is not merely an aesthetic experience, but a moral one as well: the Good is the Beautiful. The link between morality and aesthetics also occurs in Schiller's controversial poem, "[[Die Götter Griechenlandes]]" (The Gods of Greece). The "gods" in Schiller's poem are thought by modern scholars to represent moral and aesthetic values, which Schiller tied to [[Paganism]] and an idea of [[animism|enchanted nature]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=82–83}} In this respect, Schiller's aesthetic doctrine shows the influence of [[Christian theosophy]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=81}}

There is general consensus among scholars that it makes sense to think of Schiller as a [[liberalism|liberal]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Nicholas |title=Schiller: A Birmingham Symposium |date=2006 |publisher=Rodopi |page=257}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=John|author-link=John Gray (philosopher)|title=Liberalism |date=1995 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |page=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=Lesley |title=Friedrich Schiller: Drama, Thought and Politics |date=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=2}}</ref> and he is frequently cited as a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] thinker.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Duncan|author-link=Duncan Bell (historian)|title=Ethics and World Politics|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=147|isbn=978-0-19-954862-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanahuja |first1=Lorena Cebolla |last2=Ghia |first2=Francesco |title=Cosmopolitanism: Between Ideals and Reality |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages=43–44}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cavallar |first1=Georg |title=Imperfect Cosmopolis: Studies in the history of international legal theory and cosmopolitan ideas |date=2011 |publisher=University of Wales Press |page=41}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=Lesley |title=Schiller's Aesthetic Essays: Two Centuries of Criticism |date=1995 |publisher=Camden House |page=58}}</ref> Schiller's philosophical work was particularly concerned with the question of human freedom, a preoccupation which also guided his historical research, such as on the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Dutch Revolt]], and then found its way as well into his dramas: the [[Wallenstein (trilogy of plays)|''Wallenstein'' trilogy]] concerns the Thirty Years' War, while ''Don Carlos'' addresses the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain. Schiller wrote two important essays on the question of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] (''{{Lang|de|das Erhabene}}''), entitled "{{Lang|de|Vom Erhabenen}}" and "{{Lang|de|Über das Erhabene}}"; these essays address one aspect of human freedom—the ability to defy one's animal instincts, such as the drive for self-preservation, when, for example, someone willingly sacrifices themselves for conceptual ideals.

===Plays===
Schiller is considered by most Germans to be Germany's most important classical playwright. Critics like F. J. Lamport and [[Eric Auerbach]] have noted his innovative use of dramatic structure and his creation of new forms, such as the melodrama and the bourgeois tragedy.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} What follows is a brief chronological description of the plays.
* ''[[The Robbers]]'' (''Die Räuber''): The language of ''The Robbers'' is highly emotional, and the depiction of physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany's [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement. ''The Robbers'' is considered by critics like [[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]] to be the first European [[melodrama]]. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the [[Bohemian Forest]]. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies of class and religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play ''[[Julius of Taranto]]'' by [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]].<ref name="britannica-Leisewitz">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335498/Johann-Anton-Leisewitz?anchor=ref141414 "Johann Anton Leisewitz"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref>
* ''[[Fiesco (play)|Fiesco]]'' (''Die Verschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua''):
* ''[[Intrigue and Love]]'' (''Kabale und Liebe''): The aristocratic Ferdinand von Walter wishes to marry Luise Miller, the bourgeois daughter of the city's music instructor. Court politics involving the duke's beautiful but conniving mistress Lady Milford and Ferdinand's ruthless father create a disastrous situation reminiscent of Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Schiller develops his criticisms of absolutism and bourgeois hypocrisy in this [[bourgeois tragedy]]. Act 2, scene 2 is an anti-British [[parody]] that depicts a firing-squad massacre. Young Germans who refused to join the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]] and British to quash the [[American Revolutionary War]] are fired upon.<ref name=Ode>''The Autobiography of Col. John Trumbull'', Sizer 1953 ed., p. 184, n. 13</ref>
* ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'': This play marks Schiller's entrée into historical drama. Very loosely based on the events surrounding the real [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Don Carlos]] of Spain, Schiller's Don Carlos is another republican figure—he attempts to free Flanders from the despotic grip of his father, King [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip]]. The Marquis Posa's famous speech to the king proclaims Schiller's belief in personal freedom and democracy.
* The [[Wallenstein (trilogy of plays)|''Wallenstein'' trilogy]]: Consisting of ''Wallenstein's Camp'', ''The Piccolomini'', and ''Wallenstein's Death'', these plays tell the story of the last days and assassination of the treasonous commander [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]].
* ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'' (''Maria Stuart''): This history of the Scottish queen, who was Elizabeth I's rival, portrays Mary Stuart as a tragic heroine, misunderstood and used by ruthless politicians, including and especially, Elizabeth.[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img49 Schiller monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument in [[Kaliningrad]] (formerly [[Königsberg]]), Russia]]
* ''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' (''Die Jungfrau von Orleans''): about [[Joan of Arc]]
* ''[[The Bride of Messina]]'' (''Die Braut von Messina'')
* ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'' (''Wilhelm Tell'')
* ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' (unfinished)

===''Aesthetic Letters''===
{{main|Play drive}}
A pivotal work by Schiller was ''On the Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters''<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/schiller-education.html "Letters Upon The Aesthetic Education of Man"], [[Fordham University]]</ref> (''Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen''), first published 1794, which was inspired by the great disenchantment Schiller felt about the [[French Revolution]], its degeneration into violence and the failure of successive governments to put its ideals into practice.<ref>Schiller, ''On the Aesthetic Education of Man'', ed. Elizabeth M. Wilkinson and [[L. A. Willoughby]], 1967</ref> Schiller wrote that "a great moment has found a little people"; he wrote the ''Letters'' as a philosophical inquiry into what had gone wrong, and how to prevent such tragedies in the future. In the ''Letters'' he asserts that it is possible to elevate the moral character of a people, by first touching their souls with beauty, an idea that is also found in his poem ''Die Künstler'' (''The Artists''): "Only through Beauty's morning-gate, dost thou penetrate the land of knowledge."

On the philosophical side, ''Letters'' put forth the notion of ''der sinnliche Trieb / Sinnestrieb'' ("the sensuous drive") and ''Formtrieb'' ("the formal drive"). In a comment to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy, Schiller transcends the dualism between ''Formtrieb'' and ''Sinnestrieb'' with the notion of ''Spieltrieb'' ("the [[play drive]]"), derived from, as are a number of other terms, Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgment|Critique of the Faculty of Judgment]]''. The conflict between man's material, sensuous nature and his capacity for reason (''Formtrieb'' being the drive to impose conceptual and moral order on the world), Schiller resolves with the happy union of ''Formtrieb'' and ''Sinnestrieb'', the "play drive," which for him is synonymous with artistic beauty, or "living form." On the basis of ''Spieltrieb'', Schiller sketches in ''Letters'' a future ''ideal state'' (a [[utopia|eutopia]]), where everyone will be content, and everything will be beautiful, thanks to the free play of ''Spieltrieb''. Schiller's focus on the dialectical interplay between ''Formtrieb'' and ''Sinnestrieb'' has inspired a wide range of succeeding aesthetic philosophical theory, including notably [[Jacques Rancière]]'s conception of the "aesthetic regime of art," as well as social philosophy in [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In the second part of his important work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Marcuse finds Schiller's notion of ''Spieltrieb'' useful in thinking a social situation without the condition of modern [[social alienation]]. He writes, "Schiller's ''Letters'' ... aim at remaking of civilization by virtue of the liberating force of the aesthetic function: it is envisaged as containing the possibility of a new reality principle."<ref>[[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse, Herbert]]. ''[[Eros and Civilization]]''. Beacon Press. 1966</ref>

==Musical settings==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] said that a great poem is more difficult to set to music than a merely good one because the composer must rise higher than the poet – "who can do that in the case of Schiller? In this respect Goethe is much easier," wrote Beethoven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beethoven: the man and the artist, as revealed by his own words, Project Gutenberg.|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3528/3528-h/3528-h.htm|access-date=20 November 2011}}</ref>

There are relatively few famous musical settings of Schiller's poems. Notable exceptions are Beethoven's setting of "An die Freude" (''[[Ode to Joy]]'')<ref name=Ode /> in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], [[Johannes Brahms]]' choral setting of "[[Nänie]]" and "[[Des Mädchens Klage]]" by [[Franz Schubert]], who set 44 of Schiller's poems<ref>[http://brittlebooks.library.illinois.edu/brittlebooks_open/Books2010-04/schufr0001fifson/schufr0001fifson.pdf Fifty Songs by Franz Schubert by Henry T. Finck] Published in 1904 by Oliver Ditson Company</ref> as [[Lied]]er, mostly for voice and piano, also including "[[Die Bürgschaft]]". In 2005 [[Graham Waterhouse]] set ''[[Der Handschuh (Waterhouse)|Der Handschuh]]'' (The Glove) for cello and speaking voice.
[[File:Ferdinand Carl Christian Jagemann Schiller auf dem Totenbette 1805.jpeg|thumb|upright|Schiller on his deathbed – drawing by the portraitist [[Ferdinand Jagemann]], 1805]]
The Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] admired Schiller greatly and adapted several of his stage plays for his operas:
* ''[[I masnadieri]]'' is based on ''[[The Robbers]]''
* ''[[Giovanna d'Arco]]'' is based on ''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]''
* ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' is based on ''[[Intrigue and Love]]''
* ''[[La forza del destino]]'' is based partly on ''[[Wallenstein (play)|Wallenstein]]'s Camp''
* ''[[Don Carlos]]'' is based on the [[Don Carlos (play)|play of the same title]]
[[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti's]] ''[[Maria Stuarda]]'' is based on ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]''; [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'' is an adaptation of ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]''. [[Nicola Vaccai]]'s ''Giovanna d'Arco'' (1827) is based on ''The Maid of Orleans'', and his ''La sposa di Messina'' (1839) on ''The Bride of Messina''. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s 1881 opera ''[[The Maid of Orleans (opera)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' is partly based on Schiller's work. German-Russian composer [[Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova]] created a musical setting for Schiler's ''William Tell'' in 1935.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Aaron I.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16714846|title=International encyclopedia of women composers|date=1987|isbn=0-9617485-2-4|edition=Second edition, revised and enlarged|location=New York|oclc=16714846}}</ref> The 20th-century composer [[Giselher Klebe]] adapted ''The Robbers'' for his first opera of [[Die Räuber (opera)|the same name]], which premiered in 1957.

==Schiller's burial==
A poem written about the poet's burial:

{{poemquote|
Two dim and paltry torches that the raging storm
And rain at any moment threaten to put out.
A waving pall. A vulgar coffin made of pine
With not a wreath, not e'en the poorest, and no train –
As if a crime were swiftly carried to the grave!
The bearers hastened onward. One unknown alone,
Round whom a mantle waved of wide and noble fold,
Followed this coffin. 'Twas the Spirit of Mankind.|[[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Munsterberg|first=Margarete|title=A Harvest of German Verse|url=https://archive.org/details/aharvestgermanv00munsgoog|year=1916|publisher=D.
