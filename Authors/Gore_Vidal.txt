'''Eugene Luther Gore Vidal''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ᵻ|ˈ|d|ɑː|l}}; born '''Eugene Louis Vidal''', October 3, 1925 – July 31, 2012) was an American writer and [[public intellectual]] known for his [[epigram]]matic [[wit]], erudition, and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] manner. Vidal was [[bisexual]], and in his novels and essays interrogated the social and cultural sexual [[Social norm|norms]] he perceived as driving American life.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vidal |first1=Gore |title=United States, Essays 1952-1992 |publisher=Random House}}</ref> Beyond literature, Vidal was heavily involved in politics. He twice sought office—unsuccessfully—as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate, first in 1960 to the [[United States House of Representatives]] (for New York), and later in 1982 to the [[U.S. Senate]] (for California).

A grandson of a U.S. Senator, Vidal was born into an upper-class political family. As a political commentator and essayist, Vidal's primary focus was the [[History of the United States|history]] and [[society of the United States]], especially how a [[militaristic]] [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] reduced the country to a [[American imperialism|decadent empire]].<ref>Wiener, Jon. ''I Told You So: Gore Vidal Talks Politics'' Counter Point Press; Berkeley (2012) pp. 54–55</ref> His political and cultural essays were published in ''[[The Nation]]'', the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazines. As a public intellectual, Gore Vidal's topical debates on sex, politics, and religion with other intellectuals and writers occasionally turned into quarrels with the likes of [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] and [[Norman Mailer]].

As a novelist, Vidal explored the nature of corruption in public and private life. His style of narration evoked the time and place of his stories, and delineated the [[psychology]] of his characters.<ref>Murphy, Bruce. ''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' (Fourth Edition) HarperCollins Publishers (1996) p. 1,080.</ref> His third novel, ''[[The City and the Pillar]]'' (1948), offended the literary, political, and moral sensibilities of conservative book reviewers, the plot being about a dispassionately presented male homosexual relationship.<ref>Terry, C.V. ''New York Times Book Review'', "The City and the Pillar" January 11, 1948, p. 22.</ref> In the historical novel genre, Vidal recreated the imperial world of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] (r. AD 361–63) in ''[[Julian (novel)|Julian]]'' (1964). Julian was the Roman emperor who espoused "religious tolerance" in order to re-establish [[pagan]] [[polytheism]] to [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of state paganism|counter Christianity]].<ref>Hornblower, Simon & Spawforth, Editors. ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization'' Oxford University Press. (1998) pp. 383–84.</ref> In social satire, ''[[Myra Breckinridge]]'' (1968) explores the mutability of gender roles and sexual orientation as being social constructs established by [[Mores|social mores]].<ref name="Kiernan-1982">{{cite book |last1=Kiernan |first1=Robert F |title=Gore Vidal |date=1982 |publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing |isbn=9780804424615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzUgAQAAIAAJ&q=Kiernan,+Robert+F.+Gore+Vidal |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>{{RP|94-100}} In ''[[Burr (novel)|Burr]]'' (1973) and ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]'' (1984), each protagonist is presented as "A Man of the People" and as "A Man" in a narrative exploration of how the public and private facets of personality affect the national politics of the United States.<ref name="Palimpsest-1995">{{cite book |last1=Vidal |first1=Gore |title=Palimpsest: A Memoir |date=1995 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780679440383 |url=https://archive.org/details/palimpsestmemoir0000vida |url-access=registration |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>{{RP|439}}<ref name="Kiernan-1982" />{{RP|75-85}}

Raised in Washington, D.C., Vidal attended the [[Sidwell Friends School]] and St. Albans School.

He visited for the first time Rome, the city which came to be "at the center of Gore's literary imagination", and Paris. When the [[World War II|Second World War]] began in early September, the group was forced to an early return home; on his way back, he and his colleagues stopped in Great Britain, and they met the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Joe Kennedy]] (the father of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], later the President of the United States of America).<ref>Jay Parini, ''Every time a friend succeeds, something inside me dies: The Life of Gore Vidal'' (London: Little, Brown, 2015), 27–28. )</ref> In 1940 he attended the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]] and later transferred to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], where he contributed to [[the Exonian]], the school newspaper.<ref>''Gore Vidal: A Critical Companion'', Susan Baker, Curtis S. Gibson. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. {{ISBN|0-313-29579-4}}. p. 3.</ref>

After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], rather than attend university, Vidal enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] at age 17 and was assigned to work as an office clerk in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|USAAF]]. Later, Vidal passed the examinations necessary to become a maritime [[warrant officer]] (junior grade) in the [[US Army Transportation Corps|Transportation Corps]], and subsequently served as first mate of the ''F.S. 35th'', a US Army Freight and Supply (FS) ship berthed at [[Dutch Harbor]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]]. After three years in service, Vidal suffered [[hypothermia]], developed [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and, consequently, was reassigned to duty as a mess officer.<ref>Vidal, Gore. ''Williwaw'', "Preface", p. 1.</ref>

==Literary career==
The literary works of Vidal were influenced by numerous other writers, poets and playwrights, novelists and essayists. These include, from antiquity, [[Petronius]] (d. AD 66), [[Juvenal]] (AD 60–140), and [[Apuleius]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] c. AD 155); and from the post-Renaissance, [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533-1592), [[Thomas Love Peacock]] (1785–1866), and [[George Meredith]] (1828–1909). More recent literary influences included [[Marcel Proust]] (1871–1922), [[Henry James]] (1843–1916), and [[Evelyn Waugh]] (1903–1966).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3917/the-art-of-fiction-no-50-gore-vidal|title=Paris Review – The Art of Fiction No. 50, Gore Vidal|year=1974|volume=Fall 1974|issue=59|access-date=November 29, 2010|archive-date=October 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028143626/http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3917/the-art-of-fiction-no-50-gore-vidal|url-status=live|last1=Clarke|first1=Interviewed by Gerald}}</ref> The cultural critic [[Harold Bloom]] has written that Gore Vidal believed that his sexuality had denied him full recognition from the literary community in the United States. Bloom himself contends that such limited recognition more resulted from Vidal's "best fictions" being "distinguished historical novels", a subgenre "no longer available for canonization".<ref name="Bloom1994">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-QzKinSsz0C|access-date=August 1, 2012|year=1994|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-57322-514-4|page=21|archive-date=September 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919025924/https://books.google.com/books?id=_-QzKinSsz0C|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1960s, Vidal published [[Julian (novel)|''Julian'']] (1964), about the Roman Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] (r. A.D. 361–363), who sought to reinstate [[polytheism|polytheistic paganism]] when Julian viewed that Christianity threatened the cultural integrity of the Roman Empire, [[Washington, D.C. (novel)|''Washington, D.C.'']] (1967), about political life during the presidential era of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1933-1945), and ''[[Myra Breckinridge]]'' (1968), a satire of the American movie business, by way of a school of dramatic arts owned by a [[transsexual]] woman, the eponymous anti-heroine.

After publishing the plays [[Weekend (play)|''Weekend'']] (1968) and ''[[An Evening With Richard Nixon]]'' (1972) and the novel ''Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir'' (1970), Vidal concentrated upon the essay and developed two types of fiction. The first type is about American history, novels specifically about the nature of national politics.<ref name="NYTimes -7-jul-1970">{{cite news|author=Leonard, John|author-link=John Leonard (critic)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/vidal-sisters.html|title=Not Enough Blood, Not Enough Gore|work=The New York Times|date=July 7, 1970|access-date=October 30, 2008|archive-date=April 10, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410073540/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/vidal-sisters.html|url-status=live}}</ref> ''The New York Times'', quoting critic Harold Bloom about those historical novels, said that Vidal's imagination of American politics "is so powerful as to compel awe."<ref name=NYTobit /> The historical novels formed the seven-book series, [[Narratives of Empire]]: (i) ''[[Burr (novel)|Burr]]'' (1973), (ii) ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]'' (1984), (iii) ''[[1876 (novel)|1876]]'' (1976), (iv) ''[[Empire (Vidal novel)|Empire]]'' (1987), (v) ''[[Hollywood (Vidal novel)|Hollywood]]'' (1990), (vi) ''Washington, D.C.'' (1967) and (vii) ''[[The Golden Age (Gore Vidal novel)|The Golden Age]]'' (2000). Besides U.S. history, Vidal also explored and analyzed the history of the ancient world, specifically the [[Axial age|Axial Age]] (800–200 B.C.), with the novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'' (1981). The novel was published without four chapters that were part of the manuscript he submitted to the publisher; years later, Vidal restored the chapters to the text and re-published the novel ''Creation'' in 2002.

The second type of fiction is the topical satire, such as ''[[Myron (novel)|Myron]]'' (1974) the sequel to ''Myra Breckinridge''; ''[[Kalki (novel)|Kalki]]'' (1978), about the end of the world and the consequent ennui; ''[[Duluth (novel)|Duluth]]'' (1983), an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] story; ''[[Live from Golgotha: The Gospel according to Gore Vidal|Live from Golgotha]]'' (1992), about the adventures of Timothy, Bishop of Macedonia, in the early days of Christianity; and ''[[Smithsonian Institution (novel)|The Smithsonian Institution]]'' (1998), a time-travel story.

In the United States, Vidal is often considered an essayist rather than a novelist.<ref>{{cite news |first=Deborah |last=Solomon |title=Literary Lion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15wwln-Q4-t.html?ref=magazine |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=June 15, 2008 |access-date=June 29, 2008 |archive-date=December 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210225213/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15wwln-Q4-t.html?ref=magazine |url-status=live }}</ref> Even the occasionally hostile literary critic, such as [[Martin Amis]], admitted that "Essays are what he is good at ... [Vidal] is learned, funny, and exceptionally clear-sighted. Even his blind spots are illuminating."

For six decades, Vidal applied himself to socio-political, sexual, historical and literary subjects. In the essay anthology ''Armageddon'' (1987) he explored the intricacies of power (political and cultural) in the contemporary United States. His criticism of the incumbent U.S. president, [[Ronald Reagan]], as a "triumph of the embalmer's art" communicated that Reagan's provincial worldview, and that of his administration's, was out of date and inadequate to the [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] realities of the world in the late twentieth century. In 1993, Vidal won the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]] for the anthology [[United States (essays)|''United States: Essays 1952–92'']] (1993).<ref name=nba1993>[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1993 "National Book Awards&nbsp;– 1993"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029015053/http://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1993/ |date=October 29, 2018 }}. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-12.<br />(With acceptance speech by Vidal, read by Harry Evans.)</ref>

In 2000, Vidal published the collection of essays, ''[[The Last Empire]]'', then such self-described "pamphlets" as ''Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace'', ''Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta'' and ''Imperial America'', critiques of American expansionism, the [[military–industrial complex]], the national security state and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. Vidal also wrote a historical essay about the U.S. founding fathers, ''[[Inventing a Nation]]''. In 1995, he published a memoir [[Palimpsest (memoir)|''Palimpsest'']] and in 2006 its follow-up volume, ''[[Point to Point Navigation]]''. Earlier that year, Vidal had published ''[[Clouds and Eclipses: The Collected Short Stories]].''

===Hollywood===
[[File:Broogoldvidawild.jpg|thumb|upright|Vidal (second from right) supporting the [[1981 Writers Guild of America strike]]]]
In 1956, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] hired Gore Vidal as a [[screenwriter|screenplay writer]] with a four-year employment contract. In 1958, the director [[William Wyler]] required a [[script doctor]] to rewrite the screenplay for [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|''Ben-Hur'']] (1959), originally written by [[Karl Tunberg]]. As one of several script doctors assigned to the project, Vidal rewrote significant portions of the script to resolve ambiguities of character motivation, specifically to clarify the enmity between the Jewish protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, and the Roman antagonist, Messala, who had been close boyhood friends. In exchange for rewriting the ''Ben-Hur'' screenplay, on location in Italy, Vidal negotiated the early termination (at the two-year mark) of his four-year contract with MGM.<ref name="Palimpsest-1995" /><ref>{{RP|301–307}}</ref>

Thirty-six years later, in the documentary film ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' (1995), Vidal explained that Messala's failed attempt at resuming their homosexual, boyhood relationship motivated the ostensibly political enmity between Ben-Hur ([[Charlton Heston]]) and Messala ([[Stephen Boyd]]). Vidal said that Boyd was aware of the homosexual subtext to the scene and that the director, the producer and the screenwriter agreed to keep Heston ignorant of the subtext, lest he refuse to play the scene.<ref name="Palimpsest-1995" /><ref>{{RP|306}}</ref> In turn, on learning of that script-doctor explanation, Charlton Heston said that Vidal had contributed little to the script of ''Ben-Hur''.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Commanding Presence: Actor Charlton Heston Sets His Epic Career in Stone – or At Least on Paper |author=Mick LaSalle |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 2, 1995 |page=E1}}</ref> Despite Vidal's script-doctor resolution of the character's motivations, the [[Screen Writers Guild]] assigned formal screenwriter-credit to Karl Tunberg, in accordance with the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]], which favored the "original author" of a screenplay, rather than the writer of the filmed screenplay.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gore Vidal, Aloof in Art and Life |author=Ned Rorem |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 12, 1999 |page=18S}}</ref>

Two plays, ''The Best Man: A Play about Politics'' (1960, made into a [[The Best Man (1964 film)|film]] in 1964) and ''Visit to a Small Planet'' (1955) were theater and movie successes. Vidal occasionally returned to the movie business, and wrote historically accurate teleplays and screenplays about subjects important to him. [[Billy the Kid (1989 film)|''Billy the Kid'']] (1989) is one, about [[William H. Bonney]], a gunman in the New Mexico territory [[Lincoln County War]] (1878), and later an outlaw in the U.S. Western frontier. Another is 1979's [[Caligula (film)|''Caligula'']] (based upon the life of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Caligula]]).,<ref name="Time-3-jan-1977">"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947822,00.html Show Business: Will the Real Caligula Stand Up?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022172027/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947822,00.html |date=October 22, 2010 }}", ''Time'' January 3, 1977.</ref> from which Vidal had his screenwriter credit removed because the producer, [[Bob Guccione]], the director, [[Tinto Brass]] and the leading actor, [[Malcolm McDowell]], rewrote the script to add extra sex and violence to increase its commercial success.

In the 1960s, Vidal migrated to Italy, where he befriended the film director [[Federico Fellini]], for whom he appeared in a cameo role in the film ''[[Roma (1972 film)|Roma]]'' (1972). He also acted in the films ''[[Bob Roberts]]'' (1992), a serio-comedy about a [[reactionary]] populist politician who manipulates youth culture to win votes; ''[[With Honors (film)|With Honors]]'' (1994) an [[Ivy league]] comedy-drama; ''[[Gattaca]]'' (1997), a science-fiction drama about [[genetic engineering]]; and ''[[Igby Goes Down]]'' (2002), a coming-of-age serio-comedy directed by his nephew, Burr Steers.

===Political campaigns===

In 1960, Vidal was the Democratic candidate for Congress for the [[New York's 29th congressional district|29th Congressional District]] of New York, a usually Republican district on the Hudson River but lost to the Republican candidate [[J.

In 1982, he campaigned against [[Jerry Brown]], the incumbent Governor of California, in the Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate; Vidal forecast accurately that the opposing Republican candidate would win the election.<ref name="vidal_correx_july_2011">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402190800/http://www.gorevidalnow.com/in-which-gore-vidal-corrects-his-wikipedia-page/ Archived from gorevidalnow.com], in which Gore Vidal corrects his Wikipedia page</ref> That foray into senatorial politics is the subject of the documentary film ''[[Gore Vidal: The Man Who Said No]]'' (1983), directed by [[Gary Conklin]].

In a 2001 article, "The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh", Gore undertook to discover why domestic terrorist [[Timothy McVeigh]] perpetrated the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995. He concluded that McVeigh (a politically disillusioned U.S. Army veteran of the [[Gulf War|First Iraq War]], 1990–91) had destroyed the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] as an act of revenge for the FBI's [[Waco massacre]] (1993) at the [[Branch Davidian]] Compound in Texas, believing that the U.S. government had mistreated Americans in the same manner that he believed that the U.S. Army had mistreated the Iraqis. In concluding the Vanity Fair article, Vidal refers to McVeigh as an "unlikely sole mover," and theorizes that foreign/domestic conspiracies could have been involved.<ref>Gore Vidal, [http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2001/09/mcveigh200109?printable=true&currentPage=all "The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530073906/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2001/09/mcveigh200109?printable=true&currentPage=all |date=May 30, 2010 }}.

Vidal became a member of the board of advisors of [[The World Can't Wait]], a political organization which sought to publicly repudiate the foreign-policy program of the Bush Administration (2001–2009) and advocated Bush's [[movement to impeach George W.

===Political philosophy===
[[File:Gore Vidal (c. 1976-1983).jpg|right|thumb|{{center|Vidal ca. 1978}}]]
In the ''American Conservative'' article, "My Pen Pal Gore Vidal" (2012), Bill Kauffman reported that Vidal's favorite American politician, during his lifetime, was [[Huey Long]] (1893–1935), the [[Populism#United States|populist]] Governor (1928–32) and Senator (1932–35) from [[Louisiana]], who also had perceived the essential, one-party nature of U.S. politics and who was assassinated by a lone gunman.<ref>Kauffman, Bill (September 14, 2012) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/my-pen-pal-gore-vidal/ My Pen Pal Gore Vidal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328092414/https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/my-pen-pal-gore-vidal/ |date=March 28, 2019 }}, ''The American Conservative''</ref>

Despite that, Vidal said, "I think of myself as a conservative", with a proprietary attitude towards the United States.

In a September 30, 2009 interview with ''[[The Times]]'' of London, Vidal said that there soon would be a [[dictatorship]] in the United States. The newspaper emphasized that Vidal, described as "the Grand Old Man of American ''[[belles-lettres]]''", claimed that America is rotting away – and to not expect [[Barack Obama]] to save the country and the nation from imperial decay.

=== The Buckley–Vidal feud ===
[[File:William F. Buckley, Jr. 1985.jpg|thumb|upright|The feud between Vidal and Buckley (pictured) lasted until the latter's death in 2008.]]

In 1968, the [[ABC News|ABC television network]] hired the liberal Vidal and the conservative [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] as political analysts of the presidential-nomination conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html |title=Political Animals: Vidal, Buckley and the '68 Conventions |last1=Kloman |first1=Harry |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=November 2, 2009 |archive-date=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921082404/http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Their commentaries led to Buckley threatening to assault Vidal. After days of bickering, their debates degraded to vitriolic ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks. Discussing the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protests]], the [[public intellectual]]s argued about [[freedom of speech]], namely, the legality of protesters to display a [[Viet Cong]] flag in America, Vidal told Buckley to "shut up a minute." Buckley had likened violent left wing protesters to German National Socialists. Vidal stated, "As far as I'm concerned, the only sort of [[crypto-fascism|pro-crypto-Nazi]] I can think of is yourself." Buckley replied, "Now listen, you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi, or I'll sock you in the goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." ABC's [[Howard K. Smith]] interjected, and the debate resumed without violence.<ref name="vidal_correx_july_2011"/><ref>{{cite web|title=William Buckley/Gore Vidal Debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYymnxoQnf8|access-date=August 3, 2012|archive-date=January 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111011616/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYymnxoQnf8|url-status=live}}</ref> Later, Buckley said he regretted having called Vidal a "queer," but still expressed some distaste for Vidal when he said that he was an "evangelist for bisexuality."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898542,00.html |title=Feuds: Wasted Talent |work=Time |date=August 22, 1969 |access-date=November 7, 2011 |archive-date=November 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127012500/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898542,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1969, in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, Buckley continued his cultural feud with Vidal in the essay "On Experiencing Gore Vidal" (August 1969), in which he portrayed Vidal as an [[Apologia|apologist]] for homosexuality; Buckley said, "The man who, in his essays, proclaims the normalcy of his affliction [i.e., homosexuality], and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher." The essay is collected in ''The Governor Listeth: A Book of Inspired Political Revelations'' (1970), an anthology of Buckley's writings from the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Vidal riposted in ''Esquire'' with the September 1969 essay "A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr." and said that Buckley was "anti-black," "[[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]]" and a "warmonger."<ref name="esquire_sept_1969"/> Buckley sued Vidal for [[libel]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vidal Is Sued by Buckley; A 'Nazi' Libel Is Charged |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/05/07/archives/vidal-is-sued-by-buckley-a-nazi-libel-is-charged.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=7 May 1969 |access-date=29 April 2019 |archive-date=July 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716083813/https://www.nytimes.com/1969/05/07/archives/vidal-is-sued-by-buckley-a-nazi-libel-is-charged.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The feud continued in ''Esquire'', where Vidal implied that in 1944, Buckley and unnamed siblings had vandalized a [[Protestant]] church in [[Sharon, Connecticut]], (the Buckley family hometown) after the wife of a pastor had sold a house to a Jewish family. Buckley again sued Vidal and ''Esquire'' for libel and Vidal filed a counterclaim for libel against Buckley, citing Buckley's characterization of ''Myra Breckinridge'' (1968) as a [[pornography|pornographic]] novel.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Buckley v.

In ''Gore Vidal: A Biography'' (1999), [[Fred Kaplan (biographer)|Fred Kaplan]] said that, "The court had 'not' sustained Buckley's case against ''Esquire'' ... [that] the court had 'not' ruled that Vidal's article was 'defamatory.' It had ruled that the case would have to go to trial ''in order to determine, as a matter of fact, whether or not it was defamatory''. The cash value of the settlement with ''Esquire'' represented 'only' Buckley's legal expenses."<ref name=Kaplan-1999 />

In 2003, Buckley resumed his complaint of having been libeled by Vidal, this time with the publication of the anthology ''Esquire's Big Book of Great Writing'' (2003), which included Vidal's essay, "A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr." Again, the offended Buckley filed lawsuit for libel and ''Esquire'' magazine again settled Buckley's claim with $55,000–65,000 for the fees of his attorney and $10,000 for personal damages suffered by Buckley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html |title=Political Animals: Vidal, Buckley and the '68 Conventions |last1=Kloman |first1=Harry |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-date=November 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117030038/http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the obituary "RIP WFB – in Hell" (March 20, 2008), Vidal remembered Buckley, who had died on February 27, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20080320_gore_vidal_speaks_seriously_ill_of_the_dead/ |title=Reports&nbsp;– Gore Vidal Speaks Seriously Ill of the Dead |publisher=Truthdig |date=March 20, 2008 |access-date=January 22, 2009 |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204113214/http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20080320_gore_vidal_speaks_seriously_ill_of_the_dead/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Later, in the interview "Literary Lion: Questions for Gore Vidal" (June 15, 2008), ''New York Times'' reporter Deborah Solomon asked Vidal, "How did you feel, when you heard that Buckley died this year?"

===Polanski rape case===
{{Further|Roman Polanski sexual abuse case}}
In ''The Atlantic'' magazine interview, "A Conversation with Gore Vidal" (October 2009), by John Meroney, Vidal spoke about topical and cultural matters of U.S. society. Asked his opinion about the arrest of the film director [[Roman Polanski]], in Switzerland, in September 2009, in response to an extradition request by U.S. authorities, for having fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid jail for the [[statutory rape]] of a thirteen-year-old girl in Hollywood, Vidal said, "I really don't give a fuck. Look, am I going to sit and weep every time a young hooker feels as though she's been taken advantage of?"

Asked for elaboration, Vidal explained the cultural temper of the U.S. and of the Hollywood movie business in the 1970s:

{{quote|The [news] media can't get anything straight. Plus, there's usually an [[anti-Semitic]] and [[homophobia|anti-fag]] thing going on with the press—lots of crazy things. The idea that this girl was in her communion dress, a little angel, all in white, being raped by this awful Jew ''[[Polack]]o''—that's what people were calling him—well, the story is totally different now [2009] from what it was then [1970s] ... Anti-Semitism got poor Polanski. He was also a foreigner. He did not subscribe to American values, in the least. To [his persecutors], that seemed vicious and unnatural."|Gore Vidal<ref name="John Meroney">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/10/a-conversation-with-gore-vidal/307767/2/|title=A Conversation With Gore Vidal|author=John Meroney|date=October 28, 2009|work=The Atlantic|access-date=March 7, 2017|archive-date=January 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104100511/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/10/a-conversation-with-gore-vidal/307767/2/|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Asked to explain the term "American values," Vidal replied, "Lying and cheating. There's nothing better."<ref name="John Meroney"/>

In response to Vidal's opinion about the decades-old Polanski rape case, a spokeswoman for the organization [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]], Barbara Dorris, said, "People should express their outrage, by refusing to buy any of his books," called Vidal a "mean-spirited buffoon" and said that, although "a boycott wouldn't hurt Vidal financially," it would "cause anyone else, with such callous views, to keep his mouth shut, and [so] avoid rubbing salt into the already deep [psychological] wounds of (the victims)" of sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gore Vidal rips Roman Polanski rape victim as 'hooker'|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/inside_track/celebrity_news/2009/11/gore_vidal_rips_roman_polanski_rape_victim_%E2%80%98hooker%E2%80%99|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=November 1, 2009|access-date=January 10, 2015|archive-date=December 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228055456/http://www.bostonherald.com/inside_track/celebrity_news/2009/11/gore_vidal_rips_roman_polanski_rape_victim_%E2%80%98hooker%E2%80%99|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1997, Vidal was one of thirty-four public intellectuals and celebrities who signed an open-letter addressed to [[Helmut Kohl]], the Chancellor of Germany, published in the ''International Herald Tribune'', protesting the treatment of [[Scientology in Germany|Scientologists in Germany]].<ref>Drozdiak, William (January 14, 1997).

===Sexuality===
In 1967, Vidal appeared in the [[CBS]] documentary, ''[[CBS Reports: The Homosexuals]]'', in which he expressed his views on [[homosexuality]] in the arts.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=CBS/Mike Wallace |date=March 3, 1967 |title=The Homosexuals |medium=Television |language=en |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UNcDHa5ao |access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> Commenting on his life's work and his life, he described his style as "Knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn."<ref name=Freethinker0812/>

Vidal often rebutted the label of "gay." He maintained that it referred to sexual acts rather than sexuality. Gore did not express a public stance on the HIV-AIDS crisis. According to Vidal's close friend [[Jay Parini]], "Gore didn’t think of himself as a gay guy. It makes him self-hating. How could he despise gays as much as he did? In my company he always used the term 'fags.' He was uncomfortable with being gay. Then again, he was wildly courageous." Biographer Fred Kaplan concluded: "He was not interested in making a difference for gay people, or being an advocate for gay rights. There was no such thing as 'straight' or 'gay' for him, just the body and sex."<ref name="gay">{{cite news|last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=July 31, 2013|title=How Gay Was Gore Vidal?|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-gay-was-gore-vidal|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=July 14, 2020|archive-date=September 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927201215/https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-gay-was-gore-vidal|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the September 1969 edition of ''Esquire'', Vidal wrote

{{quote|We are all bisexual to begin with. That is a fact of our condition. And we are all responsive to sexual stimuli from our own as well as from the opposite sex. Certain societies at certain times, usually in the interest of maintaining the baby supply, have discouraged homosexuality. Other societies, particularly militaristic ones, have exalted it. But regardless of tribal taboos, homosexuality is a constant fact of the human condition and it is not a sickness, not a sin, not a crime ... despite the best efforts of our puritan tribe to make it all three. Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word 'natural,' not normal.<ref name="esquire_sept_1969">{{cite magazine |author=Gore Vidal|title=A Distasteful Encounter with William F.

In the multi-volume memoir ''[[The Diary of Anaïs Nin]]'' (1931–74), [[Anaïs Nin]] said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied her claim in his memoir ''Palimpsest'' (1995). In the online article "Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anaïs Nin" (2013), author [[Kim Krizan]] said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin, which contradicts his denial of a love affair with Nin. Krizan said she found the love letter while researching ''Mirages'', the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-krizan/gore-vidals-secret-unpubl_b_4004916.html|title=Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anaïs Nin|date=September 27, 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=September 20, 2013|first=Kim|last=Krizan|archive-date=September 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200327/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-krizan/gore-vidals-secret-unpubl_b_4004916.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Vidal would cruise the streets and bars of New York City and other locales and wrote in his memoir that by age twenty-five, he had had more than a thousand sexual encounters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vidal |first=Gore |author-link=Gore Vidal |date=1995 |title=Palimpsest: A Memoir}}, p. 121.</ref> Vidal also said that he had an intermittent romance with the actress [[Diana Lynn]], and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter.<ref name="Palimpsest-1995" /><ref>{{RP|290}}</ref><ref>Joy Do Lico and Andrew Johnson, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080526082405/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-rumours-about-my-love-child-may-be-true-says-gore-vidal-834022.html "The Rumours About My Love Child May Be True, says Gore Vidal"], ''The Independent'', May 25, 2008.</ref> He was briefly engaged to the actress Joanne Woodward before she married the actor Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles.<ref name="balaban">{{cite magazine|last1=Balaban|first1=Judy|title=The Gore They Loved|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/02/gore-vidal-beloved-women-susan-sarandon|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=January 22, 2013|publisher=Condé Nast|access-date=December 28, 2016|archive-date=April 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425005931/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/02/gore-vidal-beloved-women-susan-sarandon|url-status=live}}</ref>

Vidal enjoyed telling his sexual exploits to friends. Vidal claimed to have slept with [[Fred Astaire]] when he first moved to Hollywood. Vidal reportedly told his nephew that [[Dennis Hopper]] had a "lovely tuft of hair above his ass."<ref name="gay"/>

In the course of his life, Vidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States.

''The Guardian'' said that "Vidal's critics disparaged his tendency to formulate an aphorism, rather than to argue, finding in his work an underlying note of contempt for those who did not agree with him.
