'''Marian Hemar''' (1901–1972), born '''Marian Hescheles''' (other [[pen name]]s: Jan Mariański, and Marian Wallenrod), was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, journalist, playwright, comedy writer, and songwriter. Hemar himself stated that before the outbreak of World War II he had already written 1,200 songs,<ref name="art">{{cite web|url=http://www.polartcenter.com/Marian_Hemar_W_Warszawie_1924_1939_p/9700150.htm |author=Polish Art Center |work=Biography, Compact Disc |title=Marian Hemar W Warszawie 1924 - 1939 |year=2011 |location=Hamtramck, MI |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715101913/http://www.polartcenter.com/Marian_Hemar_W_Warszawie_1924_1939_p/9700150.htm |archive-date=2011-07-15 }}</ref> including such widely popular hits as ''Może kiedyś innym razem (Maybe Some Other Time)'' and ''Upić się warto (Let's get drunk)''. Hemar was a final ''[[nom de plume]]'' (a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by Marian in his literary career. It was formed from the first two letters of his last name, Hescheles, and the first three letters of his given name, Marian.

==Life==
Marian Hemar was born to a Jewish family on 6 April 1901 in [[Lwów]]. He studied medicine and philosophy at the [[Jan Kazimierz University]] locally, and took part in the [[Battle of Lemberg (1918)|Defense of Lwów]] in 1918 and 1919 as a volunteer on the Polish side of the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] of independence.  At the invitation of Jerzy Boczkowski, director of the legendary ''[[:pl:Qui Pro Quo|Qui Pro Quo]]'' Theatre, he left for [[Warsaw]] in 1924. By 1925 he was already a well-known personality in the arts community of Warsaw, working at the ''Qui Pro Quo'' cabaret with [[Julian Tuwim]]. He was a key figure in the productions of ''Banda'', ''[[:pl:Morskie Oko (cabaret)|Morskie Oko]]'', and ''[[:pl:Cyrulik Warszawski|Cyrulik Warszawski]]'' ("Barber of Warsaw") cabarets; as well as the author of hundreds of [[Polish Radio]] sketches.<ref name="art" /> He also wrote ''shmontses (szmonces)'' – Jewish jokes, monologues and sketches – and jointly composed political sketches with poets Julian Tuwim and [[Antoni Słonimski]].<ref name="yivo">{{cite web |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/hemar_marian |publisher=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research |title=Marian Hemar |author=Eugenia Prokop-Janiec |year=2010}}</ref>

His unhappy love affair with the Warsaw [[diseuse]] Maria Modzelewska inspired many of his songs including ''Chciałabym, a boję się (Happy Days Are Here Again'', aka ''I'd Love To Do It, but I'm Afraid'')<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3to5aAYqF4 |title=Mieczysław Fogg (with Syrena Rekord orchestra) sings Foxtrott "Może kiedyś (Innym razem)" by Marian Hemar |work=Soundtrack from the film "12 Krzeseł ("Twelve Chairs"), 1933 |publisher=YouTube, with biographical notes}}</ref>

Soon after the outbreak of [[World War II]] Hemar fled Warsaw after being searched for by the Gestapo and reached Romania, and eventually the Middle East, where  he signed up and served in the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade]]. During the war he continued his literary activity, organizing concerts, speeches and field theater plays for Polish troops.  He also organized one of the few theaters operating in [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged Tobruk]].

{{quote|He was called "The bard of Lvov, the troubadour of the London emigration". For 16 years (1953-1969) he prepared and presented weekly cabaret programmes for Radio Free Europe, in which - in prose and verse - he commented upon all the important news from post-war Poland. — Polish Art Center<ref name="art"/>}}

After the war, Hemar was unable to return to communist Poland due to the persecution by the Polish authorities of all persons who were politically active. In 1939, he left for Palestine but settled in England in 1941,<ref name="yivo"/> becoming one of the best-known figures in the [[Polish diaspora]]. He continued to be popular in Poland with his weekly program broadcast by the Polish section of the [[Radio Free Europe]].

Hemar died on 11 February 1972 in [[Dorking]], Surrey (near London).  He is buried in the graveyard of Christ Church, Coldharbour, Surrey, alongside his wife, Caja (1910-1982).  There are plans to move his remains to Poland. Hemar's mother was the sister of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s father.<ref>[http://www.lem.pl/polish/faq/faq.htm Lem's FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625093849/http://www.lem.pl/polish/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-06-25 }}</ref>
