'''Jesse Ball''' (born June 7, 1978) is an American [[novelist]] and [[poet]]. He has published novels, volumes of poetry, short stories, and drawings. His works are distinguished by the use of a spare style and have been compared to those of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Italo Calvino]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/the-curfew-by-jesse-ball-book-review.html|title=The Curfew - By Jesse Ball - Book Review|first=William|last=Giraldi|date=Aug 26, 2011|accessdate=Jul 31, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref name="Profile in New City Chicago">{{cite web|url=https://newcity.com/2009/02/24/where-dreams-lie-inside-the-strange-compelling-worlds-of-jesse-ball/|title=Where Dreams Lie: Inside the strange compelling worlds of Jesse Ball|date=Feb 25, 2009|website=Newcity|accessdate=Jul 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/2011/08/review-curfew-by-jesse-ball.html|title=Review: THE CURFEW by Jesse Ball|first=The|last=Ape|date=Aug 4, 2011|accessdate=Jul 31, 2019}}</ref>

== Career ==
In 2007 and 2008, Ball published ''Samedi the Deafness'' and the novella ''The Early Deaths of Lubeck, Brennan, Harp & Carr.''  The latter won the ''[[Paris Review]]'''s [[Plimpton Prize]].  These were followed in 2009 by ''The Way Through Doors'', and in 2011, ''The Curfew'', whose style [[The New Yorker]] described as "[lying] at some oscillating coordinate between [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] and [[Italo Calvino|Calvino]]: swift, intense fables composed of equal parts wonder and dread."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/11/the-curfew-2|title=The Curfew|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

Ball's 2014 book ''Silence Once Begun'' was reviewed by [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in February 2014.<ref name="new_yorker_review">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/10/but-he-confessed|title=James Wood: Jesse Ball's "Silence Once Begun"|last=Wood|first=James|work=The New Yorker|date=24 December 1969|accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> In 2015, he was a finalist for the NYPL Young Lion Prize<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/03/27/15-years-young-lions-fiction|title=NYPL's Top Authors Under 35: 15 Years of Young Lions Fiction|website=The New York Public Library|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> (also for ''Silence Once Begun)''.  Later that year, he published ''A Cure for Suicide'', which was long-listed for the [[National Book Award]].

In 2017, ''[[Granta]]'' included him on their list of Best Young American Novelists.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists|title=Granta's list of the best young American novelists|date=2017-04-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> On June 30 of that year Ball published an opinion piece in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' suggesting that all American citizens be incarcerated periodically, as a civic duty.  The article likens this incarceration to already existing jury duty and states that no one, not even sitting politicians, judges or military officers would be free from it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-ball-incarceration-duty-20170630-story.html|work=LA Times|date=June 30, 2017|title=Everyone should go to jail, say, once every ten years}}</ref>

Ball's ''The Divers' Game'' was included on [[The New Yorker]]'s Best Books of 2019 list. Staff writer Katy Waldman writes, "This dystopic fable imagines a society riven in two, with the upper class empowered to murder members of the lower class, for any reason."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/the-best-books-of-2019|title=The Best Books of 2019|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2019-12-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ball was born into a middle-class, English-speaking Irish-Sicilian family in Port Jefferson, New York, on Long Island.  Ball's father worked in Medicaid; his mother worked in libraries.  His brother, Abram, was born with Down's syndrome and attended a school some distance from the place where they lived.<ref name="Profile in New City Chicago"/> Ball attended Port Jefferson High School, and matriculated at [[Vassar College]].

Following Vassar, Ball attended [[Columbia University]], where he earned an MFA and met the poet [[Richard Howard]]. Howard helped the then 24-year-old poet publish his first volume, ''[[March Book]]'', with [[Grove Press]].

In Iceland, Ball met Thordis Bjornsdottir, a poet and author who he collaborated with on two books, married,<ref name="Profile in New City Chicago"/> and later divorced. Ball and the writer [[Catherine Lacey (author)|Catherine Lacey]] have been partners since 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-ent-catherine-lacey-0913-story.html|title='The Answers' author Catherine Lacey conjures sentences that can stop you cold|last=Borrelli|first=Christopher|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>
