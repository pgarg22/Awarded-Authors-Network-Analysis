Fountain's one-man show, ''Sex Addict'', opened at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in April 2004. During the 90-minute show, Fountain would discuss various sex topics, in person and online, and tackle issues of [[homophobia]] and the perceived immorality of [[promiscuity]]. At the end, he encouraged the audience to select the next person he should have sex with on the dating website [[Gaydar (website)|Gaydar]]. After Gaydar later sent him a [[cease and desist]] letter, Fountain asked the audience to choose somebody from a list of online volunteers or nominate themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wolf|first=Matt|date=2005-01-13|title=Tim Fountain Sex Addict|url=https://variety.com/2005/legit/reviews/tim-fountain-sex-addict-1200528703/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2004-08-17|title=Where sex is scandalous|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/aug/17/gayrights.edinburgh04|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}</ref> [[The List (magazine)|''The List'']] praised the show for its humor and ''[[The London Evening Standard]]'' called it "artistically criminal".<ref name=":0" /> The show later transferred to London's [[Royal Court Theatre]] in January 2005 <ref>{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Paul|date=17 January 2005|title=Tim Fountain: Sex Addict, Theatre Upstairs, Royal Court, London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/tim-fountain-sex-addict-theatre-upstairs-royal-court-london-5344736.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=[[The Independent]]|language=en}}</ref> and the [[Schaubühne]] in Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Bühne bizarr , Schaubühne|url=https://www.bz-berlin.de/artikel-archiv/buehne-bizarr-schaubuehne-2|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=[[B.Z.
