==Biography==

===Early life===
Sugathapala De Silva was born on 4 August 1928 Midigama ([[weligama]], [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]]), downsouth town 130 kilometres from Colombo to the son of a small trader.<ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/11/03/fea101.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104161624/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/11/03/fea101.html |date=4 January 2010 }} [[The Sunday Observer]], Ajith Samaranayake (3 November 2002), " The Curtain falls on an era",</ref> He grew up there, among [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]], [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Muslim]] traders. His childhood experiences would later influence him to write the novels ''Ikbithi Siyalloma Sathutin Jeevathvuha'' and ''Esewenam Minisune Me Asaw''. According to other writing he was born in [[Weligama]] and After studied in a few schools in Galle and from tenth grade studied Jinaraja Boy's College [[Jinaraja Boy's College]] , [[Gampola]], and came to Colombo.<ref>[http://sundaytimes.lk/970316/plus13.html] [[The Sunday Times]], By Madhubhashini Disanayaka(16 March 1997), " Ape kattiya dared to differ",</ref> Sugathapala de Silva worked as a salesman at K.V.G. de Silva's bookstall at [[Wellawatte]]. He made this environment read book using free time. That habit amassed in him to gain knowledge which becomes a free thinker, a creator, an innovator, a radical and non-conformist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/11/02/fea10.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018071538/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/11/02/fea10.html |archive-date=18 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }} [[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|daily news]], by Namel Weeramuni (2 November 2002), " The rebel who shed new light on the stage",</ref>

==1960==

De Silva came to [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] in the 1960s, and became engaged in the political and cultural movement, taking place there at that time. Nicknamed the "lovable dictator", he formed the drama group "Apey Kattiya" there, and started to translate and adapt plays by [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]], like ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', to wide acclaim. He followed these plays with original ones, like ''Thattu Geval'' and ''Boarding Karayo'' which captured the mood of the new city-bred middle classes of the time. Among his other creations are ''Eka Walle Pol'', ''Boodin Karayo'', ''Hithahonda Ammandi'', ''Harima Badu Hayak'', ''Mutu Kumari'', ''Esala Sanda'', ''Marasad'' and ''Snthuvara sebalano''.

==1970==

De Silva's best play is considered by many to be ''Dunna Dunu Gamuwe'', which was written just after the 1971 insurrection in [[Sri Lanka]]. Although centred on a trade union struggle, it had an admixture of politics and art expertly mixed with technique and aided by some superb acting by the late U. Ariyawimal and Wilson Jayasiri was the precursor of the serious political theatre which followed at the end of the decade.

De Silva worked for long time at the [[Sri Lanka]] Broadcasting Corporation as a producer, and in the late 1960s was in charge of the weekly [[radio play]], and the weekly short story programs on the station, which were the first "stamping grounds" of writers and dramatists who are today well known in their own right.<ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/08/23/mon03.asp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829135311/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/08/23/mon03.asp |date=29 August 2009 }} [[The Sunday Observer]], By Indeewara Thilakarathne (23 August 2009), " Sri Lankan Theatre ",</ref>

De Silva was bed-ridden from 1997, and died in hospital on 28 October 2002.<ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/11/03/fea101.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104161624/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/11/03/fea101.html |date=4 January 2010 }} [[The Sunday Observer]], Ajith Samaranayake (3 November 2002), " The Curtain falls on an era",</ref>
