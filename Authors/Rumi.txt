According to the authoritative Rumi biographer [[Franklin Lewis]] of the [[University of Chicago]], "[t]he Anatolian peninsula which had belonged to the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, had only relatively recently been conquered by Muslims and even when it came to be controlled by Turkish Muslim rulers, it was still known to Arabs, Persians and Turks as the geographical area of Rum. As such, there are a number of historical personages born in or associated with Anatolia known as Rumi, a word borrowed from Arabic literally meaning 'Roman,' in which context Roman refers to subjects of the [[Byzantine Empire]] or simply to people living in or things associated with [[Anatolia]]."<ref>{{cite book|author=Franklin Lewis|title=Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi|publisher= One World Publication Limited|year= 2008|page= 9}}</ref> He was also known as "Mullah of Rum" ({{lang|fa|ملای روم}} ''mullā-yi Rūm'' or {{lang|fa|ملای رومی}} ''mullā-yi Rūmī'').<ref>[http://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C+%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%85 "ملای روم"] in ''[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]]''</ref>

===Overview===
Rumi was born to native Persian-speaking parents,<ref name="Annemarie Schimmel">Annemarie Schimmel, The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalaloddin Rumi, SUNY Press, 1993, p. 193: "Rumi's mother tongue was Persian, but he had learned during his stay in Konya, enough Turkish and Greek to use it, now and then, in his verse."</ref><ref name="Franklin Lewis">Franklin Lewis: "On the question of Rumi's multilingualism (pp. 315–317), we may still say that he spoke and wrote in Persian as a native language, wrote and conversed in Arabic as a learned "foreign" language and could at least get by at the market in Turkish and Greek (although some wildly extravagant claims have been made about his command of Attic Greek, or his native tongue being Turkish) (Lewis 2008:xxi). (Franklin Lewis, "Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi," One World Publication Limited, 2008).
Franklin also points out that: "Living among Turks, Rumi also picked up some colloquial Turkish."(Franklin Lewis, "Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi," One World Publication Limited, 2008, p. 315). He also mentions Rumi composed thirteen lines in Greek (Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi'', One World Publication Limited, 2008, p. 316). On Rumi's son, Sultan Walad, Franklin mentions: "[[Sultan Walad]] elsewhere admits that he has little knowledge of Turkish" (Sultan Walad): Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi, "Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi'', One World Publication Limited, 2008, p. 239) and

He was born either in [[Vakhsh, Tajikistan|Wakhsh]],<ref name="Balkh">[[Annemarie Schimmel]], "I Am Wind, You Are Fire," p. 11. She refers to a 1989 article by [[Fritz Meier]]:{{Quote|Tajiks and Persian admirers still prefer to call Jalaluddin 'Balkhi' because his family lived in Balkh, current day in [[Afghanistan]] before migrating westward. However, their home was not in the actual city of Balkh, since the mid-eighth century a center of Muslim culture in (Greater) Khorasan (Iran and Central Asia). Rather, as Meier has shown, it was in the small town of Wakhsh north of the Oxus that Baha'uddin Walad, Jalaluddin's father, lived and worked as a jurist and preacher with mystical inclinations. Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi&nbsp;: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings, and Poetry of Jalâl al-Din Rumi'', 2000, pp. 47–49.}} Lewis has devoted two pages of his book to the topic of Wakhsh, which he states has been identified with the medieval town of Lêwkand (or Lâvakand) or Sangtude, which is about 65 kilometers southeast of Dushanbe, the capital of present-day Tajikistan. He says it is on the east bank of the Vakhshâb river, a major tributary that joins the Amu Daryâ river (also called Jayhun, and named the Oxus by the Greeks). He further states: "Bahâ al-Din may have been born in Balkh, but at least between June 1204 and 1210 (Shavvâl 600 and 607), during which time Rumi was born, Bahâ al-Din resided in a house in Vakhsh (Bah 2:143 [= Bahâ' uddîn Walad's] book, "Ma`ârif."). Vakhsh, rather than Balkh was the permanent base of Bahâ al-Din and his family until Rumi was around five years old (mei 16–35) [= from a book in German by the scholar Fritz Meier—note inserted here]. At that time, in about the year 1212 (A.H. 608–609), the Valads moved to Samarqand (Fih 333; Mei 29–30, 36) [= reference to Rumi's "Discourses" and to Fritz Meier's book—note inserted here], leaving behind Baâ al-Din's mother, who must have been at least seventy-five years old."</ref> a village on the [[Vakhsh River]] in present-day [[Tajikistan]],<ref name="Balkh" /> or in the city of Balkh, in present-day Afghanistan.<ref name="UNESCO" /><ref name="UNESDOC" />

===Childhood and emigration===
Rumi's father was [[:ru:Баха ад-Дин Валад|Bahā ud-Dīn Walad]], a theologian, jurist and a [[mysticism|mystic]] from Balkh, who was also known by the followers of Rumi as Sultan al-Ulama or "Sultan of the Scholars". According to [[Sultan Walad]]'s ''Ibadetname'' and Shamsuddin Aflaki (c.1286 to 1291), Rumi was a descendant of [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{citation|title=FUNDAMENTALS OF RUMI'S THOUGHT|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ9RCwAAQBAJ&q=aflaki+rumi+abu+bakr&pg=PT36|year=2006|publisher=Tughra Books|isbn = 9781597846134}}</ref> Some modern scholars, however, reject this claim and state it does not hold on closer examination. The claim of maternal descent from the [[Khwarazmshah]] for Rumi or his father is also seen as a non-historical hagiographical tradition designed to connect the family with royalty, but this claim is rejected for chronological and historical reasons. The most complete genealogy offered for the family stretches back to six or seven generations to famous Hanafi jurists.<ref name="hagiographer1">Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). pp. 90–92: "Baha al-Din’s disciples also traced his family lineage to the first caliph, Abu Bakr (Sep 9; Af 7; JNO 457; Dow 213). This probably stems from willful confusion over his paternal great grandmother, who was the daughter of Abu Bakr of Sarakhs, a noted jurist (d. 1090). The most complete genealogy offered for family stretches back only six or seven generations and cannot reach to Abu Bakr, the companion and first caliph of the Prophet, who died two years after the Prophet, in C.E. 634 (FB 5–6 n.3)."</ref><ref name="hagiographer2">H. Algar, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-al-din-mohammad-walad-b “BAHĀʾ-AL-DĪN MOḤAMMAD WALAD“], Encyclopedia Iranica. There is no reference to such descent in the works of Bahāʾ-e Walad and Mawlānā Jalāl-al-Dīn or in the inscriptions on their sarcophagi. The attribution may have arisen from confusion between the caliph and another Abū Bakr, Šams-al-Aʾemma Abū Bakr Saraḵsī (d. 483/1090), the well-known Hanafite jurist, whose daughter, Ferdows Ḵātūn, was the mother of Aḥmad Ḵaṭīb, Bahāʾ-e Walad's grandfather (see Forūzānfar, Resāla, p. 6). Tradition also links Bahāʾ-e Walad's lineage to the Ḵᵛārazmšāh dynasty. His mother is said to have been the daughter of ʿAlāʾ-al-Dīn Moḥammad Ḵārazmšāh (d. 596/1200), but this appears to be excluded for chronological reasons (Forūzānfar, Resāla, p. 7)</ref><ref name="hagiographer3">(Ritter, H.; Bausani, A.

We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din's mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as "Māmi" (colloquial Persian for Māma),<ref name="hagiographer4">Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 44:“Baha al-Din’s father, Hosayn, had been a religious scholar with a bent for asceticism, occupied like his own father before him, Ahmad, with the family profession of preacher (khatib). Of the four canonical schools of Sunni Islam, the family adhered to the relatively liberal [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh]]. Hosayn-e Khatibi enjoyed such renown in his youth—so says Aflaki with characteristic exaggeration—that Razi al-Din Nayshapuri and other famous scholars came to study with him (Af 9; for the legend about Baha al-Din, see below, "The Mythical Baha al-Din"). Another report indicates that Baha al-Din's grandfather, Ahmad al-Khatibi, was born to Ferdows Khatun, a daughter of the reputed Hanafite jurist and author Shams al-A’emma Abu Bakr of Sarakhs, who died circa 1088 (Af 75; FB 6 n.4; Mei 74 n. 17). This is far from implausible and, if true, would tend to suggest that Ahmad al-Khatabi had studied under Shams al-A’emma. Prior to that the family could supposedly trace its roots back to Isfahan. We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din's mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as "Mama" (Mami), and that she lived to the 1200s." (p. 44)</ref> and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s. The mother of Rumi was Mu'mina Khātūn. The profession of the family for several generations was that of Islamic preachers of the relatively liberal [[Hanafi]] [[Maturidi]] school, and this family tradition was continued by Rumi (see his Fihi Ma Fih and Seven Sermons) and [[Sultan Walad]] (see Ma'rif Waladi for examples of his everyday sermons and lectures).

When the [[Mongol]]s invaded Central Asia sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his whole family and a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], in the Iranian city of [[Nishapur]], located in the province of Khorāsān. Attar immediately recognized Rumi's spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, "Here comes a sea followed by an ocean."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Suspended Somewhere Between: A Book of Verse|last=Ahmed|first=Akbar|publisher=PM Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60486-485-4|pages=i}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi|last=El-Fers|first=Mohamed|publisher=MokumTV|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4092-9291-3|pages=45}}</ref> Attar gave the boy his ''Asrārnāma'', a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works.

From Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for [[Baghdad]], meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} From Baghdad they went to [[Hejaz]] and performed the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] at [[Mecca]]. The migrating caravan then passed through [[Damascus]], [[Malatya]], [[Erzincan]], [[Sivas]], [[Kayseri]] and [[Nigde]]. They finally settled in [[Karaman]] for seven years; Rumi's mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: [[Sultan Walad]] and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.

On 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of [[Kayqubad I|'Alā' ud-Dīn Key-Qobād]], ruler of Anatolia, [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha' ud-Din]] came and finally settled in Konya in [[Anatolia]] within the westernmost territories of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]].

===Education and encounters with Shams-e Tabrizi===
Baha' ud-Din became the head of a [[madrassa]] (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the [[Shariah]] as well as the [[Tariqa]], especially that of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi's public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing [[fatwas]] and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.

During this period, Rumi also travelled to [[Damascus]] and is said to have spent four years there.

It was his meeting with the dervish [[Shams-e Tabrizi]] on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic.
[[File:Tomb of Shams Tabrizi 9.JPG|thumb|Tomb shrine of Shams Tabrizi, [[Khoy]]]]

Shams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could "endure my company". A voice said to him, "What will you give in return?" Shams replied, "My head!" The voice then said, "The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya." On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is rumoured that Shams was murdered with the connivance of Rumi's son, 'Ala' ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semazen.net/eng/show_text_main.php?id=166&menuId=17|title=Hz. Mawlana and Shams|work=semazen.net}}</ref>

Rumi's love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Shams found their expression in an outpouring of lyric poems, [[Diwan-e Shams-e Tabrizi|''Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi'']]. He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:
{{quote|
Why should I seek? I am the same as<br />
He. His essence speaks through me.<br />
I have been looking for myself!<ref>''The Essential Rumi''. Translations by Coleman Barks, p. xx.</ref>
}}

===Later life and death===
[[File:Maulana Jelaledin Muhammad Rumi in konya.jpg|thumb|Tomb shrine of Rumi, [[Konya]]]]

Mewlana had been spontaneously composing ''[[ghazal]]s'' (Persian poems), and these had been collected in the ''Divan-i Kabir'' or Diwan Shams Tabrizi. Rumi found another companion in Salaḥ ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favourite student, [[Husam al-Din Chalabi|Hussam-e Chalabi]], assumed the role of Rumi's companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: "If you were to write a book like the ''Ilāhīnāma'' of Sanai or the ''Mantiq ut-Tayr'' of 'Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it." Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his ''Masnavi'', beginning with:

{{quote|
Listen to the reed and the tale it tells,<br />
How it sings of separation...<ref>{{cite web|first=Camille |last=Helminski| title=Introduction to Rumi: Daylight | url = http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html|access-date=2007-05-06|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155558/http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html |archive-date = July 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>
}}

Hussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the ''Masnavi'', to Hussam.

In December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known ''ghazal'', which begins with the verse:

{{quote|
How doest thou know what sort of king I have within me as companion?<br />
Do not cast thy glance upon my golden face, for I have iron legs.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein |title= Islamic Art and Spirituality |publisher= SUNY Press |year= 1987 |page= 120 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EBu6gWcT0DsC&pg=PA120 |isbn= 978-0-88706-174-5 }}</ref>
}}

Rumi died on 17 December 1273 in [[Konya]]. His death was mourned by the diverse community of Konya, with local Christians and Jews joining the crowd that converged to bid farewell as his body was carried through the city.<ref name=Mojaddedi-19>{{cite book|author=Jawid Mojaddedi|chapter=Introduction|title=Rumi, Jalal al-Din. The Masnavi, Book One|publisher=Oxford University Press (Kindle Edition)|year=2004|page=xix}}</ref> Rumi's body was interred beside that of his father, and a splendid shrine, the ''Yeşil Türbe'' (Green Tomb, قبه الخضراء; today the [[Mevlana Museum|Mevlâna Museum]]), was erected over his place of burial. His epitaph reads:

{{quote|

==Teachings==
[[File:Shams ud-Din Tabriz 1502-1504 BNF Paris.jpg|thumb|A page of a copy c. 1503 of the ''[[Diwan-e Shams-e Tabriz-i]]''. See [[Rumi ghazal 163]].]]

Like other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, Rumi's poetry speaks of love which infuses the world. Rumi's teachings also express the tenets summarized in the Quranic verse which Shams-e Tabrizi cited as the essence of prophetic guidance: "Know that ‘There is no god but He,’ and ask forgiveness for your sin" (Q. 47:19). In the interpretation attributed to Shams, the first part of the verse commands the humanity to seek knowledge of ''[[tawhid]]'' (oneness of God), while the second instructs them to negate their own existence. In Rumi's terms, ''tawhid'' is lived most fully through love, with the connection being made explicit in his verse that describes love as "that flame which, when it blazes up, burns away everything except the Everlasting Beloved."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=William C. Chittick|title=RUMI, JALĀL-AL-DIN vii. Philosophy|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/rumi-philosophy|year=2017|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}
</ref> Rumi's longing and desire to attain this ideal is evident in the following poem from his book the [[Masnavi]]:<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/n-III-3901.html|title=The Mathnawî-yé Ma'nawî – Rhymed Couplets of Deep Spiritual Meaning of Jalaluddin Rumi. |author=Ibrahim Gamard (with gratitude for R.A.

The ''Masnavi'' weaves fables, scenes from everyday life, Qur'anic revelations and exegesis, and metaphysics into a vast and intricate tapestry.

Rumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry and dance as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of [[Sufi whirling|whirling Dervishes]] developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]], listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, ''samāʿ'' represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In other verses in the ''Masnavi'', Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:

{{quote|
The lover's cause is separate from all other causes<br />
Love is the astrolabe of God's mysteries.<ref>{{cite book | last =Naini | first =Majid| title =The Mysteries of the Universe and Rumi's Discoveries on the Majestic Path of Love | author-link=Majid Naini}}</ref>

==Major works==

Rumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (''[[Ruba'i|rubayāt]]'') and odes (''[[ghazal]]'') of the ''Divan'', the six books of the ''Masnavi''. The prose works are divided into The Discourses, The Letters, and the ''Seven Sermons''.

It was compiled from the notes of his various disciples, so Rumi did not author the work directly.<ref>Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West&nbsp;— The Life, Teachings, and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi'', Oneworld Publications, 2000, Chapter 7.</ref> An English translation from the Persian was first published by [[A.J. Arberry]] as ''Discourses of Rumi'' (New York: Samuel Weiser, 1972), and a translation of the second book by Wheeler Thackston, ''Sign of the Unseen'' (Putney, VT: Threshold Books, 1994). The style of the ''Fihi ma fihi'' is colloquial and meant for middle-class men and women, and lack the sophisticated wordplay.<ref>“As Safa points out (Saf 2:1206) the Discourse reflect the stylistics of oral speech and lacks the sophisticated word plays, Arabic vocabulary and sound patterning that we would except from a consciously literary text of this period. Once again, the style of Rumi as lecturer or orator in these discourses does not reflect an audience of great intellectual pretensions, but rather middle-class men and women, along with number of statesmen and rulers”” (Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 292)</ref>
* ''Majāles-e Sab'a'' (''Seven Sessions'', Persian: {{lang|fa|مجالس سبعه}}) contains seven Persian sermons (as the name implies) or lectures given in seven different assemblies. The sermons themselves give a commentary on the deeper meaning of Qur'an and [[Hadith]]. The sermons also include quotations from poems of [[Sana'i]], [[Attar of Nishapur|'Attar]], and other poets, including Rumi himself. As Aflakī relates, after Shams-e Tabrīzī, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Salāh al-Dīn Zarkūb. The style of Persian is rather simple, but quotation of Arabic and knowledge of history and the Hadith show Rumi's knowledge in the Islamic sciences. His style is typical of the genre of lectures given by Sufis and spiritual teachers.<ref>Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 293</ref>
* ''Makatib'' (''The Letters'', Persian: مکاتیب) or ''Maktubat'' ({{lang|fa|مکتوبات}}) is the [[Letter collection|collection of letters]] written in Persian by Rumi to his disciples, family members, and men of state and of influence. The letters testify that Rumi kept very busy helping family members and administering a community of disciples that had grown up around them. Unlike the Persian style of the previous two mentioned works (which are lectures and sermons), the letters are consciously sophisticated and epistolary in style, which is in conformity with the expectations of correspondence directed to nobles, statesmen and kings.<ref>Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 295:“In contrast with the prose of his Discourses and sermons, the style of the letters is consciously sophisticated and epistolary, in conformity with the expectations of correspondence directed to nobles, statesmen and kings"</ref>

==Religious outlook==
Rumi belongs to the class of Islamic philosophers which include [[Ibn Arabi]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} These transcendental philosophers are often studied together in traditional schools of [[irfan]], philosophy and theosophy throughout the Muslim world.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Hossein (2000) Transcendent Theosophy of Mulla Sadra {{ISBN|964-426-034-1}}</ref>

Rumi embeds his theosophy (transcendental philosophy) like a string through the beads of his poems and stories. His main point and emphasis is the unity of being.

It is undeniable that Rumi was a Muslim scholar and took Islam seriously. Nonetheless, the depth of his spiritual vision extended beyond narrow understanding sectarian concerns. One rubaiyat reads:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|در راه طلب عاقل و دیوانه یکی است
در شیوه‌ی عشق خویش و بیگانه یکی است
آن را که شراب وصل جانان دادند
در مذهب او کعبه و بتخانه یکی است}}
|attr1=Quatrain 305|
On the seeker's path, wise men and fools are one.
In His love, brothers and strangers are one.
Go on! Drink the wine of the Beloved!
In that faith, Muslims and pagans are one.<ref>Rumi: 53 Secrets from the Tavern of Love, trans. by Amin Banani and Anthony A. Lee, p. 3</ref>}}

According to the Quran, Muhammad is a mercy sent by God to the [[Alamin]] (to all worlds), including humanity overall.<ref>{{citation|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=21&verse=107|title=Verse (21:107) – English Translation}}</ref> In regards to this, Rumi states:

<blockquote>"The Light of Muhammad does not abandon a Zoroastrian or Jew in the world. May the shade of his good fortune shine upon everyone! He brings all of those who are led astray into the Way out of the desert."<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-17EZOGivqMC|page=163|title=Rumi and Islam|author=Ibrahim Gamard|isbn=978-1-59473-002-3|year=2004}}</ref></blockquote>

Rumi, however, asserts the supremacy of [[Islam]] by stating:

<blockquote>"The Light of Muhammad has become a thousand branches (of knowledge), a thousand, so that both this world and the next have been seized from end to end. If Muhammad rips the veil open from a single such branch, thousands of monks and priests will tear the string of false belief from around their waists."<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-17EZOGivqMC|author=Ibrahim Gamard|page=177|title=Rumi and Islam|isbn=978-1-59473-002-3|year=2004}}</ref></blockquote>

Many of Rumi's poems suggest the importance of outward religious observance and the primacy of the Qur'an.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=407–408}}</ref>

{{quote|
Flee to God's Qur'an, take refuge in it<br />
there with the spirits of the prophets merge.<br />
The Book conveys the prophets' circumstances<br />
those fish of the pure sea of Majesty.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|p=408}}</ref>
}}

Rumi states:

<blockquote><poem>I am the servant of the Qur'an as long as I have life.
I am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen one.
If anyone quotes anything except this from my sayings,
I am quit of him and outraged by these words.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/self-discovery.html|title=Rumi and Self Discovery|publisher=Dar al Masnavi|author=Ibrahim Gamard}}</ref></poem></blockquote>

Rumi also states:

{{quote|"I "sewed" my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad."<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-17EZOGivqMC|title=Rumi and Islam|author=Ibrahim Gamard|publisher=SkyLight Paths|year=2004|page=169|isbn=978-1-59473-002-3}}</ref>}}

On the first page of the Masnavi, Rumi states:
<blockquote> "Hadha kitâbu 'l- mathnawîy wa huwa uSûlu uSûli uSûli 'd-dîn wa kashshâfu 'l-qur'ân."<br />
"This is the book of the Masnavi, and it is the roots of the roots of the roots of the (Islamic) Religion and it is the Explainer of the Qur'ân."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/about_masnavi.html|title=About the Masnavi|publisher=Dar Al-Masnavi}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Hadi Sabzavari]], one of Iran's most important 19th-century philosophers, makes the following connection between the Masnavi and Islam, in the introduction to his philosophical commentary on the book:
<blockquote>It is a commentary on the versified exegesis [of the Qur’ān] and its occult mystery, since all of it [all of the Mathnawī] is, as you will see, an elucidation of the clear verses [of the Qur’ān], a clarification of prophetic utterances, a glimmer of the light of the luminous Qur’ān, and burning embers irradiating their rays from its shining lamp. As respects to hunting through the treasure-trove of the Qur’ān, one can find in it [the Mathnawī] all [the Qur’ān's] ancient philosophical wisdom; it [the Mathnawī] is all entirely eloquent philosophy. In truth, the pearly verse of the poem combines the Canon Law of Islam ([[sharia|sharīʿa]]) with the Sufi Path ([[tariqa|ṭarīqa]]) and the Divine Reality ([[haqiqa|ḥaqīqa]]); the author's [Rūmī] achievement belongs to God in his bringing together of the Law (sharīʿa), the Path, and the Truth in a way that includes critical intellect, profound thought, a brilliant natural temperament, and integrity of character that is endowed with power, insight, inspiration, and illumination.<ref>Eliza Tasbihi, "Sabzawārī’s Sharḥ-i Asrār: A Philosophical Commentary on Rūmī’s Mathnawī" in ''Mawlana Rumi Review'', Volume 7, Issue 1 (2016), p. 187</ref></blockquote>

[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] states:
<blockquote>One of the greatest living authorities on Rûmî in Persia today, Hâdî Hâ'irî, has shown in an unpublished work that some 6,000 verses of the Dîwân and the Mathnawî are practically direct translations of Qur'ânic verses into Persian poetry.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr, "Rumi and the Sufi Tradition," in Chelkowski (ed.), ''The Scholar and the Saint'', p. 183</ref></blockquote>

Rumi states in his [[Diwan (poetry)|Dīwān]]:
<blockquote>The Sufi is hanging on to Muhammad, like [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>Quoted in Ibrahim Gamard, ''Rumi and Islam: Selections from His Stories, Poems, and Discourses&nbsp;— Annotated and Explained'', p. 171.</ref></blockquote>

His [[Masnavi]] contains anecdotes and stories derived largely from the Quran and the hadith, as well as everyday tales.

==Legacy==
===Universality===
[[Shahram Shiva]] asserts that "Rumi is able to verbalise the highly personal and often confusing world of personal growth and development in a very clear and direct fashion. He does not offend anyone, and he includes everyone.... Today Rumi's poems can be heard in churches, synagogues, Zen monasteries, as well as in the downtown New York art/performance/music scene."

To many modern Westerners, his teachings are one of the best introductions to the philosophy and practice of [[Sufism]]. In the West [[Shahram Shiva]] has been teaching, performing and sharing the translations of the poetry of Rumi for nearly twenty years and has been instrumental in spreading Rumi's legacy in the English-speaking parts of the world.

According to Professor Majid M. Naini,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naini.net|title=index|work=naini.net}}</ref> "Rumi's life and transformation provide true testimony and proof that people of all religions and backgrounds can live together in peace and harmony. Rumi’s visions, words, and life teach us how to reach inner peace and happiness so we can finally stop the continual stream of hostility and hatred and achieve true global peace and harmony.”

Rumi's work has been translated into many of the world's languages, including Russian, German, Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, Bengali, French, Italian, and Spanish, and is being presented in a growing number of formats, including concerts, workshops, readings, dance performances, and other artistic creations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rumi.net|title=Rumi Network by Shahram Shiva – The World's Most Popular Website on Rumi|work=rumi.net}}</ref> The English interpretations of Rumi's poetry by [[Coleman Barks]] have sold more than half a million copies worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/dr-braks/dr-barks.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507142950/http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/dr-braks/dr-barks.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 May 2006|title=University of Tehran|work=ut.ac.ir}}</ref> and Rumi is one of the most widely read poets in the United States.<ref>Curiel, Jonathan, [[San Francisco Chronicle]] Staff Writer, ''Islamic verses: The influence of Muslim literature in the United States has grown stronger since the 11 Sep attacks'' (6 February 2005), [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/06/INGH7B3FM31.DTL Available online] (Retrieved Aug 2006)</ref> [[Shahram Shiva]] book "Rending the Veil: Literal and Poetic Translations of Rumi" (1995, HOHM Press) is the recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Award.

Recordings of Rumi poems have made it to the USA's Billboard's Top 20 list. A selection of American author [[Deepak Chopra]]'s editing of the translations by Fereydoun Kia of Rumi's love poems has been performed by Hollywood personalities such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Goldie Hawn]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Demi Moore]].

There is a famous landmark in [[Northern India]], known as [[Rumi Gate]], situated in [[Lucknow]] (the capital of [[Uttar Pradesh]]) named for Rumi. Indian filmmaker [[Muzaffar Ali]] who is from Lucknow made a documentary, titled ''Rumi in the Land of Khusrau'' (2001), which presents concerts based on the works of Rumi and [[Amir Khusrau]] and highlights parallels between the lives of the poets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rumi in the Land of Khusrau (Full Movie ) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcwcL_IfKZg |publisher=Indian Diplomacy |language=en |date=Jun 2, 2012}}</ref>

{{quote|Say it in Persian although in Arabic sounds better—Love, however, has its own many other dialects}}

These cultural, historical and linguistic ties between Rumi and [[Iran]] have made Rumi an iconic Iranian poet, and some of the most important Rumi scholars including Foruzanfar, Naini, Sabzewari, etc., have come from modern Iran.<ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000">Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2000.</ref> Rumi's poetry is displayed on the walls of many cities across [[Iran]], sung in Persian music,<ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000" /> and read in school books.<ref>See for example 4th grade Iranian school book where the story of the Parrot and Merchant from the Mathnawi is taught to students</ref>

===Mewlewī Sufi Order; Rumi and Turkey===
{{Main|Mevlevi Order|Sama (Sufism)}}
The Mewlewī Sufi order was founded in 1273 by Rumi's followers after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/r/172/whm.html%7ctitle=Sufism%7cwork=gmu.edu|title=Sufism|work=gmu.edu}}</ref> His first successor in the rectorship of the order was "[[Husam al-Din Chalabi|Husam Chalabi]]" himself, <!-- who? -->after whose death in 1284 Rumi's younger and only surviving son, [[Sultan Walad]] (died 1312), popularly known as author of the mystical ''Maṭnawī Rabābnāma'', or the ''Book of the Rabab'' was installed as grand master of the order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/spirituality-mevlevi.html/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827150758/http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/spirituality-mevlevi.html|url-status=dead|title=Islamic Supreme Council of America – Islamic Supreme Council of America|archivedate=27 August 2013|website=www.islamicsupremecouncil.org}}</ref> The leadership of the order has been kept within Rumi's family in Konya uninterruptedly since then.<ref>{{cite web |title= Mevlâna Celâleddin Rumi |url= http://www.mevlana.net/celebi.htm |access-date= 19 May 2007 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070506121512/http://www.mevlana.net/celebi.htm |archive-date= 6 May 2007 }}</ref>
The Mewlewī Sufis, also known as Whirling Dervishes, believe in performing their ''[[dhikr]]'' in the form of [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]. During the time of Rumi (as attested in the ''Manāqib ul-Ārefīn'' of Aflākī), his followers gathered for musical and "turning" practices.

According to tradition, Rumi was himself a notable musician who played the [[rebab|''robāb'']], although his favourite instrument was the ''[[ney]]'' or reed flute.<ref name="order">{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/V1/about_moa.html|title=About the Mevlevi Order of America|work=hayatidede.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112195131/http://www.hayatidede.org/V1/about_moa.html|archive-date=12 January 2013}}</ref> The music accompanying the ''samāʿ'' consists of settings of poems from the ''Maṭnawī'' and ''Dīwān-e Kabīr'', or of Sultan Walad's poems.<ref name="order" /> The Mawlawīyah was a well-established Sufi order in the [[Ottoman Empire]], and many of the members of the order served in various official positions of the Caliphate. The centre for the Mevlevi was in Konya. There is also a Mewlewī monastery ({{lang|fa|درگاه}}, ''dargāh'') in [[Istanbul]] near the [[Galata Tower]] in which the ''samāʿ'' is performed and accessible to the public. The Mewlewī order issues an invitation to people of all backgrounds:

{{rquote|right|<poem>''Come, come, whoever you are,''

}}

[[File:Turkey.Konya008.jpg|left|thumb|Rumi's tomb in [[Konya]], Turkey.]]
During Ottoman times, the Mevlevi produced a number of notable poets and musicians, including Sheikh Ghalib, Ismail Rusuhi Dede of Ankara, Esrar Dede, Halet Efendi, and Gavsi Dede, who are all buried at the Galata Mewlewī Khāna (Turkish: ''Mevlevi-Hane'') in Istanbul.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istanbulportal.com/istanbulportal/Divan.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325015105/http://www.istanbulportal.com/istanbulportal/Divan.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Web Page Under Construction|archivedate=25 March 2006}}</ref> Music, especially that of the ney, plays an important part in the Mevlevi.

With the foundation of the modern, secular [[Republic of Turkey]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it exclusively to that of personal morals, behaviour and faith. On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]''s (dervish lodges) and ''zāwiyas'' (chief dervish lodges), and the centres of veneration to which visits (''ziyārat'') were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 ''tekke''s as well as small centres for gatherings of various fraternities; this law dissolved the Sufi Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to their titles, impounded the Orders' assets, and banned their ceremonies and meetings. The law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish the Orders. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevlâna in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.<ref>Mango, Andrew, ''Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey'', (2002), {{ISBN|978-1-58567-011-6}}.</ref>

In the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform once a year in Konya. The Mewlānā festival is held over two weeks in December; its culmination is on 17 December, the Urs of Mewlānā (anniversary of Rumi's death), called ''Šabe Arūs'' (شب عروس) (Persian meaning "nuptial night"), the night of Rumi's union with God.<ref name="urs">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kloosterman.be/intro/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904005519/http://www.kloosterman.be/rumi.php|url-status=dead|title=Intro|archivedate=4 September 2006}}</ref> In 1974, the Whirling Dervishes were permitted to travel to the West for the first time. In 2005, [[UNESCO]] proclaimed "The [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]] Ceremony" of [[Turkey]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/39eur_uk.htm The Mevlevi Sema Ceremony] [[UNESCO]].</ref>

===Religious denomination===
As [[Edward G. Browne]] noted, the three most prominent mystical Persian poets Rumi, [[Sanai]] and [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]] were all Sunni Muslims and their poetry abounds with praise for the first two caliphs [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar ibn al-Khattāb]].<ref>[[Edward G. Browne]], ''A Literary History of Persia from the Earliest Times Until Firdawsh'', 543 pp., Adamant Media Corporation, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5|978-1-4021-6045-5}} (see p. 437)</ref> According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]], the tendency among [[Shia]] authors to anachronistically include leading mystical poets such as Rumi and Attar among their own ranks, became stronger after the introduction of [[Twelver Shia]] as the state religion in the [[Safavid Empire]] in 1501.<ref>[[Annemarie Schimmel]], ''Deciphering the Signs of God'', 302 pp., SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3|978-0-7914-1982-3}} (see p. 210)</ref>

===Eight hundredth anniversary celebrations===
In Afghanistan, Rumi is known as ''Mawlānā'', in Turkey as ''Mevlâna'', and in Iran as ''Molavī''.

At the proposal of the Permanent Delegations of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey, and as approved by its executive board and General Conference in conformity with its mission of "constructing in the minds of men the defences of peace", [[UNESCO]] was associated with the celebration, in 2007, of the eight hundredth anniversary of Rumi's birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com/?bl=culture&alt=&hn=30647|title=Haber, Haberler, Güncel Haberler, Ekonomi, Dünya, Gündem Haberleri, Son Dakika, – Zaman Gazetesi|work=zaman.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317005548/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=culture&alt=&hn=30647|archive-date=17 March 2006}}</ref> The commemoration at UNESCO itself took place on 6 September 2007;<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34694&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629034959/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34694&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2009 |title=UNESCO: 800th Anniversary of the Birth of Mawlana Jalal-ud-Din Balkhi-Rumi |date=6 September 2007 |publisher=UNESCO |quote=The prominent Persian language poet, thinker and spiritual master, Mevlana Celaleddin Belhi-Rumi was born in 1207 in Balkh, presently Afghanistan. |access-date=25 June 2014 }}</ref> UNESCO issued a medal in Rumi's name in the hope that it would prove an encouragement to those who are engaged in research on and dissemination of Rumi's ideas and ideals, which would, in turn, enhance the diffusion of the ideals of UNESCO.<ref name="UNESDOC">{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001473/147319e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

===Mawlana Rumi Review===
The ''Mawlana Rumi Review''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/2042-3357|title=Mawlana Rumi Review|issn=2042-3357}}</ref> is published annually by The Centre for Persian and Iranian Studies at the [[University of Exeter]] in collaboration with The Rumi Institute in [[Nicosia, Cyprus]], and Archetype Books<ref name="archetypebooks.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.archetypebooks.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217082004/http://www.archetypebooks.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 December 2004|title=archetypebooks.com}}</ref> in [[Cambridge]].<ref name="archetypebooks.com" /> The first volume was published in 2010, and it has come out annually since then. According to the principal editor of the journal, Leonard Lewisohn: "Although a number of major Islamic poets easily rival the likes of [[Dante]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton|Milton]] in importance and output, they still enjoy only a marginal literary fame in the West because the works of Arabic and Persian thinkers, writers and poets are considered as negligible, frivolous, tawdry sideshows beside the grand narrative of the [[Western Canon]]. It is the aim of the Mawlana Rumi Review to redress this carelessly inattentive approach to [[world literature]], which is something far more serious than a minor faux pas committed by the Western literary imagination."<ref>{{cite news|author=Lewisohn, Leonard|url=http://www.jadidonline.com/story/27052010/frnk/rumi_journal_eng |title=Editor's Note|work= Mawlana Rumi Review}}</ref>
