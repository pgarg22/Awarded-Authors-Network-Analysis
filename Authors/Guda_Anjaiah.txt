This event included lectures, speech and performance of various folk artists, singers, dancers and poets. ''Dhoom Dham'' was a huge hit and was organised in each and every village of Telangana. This event provided a platform for uniting the public, activists and political leaders under one tree.

Niluvella Gayala Veena'',''Ayyoniva Nuvvu Avvoniva Telanganoniki Thoti Paloniva'' (about Andhra settlers in Hyderabad) and others dominated Stage of ''Dhoom Dham''.
