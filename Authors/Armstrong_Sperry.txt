'''Armstrong Wells Sperry''' (November 7, 1897 – April 26, 1976) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[writer]] and [[illustrator]] of [[children's literature]]. His books include [[historical fiction]] and [[biography]], often set on [[sailing ships]], and stories of boys from [[Polynesia]], [[Asia]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures. He is best known for his 1941 [[Newbery Medal]]-winning book ''[[Call It Courage]]''.

==Early training as an artist==
Born the third and youngest son of a businessman in New Haven, Sperry attended Stamford Preparatory School from 1908 to 1915. His older brother [[Paul A. Sperry]] invented what became the first [[boat shoe]], the [[Sperry Top-Sider]].<ref>[http://blog.sperry.com/about/ Decades of Boat Shoes and Sailing Footwear Perfection]</ref> He attended the [[Art Students League of New York]] from 1915 to 1918, where he studied with [[F. Luis Mora]] and [[George Bellows]]. He then studied at the [[Yale School of Art]] in the fall of 1918 until drafted into the [[United States Navy]] at the very end of [[World War I]].

Inspired by reading the work of [[Herman Melville]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], and [[Jack London]] as a boy, and then Frederick O'Brien's [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14384/14384-h/14384-h.htm ''White Shadows in the South Seas''] in 1919, he traveled around the South Pacific from October 1920 to May 1921, spending time on [[Tahiti]], [[Raiatea]], [[Bora Bora]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], and [[Hawaii]].  In December 1921, one of his paintings of the South Seas was exhibited at the Art Centre, NYC.<ref>"Art: The December Exhibitions", December 18, 1921, ''The New York Times''.</ref>

In the summer of 1922, Sperry was introduced to [[Kenneth Emory]], an [[ethnologist]] at the [[Bishop Museum]], [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], by his foster sister, Anne Kinnear.<ref>Krauss, Bob. ''Keneti: South Seas Adventures of Kenneth Emory.'' University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 1988</ref>  He spent the spring of 1923 studying at the [[Académie Colarossi]] in [[Paris]], and continued to enroll at the Art Students League during the 1920s and early 1930s.

From September 1924 to May 1925, he was employed as an assistant to [[Kenneth Emory]] on board the Kaimiloa, a yacht owned by Medford Kellum, sailing from [[Hawaii]] to [[Fanning Island]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Malden Island]], [[Penrhyn Island]], [[Tahiti]], [[Bora Bora]],  [[Raiatea]] on scientific research, although continuing to paint, exhibiting his work in Honolulu.<ref>"Armstrong Sperry Has Prisoned the Elusive Atmosphere of the South Seas in Water Colors," by L. T. G. ''The Honolulu Advertiser'', Sunday Morning, July 12, 1925.</ref> before sailing to San Francisco in June 1925<ref>Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at San Francisco, 1893–1953.</ref>

Returning to New York in 1925, he worked in an advertising agency, "drawing vacuum cleaners, milk bottles, Campbell's Soup, etc.,",<ref>"Armstrong Sperry, 1940 Newberry Winner," by Doris S. Patee, Editor, Juvenile Books, Macmillan Company, New York, N.Y. ''The Library Journal'', July 1941, Vol. 66, pp. 589–90.</ref> then he had steady work as an illustrator of pulp romances, primarily for ''All-Story Love Stories'' for the Frank A. Munsey Company,<ref>[https://www.pulpartists.com/Sperry.html ARMSTRONG SPERRY (1897-1976)]</ref> and adventure and romance newspaper serials for [[Metropolitan Newspaper Service]]/[[United Feature Syndicate]], including many 72-part stories by Mildred Barbour. He started writing his own adventure stories with tales of the South Seas that were syndicated by Metropolitan.<ref>[https://www.pulpartists.com/Sperry.html ARMSTRONG SPERRY (1897-1976)]</ref> He illustrated books and dust jackets for other writers, including the first edition of ''[[Tarzan and the Lost Empire]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]<ref>Robert R. Barrett, "To Bora-Bora and Back Again: The Story of Armstrong W. Sperry." ''Burroughs Bulletin'', Number 11 (New Series), July 1992, pp. 3–8.</ref> in 1929 and the first of several books he would illustrate for Helen Follet, ''Magic Portholes'' in 1932. He married Margaret Robertson, a medical doctor and daughter of [[San Francisco]] bookseller and publisher A. M. Robertson, in 1930, whom he had met on his trip to Hawaii in 1925.<ref>[https://www.pulpartists.com/Sperry.html ARMSTRONG SPERRY (1897-1976)]</ref>

==From illustrator to award-winning writer==

Sperry's first book, ''One Day with Manu,'' a colorfully illustrated tale of everyday life in Bora Bora, appeared in 1933. Critic Joan McGrath, cautions modern readers to take his depictions of other cultures in context, stating, <blockquote>"His early work, such as the tales of Manu, Jambi, and Tuktu, are unlikely to be found in library collections of today, in an era rendered more sensitive to the feelings of minority cultures and racial pride than in the 1930s. Coloured as they were by the prevailing attitudes of his day, Sperry's ethnological works for young readers would by critics of today be stigmatized as condescending in their approach: it is all too easy to lose the historical perspective that would credit him with enlightenment and objectivity, given their date of publication."<ref>''Twentieth Century Children's Writers'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1985, pp. 722–23.</ref></blockquote>

Sperry's great-grandfather was a sea captain, inspiring his love of the ocean and his book ''All Sail Set'' about the [[clipper ship]] ''[[Flying Cloud (clipper)|Flying Cloud]]'', which won him a [[Newbery Honor|Newbery Honor Book]] award in 1936. Although settled in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], in 1934, Sperry and his family lived [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], for a year, inspiring several books, including ''Wagons Westward: The Story of the Old Trail to Santa Fe'' in 1936 and ''Little Eagle, a Navaho Boy'' in 1938.

[[File:CallItCourage 1sted.jpg|thumb|right|Dustjacket of the first printing of ''Call It Courage'']] On February 13, 1940 ''[[Call It Courage]]'' was published by The [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan Company]], the story about a young boy on the island of [[Hikueru]] in [[Polynesia]] written and illustrated by Sperry.  He was awarded the [[Newbery Medal]] for 1940 on June 20, 1941, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], by the Children's Library Section of the [[American Library Association]].<ref>Irvin Kerlan, ''Newbery and Caldecott Awards: A Bibliography of First Editions.'' University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1949, p.27</ref> At his acceptance of the Medal, he said, "I had been afraid that perhaps in ''Call It Courage'', the concept of spiritual [[courage]] might be too adult for children, but the reception of this book has reaffirmed a belief I have long held: that children have imagination enough to grasp any idea, and respond to it, if it is put to them honestly and without a patronizing pat on the head."<ref>from "Acceptance Paper" by Armstrong Sperry, as appeared in ''Newbery Medal Books: 1922–1955'', Bartha Mohoney Miller and Elinor Whitney Field, eds., Horn Book, Boston, 1955, p. 207.</ref>

Sperry purchased a farm in [[Thetford Center, Vermont]], in the late 1930s, and then moved to [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], at the beginning of [[World War II]].  In 1944, he won the [[New York Herald Tribune]] Children's Spring Book Festival Award for ''Storm Canvas'', a story of a boy on the U.S. [[frigate]] Thunderbolt in 1814, and in 1949, he won the [[Boys and Girls Clubs of America|Boys' Clubs of America]] Junior Book Award for the 1947 publication of ''The Rain Forest''.<ref>Obituary, ''The New York Times'', April 30, 1976.</ref>

Although established as a writer, Sperry continued to illustrate dustjackets for other well-known authors of young adult fiction of his era, including [[Howard Pease]], Agnes D. Hewes, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], Florence C. Means, and Hildegarde Hawthorne, as well as illustrating various [[basal reader]]s for the Ginn Co. In 1951, he illustrated an adaptation by Allen Chaffee of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''Story of [[Hiawatha]].''

In 1942, he published his only novel for adult readers, ''No Brighter Glory,'' about the [[Astor family]].
