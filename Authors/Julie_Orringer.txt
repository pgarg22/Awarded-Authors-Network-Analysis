Knopf]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4000-4111-4}} ''[[How to Breathe Underwater]]'' contains nine short stories, many of them about characters submerged by loss, whether of parents or lovers or a viable relationship to the world in general.  In "Pilgrims," a band of motherless children torment each other on [[Thanksgiving]] day.  In "The Isabel Fish," the sole survivor of a drowning accident takes up [[scuba diving]].  In "When She is Old and I am Famous," a young woman confronts the inscrutable power of her cousin's beauty.  In "The Smoothest Way is Full of Stones," the failure of religious and moral codes—to protect, to comfort, to offer solace—is seen through the eyes of a group of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] adolescents discovering the irresistible power of their sexuality. ''How to Breathe Underwater'' is a New York Times Notable Book, a San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year, and the winner of the Northern California Book Award.
