==Writing==
Naseem Hijazi used historic settings as the background for his novels and based most of his work on [[Islamic history]], demonstrating both the rise and fall of the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]].<ref name=TheNation/> His novels ''Muhammad Bin Qasim'', ''Aakhri Ma'raka'', ''Qaisar-o Kisra'', and ''Qafla-i Hijaz'' describe the era of Islam's rise to political, militaristic, economic, and educational power, while ''Yusuf Bin Tashfain'', ''[[Shaheen (novel)|Shaheen]]'',<ref name=iqbalcyberlibrary>{{cite web|url=http://www.iqbalcyberlibrary.net/ICBN/969-416-205-018/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503011600/http://www.iqbalcyberlibrary.net/ICBN/969-416-205-018/|title=Shaheen (Volume-1)|date=12 March 2007|archive-date=3 May 2007|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> ''Kaleesa Aur Aag'', and ''Andheri Raat Ke Musafir'' describe the period of the Spanish [[Reconquista]].

In ''Akhri Chataan'', he depicts the [[Central Asia]]n conquests of [[Genghis Khan]] and his destruction of the [[Khwarezmian dynasty|Khwarizm Sultanate]].<ref name=TheNation/>

Hijazi wrote two sequential novels on the [[British Raj]], and described the shortcomings of many nations within India after the collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]]. The novel ''Mu'azzam Ali'' starts a little before the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The lead character, Muazzam Ali, joins the fight against the British with the army of [[Siraj ud-Daulah|Siraj-ud-Daula]]. The story progresses as the character moves from one place in India to another in search of lost glory and freedom. He takes part in the [[third battle of Panipat]] and finally settles in [[Srirangapattana]], which is growing in power under the towering personality of [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]]. The book ends around the death of Ali. The second book on the battles in the same area, ''Aur Talwar Toot Gayee'' (And the Sword Broke), is about Haider's son [[Tipu Sultan|Sultan Tipu]], where the same character is finding his dreams being fulfilled in Tipu's valiant endeavours against the [[British East India Company]]. The book culminates in Sultan Tipu's sad and untimely martyrdom.<ref name=TheNation/><ref name=goodreads>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1473738.Naseem_Hijazi |title=Naseem Hijazi's list of novels with their ratings|website=goodreads.com website|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>
