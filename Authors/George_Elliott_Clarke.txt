'''George Elliott Clarke''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|ONS}} (born February 12, 1960) is a Canadian poet, playwright and literary critic who served as the [[Poet Laureate of Toronto]]<ref>{{cite web

[[The Canadian Press]] via ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', January 5, 2016.</ref> His work is known largely for its use of a vast range of literary and artistic traditions (both "high" and "low"), its lush physicality and its bold political substance. One of Canada's most illustrious poets, Clarke is also known for chronicling the experience and history of the [[Black Canadian]] communities of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], creating a cultural geography that he has coined "Africadia".

==Life==
Clarke was born to William and Geraldine Clarke in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]],<ref name=compton>{{cite journal |url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/scl/article/view/12866/13916 |last=Compton |first=Anne |title=Standing Your Ground: George Elliott Clarke in Conversation |journal=Studies in Canadian Literature |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=1998 |access-date=6 June 2013}}</ref> near the [[Black Loyalist]] and Afro-[[Métis]] community of [[Three Mile Plains, Nova Scotia|Three Mile Plains]], and grew up in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He graduated from [[Queen Elizabeth High School (Halifax)|Queen Elizabeth High School]] in 1978.<ref name="hightimes">{{cite news |last1=Kimber |first1=Stephen |title=High times |url=https://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/high-times/Content?oid=961069 |work=The Coast |date=26 July 2007}}</ref>

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] honours degree in English from the [[University of Waterloo]] (1984), an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in English from [[Dalhousie University]] (1989) and a PhD degree in English from [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] (1993).  He has received honorary degrees from [[Dalhousie University]] ([[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]]), the [[University of New Brunswick]] ([[Doctor of Letters|Litt.D.]]), the University of Alberta (Litt.D.), the University of Waterloo (Litt.D.), and most recently, Saint Mary's University (Litt.D). He taught English and Canadian Studies at [[Duke University]] from 1994 to 1999 and was appointed the Seagrams Visiting Chair in Canadian Studies at [[McGill University]] for the academic year 1998-1999.<ref>{{cite web

Clarke has also served as a Noted Scholar at the [[University of British Columbia]] (2002), as a Visiting Scholar at [[Mount Allison University]] (2005), and as the William Lyon Mackenzie King Visiting Professor in Canadian Studies at [[Harvard University]] (2013–14); and, outside of the academic sphere, as a researcher for the [[Ontario Provincial Parliament]] (1982–83), editor of the Imprint ([[University of Waterloo]], 1984–85) and The Rap ([[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], 1985–87), social worker for the [[Black United Front of Nova Scotia]] (1985–86), parliamentary aide to [[Howard McCurdy]] (1987–91), and newspaper columnist for [[The Daily News (Halifax)]] (1988–89).<ref>{{cite web

Clarke is a sought-after conference speaker and is active in poetry circles throughout Canada, the US, the Caribbean, and Europe. He is also a founding member of the music collective Afro-Métis Nation, which put out its first album, "Constitution", in May 2019. The group derives its name from the artists' mixed Africadian and [[Mi'kmaq]] descent. Clarke has described the group's sound as "a mash-up of southern-fried blues and saltwater spirituals, with Nashville guitars, Mi’kmaw-and-“African” drums, Highland bagpipes and Acadien fiddles."<ref>{{cite web

==Writing career==
Clarke is recognized both for his own oeuvre, which includes seventeen collections of poetry, two novels, and four works of drama and opera, and for collecting and promoting stories of African-Canadian writers and poets in anthologies and studies such as ''Border Lines'' (1995), ''Eyeing the North Star'' (1997), ''Odysseys Home'' (2002), ''Fire on the Water'' (2002), ''Directions Home'' (2012) and ''Locating Home'' (2017). His artistic influences stretch from [[Shakespeare]] to [[Miles Davis]], from [[Ezra Pound]] to [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] and [[Malcolm X]], and it is from the fertile contradictions and tensions between thinkers of all periods of history that Clarke's later work draws much of its power. His style, with its embrace of the vernacular, the rambunctious, the unresolved and the spontaneous, lends itself well to the bold, passionate performances for which he is well known. His poetic and academic careers intersect in their particular emphasis on the perspectives of the African descendants in Canada and [[Nova Scotia]], especially the African-American slaves’ descendants who settled on the East coast of Nova Scotia, whom he calls "Africadian."  He writes that it is a word that he "minted from 'Africa' and 'Acadia' (the old name for Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]]), to denote the Black populations of the Maritimes and especially of Nova Scotia".<ref name=fire />

He views "Africadian" literature as "literal and liberal—I canonize songs and sonnets, histories and homilies."<ref name=fire>Clarke, George Elliott, ''Fire on the Water: Anthology of Black Nova Scotian Writing, Volume One'' (1991), Porters Lake, [[Nova Scotia]]: Pottersfield Press.</ref> Clarke has stated that he found further writing inspiration in the 1970s and his "individualist poetic scored with implicit social commentary" came from the "Gang of Seven" intellectuals, "poet-politicos: jazz trumpeter [[Miles Davis]], troubadour-bard [[Bob Dylan]], libertine lyricist [[Irving Layton]], guerrilla leader and poet [[Mao Zedong]], reactionary modernist [[Ezra Pound]], Black Power orator [[Malcolm X]] and the Right Honourable [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]."<ref name="gaspereau.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.gaspereau.com|title=Gaspereau Press - Home Page|website=www.gaspereau.com|access-date=November 5, 2018}}</ref>  Clarke found "as a whole, the group’s blunt talk, suave styles, acerbic independence, raunchy macho, feisty lyricism, singing heroic and a scarf-and-beret chivalry quite, well, liberating."<ref name="gaspereau.com"/> His poetry and scholarship, which address and challenge historic encounters with racism, segregated areas, discrimination, hatred, forced relocation and a loss of a sense of identity and a sense of belonging experienced by the Black populations of Canada, have earned him worldwide acclaim.

In his anthology ''Fire On The Water'', Clarke uses a biblical timeline stretching from Genesis to Psalms and Proverbs to Revelation to present Black writings and authors born within a specific period.  These names reflect the Africadians’ and other Black peoples’ forebears and the first singers' own preferences for singing "the Lord’s song in this strange land."<ref name=fire /> In his most recent book, ''These Are the Words'', a collaboration with Canadian Poet [[John B. Lee]], Clarke translates one of the nine books of the Bible's apocrypha into a vigorous English vernacular.<ref>{{cite web |title=These Are the Words |url=http://www.hiddenbrookpress.com/publication/these-are-the-words/ |first1=George Elliott |last1=Clarke |first2=John B. |last2=Lee |access-date=May 21, 2019}}</ref> It is a prime example of his wide and open poetic sensibility, in which the spiritual and the sensual have equally their part.

His intellectual contributions involve both his ability to combine literary criticism and theatrical forte and his continuance of the themes of cultural inclusiveness and Canadian iconic symbolism.  In his 2007 play ''Trudeau:  Long March, Shining Path'', Clarke features his [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Liberal hero Trudeau]] (1919–2000) describing him as "the Shakespearean character: ...He’s a figure about whom it is almost impossible to say anything definitive because he is encompassed by so many contradictions but that’s what makes him interesting."  In presenting a multicultural Trudeau on the international stage, Clarke seeks to capture the human dimensions, the personality of Trudeau rather than his politics so as to  emphasize the dialogues among key characters and "show the people as people not just exponents of ideas".<ref>{{cite web |title=Trudeau perfect subject for new opera, Clarke says |url=http://www.cbc.ca:80/arts/story/2006/07/12/trudeau-opera.html |website=cbc.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510030000/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/07/12/trudeau-opera.html |archive-date=May 10, 2007 |date=July 12, 2006 |access-date=December 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
In 2012 Clarke was given substantial critical recognition in a volume devoted to the body of his writing, ''Africadian Atlantic: Essays on George Elliott Clarke'', edited by [[Joseph Pivato]].

In his 2016 and 2017 collections of poems, the names of which, ''Canticles I (MXXVI)'' and ''Canticles I (MMXVII)'', are a reference to [[Ezra Pound]]'s [[The Cantos]] and [[The Song of Solomon]], Clarke puts famous thinkers, explorers and rulers of the 17th, 18th and 20th Centuries into a dialogue on slavery and heritage. Together, these collections make up the first part of a projected three-part epic. Canticles II: MMXIX was released in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canticles I (mmxvii) : George Elliott Clarke |url=https://www.guernicaeditions.com/title/9781771831901 |publisher=Guernica Editions |access-date=May 21, 2019}}</ref>

In his time as Poet Laureate of Toronto, Clarke created the Poets' Corner at City Hall, and worked with the Toronto Public Library to create the Toronto Poetry Map, an electronic map of the city that marks all sites referenced in Canadian poetry, and presents the relevant lines to the viewer. He also founded the East End Poetry Festival. For these accomplishments and more he is credited with expanding the role and responsibilities of the Poet Laureate considerably. Clarke similarly expanded the role of Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate during his tenure, becoming the first to have his poems recited in the Houses and recorded in Hansard.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Parliament of Poems: An Interview with Parliamentary Poet, George Elliott Clarke |url=http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/a-parliament-of-poems-an-interview-with-parliamentary-poet-laureate-george-elliott-clarke/ |website=blog.pshares.org |date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

==Family==
Mr Clarke is a great-nephew of the late Canadian opera singer [[Portia White]], politician [[Bill White (Canadian politician)|Bill White]] and labour union leader [[Jack White (politician)|Jack White]]. Clarke is a seventh-generation African Canadian and is descended from African-American refugees from the [[War of 1812]] who escaped to the British and were relocated to Nova Scotia. Clarke is the great grandson of [[William A. White|William Andrew White]], an American-born Baptist preacher and missionary, army chaplain, and radio pioneer, who was one of the very few black officers in the British army worldwide during [[World War I]]. Clarke also has Indigenous ancestors for the Mi'kmaq communities.

==Awards and merits==
In 1998 Clarke won the Portia White Prize for Artistic Achievement. In 2001, he won the [[2001 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award for poetry]] for his book ''Execution Poems,'' as well as the National Magazine Gold Medal for Poetry. He has also won the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Achievement Award (2004), the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Fellowship Prize (2005-2008), the Dartmouth Book Award for Fiction (2006), and the Eric Hoffer Book Award for Poetry (2009).<ref>(http://www.english.utoronto.ca/grad/programs/MA_CRW_Faculty.htm)</ref>

Clarke was appointed to the [[Order of Nova Scotia]] in 2006, and to the [[Order of Canada]], at the rank of Officer, in 2008.

On January 16, 2008 Clarke was made an honorary Fellow of the [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton|Haliburton Literary Society]], the oldest literary society in North America, at the [[University of King's College]], Halifax; and in 2009 he was a co-recipient of the [[William P. Hubbard]] Award for Race Relations from the City of Toronto for his outstanding achievements and commitment in making a distinct difference in racial relations in Toronto.  Clarke was chosen expressly for "his local and national leadership role in creating an understanding and awareness of African and black culture and excellence in his contribution to redefining culture."<ref>(https://torontoist.com/2014/04/poetry-that-speaks-truth-to-power/)</ref>

In November 2012, Clarke became Toronto's fourth Poet Laureate.<ref>{{cite web
