[[Image:Ho Xuan Huong.png|thumb|Hồ Xuân Hương]]
'''Hồ Xuân Hương''' ([[wikt:胡|胡]][[wikt:春|春]][[wikt:香|香]]; 1772–1822) was a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] poet born at the end of the [[Lê dynasty]]. She grew up in an era of political and social turmoil&nbsp;– the time of the [[Tây Sơn dynasty|Tây Sơn]] rebellion and a three-decade civil war that led to [[Nguyễn Ánh]] seizing power as Emperor [[Gia Long]] and starting the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. She wrote poetry using [[chữ nôm]] (Southern Script), which adapts Chinese characters for writing demotic [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. She is considered to be one of [[Vietnam]]'s greatest classical poets. [[Xuân Diệu]], a prominent modern poet, dubbed her "The Queen of Nôm poetry".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Biography==
The facts of her life are difficult to verify, but this much is well established: she was born in [[Nghệ An Province]] near the end of the rule of the [[Trịnh lords]], and moved to [[Hanoi]] while still a child. The best guess is that she was the youngest daughter of Ho Phi Dien.

According to the first researchers of Hồ Xuân Hương, such as Nguyen Huu Tien and Duong Quang Ham, she was a daughter of  Ho Phi Dien (born in 1704) in Quynh Doi Village, Quynh Luu District, Nghệ An Province (*). Ho Phi Dien acquired the baccalaureate diploma at the age of 24, under Le Bao Thai's Dynasty. Due to his family's poverty, he had to work as a tutor in Hai Hung, Ha Bac for his earnings. At that place, he cohabitated with a girl from [[Bac Ninh]], his concubine&nbsp;– Hồ Xuân Hương was born as a result of that love affair.

Nevertheless, in a paper in ''Literature Magazine'' (No. 10, Hanoi 1964), Tran Thanh Mai claims that Hồ Xuân Hương's hometown was the same as mentioned above, but she was a daughter of Ho Si Danh (1706–1783) and a younger stepsister of Ho Si Dong (1738–1786)"

She became locally famous and obtained a reputation of creating poems that were subtle and witty. She is believed to have married twice as her poems refer to two different husbands: Vinh Tuong (a local official) and Tong Coc (a slightly higher level official). She was the second-rank wife of Tong Coc, in Western terms, a [[concubine]], a role that she was clearly not happy with ("like the maid/but without the pay"). However, her second marriage did not last long as Tong Coc died just six months after the wedding.

She lived the remainder of her life in a small house near the West Lake in Hanoi. She had visitors, often fellow poets, including two specifically named men: Scholar Ton Phong Thi and a man only identified as "The Imperial Tutor of the Nguyễn Family." She was able to make a living as a teacher and evidently was able to travel since she composed poems about several places in Northern Vietnam.

A single woman in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] society, her works show her to be independent-minded and resistant to societal norms, especially through her socio-political commentaries and her use of frank sexual humor and expressions. Her poems are usually irreverent, full of [[double entendre]]s, and erudite.<ref>'The Poetess of White Silk Lake' in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin).

By composing the vast majority of her works in Nôm, she helped to elevate the status of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] as a literary language. Recently, however, some of her poems have been found which were composed in [[classical Chinese]], indicating that she was not a purist. In modern times, [[Chữ nôm]] is nearly a dead script, having been supplanted by [[Quốc Ngữ]], a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] introduced during the period of French colonization. For details, see [[Vietnamese language]]. Some of her poems were collected and translated into English in [[John Balaban (poet)|John Balaban]]'s ''Spring Essence'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|1 55659 148 9}}).

An important Vietnamese poet and her contemporary is [[Nguyễn Du]], who similarly wrote poetry in demotic Vietnamese, and so helped to found a national literature.

A few cities in Vietnam have streets named after Hồ Xuân Hương.<ref>{{cite book| title=Vietnam Country Map |publisher=Periplus Travel Maps |year=2002–2003 |isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}</ref>

==Quotes==
"My body is like a jackfruit swinging on a tree, <br>
My skin is rough, my pulp is thick. <br>
Dear prince, if you want me then pierce me upon your stick <br>
Don't squeeze, i'll ooze and stain your hands." <br>
("The Jackfruit"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/50918/jackfruit|title=Jackfruit by Ho Xuan Huong &#124; Poetry Magazine|website=www.poetryfoundation.org}}</ref>)

Because I pitied, this happened, <br>
I wonder if he knows? <br>
Our match had not begun <br>
When fate intervened. <br>
The sin he will have to bear, for a hundred years - <br>
Right now, love's burden is all mine. <br>
("Premarital Pregnancy")

Ðằng Kingdom is now a small place <br>
Between Sở and Tề. <br>
("The Kingdom of Ðằng")

Gently Spring evening comes to the pavilion, <br>
Unclouded in the least by worldly sins. <br>
Three times the temple's bell surges like a wave <br>
Unsettling the puddle where sky and water mingle. <br>
Truly the sea of Love cannot be emptied <br>
And the stream of Grace flows easily everywhere. <br>
Now, where, where is Nirvana? <br>
Nirvana's here, nine parts in ten. <br>
("Spring Watching Pavilion")
