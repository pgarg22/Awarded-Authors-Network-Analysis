==Career==
From 1936 to 1938, he was an assistant lecturer in English and reported university news for the ''[[Christchurch Press|Press]]'' until he wrote an article advocating trial marriage, which angered the university. Well known for radical leftist opinions, he was often in trouble with authorities. In addition to writing for the ''Press'', Glover edited ''New Zealand Motor Owner'', the Canterbury University College ''Review'', and Students Association newspaper ''Canta''. In 1934 he interviewed [[George Bernard Shaw]] for the newspaper.

In 1932 at the university sports tournament in Auckland he again met up with Lowry. Lowry had by this time set up a press for the Auckland University Students Association and was publishing a magazine called ''Phoenix''. Returning to Canterbury Glover formed the Caxton Club with the aim of studying printing and typography. In 1937 together with John Drew he founded the [[Caxton Press (New Zealand)|Caxton Press]]. The Caxton Press enabled Glover to pursue his interest in publishing. Caxton published the early works of many New Zealand writers such as [[Ursula Bethell]], [[R. A. K. Mason]], [[Allen Curnow]], [[Charles Brasch]], [[Frank Sargeson]] and [[A. R. D. Fairburn]]. Glover's own poems were also printed.

==Military service==

His work at the Press was interrupted by service with the [[Royal Navy]] in [[World War II]]. He had wanted to join the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] but as there were no suitable vacancies he applied under a programme which sent New Zealand naval recruits to the United Kingdom on loan to the Royal Navy. He left Christchurch to Auckland, then embarking on the ''[[Dominion Monarch]]'' for [[HMS Ganges (shore establishment)|HMS ''Ganges'']] Shortly Gate, England arriving in February 1942.

After a short period of training he was assigned to the newly completed destroyer [[HMS Onslaught (G04)|HMS ''Onslaught'']] for its sea trials.

In 1975, Glover was presented with the [[Soviet Union]]'s war veterans medal for his service on the Russian convoys.

==Post-war life and career==
During 1944, while on leave in London, Glover stayed with his New Zealand friend Charles Brasch. Together they developed the idea for a new literary magazine. This became [[Landfall (journal)|''Landfall'']], which Caxton began publishing in March 1947. From 1945 to 1948 Glover served on the Canterbury University College Council, while also working at Caxton. His work was hindered however by a growing drinking problem and he was dismissed at the end of 1951. He began working for Albion Wright at Pegasus Press but was again dismissed. During this period he separated from his wife. They did not divorce until 1970. In 1950 he began a relationship with Khura Skelton. They moved to [[Paekakariki]] in 1954, but his drinking problem continued into alcoholism. Kura died in 1969.

In 1954, Glover worked for Carlton-Carruthers du Chateau and King as an advertising copywriter and then for Wingfield Press from 1954 to 1962 as production manager and typographer. He tutored for the Technical Correspondence Institute from 1964 to 1973. During the late 1950s he helped develop the Mermaid Press and in 1971 founded the Cats-paw Press. He was a member of the New Zealand Literary Fund Advisory Committee from 1955 to 1958 and President of the Friends of the Turnbull Library from 1963 to 1965.

Glover married Gladys Evelyn Cameron (née Stevens) on 21 September 1971. In 1975 he was invited to visit Russia by the Soviet Writers Union. Later that year he awarded an honorary doctorate of literature from Victoria University of Wellington and elected president of honour of the New Zealand Centre of PEN. On 7 August 1980 Glover fell down some steps at Breaker Bay and injured himself. He died two days later from bronchopneumonia.
