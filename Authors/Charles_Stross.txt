'''Charles David George''' "'''Charlie'''" '''Stross''' (born 18 October 1964<ref name="isfdb">{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?2200|title=Summary Bibliography: Charles Stross|website=www.isfdb.org|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>) is a British writer of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. Stross specialises in [[hard science fiction]] and [[space opera]]. Between 1994 and 2004, he was also an active writer for the magazine ''[[Computer Shopper (UK magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'' and was responsible for the monthly [[Linux]] column. He stopped writing for the magazine to devote more time to novels. However, he continues to publish freelance articles on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stross|first=Charles|title=Linux in Computer Shopper|url=https://www.antipope.org/charlie/old/linux/index.html|website=antipope.org}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Stross was born in [[Leeds]], England.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/intcs.htm |title = Charles Stross interviewed - infinity plus non-fiction}}</ref> He showed an early interest in writing and wrote his first science fiction story at age 12. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Pharmacy in 1986 and qualified as a pharmacist in 1987. In 1989, he enrolled at [[Bradford University]] for a post-graduate degree in computer science. In 1990, he went to work as a technical author and programmer. In 2000, he began working as a writer full-time, as a technical writer at first, but then became successful as a fiction writer.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/01Stross.html|title=Charles Stross: Fast Forward|date=2005|access-date=14 October 2015}}</ref><ref name="tor">[http://www.tor.com/bios/authors/charlesstross Charles Stross] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009062707/http://www.tor.com/bios/authors/charlesstross |date=9 October 2014 }}, Tor.com (accessed 29 May 2013)</ref>

== Career ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Stross published some [[role-playing game]] articles about ''[[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' in ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' magazine. Some of his creatures, such as the death knight, githyanki (the name borrowed from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s 1977 novel, ''[[Dying of the Light (1977 novel)|Dying of the Light]]''), [[githzerai]], and [[slaad]] (a chaotic race of frog-like humanoids) were later published in the ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' monster compendium.<ref name="rpg">{{cite web |publisher=Kyngdoms |title=The Kyngdoms Interview |url=http://www.thekyngdoms.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=36&start=0 |date=26 May 2010 |access-date=26 May 2010}}</ref>

His first published short story, "The Boys", appeared in ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1987. A collection of his short stories, ''[[Toast: And Other Rusted Futures]]'', was released in 2002; subsequent short stories have been nominated for the Hugo Award, [[Nebula Award]], and other awards. His first novel, ''[[Singularity Sky]]'', was published by [[Ace Books]] in 2003 and was also nominated for the [[Hugo Award]]. His novella "The Concrete Jungle" (published in ''[[The Atrocity Archives]]'') won the Hugo award for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|its category]] in 2005.<ref name=Hugo05 /> His novel ''[[Accelerando]]'' won the 2006 [[Locus Award]] for best science fiction novel, was a finalist for the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel]],<ref name=CampbellNom /> and was on the final ballot for the Hugo Award in the best novel category.<ref name=Hugo06 /> ''[[Glasshouse (novel)|Glasshouse]]'' won the 2007 [[Prometheus Award]] and was on the final ballot for the Hugo Award in the best novel category; the German translation ''Glashaus'' won the 2009 [[Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kurd-lasswitz-preis.de/2009/KLP_2009_Bestes_auslaendisches_Werk.htm|title=KLP 2009 Bestes ausländisches Werk|website=www.kurd-lasswitz-preis.de}}</ref> His novella "[[Missile Gap]]" won the 2007 Locus Award for best novella, and most recently he was awarded the [[Edward E. Smith Memorial Award]] or Skylark at [[Boskone]] 2008.

His novel ''[[The Atrocity Archives]]'' (2004) focused on a British intelligence agency investigating Mythos-like horrors; using ideas similar to those in the RPG book ''[[Delta Green]]'' (1996), Stross commented in an afterword to the book: "All I can say in my defence is... I hadn't heard of ''Delta Green'' when I wrote ''The Atrocity Archive''... I'll leave it at that except to say that ''Delta Green'' has come dangerously close to making me pick up the dice again."<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=[[Mongoose Publishing]]|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|247}}

He was the Guest of Honor at Boskone 48 in Feb 2011.

[[Cubicle 7]] used their ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' license to create ''[[The Laundry]]'' (2010), based on Stross' writings, wherein agents must deal with the outer gods and British bureaucracy at the same time.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|432}}
