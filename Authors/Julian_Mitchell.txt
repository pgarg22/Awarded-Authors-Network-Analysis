'''Charles Julian Humphrey Mitchell''', [[FRSL]] (born 1 May 1935) is an English playwright, screenwriter and occasional novelist. He is best known as the writer of the play and film ''[[Another Country (play)|Another Country]]'', and as a screenwriter for TV, producing many original plays and series episodes, including at least ten for ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''.

Mitchell was born in [[Epping, Essex|Epping]], [[Essex]], and educated at [[Winchester College]], where he won the English Verse and [[Duncan Reading Prizes]].<ref>Winchester College Register 1992</ref> He did his national service in submarines 1953-55 as a [[Sub-Lieutenant|Sub Lt]] [[RNVR]]. He then went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]] and received a BA with first class honours in 1958.  This was followed by a period as a [[Harkness Fellow]] in the [[United States|USA]] (1959â€“61). He earned an M.A. in 1962 at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St. Antony's College, Oxford]]. Since 1962 he has been a freelance writer.

In the late 1960s, Mitchell co-wrote the [[teleplay]] ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' with [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]]. It was never produced, though it gave rise to the band's [[concept album]]. He recently recalled the aborted project: "''Arthur'' had a most unhappy history. It was originally meant to be a ... sort of rock opera, and we got as far as casting (excellent director and actors) and finding locations and were about to go when the producer went to a production meeting without a proper budget, tried to flannel his way through it, was immediately sussed and the production pulled. I have never been able to forgive the man."{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Mitchell has written nine produced plays, including ''[[Another Country (play)|Another Country]]'', which won the SWET (now Olivier) Award for best play of the year (1981), and ''[[After Aida]]'' (1985), a play-with-music about composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]].

Mitchell has screenplay credits for five feature films. The earliest was ''[[Arabesque (1966 film)|Arabesque]]'' (1966), which was directed by [[Stanley Donen]]. ''[[Another Country (1984 film)|Another Country]]'' (1984) is based on Mitchell's own play, and directed by [[Marek Kanievska]]. ''[[Vincent & Theo]]'' (1990) is a biographical film about the famed painted [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], and was directed by [[Robert Altman]]. ''[[August (1996 film)|August]]'' (1996) was directed and starred [[Anthony Hopkins]], and was adapted from [[Anton Chekhov]]'s classic play ''[[Uncle Vanya]]''. ''[[Wilde (film)|Wilde]]'' (1997) is based on the life of [[Oscar Wilde]], and was directed by [[Brian Gilbert (director)|Brian Gilbert]].

In 2007 he wrote the BBC4 drama ''[[Consenting Adults (2007 film)|Consenting Adults]]'' about [[John Wolfenden|Sir John Wolfenden]] and his celebrated [[Wolfenden Report|1957 report]].
