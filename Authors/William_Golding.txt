'''Sir William Gerald Golding''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE|FRSL}} (19 September 1911 – 19 June 1993) was a British novelist, playwright, and poet. Best known for his [[debut novel]] ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954), he published another twelve volumes of fiction in his lifetime. In 1980, he was awarded the [[Booker Prize]] for ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'',  the first novel in what became his sea trilogy, ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]''. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1983.

As a result of his contributions to literature, Golding was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1988.<ref name="awards">[http://www.william-golding.co.uk/life/awards.aspx William Golding: Awards].

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:William Golding's Plaque at Bishop Wordsworth's School.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]], [[Salisbury]].]]
William Golding was born in his maternal grandmother's house, 47 Mount Wise, [[Newquay]],<ref>Carey, Chap. 5 ('Childhood'), pg. 18.</ref> [[Cornwall]].<ref name=ODNB>Kevin McCarron, ‘Golding, Sir William Gerald (1911–1993)’, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52079 accessed 13 November 2007]</ref> The house was known as ''Karenza'', the [[Cornish language]] word for ''love'', and he spent many childhood holidays there.<ref>Carey, Chap 5 ('Childhood'), pg. 18.</ref> He grew up in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]], where his father (Alec Golding) was a science master at [[Marlborough Grammar School]] (1905 to retirement), the school the young Golding and his elder brother Joseph attended.<ref>(Which should not be confused with [[Marlborough College]], the nearby "public" boarding school).</ref> His mother, Mildred (Curnoe),<ref>Raychel Haugrud Reiff, William Golding: Lord of the Flies, Marshall Cavendish, 2009</ref> kept house at 29, The Green, Marlborough, and was a campaigner for female suffrage. Golding's mother, who was [[Cornish people|Cornish]] and whom he considered "a superstitious [[Celts|Celt]]", used to tell him old Cornish ghost stories from her own childhood.<ref>Carey, Chap. 4 ('The House'), pg. 15.</ref> In 1930 Golding went to [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he read [[Natural Sciences]] for two years before transferring to [[English Literature|English]] for his final two years.<ref>Carey, pp. 41, 49</ref> His original [[Tutorial system|tutor]] was the chemist [[Thomas Taylor (chemist)|Thomas Taylor]].<ref>Carey, p. 15</ref> In a private journal and in a memoir for his wife, Golding said he tried to rape a 15-year-old girl when he was 18 and on his first holiday from Oxford.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|date=2009-08-16|title=Author William Golding tried to rape teenager, private papers show|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/16/william-golding-attempted-rape|access-date=2019-12-20|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Golding took his B.A. degree with Second Class Honours in the summer of 1934, and later that year a book of his ''[[Poems (poetry by Golding)|Poems]]'' was published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan & Co]], with the help of his Oxford friend, the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophist]] Adam Bittleston.

He was a schoolmaster teaching English and music at [[Maidstone Grammar School]] 1938 – 1940, before moving to [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]], [[Salisbury]], in April 1940. There he taught English, [[Philosophy]], Greek, and drama until joining the navy on the 18th December 1940, reporting for duty at [[HMS Raleigh (shore establishment)|HMS Raleigh]]. He returned in 1945 and taught the same subjects until 1961.<ref>Carey, pp. 82, 111</ref>

Golding kept a personal journal for over 22 years <ref name="william-golding.co.uk">William Golding Website, https://william-golding.co.uk/timeline, Accessed 28th Nov 2020.</ref> from 1971 until the night before his death, and which contained approximately 2.4 million words in total. The journal was initially used by Golding in order to record his dreams, but over time it gradually began to function as a record of his life. The journals contained insights including retrospective thoughts about his novels and memories from his past. At one point Golding described setting his students up into two groups to fight each other – an experience he drew on when writing ''Lord of the Flies''.<ref>Carey, Chap 10 ('Teaching'), pgs. 125-6.</ref> [[John Carey (critic)|John Carey]], the emeritus professor of English literature at Oxford university, was eventually given 'unprecedented access to Golding's unpublished papers and journals by the Golding estate'.<ref name="william-golding.co.uk"/> Though Golding had not written the journals specifically so that a biography could be written about him, Carey published ''William Golding: The Man Who Wrote Lord of the Flies'' in 2009.<ref>Carey, John. ''The Man Who Wrote Lord of the Flies''. Faber, 2009.</ref>

===Marriage and family===
Golding was engaged to Molly Evans, a woman from Marlborough, who was well liked by both of his parents.<ref>Presley, Nicola. 'William Golding's Early Life.'William Golding Officical Website, Published 19th Sept. 2018, https://william-golding.co.uk/william-goldings-early-life. Accessed 29th Nov. 2020.</ref> However, he broke off the engagement and married Ann Brookfield, an analytical chemist,<ref name="bloom">{{cite book |title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies; Bloom's modern critical interpretations |pages=161–165 |author=Harold Bloom |isbn=978-0-7910-9826-4 |year=2008 |publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref> on 30 September 1939. They had two children, David (born September, 1940) and Judith (born July, 1945).<ref name="ODNB"/>

===War service===
During [[World War II]], Golding joined the [[Royal Navy]] in 1940.<ref>Raychel Haugrud Reiff, ''William Golding: Lord of the Flies'', page 58 (Marshall Cavendish, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-7614-4276-9}}</ref> He served on a destroyer which was briefly involved in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']]. Golding participated in the invasion of [[Normandy]] on [[D-Day]], commanding a [[Landing Craft Tank (Rocket)|landing craft]] that fired salvoes of [[RP-3#tanks-encyclopedia|rockets]] onto the beaches. He was also in action at [[Walcheren]] in October and November 1944, during which time 10 out of 27 assault craft that went into the attack were sunk.<ref>{{cite book| last=Mortimer| first=John| author-link=John Mortimer| title=Character Parts| location=London| publisher=Penguin| year=1986| isbn=978-0-14-008959-2| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/characterparts00mort}}</ref><ref>Carey, p. 94</ref>

==="Crisis"===
Golding had a [[Alcohol abuse|troubled relationship with alcohol]]; Judy Carver notes that her father was "always very open, if rueful, about problems with drink".<ref name="Jordison 2013">{{cite web | last=Jordison | first=Sam | title=Live webchat with Judy Carver on The Spire by William Golding – post your questions here | website=the Guardian | date=24 April 2013 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/24/live-webchat-judy-carver | access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref> Golding suggested that his self-described "crisis", of which [[alcoholism]] played a major part, had plagued him his entire life.<ref name="Kendall466">Kendall p. 466</ref> John Carey mentions several instances of [[binge drinking]] in his biography, including Golding’s experiences in 1963; whilst on holiday in [[Greece]] (when he was meant to have been finishing his novel ''[[The Spire]]''), after working on his writing in the morning, he would go to his preferred "[[Kafenio|Kapheneion]]" to drink at midday.<ref name ="Carey277">Carey p. 277</ref> By the evening would move onto [[ouzo]] and [[brandy]]; he developed a reputation locally for "provoking explosions".<ref name="Carey277"/>

Unfortunately, the eventual publication of ''The Spire'' the following year did not help Golding's developing struggle with alcohol; it had precisely the opposite effect, with the novel's scathingly negative reviews in a BBC radio broadcast affecting him severely.<ref name="Carver McCrum">{{cite web | last=McCrum | first=Robert | title=William Golding's crisis | website=[[The Guardian]] | date=11 March 2012 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/william-golding-crisis | access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref> Following the publication of ''[[The Pyramid (Golding novel)|The Pyramid]]'' in 1967, Golding experienced a severe [[writer's block]]: the result of myriad crises (family anxieties, [[insomnia]], and a general sense of dejection).<ref name="Kendall466"/> Golding eventually became unable to deal with what he perceived to be the intense reality of his life without first drinking copious amounts of alcohol.<ref>Kendall p. 467</ref> [[Tim Kendall]] suggests that these experiences manifest in Golding's writing as the character Wilf in ''[[The Paper Men]]''; "an ageing novelist whose alcohol-sodden journeys across Europe are bankrolled by the continuing success of his first book".<ref> Kendall p. 479 </ref>

By the late 1960s, Golding was relying on alcohol – which he referred to as "the old, old anodyne".<ref>Golding qtd in Kendall p. 467</ref> His first steps towards recovery came from his study of [[Carl Jung]]'s writings, and in what he called "an admission of discipleship" he travelled to [[Switzerland]] in 1971 to see Jung's landscapes for himself.<ref name="Kendall Email">Kendall, Tim. ''Update.'' Email, ''University of Exeter'', 4th Jun 2021.</ref> That same year, he started keeping a journal in which he recorded and interpreted his dreams; the last entry is from the day before he died, in 1993, and the volumes-long work came to be thousands of pages long by this time.<ref name="Carver McCrum"/>

The crisis did inevitably affected Golding’s output, and his next novel, ''[[Darkness Visible (novel)|Darkness Visible]]'', would be published twelve years after ''The Pyramid''; a far cry from the prolific author that had produced six novels in thirteen years since the start of his career.<ref name="Kendall466"/> But, despite this, the extent of Golding's recovery is evident from the fact that this was only the first of six further novels that Golding completed before his death.<ref name="Kendall Email"/>

===Death===
In 1985, Golding and his wife moved to a house called [[Tullimaar House|Tullimaar]] in [[Perranarworthal]], near [[Truro]], Cornwall. He died of heart failure eight years later on 19 June 1993. His body was buried in the parish churchyard of [[Bowerchalke]] near his former home and the [[Wiltshire]] county border with [[Hampshire]] and [[Dorset]].

On his death he left the draft of a novel, ''[[The Double Tongue]]'', set in [[Delphi|ancient Delphi]], which was published posthumously in 1995.<ref name="Lambert">{{cite news| author=Bruce Lambert| title=William Golding Is Dead at 81; The Author of 'Lord of the Flies'| url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0919.html| work=The New York Times| date=20 June 1993| access-date=6 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Golding | first=William | title=The Double Tongue| location=London| publisher=Faber | year=1996| isbn=978-0-571-17803-2| title-link=The Double Tongue }}</ref>

==Career==

===Writing success===
[[File:Golding, Lundkvist och Sartre i Leningrad 1963.jpg|thumb|Golding, [[Artur Lundkvist]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] at a writers' congress in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[USSR]], 1963.]]
Whilst still a teacher at [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]], in 1951 Golding began writing a manuscript of the novel initially titled ''Strangers from Within''.<ref name="Williams">{{cite web | title=New BBC programme sheds light on the story behind the publication of Lord of the Flies | website=Faber & Faber Blog | url=https://www.faber.co.uk/blog/new-bbc-programme-sheds-light-on-the-story-behind-the-publication-of-lord-of-the-flies/ | access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref> In September 1953, after rejections from seven other publishers, Golding sent a manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]] and was initially rejected by their reader, Jan Perkins, who labelled it as "Rubbish & dull. Pointless".<!--<ref name="Sunday Feature BBC R3">Sunday Feature, 18:45 02/06/2019, BBC Radio 3, 45 mins. https://learningonscreen.ac.uk/ondemand/index.php/prog/13750939?bcast=129246943 (Accessed 16 Apr 2020)</ref>--> His book, however, was championed by Charles Monteith, a new editor at the firm. Monteith asked for some changes to the text and the novel was published in September 1954 as ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.

After moving in 1958 from [[Salisbury]] to nearby [[Bowerchalke]], he met his fellow villager and walking companion [[James Lovelock]]. The two discussed Lovelock's [[Gaia Hypothesis|hypothesis]], that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the personification of the Earth in Greek mythology, and mother of the Titans.<ref name="ecolo.org">James Lovelock, ‘What is Gaia?’, [http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/what_is_Gaia.html accessed 16 May 2013]</ref> His publishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer-in-residence at [[Hollins University|Hollins College]] (now Hollins University), near [[Roanoke, Virginia]].

Golding won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' in 1979, and the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' in 1980. In 1983 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], and was according to the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' "an unexpected and even contentious choice".<ref name="ODNB"/>

In 1988 Golding was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=51558 |date=13 December 1988 |page=13986 }}</ref> In September 1993, only a few months after his unexpected death, the First International William Golding Conference was held in France, where Golding's presence had been promised and was eagerly expected.<ref>F. Regard (ed.), F''ingering Netsukes: Selected Papers from the First International William Golding Conference'', Saint-Etienne, PUSE, 1995.</ref>

===Fiction===
His first novel, ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954; film, 1963 and 1990; play, adapted by [[Nigel Williams (author)|Nigel Williams]], 1995), describes a group of boys stranded on a tropical island descending into a lawless and increasingly wild existence before being rescued. ''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955) shows "new people" (generally identified with ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with [[Neanderthals]]) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel ''[[Pincher Martin]]'' records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. ''[[Free Fall (Golding novel)|Free Fall]]'' (1959) explores the issue of freedom of choice. The novel's narrator, a World War Two soldier in a German POW Camp, endures interrogation and solitary confinement. After these events and while recollecting the experiences, he looks back over the choices he has made, trying to trace precisely where he lost the freedom to make his own decisions. ''[[The Spire]]'' (1964) follows the construction (and near collapse) of an impossibly large spire on the top of a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be [[Salisbury Cathedral]]). The novel explores ideas of sexual lust, religious fervour and delusion, and the power of the Church in Medieval England, with the titular spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity.

Golding's 1967 novel ''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' consists of three linked stories with a shared setting in a small English town based partly on Marlborough where Golding grew up. ''[[The Scorpion God]]'' (1971) contains three novellas, the first set in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God'); the second describing a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer group ('Clonk, Clonk'); and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The last of these, originally published in 1956, was reworked by Golding into a play, ''The Brass Butterfly'', in 1958. From 1971 to 1979 Golding published no novels. After this period he published ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979): a story involving terrorism, paedophilia, and a mysterious figure who survives a fire in [[the Blitz]], and appears to have supernatural powers. In 1980, Golding published ''[[To the Ends of the Earth#Rites of Passage|Rites of Passage]]'', the first of his novels about a voyage to Australia in the early nineteenth century. The novel won the [[Booker Prize]] in 1980 and Golding followed this success with ''[[To the Ends of the Earth#Close Quarters|Close Quarters]]'' (1987) and ''[[To the Ends of the Earth#Fire Down Below|Fire Down Below]]'' (1989) to complete his 'sea trilogy', later published as one volume entitled ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]''. The three stories were later adapted into [[To the Ends of the Earth (TV series)|a mini-series for the BBC]], starring [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]. In 1984 he published ''[[The Paper Men]]'': an account of the struggles between a novelist and his would-be biographer.

The novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' is arguably Golding's most famous book. Considered a modern classic, the book is read in schools around the world today.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2014-09-16|title=William Golding Flies classic holds true 60 years on|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-29205286|access-date=2020-12-22}}</ref>
