==Biography==
Guru Tegh Bahadur was the youngest son of Guru Hargobind, the sixth guru: Guru Hargobind had one daughter, Bibi Viro, and five sons: Baba Gurditta, Suraj Mal, Ani Rai, Atal Rai, and Tyaga Mal. Tyaga Mal was born in Amritsar in the early hours of 1 April 1621. He came to be known by the name Tegh Bahadur (Mighty of the Sword), given to him by Guru Hargobind after he had shown his valor in a battle against the Mughals.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&pg=PA34|year=1995|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4|pages=34–35|access-date=23 November 2016|archive-date=28 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528230214/https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&pg=PA34%2F|url-status=live}}</ref>

Amritsar at that time was the center of the Sikh faith. As the seat of the [[Sikh Gurus]], and with its connection to Sikhs in far-flung areas of the country through the chains of ''Masands'' or missionaries, it had developed the characteristics of the state capital. 

Guru Tegh Bahadur was brought up in the Sikh culture and trained in [[archery]] and [[horsemanship]]. He was also taught the old classics such as the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]], and the [[Puranas]]. He preferred prolonged spells of seclusion and contemplation. Tegh Bahadur was married on 3 February 1632 to Mata Gujri.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bonnie|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history, Volume 2|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/410 410]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/410}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=H.S.

===Stay at Bakala ===
In the 1640s, nearing his death, Guru Hargobind and his wife Nanki moved to his ancestral village of [[Baba Bakala|Bakala]] in [[Amritsar district]], together with Tegh Bahadur and [[Mata Gujri]]. Bakala, as described in '''''Gurbilas Dasvin Patshahi''''', was then a prosperous town with many beautiful pools, wells, and ''baolis''. After Guru Hargobind's death, Tegh Bahadur continued to live in Bakala with his wife and mother. <ref name=gandhi621>{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Surjit|title=History of Sikh gurus retold|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|year=2007|isbn=978-81-269-0858-5|pages=621–22}}</ref>

===Guru journey===
In March 1664 [[Guru Har Krishan]] contracted [[smallpox]]. When asked by his followers who would lead them after him, he replied ''Baba Bakala'', meaning his successor was to be found in Bakala. Taking advantage of the ambiguity in the words of the dying Guru, many installed themselves in Bakala, claiming themselves as the new Guru. Sikhs were puzzled to see so many claimants.<ref name=mk1992/><ref name=hss2000/>

Sikh tradition has a myth concerning the manner in which Tegh Bahadur was selected as the ninth guru. A wealthy trader, [[Baba Makhan Shah Labana]], had once prayed for his life and had promised to gift 500 gold coins to the Sikh Guru if he survived.<ref name=mk1992/> He arrived in search of the ninth Guru. He went from one claimant to the next making his obeisance and offering two gold coins to each Guru, believing that the right guru would know that his silent promise was to gift 500 coins for his safety. Every "guru" he met accepted the two gold coins and bid him farewell.<ref name=mk1992/> Then he discovered that Tegh Bahadur also lived at Bakala. Labana gifted Tegh Bahadur the usual offering of two gold coins. Tegh Bahadur gave him his blessings and remarked that his offering was considerably short of the promised five hundred. Makhan Shah Labana forthwith made good the difference and ran upstairs. He began shouting from the rooftop, '''"Guru ladho re, Guru ladho re"''' meaning "I have found the Guru, I have found the Guru".<ref name=mk1992>{{cite book|last=Kohli|first=Mohindar|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur: testimony of conscience|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=1992|isbn=978-81-7201-234-2|pages=13–15}}</ref>

In August 1664 a Sikh [[Sangat (Sikhism)|Sangat]] arrived in Bakala and anointed Tegh Bahadur as the ninth guru of Sikhs. The ''Sangat'' was led by Diwan Durga Mal, and a formal '''"Tikka ceremony"''' was performed by [[Baba Gurditta]], elder brother of Guru Teg Bahadur, conferring Guruship on Him.<ref name=hss2000>{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1|page=85}}</ref>

As had been the custom among Sikhs after the execution of [[Guru Arjan]] by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, Guru Tegh Bahadur was surrounded by armed bodyguards.<ref>{{cite book|author=H.R.

==Works==
Guru Tegh Bahadur contributed many hymns to Granth Sahib<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-25|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur Martyrdom Day: Revelation From Guru Granth Sahib Ji|url=https://news.jagatgururampalji.org/guru-tegh-bahadur-martyrdom-day/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-26|website=SA News Channel|language=en-US}}</ref> including the ''Shloks'', or couplets near the end of the Guru Granth Sahib.<ref name=mk37/> Guru Tegh Bahadur toured various parts of the Mughal Empire and was asked by Gobind Sahali to construct several Sikh temples in Mahali. His works include 116 shabads, 15 ragas, and his bhagats are credited with 782 compositions that are part of ''bani'' in Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi|title=The history of Sikh gurus|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2006|isbn=978-81-8382-075-2|page=170}}</ref> His works are included in the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'' (pages 219–1427).<ref name="mahalla">{{cite book|author=Tegh Bahadur (Translated by Gopal Singh)|title=Mahalla nawan: compositions of Guru Tegh Bahādur-the ninth guru (from Sri Guru Granth Sahib): Bāṇī Gurū Tega Bahādara|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-81-7764-897-3|pages=xxviii–xxxiii, 15–27}}</ref> They cover a wide range of topics, such as the nature of God, human attachments, body, mind, sorrow, dignity, service, death, and deliverance.

==Journeys==
Guru Tegh Bahadur traveled extensively in different parts of the country, including [[Dhaka]] and [[Assam]], to preach the teachings of Nanak, the first Sikh guru. The places he visited and stayed in became sites of Sikh temples.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1|pages=139–40}}</ref> During his travels, Guru Tegh Bahadur spread the Sikh ideas and message, as well as started community water wells and langars (community kitchen charity for the poor).<ref name="ps189">{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi|title=The history of Sikh gurus|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2006|isbn=978-81-8382-075-2|pages=187–89}}</ref><ref name="rp88">{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism and Indian civilization|year=2004|isbn=978-81-7141-879-4|page=88}}</ref>

The Guru made three successive visits to [[Kiratpur Sahib|Kiratpur]]. On 21 August 1664, Guru went there to console Bibi Roop upon the death of her father, [[Guru Har Rai]], the seventh Sikh guru, and of his brother, Guru Har Krishan. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Sikhism - Guru Har Rai {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism/Guru-Har-Rai|access-date=2021-11-26|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref> The second visit was on 15 October 1664, at the death on 29 September 1664, of Bassi, the mother of Guru Har Rai. A third visit concluded a fairly extensive journey through the northwest Indian subcontinent. His son [[Guru Gobind Singh]], who would be the tenth Sikh Guru, was born in [[Patna]], while he was away in [[Dhubri]], Assam in 1666, where stands the [[Gurdwara Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib]].There he helped end the war between Raja Ram Singh of Bengal and Raja Chakardwaj of Ahom state (later Assam).<ref name="ps189" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Kohli|first=Mohindar|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur: testimony of conscience|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=1992|isbn=978-81-7201-234-2|pages=25–27}}</ref> He visited the towns of Mathura, Agra, Allahabad and Varanasi.<ref name="nsxviii">{{cite book|author=Gobind Singh (Translated by Navtej Sarna)|title=Zafarnama|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-670-08556-9|pages=xviii–xix}}</ref>

After his visit to Assam, Bengal and Bihar, the Guru visited Rani Champa of [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]] who offered to give the Guru a piece of land in her state. The Guru bought the site for 500 [[rupees]]. There, Guru Tegh Bahadur founded the city of [[Anandpur Sahib]] in the foothills of Himalayas.<ref name=bbcgtb/><ref>{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1|page=21}}</ref> In 1672, Tegh Bahadur traveled through Kashmir and the North-West Frontier, to meet the masses, as the persecution of [[Kafir|non-Muslim]]s reached new heights.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi|title=The history of Sikh gurus|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2006|isbn=978-81-8382-075-2|pages=121–24}}</ref>

== Conflicts with Mughals ==
Padshah Burranji (c. late seventeenth century) prob. remains the earliest source to chronicle the contestations between Aurangzeb and Guru — it portrayed Tegh Bahadur as a migrant plunderer, commandeering a force of thousands. Acting upon the complaint of Brahmins and Qazis, Aurangzeb had issued summons but on being met with defiance, he had Tegh Bahadur forcibly captured and scheduled for execution. However, [[Ram Singh I]] saved him — he became the Guru's personal surety and brought him to his territory, only for the Guru to flee away. Aurangzeb took much umbrage at Ram Singh I but did not punish him; instead, he was sent for an expedition to Assam. The Burranji does not mention of what happened to Tegh Bahadur afterwards; he, very likely, resumed on an eastward journey. It is not very clear why the Mughals did not mount further assaults.{{Efn|Sikh bardic chronicles, alleged to be of contemporary times, reproduce the same narrative but with some minor variations — the Guru was imprisoned alongside Mati Das, Sati Das, Dayal Das and others, under the over-watch of Ram Singh I, who not only resisted and deferred his execution but eventually allowed him to flee.{{pb}}However, it is very likely that these chronicles contain interpolations. Grewal and others caution against using these documents as reliable sources of history.}} 

===Execution===
The primary nucleus of Sikh narratives remain the roughly contemporary ''[[Bachittar Natak]]'', a memoir of Tegh Bahadur's son, dated between late 1680s and late 1690s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Fenech|first=Louis E.|date=1997|title=Martyrdom and the Sikh Tradition|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/606445|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=117|issue=4|pages=623–642|doi=10.2307/606445|jstor=606445|issn=0003-0279|access-date=2 December 2017|archive-date=6 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006000554/https://www.jstor.org/stable/606445|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Grewal|first=J.

The earliest Persian source to chronicle his execution is ''Siyar-ul-Mutakhkherin'' by [[Ghulam Hussain Khan]] c. 1782, where Tegh Bahadur's (alleged) oppression of subjects is held to have incurred Aurangzeb's wrath:<ref name="sc2001">{{cite web|last1=Chandra|first1=Satish|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur's martyrdom|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2001/10/16/stories/05162524.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020228135707/http://thehindu.com/thehindu/2001/10/16/stories/05162524.htm|archive-date=28 February 2002|access-date=20 October 2016|work=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref>
{{Quotation|Tegh Bahadur, the Ninth successor of (Guru) Nanak became a man of authority with a large number of followers. (In fact) Several thousand persons used to accompany him as he moved from place to place. His contemporary Hafiz Adam, a faqir belonging to the group of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's followers, had also come to have a large number of murids and followers. Both these men (Guru Tegh Bahadur and Hafiz Adam) used to move about in Punjab, adopting a habit of coercion and extortion. Tegh Bahadur used to collect money from Hindus and Hafiz Adam from Muslims.

Over course of time, strands of narratives from bardic chronicles were compounded with it, to generate a popular narrative which (roughly) runs as follows: Tegh Bahadur left from his base at Makhowal to confront the persecution of [[Kashmiri Hindus|Kashmiri Brahmins]] by Mughal officials but was arrested at Ropar and put to jail in Sirhind.<ref name="Grewal1998p71">{{cite book|author=J.

Remarkably, in contrast to this dominating theme in Sikh literature, some pre-modern Sikh accounts had laid the blame on an acrimonious succession dispute: Ram Rai, elder brother of [[Guru Har Krishan]], was held to have instigated Aurangzeb against Tegh Bahadur by suggesting that he prove his spiritual greatness by performing miracles at the Court.<ref name="sc2001" />{{Efn|Ghulam Muhiuddin Bute Shah in his ''Tarikh- i-Punjab'' reiterates this narrative.}} Sohan Lal Suri, the court historian of [[Ranjit Singh]], in his magisterial ''[[Umdat ut Tawarikh]]'' (c. 1805) chose to reiterate Hussain Khan's argument at large: Tegh Bahadur had provided refuge to all classes of rebels and commanded a huge nomadic army across Punjab; so he was put down at the earliest, lest he declare an insurrection in near future.<ref name="sc2001" />

[[Guru Har Gobind]] was Guru Tegh Bahadur's father. He was originally named ''Tyag Mal'' ({{lang-pa|ਤਿਆਗ ਮਲ}}) but was later renamed ''Tegh Bahadur'' after his gallantry and bravery in the wars against the Mughal forces. He built the city of Anandpur Sahib and was responsible for saving a faction of [[Kashmiri Pandits]], who were being persecuted by the Mughals.<ref name="pslf">{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh and Louis Fenech|title=The Oxford handbook of Sikh studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|location=Oxford, UK|pages=236–245, 444–446, Quote: "this second martyrdom helped to make 'human rights and freedom of conscience' central to its identity." Quote: "This is the reputed place where several Kashmiri Pandits came seeking protection from Aurangzeb's army."}}</ref>

After the execution of Tegh Bahadur by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a number of Sikh temples were built in his and his associates' memory. The [[Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib]] in [[Chandni Chowk]], Delhi, was built over where he was beheaded.<ref name=skc>SK Chatterji (1975), Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur and the Sis Ganj Gurdwara, Sikh Review, 23(264): 100–09</ref> [[Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib]], also in Delhi, is built on the site of the residence of a disciple of Teg Bahadur, who burned his house to cremate his master's body.<ref name=singharakab/>

Gurdwara Sisganj Sahib in Punjab marks the site where in November 1675, the head of the martyred Guru Teg Bahadar which was brought by Bhai Jaita (renamed [[Bhai Jiwan Singh]] according to [[Sikh rites]]) in defiance of the Mughal authority of Aurangzeb was cremated here.<ref>Harbans Singh (1992), "History of Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib", in ''Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume 1'', pg. 547</ref> During his journey to Anandpur Sahib Bhai Jaita Singh reach a village near Delhi in [[Sonipat]] and the Mughal army also reach that village.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dibhu.com/index.php/2019/05/06/baba-kushal-singh-ji-dahiya/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 January 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224171945/http://dibhu.com/index.php/2019/05/06/baba-kushal-singh-ji-dahiya/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Bhai Jaita demand for help to villagers so the villagers hideout Bhai Jaita with Guru' head.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hindi.pratilipi.com/read/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE-ttraa5um49oe-4v256n71255eh9d|title=Pratilipi {{!}} Read Stories, Poems and Books|website=hindi.pratilipi.com|language=hi|access-date=2020-01-05|archive-date=26 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210926165700/https://hindi.pratilipi.com/read/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE-ttraa5um49oe-4v256n71255eh9d|url-status=live}}</ref> A villager named [[Kushal Singh Dahiya]] came ahead and offers his own head in the place of Guru's head to Mughal army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.khaskhabar.com/news/news-cm-manohar-lal-unveils-statue-of-kushal-singh-dahiya-at-rai-in-sonipat-news-hindi-1-270473-KKN.html|title=कुशाल सिंह दहिया की प्रतिमा का सीएम ने किया अनावरण|date=2017-11-09|website=khas khabar|language=hi|access-date=2020-01-05|archive-date=27 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110640/https://m.khaskhabar.com/news/news-cm-manohar-lal-unveils-statue-of-kushal-singh-dahiya-at-rai-in-sonipat-news-hindi-1-270473-KKN.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After beheading [[Kushal Singh Dahiya]] the villagers shuffle the heads and give the head of [[Kushal Singh Dahiya]] to Mughal army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/cm-unveils-statue-of-kushal-singh-dahiya.html|title=CM unveils statue of Kushal Singh Dahiya|last=Pioneer|first=The|website=The Pioneer|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05|archive-date=21 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221103657/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/cm-unveils-statue-of-kushal-singh-dahiya.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The execution hardened the resolve of Sikhs against Muslim rule and the persecution. Pashaura Singh states that, "if the martyrdom of [[Guru Arjan]] had helped bring the Sikh Panth together, Guru Tegh Bahadur's martyrdom helped to make the protection of human rights central to its [[Sikh]] identity".<ref name="cs2013" /> Wilfred Smith<ref name="ws1981" /> stated "the attempt to forcibly convert the ninth Guru to an externalized, impersonal Islam clearly made an indelible impression on the martyr's nine-year-old son, Gobind, who reacted slowly but deliberately by eventually organizing the Sikh group into a distinct, formal, symbol-patterned community". It inaugurated the Khalsa identity.<ref name="ws1981">{{cite book|author=Wilfred Smith|year=1981|page=[https://archive.org/details/onunderstandingi0000smit/page/191 191]|title=On Understanding Islam: Selected Studies|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|isbn=978-9027934482|url=https://archive.org/details/onunderstandingi0000smit/page/191}}</ref>
