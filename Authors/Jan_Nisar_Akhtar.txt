His poetry was secular and like many of progressive writers of his generation talked of freedom, dignity, economic exploitation and other issues gleaming of the leftist leanings.<ref>''History of Indian Literature: 1911–1956, struggle for freedom: triumph and tragedy, '' by Sisir Kumar Das. [[Sahitya Akademi]], 2006. {{ISBN|81-7201-798-7}}. ''p.  226''.</ref> Even his romanticism which was amply displayed in his [[ghazal]]s, was replete with references to household and family life. His notable books include ''Nazr-e-Butaan'', ''Salaasil'', ''Javidaan'', ''Ghar Angan'' and ''Khaak-e-Dil'' (all Urdu titles). One of his many famous [[Sher (poem)|couplets]] is :

''Ashaar mere yuu.N to zamaane ke liye hai.n'',<br />

''There are some couplets meant just for the beloved''

He wrote and produced a film, ''[[Bahu Begum]]'' (1967), starring [[Pradeep Kumar]] and [[Meena Kumari]]. During the period of four-year to his death he published three collections of his works most important of them being, ''Khak-e-Dil'' (The Ashes of Heart"), which has his representative poems from 1935 to 1970, and which won him the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] (Urdu) in 1976.<ref>''Indian publishing in the seventies. by Vijaya Kumar Das.

==Family==
In 1943, he married Safia, sister of the poet [[Majaz]]. Safia worked as a school teacher at an Urdu-medium ''madarsa'' (Muslim school). She was meeting a practical necessity, to work outside her home, because Jan Nisar's income was at best sporadic, and it was necessary for her to work to support her children. Thus, when Jan Nisar moved to Mumbai to try his luck at earning a living as a film lyricist, Safia stayed back in Gwalior with their children, and wrote her absent husband a series of letters in Urdu. A collection of these letters, written between 1 October 1943 to 29 December 1953 penned, were first published in 1955 in two volumes under the title, "Harf-e-Aashna" and "Zer-e-Lab." Professor [[Asghar Wajahat]], former Head of the Hindi Department, [[Jamia Millia Islamia]], translated these letters into Hindi and this was published under the title "Tumhare Naam" in 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040721012648/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/01/08/stories/2004010800590300.htm Tumhare Naam, with love] [[The Hindu]], 8 January 2004.</ref>

Safia Akhtar died of cancer on 17 January 1953, less than ten years after her wedding, and left behind two very small sons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Jan Nisar left the children in the care of relatives while he pursued his hobbies of writing poetry and hobnobbing with various luminaries and socialites in Mumbai. Three years after Safia's death, Jan Nisar got married again on 17 September 1956, to Khadija Talat. His children by Safia did not have a good relationship with their step-mother, and his relations with them was likewise dysfunctional.
