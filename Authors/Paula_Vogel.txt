=== Career ===
A productive playwright since the late 1970s, Vogel first came to national prominence with her [[AIDS]]-related [[tragicomedy|seriocomedy]] ''[[The Baltimore Waltz]]'', which won the [[Obie Award]] for Best Play in 1992.  She is best known for her Pulitzer Prize-winning play ''[[How I Learned to Drive]]'' (1997), which examines the impact and echoes of child [[sexual abuse]] and [[incest]].  Other notable plays include ''Desdemona, A Play About A Handkerchief'' (1993), ''The Oldest Profession'' (1981), ''And Baby Makes Seven'' (1984), ''[[Hot 'N Throbbing]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Mineola Twins]]'' (1996).

====Style and themes====
Although no particular theme or topic dominates her work, she often examines traditionally controversial issues such as sexual abuse and [[prostitution]]. Asserting that she "writes the play backwards," moving from emotional circumstances and character to craft narrative structure, Vogel says, "My writing isn't actually guided by issues.... I only write about things that directly impact my life." Vogel adds, "If people get upset, it's because the play is working."  Vogel's family, especially her late brother Carl Vogel, influences her writings. Vogel says, "In every play, there are a couple of places where I send a message to my late brother Carl. Just a little something in the atmosphere of every play to try and change the [[homophobia]] in our world."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mary-Louise|last=Parker|author-link=Mary-Louise Parker|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/61/articles/2108|title=Paula Vogel|magazine=[[BOMB Magazine]]|date=Fall 1997|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Carl's likeness appears in such plays as ''[[The Long Christmas Ride Home]]'' (2003), ''And Baby Makes Seven'', and ''The Baltimore Waltz''.

"Vogel tends to select sensitive, difficult, fraught issues to theatricalize," theatre theorist [[Jill Dolan]] comments, "and to spin them with a [[dramaturgy]] that's at once creative, highly imaginative, and brutally honest."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jill|last=Dolan|title=How I Learned to Drive (review)|magazine=Theatre Journal|volume=50|issue=1|date=March 1998|page=127}}</ref> Her work embraces theatrical devices from across several traditions, incorporating, in various works, [[direct address]], [[bunraku]] puppetry, omniscient narration, and [[fantasy]] sequences.  Critic David Finkel finds this breadth in Vogel's career to be reflective of a general tendency toward stylistic reinvention from work to work.  "This playwright recoils at the notion of writing plays that are alike in their composition," Finkel writes.  "She wants each play to be different in texture from those that have preceded it."<ref>{{cite news | first=David|last=Finkle | title=Review: The Long Christmas Ride Home | url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/4056 | work=TheaterMania | date=5 November 2003 | access-date=2008-12-25}}</ref>
