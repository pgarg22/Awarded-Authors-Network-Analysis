'''Vladislav Petković Dis''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Владислав Петковић Дис}}; 10 March 1880 – 30 May 1917) was a [[Serbia]]n [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist]] poet. He died in 1917 on a boat on the [[Ionian Sea]] after being hit by a German torpedo making him also remembered as a [[war poet]].

==Biography==
Vladislav Petković was born in Zablaće, a village near [[Čačak]], in the Principality of Serbia. He made his way to Čačak, graduating from the Gymnasium and Teacher's College in 1902. He was appointed temporary teacher at [[Prlita]], a village near the town of [[Zaječar]]. He did not like teaching, and his small output of poetry brought him little income. In 1903, he moved to [[Belgrade]], and became prominent in the literary life there, when his poems appeared in ''Idila'', a literary magazine.Vladislav Petković chose his appellation "Dis" as a repetition of the middle syllable of his first name, but also as the name of the Roman god of the underworld. He was a frequent evening visitor to the Belgrade's [[kafana|''kafanas'']] in [[Skadarlija]] and elsewhere where he would drink and compose new verse at the same time.

He obtained an appointment as a customs official with the municipal government, giving him a good income and leisure time to write. He was named co-editor, with [[Sima Pandurović]], of ''Literary Week'' (Književna nedelja). Both Petković-Dis and Pandurović were considered the ''[[enfants terribles]]'' of their literary world (both being under the influence of [[Charles Baudelaire]] and other French Symbolists, like Šantić, Dučić, Rakić, Ćorović, and even Skerlić before he abandoned the movement). After the demise of the magazine, he married Hristina-Tinka, with whom he had two children, Gordana and Mutimir.

He wrote ''Spomenik'' (Monument) in anticipation of [[World War I]]:<blockquote><poem>''And it still seems that,<br>as my soul dreams on,<br>the monument lives on,<br>ready for eternity,<br>reborn into new traditions,<br>tempering young ambitions<br>to erect the next monument.''</poem></blockquote> During the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]] he was conscripted by the military as a journalist. He was the war correspondent covering battles of the [[Serbian Army]] in the [[First Balkan War]] (1912), [[Second Balkan War]] (1913), and [[World War I]] that followed. In 1915 he joined the Serbian army in their [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|retreat]] to [[Corfu]].

From Corfu, Petković was sent to [[France]] to recuperate and write about the entire tragedy. In 1917, on his way back, on either 16 May or 29 May (varying sources), he became a civilian war casualty after boarding an Italian ship, destined for Corfu. It was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine in the [[Ionian Sea]].<ref name="VN ref">{{cite web |url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:278283-Mornar-zivota-i-smrti |author=Večernje novosti |author-link=Večernje novosti |title=Mornar života i smrti |access-date=2021-01-10 |date=2007-02-26 |language=sr}}</ref> He is said to have predicted his unfortunate destiny, for one of his most famous collections of poems is called ''Drowned Souls'', earning him the reputation of a [[Poète maudit|cursed poet]].

His nickname '''Dis''' was derived from the three letters in the middle of his first name "Vla-DIS-lav". He introduced irrational and subconscious images into Serbian [[lyric poetry]]. Some of his most famous poems are ''Možda spava'' (''She May Be Sleeping'') and ''Spomenik'' (''Monument'').

In ''Spomenik'', Dis dreamed of a monument:<blockquote><poem>''It has a long life,<br>Today it descends into new legends,<br>To prepare our descendants for the next monument.''<br></poem></blockquote> Petković Dis was writing in 1913, just after Serbia wrested [[Kosovo]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and installed an obelisk on the site of the famous [[Battle of Kosovo|medieval battle]] when Kosovo was severed from Serbia by the Ottomans. Dis's poetry was not well received at the beginning by [[Jovan Skerlić]], one of the most distinguished Serbian literary critics of that time, who did not care for the poems' morbid and sinister tone.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
