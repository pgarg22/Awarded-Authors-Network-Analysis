'''Sir Walter Raleigh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɔː|l|i|,_|ˈ|r|æ|l|i|,_|ˈ|r|ɑː|l|i}}; {{circa|1552}} – 29 October 1618), also spelled '''Ralegh''',{{efn |name=pronunciation}} was an English statesman, soldier, spy, writer, poet, explorer and [[Landed gentry|landed gentleman]]. One of the most notable figures of the [[Elizabethan era]], he played a leading part in [[English colonisation of North America]], suppressed rebellion in [[Ireland]], helped defend [[Kingdom of England|England]] during the [[Spanish Armada]] and held political positions under [[Elizabeth I]].

Raleigh was born to a [[Protestant]] family in [[Devon]], the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne, and a cousin of Sir [[Richard Grenville]] and younger half-brother of Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]]. Little is known of his early life, though in his late teens he spent some time in [[Kingdom of France|France]] taking part in the [[French Wars of Religion|religious civil wars]]. In his 20s he took part in the suppression of rebellion in the [[Plantations of Ireland|colonisation]] of [[Ireland]]; he also participated in the [[siege of Smerwick]]. Later, he became a landlord of property in Ireland and mayor of [[Youghal]] in East [[Munster]], where his house still stands in [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal|Myrtle Grove]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Church and Town of Sir Walter Raleigh | website=United Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross | date=2021-05-21 | url=http://cork.anglican.org/tourism/historical-interest/the-church-and-town-of-sir-walter-raleigh/ | access-date=2021-06-15}}</ref> He rose rapidly in the favour of Queen [[Elizabeth I]] and was knighted in 1585. He was granted a [[royal patent]] to explore [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], paving the way for future English settlements. In 1591, he secretly married [[Elizabeth Throckmorton]], one of the Queen's [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], without the Queen's permission, for which he and his wife were sent to the [[Tower of London]]. After his release, they retired to his estate at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]].

In 1594, Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in [[South America]] and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of "[[El Dorado]]". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower, this time for being involved in the [[Main Plot]] against [[King James I]], who was not favourably disposed towards him. In 1616, he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado. During the expedition, men led by his top commander ransacked a Spanish outpost, in violation of both the terms of his pardon and the [[Treaty of London (1604)|1604 peace treaty with Spain]]. Raleigh returned to England and, to appease the Spanish, he was arrested and executed in 1618.

==Early life==
[[File:Millais Boyhood of Raleigh.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1871]]
Little is known about Sir Walter Raleigh's birth{{sfn|Black et al.|2011|p=724}} but he is believed to have been born on 22 January 1552 (or possibly 1554{{sfn|Nicholls|Williams|2004}}). He grew up in the house of Hayes [[Barton (demesne)|Barton]]{{sfn|Batten|2020}} (in the parish of [[East Budleigh]]), in South [[Devon]]. He was the youngest of the five sons of Walter Raleigh (1510–1581) (or Rawleigh) of [[Fardel Manor]] (in the parish of [[Cornwood]]),{{sfn|Cherry|Pevsner|2004|p=288}} in South Devon. Raleigh's family is generally assumed to have been a junior branch of the de Raleigh family, 11th-century lords of the [[manor of Raleigh, Pilton]]{{sfn|Vivian|1895|p=638}} in North Devon, although the two branches are known to have borne entirely dissimilar coats of arms,{{efn|Raleigh of Pilton: ''Gules crusilly or, a bend vair''; arms of Raleigh of Fardell: ''Gules, five fusils conjoined in bend argent''{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} }} adopted at the start of the age of [[heraldry]] (c. 1200–1215).

[[File:GilbertImpalingChampernowne YardeHeraldicWindow ChurstonFerrersChurch.xcf|thumb|Arms of Katherine Champernowne, mother of Sir Walter Raleigh, impaled by the arms of her first husband, Otes Gilbert. [[Churston Ferrers]] Church]]

His mother was Katherine Champernowne, the third wife of Walter Raleigh senior, and the fourth daughter of Sir Philip Champernowne (1479–1545), [[lord of the manor]] of [[Modbury]], Devon, by his wife Catherine Carew, a daughter of Sir Edmund Carew (d.1513) of [[Mohuns Ottery]] (in the parish of [[Luppitt]]), Devon,{{sfn|Vivian|1895|pp=639, 405, 162}} and widow of Otes Gilbert (1513–1546/7) of [[Greenway Estate|Greenway]] (in the parish of [[Brixham]]) and of [[Compton Castle]] (in the parish of [[Marldon]]), both in Devon. (The coat of arms of Otes Gilbert and Katherine Champernowne survives in a stained glass window in [[Churston Ferrers]] Church, near Greenway.) Katherine Champernowne's paternal aunt was [[Katherine Champernowne|Kat Ashley]], governess of Queen Elizabeth I, who introduced Raleigh and his brothers to the court.{{sfn|Ronald|2007|p=249}} In addition, Raleigh's maternal uncle was Sir [[Arthur Champernowne]] (c. 1524–1578), a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]], [[Sheriff of Devon]] and [[Vice-Admiral of the West|Admiral of the West]]. Walter Raleigh junior's immediate family included his full brother [[Carew Raleigh]], and half-brothers John Gilbert, [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and Adrian Gilbert. As a consequence of their kinship with the Champernowne family, all of the Raleigh and Gilbert brothers became prominent during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I]] and [[James I]].

Raleigh's family was highly [[Protestant]] in religious orientation and had a number of near escapes during the reign of [[Roman Catholic]] Queen [[Mary I of England]]. In the most notable of these, his father had to hide in a tower to avoid execution. As a result, Raleigh developed a hatred of Roman Catholicism during his childhood, and proved himself quick to express it after Protestant Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. In matters of religion, Elizabeth was more moderate than her half-sister Mary.{{sfn|Bremer|Webster|2006|p=454}}

In 1569, Raleigh left for France to serve with the [[Huguenot]]s in the French religious civil wars.{{sfn|Black et al.|2011|p=724}} In 1572, Raleigh was registered as an undergraduate at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but he left a year later without a degree. Raleigh proceeded to finish his education in the [[Inns of Court]].{{sfn|Black et al.|2011|p=724}} In 1575, he was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]], having previously been a member of [[Lyon's Inn]], one of the [[Inns of Chancery]].<ref name="Midddle Temple"/> At his trial in 1603, he stated that he had never studied law. His life is uncertain between 1569 and 1575, but in his ''History of the World'' he claimed to have been an eyewitness at the [[Battle of Moncontour]] (3 October 1569) in France. In 1575 or 1576, Raleigh returned to England.{{sfn|Edwards|1868|pp=26–33}}

==Ireland==
[[File:Raleigh's first pipe in England.jpeg|thumb|"Raleigh's First Pipe in England", an illustration included in [[Frederick William Fairholt]]'s ''Tobacco, its history and associations''{{sfn|Fairholt|1859|p=}}]]

''See [[Plantations of Ireland]]''

Between 1579 and 1583, Raleigh took part in the suppression of the [[Desmond Rebellions]]. He was present at the [[siege of Smerwick]], where he led the party that beheaded some 600 Spanish and Italian soldiers.{{sfn|St. John|1869|p=52-77}}{{sfn|Nicholls|Williams|2011|p=15}} Raleigh received {{cvt|40000|acre}} (approximately 0.2% of Ireland) upon the seizure and distribution of land following the attainders arising from the rebellion, including the coastal walled town of [[Youghal]] and, further up the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater River]], the village of [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]]. This made him one of the principal landowners and colonists in [[Munster]], but he had limited success inducing English tenants to settle on his [[Plantations of Ireland|estates]].

Raleigh made the town of Youghal his occasional home during his 17 years as an Irish landlord, frequently being domiciled at [[Killua Castle]], [[Clonmellon]], [[County Westmeath]]. He was mayor there from 1588 to 1589. His town mansion of [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal|Myrtle Grove]] is assumed to be the setting for the story that his servant doused him with a bucket of water after seeing clouds of smoke coming from Raleigh's pipe, in the belief that he had been set alight. But this story is also told of other places associated with Raleigh: the Virginia Ash Inn in [[Henstridge]] near [[Sherborne]], [[Sherborne Castle]], and [[South Wraxall Manor]] in [[Wiltshire]], home of Raleigh's friend [[Walter Long (died 1610)|Sir Walter Long]].

Amongst Raleigh's acquaintances in Munster was another Englishman who had been granted land in the Irish colonies, poet [[Edmund Spenser]]. In the 1590s, he and Raleigh travelled together from Ireland to the court at London, where Spenser presented part of his allegorical poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to Elizabeth I.

Raleigh's management of his Irish estates ran into difficulties which contributed to a decline in his fortunes. In 1602, he sold the lands to [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork]], who subsequently prospered under kings [[James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].{{sfn|Laughton| Lee|1896}} Following Raleigh's death, members of his family approached Boyle for compensation on the ground that Raleigh had struck an improvident bargain.

==New World==
[[File:Sir Walter Raleigh by Simon van de Passe (1617).jpg|thumb|Engraved portrait of Raleigh]]
In 1584, Queen Elizabeth granted Raleigh a royal charter authorising him to explore, colonise and rule any "remote, heathen and barbarous lands, countries and territories, not actually possessed of any Christian Prince or inhabited by Christian People", in return for one-fifth of all the gold and silver that might be mined there.<ref name=yale.edu/> This charter specified that Raleigh had seven years in which to establish a settlement, or else lose his right to do so. Raleigh and Elizabeth intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World and a base from which to send [[privateer]]s on raids against the treasure fleets of [[Spain]]. Raleigh himself never visited North America, although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to the [[Orinoco]] river basin in [[South America]] in search of the golden city of [[El Dorado]]. Instead, he sent others in 1585 to find the [[Roanoke Colony]], later known as the "Lost Colony".{{sfn|Quinn|1985|p=}}

These expeditions were funded primarily by Raleigh and his friends but never provided the steady stream of [[revenue]] necessary to maintain a colony in America. (Subsequent colonisation attempts in the early 17th century were made under the [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] [[Virginia Company]], which was able to raise the capital necessary to create successful colonies.)

In 1587, Raleigh attempted a second expedition, again establishing a settlement on Roanoke Island. This time, [[List of colonists at Roanoke|a more diverse group of settlers]] was sent, including some entire families,<ref name=si.edu/> under the governance of [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]].{{sfn|Hakluyt|1965|p=522}} After a short while in America, White returned to England to obtain more supplies for the colony, planning to return in a year. Unfortunately for the colonists at Roanoke, one year became three. The first delay came when Queen Elizabeth I ordered all vessels to remain at port for potential use against the [[Spanish Armada]]. After England's 1588 victory over the Spanish Armada, the ships were given permission to sail.{{sfn|Quinn|1985|pp=125–126}}

The second delay came after White's small fleet set sail for Roanoke and his crew insisted on sailing first towards [[Cuba]] in hopes of capturing treasure-laden Spanish merchant ships. Enormous riches described by their pilot, an experienced [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator hired by Raleigh, outweighed White's objections to the delay.{{sfn|Quinn|1985|pp=125–126}}

When the supply ship arrived in Roanoke, three years later than planned, the colonists had disappeared.{{sfn|Quinn|1985|pp=130–133}} The only clue to their fate was the word "CROATOAN" and letters "CRO" carved into tree trunks. White had arranged with the settlers that if they should move, the name of their destination be carved into a tree or corner post. This suggested the possibility that they had moved to [[Croatoan Island]], but a hurricane prevented John White from investigating the island for survivors.{{sfn|Quinn|1985|pp=130–133}} Other speculation includes their having starved, or been swept away or lost at sea during the stormy weather of 1588. No further attempts at contact were recorded for some years. Whatever the fate of the settlers, the settlement is now remembered as the [[Roanoke Colony|"Lost Colony of Roanoke Island"]].

==1580s==
In December 1581, Raleigh returned to England from Ireland <!---hidden because it's incomprehensible: to despatches---> as his company had been disbanded. He took part in court life and became a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I because of his efforts at increasing the Protestant Church in Ireland.<ref name="Walter Raleigh Biography"/> In 1585, Raleigh was knighted and was appointed [[Lord Warden of the Stannaries|warden of the stannaries]], that is of the [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|tin mines]] of Cornwall and Devon, [[Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall]] and [[List of vice-admirals of the coast|vice-admiral]] of the two counties. He was a member of parliament for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devonshire]] in 1585 and 1586.{{sfn|Laughton|Lee|1896}} He was also granted the right to colonise America.<ref name="Walter Raleigh Biography"/>

Raleigh commissioned shipbuilder R. Chapman of [[Deptford]] to build a ship for him. It was originally called ''Ark'' but became ''[[English ship Ark Royal (1587)|Ark Raleigh]]'', following the convention at the time by which the ship bore the name of its owner. [[The Crown]] (in the person of Queen Elizabeth I) purchased the ship from Raleigh in January 1587 for £5,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.005|1587|2015|r=1}}}} million as of 2015).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} This took the form of a reduction in the sum that Sir Walter owed the queen; he received [[Tally stick|Exchequer tallies]] but no money. As a result, the ship was renamed ''Ark Royal''.{{sfn|Collier|1852|p=151}}

In the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]] year of 1588, Raleigh had some involvement with defence against the Spanish at Devon. The ship that he had built, ''Ark Royal'', was Lord High Admiral [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Howard]]'s flagship.{{sfn|May|1989|p=8}}

==1590–1594==
[[File:William Segar Sir Walter Raleigh 1598.jpg|thumb|Sir Walter Raleigh by [[William Segar]]]]
In 1592, Raleigh was given many rewards by the Queen, including [[Durham House, London|Durham House]] in [[Strand, London|the Strand]] and the estate of Sherborne, Dorset. He was appointed [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard]]. However, he had not been given any of the [[Great Offices of State|great offices of state]].{{sfn|May|1989|p=8}}

In 1591, Raleigh had been secretly married to [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Elizabeth "Bess" Throckmorton]] (or Throgmorton). She was one of the Queen's [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], 11 years his junior, and was pregnant at the time. She gave birth to a son, believed to be named Damerei, who was given to a [[wet nurse]] at Durham House, but he died in October 1592 of plague. Bess resumed her duties to the queen. The following year, the unauthorised marriage was discovered and the Queen ordered Raleigh to be imprisoned and Bess dismissed from court. Both were imprisoned in the Tower of London in June 1592. He was released from prison in August 1592 to manage a recently returned expedition and attack on the Spanish coast. The fleet was recalled by the Queen, but not before it [[Battle of Flores (1592)|captured an incredibly rich prize]]—a merchant ship (carrack) named ''[[Madre de Deus]]'' (Mother of God) off [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]. Raleigh was sent to organise and divide the spoils of the ship. He was sent back to the Tower, but by early 1593 had been released and become a member of Parliament.{{sfn|May|1989|p=13}}

It was several years before Raleigh returned to favour,{{clarify|date=October 2020}} and he travelled extensively in this time. Raleigh and his wife remained devoted to each other. They had two more sons, Walter (known as Wat) in 1593 and [[Carew Raleigh (1605–1666)|Carew]] in 1605.{{sfn|May|1989|p=21}}

Raleigh was elected a burgess of [[Mitchell (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitchell]], Cornwall, in the parliament of 1593.{{sfn|Nicholls|Williams|2004}} He retired to his estate at Sherborne, where he built a new house, completed in 1594, known then as Sherborne Lodge. Since extended, it is now known as [[Sherborne Castle#New castle|Sherborne New Castle]]. He made friends with the local [[gentry]], such as Sir Ralph Horsey of [[Clifton Maybank]] and Charles Thynne of [[Longleat]]. During this period at a dinner party at Horsey's, Raleigh had a heated discussion about religion with Reverend Ralph Ironsides. The argument later gave rise to charges of [[atheism]] against Raleigh, though the charges were dismissed. He was elected to Parliament, speaking on religious and naval matters.{{sfn|May|1989|p=14}}

==First voyage to Guiana==
{{further|Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition}}
In 1594, he came into possession of a Spanish account of a great golden city at the headwaters of the [[Caroní River]]. A year later, he explored what is now [[Guyana]] and [[Guayana Region, Venezuela|eastern Venezuela]] in search of [[Lake Parime]] and Manoa, the legendary city. Once back in England, he published ''[[The Discovery of Guiana]]''{{sfn|Raleigh|1848}} (1596), an account of his voyage which made exaggerated claims as to what had been discovered. The book can be seen as a contribution to the [[El Dorado]] legend. [[Venezuela]] has [[gold]] deposits, but no evidence indicates that Raleigh found any mines. He is sometimes said to have discovered [[Angel Falls]], but these claims are considered far-fetched.<ref name=thelostworld.org/>

==1596–1603==
[[File:WalterRaleighandson.jpg|thumb|Raleigh and his son Walter in 1602]]
In 1596, Raleigh took part in the [[capture of Cádiz]], where he was wounded. He also served as the rear admiral (a principal command) of the [[Islands Voyage]] to the [[Azores]] in 1597.{{sfn|May|1989|p=16}} On his return from the Azores, Raleigh helped England defend itself against the major threat of the [[3rd Spanish Armada]] during the autumn of 1597. The Armada was dispersed in the Channel and later was devastated by a storm off Ireland. [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]] and Raleigh were able to organise a fleet that resulted in the capture of a Spanish ship in retreat carrying vital information regarding the Spanish plans.

In 1597 Raleigh was chosen as member of parliament for [[Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|Dorset]] and in 1601 for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]].{{sfn|Laughton|Lee|1896}} He was unique in the Elizabethan period in sitting for three counties.{{sfn|Nicholls|Williams|2004}}

From 1600 to 1603, as governor of the [[Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]], Raleigh modernised its defences. This included construction of a new fort protecting the approaches to [[Saint Helier]], Fort Isabella Bellissima, or [[Elizabeth Castle]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

==Trial and imprisonment==
[[File:Bloodytower interior.jpg|left|thumb|Raleigh's cell, Bloody Tower, Tower of London]]
Royal favour with Queen Elizabeth had been restored by this time, but his good fortune did not last; the Queen died on 24 March 1603. Raleigh was arrested on 19 July 1603 at what is now the Old Exeter Inn in Ashburton, charged with [[treason]] for his involvement in the [[Main Plot]] against Elizabeth's successor, [[James I]], and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].{{sfn|May|1989|p=19}}

Raleigh's trial began on 17 November in the converted [[Great hall|Great Hall]] of [[Winchester Castle]]. Raleigh conducted his own defence. The chief evidence against him was the signed and sworn confession of his friend [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham]]. Raleigh repeatedly requested that Cobham be called to testify. "[Let] my accuser come face to face, and be deposed. Were the case but for a small [[copyhold]], you would have witnesses or good proof to lead the jury to a verdict; and I am here for my life!" Raleigh argued that the evidence against him was "[[hearsay]]", but the tribunal refused to allow Cobham to testify and be [[cross-examination|cross-examined]].<ref name=crimtrial/><ref name=uark.edu/> Raleigh's trial has been regularly cited as influential in establishing a [[common law]] right to confront accusers in court.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Penny J. |title=Rescuing the Confrontation Clause |journal=South Carolina Law Review |date=Spring 2003 |volume=54 |issue=3 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/347466289.pdf |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perry |first1=Hadley |title=Virtually Face-to-Face: The Confrontation Clause and the Use of Two-Way Video Testimony |journal=Roger Williams University Law Review |date=Spring 2008 |volume=13 |issue=2 |url=https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1393&context=rwu_LR |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jonakait |first1=Randolph N. |title=The Origins of the Confrontation Clause: An Alternative History |journal=[[Rutgers Law Journal]] |date=Autumn 1995 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=77–168 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/230508635.pdf |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shaviro |first1=Daniel N. |title=The Confrontation Clause Today in Light of its Common Law Background |journal=Valparaiso University Law Review |date=1991 |volume=26 |pages=337–66 |url=https://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2140&context=vulr |access-date=24 October 2021}}</ref> Raleigh was convicted, but King James spared his life.{{sfn|Rowse|1962|p=241}}

While imprisoned in the Tower, Raleigh wrote his incomplete ''The Historie of the World''.{{sfn|Raleigh|1677|p=}} Using a wide array of sources in six languages, Raleigh was fully abreast of the latest continental scholarship. He wrote not about England, but of the ancient world with a heavy emphasis on geography. Despite his intention of providing current advice to the King of England, King James I complained that it was "too sawcie in censuring Princes".{{sfn|Popper|2012|p=18}}{{sfn|Racin|1974|p=}} Raleigh remained imprisoned in the Tower until 1616.{{sfn|Wallace|1959|p=256}} His son, Carew, was conceived and born (in 1604 or 1605) while Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower.{{sfn|Wallace|1959|p=228}}

==Second voyage to Guiana==
[[File:Royal Pardon of Walter Raleigh.jpg|thumb|James I's royal warrant pardoning Raleigh in 1617]]
In 1617, Raleigh was pardoned by the King and granted permission to conduct a second expedition to Venezuela in search of El Dorado. During the expedition, a detachment of Raleigh's men under the command of his long-time friend [[Lawrence Kemys]] attacked the Spanish outpost of Santo Tomé de Guayana on the [[Orinoco]] river, in violation of peace treaties with Spain and against Raleigh's orders. A condition of Raleigh's pardon was avoidance of any hostility against Spanish colonies or shipping. In the initial attack on the settlement, Raleigh's son, Walter, was fatally shot. Kemys informed Raleigh of his son's death and begged for forgiveness, but did not receive it, and at once committed suicide. On Raleigh's return to England, an outraged [[Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, 1st Count of Gondomar|Count Gondomar]], the Spanish ambassador, demanded that Raleigh's death sentence be reinstated by King James, who had little choice but to do so. Raleigh was brought to London from [[Plymouth]] by Sir [[Lewis Stukley]], where he passed up numerous opportunities to make an effective escape.{{sfn|Wolffe|2004}}{{sfn|Laughton|1898}}

==Execution and aftermath==
[[File:Execution of Sir Walter Raleigh.jpg|thumb|left|Raleigh just before he was beheaded&nbsp;– an illustration from ''circa'' 1860]]
Raleigh was beheaded in the [[Old Palace Yard]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]] on 29 October 1618. "Let us dispatch", he said to his executioner. "At this hour my [[Fever|ague]] comes upon me. I would not have my enemies think I quaked from fear." After he was allowed to see the axe that would be used to behead him, he mused: "This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physician for all diseases and miseries." According to biographers, Raleigh's last words, spoken to the hesitating executioner, were: "What dost thou fear? Strike, man, strike!"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Malcolm |title=They Went That-a-way |date=1988 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-65709-7 |page=250}}</ref>{{sfn|Trevelyan|2002|p=552}}

[[Thomas Hariot]] may have introduced him to [[tobacco]].{{Sfn|Ley|1965|p=88}} Having been one of the people to popularise tobacco smoking in England, he left a small [[tobacco pouch]], found in his cell shortly after his execution. Engraved upon the pouch was a [[Latin]] inscription: ''Comes meus fuit in illo miserrimo tempore'' ("It was my companion at that most miserable time").{{sfn|Borio|2007}}<ref name=wallacecollection.org/>

Raleigh's head was embalmed and presented to his wife. His body was to be buried in the local church in [[Beddington]], [[Surrey]], the home of Lady Raleigh, but was finally laid to rest in [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]], where his tomb may still be visited today.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=}} "The Lords", she wrote, "have given me his dead body, though they have denied me his life. God hold me in my wits."{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1961|p=158|loc=Chap. VI}} It has been said that Lady Raleigh kept her husband's head in a velvet bag until her death.{{sfn|Brushfield|1896|p=}} After Raleigh's wife's death 29 years later, his head was removed to his tomb and interred at St. Margaret's Church.{{sfn|Lloyd|Mitchinson|2006|p=}} Although Raleigh's popularity had waned considerably since his Elizabethan heyday, his execution was seen by many, both at the time and since, as unnecessary and unjust, as for many years his involvement in the Main Plot seemed to have been limited to a meeting with [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]].{{sfn|Christenson|1991|pp=385–387}} One of the judges at his trial later said: "The justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of the honourable Sir Walter Raleigh."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2007/13-SCt/Crawford_v._Washington.pdf|title=Crawford v.

==Poetry==
[[File:Raleigh OfFardell Arms.svg|thumb|180px|Arms of Sir Walter Raleigh<!--''Gules, five fusils conjoined in bend argent''<ref>[[William Pole (antiquary)|Pole, Sir William]] (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, [[Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet|Sir John-William de la Pole]] (ed.), London, 1791, p.499</ref>-->]]
Raleigh's poetry is written in the relatively straightforward, unornamented mode known as the plain style. [[C. S. Lewis]] considered Raleigh one of the era's "silver poets", a group of writers who resisted the [[Italian Renaissance]] influence of dense classical reference and elaborate poetic devices. His writing contains strong personal treatments of themes such as love, loss, beauty, and time. Most of his poems are short lyrics that were inspired by actual events.{{sfn|Black et al.|2011|p=724}}

In poems such as "What is Our Life" and "[[The Lie (poem)|The Lie]]", Raleigh expresses a ''[[contemptus mundi]]'' (contempt of the world) attitude more characteristic of the [[Middle Ages]] than of the dawning era of humanistic optimism. But his lesser-known long poem "The Ocean's Love to Cynthia" combines this vein with the more elaborate conceits associated with his contemporaries [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[John Donne]], expressing a melancholy sense of history. The poem was written during his imprisonment in the Tower of London.{{sfn|Black et al.|2011|p=724}}

Raleigh wrote a poetic response to [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s "[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]" of 1592, entitled "[[The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd]]". Both were written in the style of traditional [[pastoral poetry]] and follow the structure of six four-line stanzas employing a [[rhyme scheme]] of [[Clerihew|AABB]], with Raleigh's an almost line-for-line refutation of Marlowe's sentiments.<ref name="latech">{{cite web |url=http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/marlowe/shepherd_&_notes.htm |title=Notes for ''The Passionate Shepherd to His Love'' |publisher=Dr. Bruce Magee, [[Louisiana Tech University]] |access-date=29 October 2012}}</ref> Years later, the 20th-century poet [[William Carlos Williams]] would join the poetic "argument" with his "[[Raleigh Was Right]]".

===Writing Shakespeare===
{{see_also|List of Shakespeare authorship candidates|Shakespeare authorship question}}
In 1845, Shakespeare scholar [[Delia Bacon]] first proposed that a group of authors had actually written the plays later attributed to [[William Shakespeare]], the main writer being Walter Raleigh.{{sfn|Farrand|2013}}{{sfn|Hechinger|2011}} Later, George S. Caldwell asserted that Raleigh was actually the sole author.{{sfn|Wallechinsky|Wallace|1981}} These claims have been supported by other scholars throughout subsequent years, including [[Albert J. Beveridge]] and [[Henry Pemberton]], but are rejected by the majority of Shakespearean scholars today.{{efn|{{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=621}}: "...antiStratfordism has remained a fringe belief system"; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=450}}; {{Harvnb|Paster|1999|p=38}}: "To ask me about the authorship question ... is like asking a palaeontologist to debate a creationist's account of the fossil record."; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|pp=149–51}}: "I do not know of a single professor of the 1,300-member Shakespeare Association of America who questions the identity of Shakespeare ... antagonism to the authorship debate from within the profession is so great that it would be as difficult for a professed Oxfordian to be hired in the first place, much less gain tenure..."; {{Harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=278–9}}: "I have never met anyone in an academic position like mine, in the Establishment, who entertained the slightest doubt as to Shakespeare's authorship of the general body of plays attributed to him."; {{Harvnb|Pendleton|1994|p=21}}: "Shakespeareans sometimes take the position that to even engage the Oxfordian hypothesis is to give it a countenance it does not warrant."; {{Harvnb|Sutherland|Watts|2000|p=7}}: "There is, it should be noted, no academic Shakespearian of any standing who goes along with the Oxfordian theory."; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=30}}: "...most of the great Shakespearean scholars are to be found in the Stratfordian camp..."}}

The state capital of [[North Carolina]], its second-largest city, was named [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] in 1792, after Sir Walter, sponsor of the [[Roanoke Colony]]. In the city, a bronze statue, which has been moved around different locations within the city, was cast in honour of the city's namesake. The "Lost Colony" is commemorated at the [[Fort Raleigh National Historic Site]] on [[Roanoke Island]], North Carolina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelostcolony.org/|title=The Lost Colony – #1 OBX Attraction|website=The Lost Colony}}</ref>

Raleigh has been widely speculated to be responsible for introducing the [[potato]] to Europe, and was a key figure in bringing it to Ireland. However, modern historians dispute this claim, suggesting it would have been impossible for Raleigh to have discovered the potato in the places he visited.{{sfn|Salaman|Burton|1985|p=148}}

Due to Raleigh's role in the popularisation of smoking, [[John Lennon]] humorously referred to him as "such a stupid [[Git (slang)|git]]"<!--"get" is correct, as Liverpudlian - see Talk#Raleigh in pop culture--> in the song "[[I'm So Tired]]" on the "White Album" ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (1968).<ref>[http://www.thebeatles.com/song/im-so-tired ''The Beatles'' (''The White Album'') "I'm So Tired" website].

Various colourful stories are told about him, such as laying his cloak over a puddle for the Queen, but they are probably apocryphal.<ref name="Fragmenta">[[Robert Naunton|Naunton, Robert]] ''Fragmenta Regalia'' 1694, reprinted 1824.

The author [[George Garrett (poet)|George Garrett]]'s historical fiction novel ''[[Death of the Fox]]'' explores Raleigh's relationships with Elizabeth I and her successor James I.

==Raleigh's descendants==
Many people claim descent from Sir Walter Raleigh, but nearly all have no basis in fact. The only authentic lines of descent are as follows:

Raleigh's only surviving child, Carew Raleigh, had three surviving children—Walter (d. 1660), Anne (d. 1708) and Philip (d. 1705).
 
The elder son, Walter Raleigh, was knighted in June 1660, but died two months later. He was buried at West Horsley. He left three surviving children—Elizabeth, Philippa and Anne. Philippa (who married Oliver Weekes, of Tortingdon, Sussex) and Anne (who married William Knight, of Barrells, Warwickshire) left descendants. It was Philippa Weekes' daughter, Elizabeth Elwes, who seems to have owned the main store of Raleigh memorabilia and was consulted by William Oldys in 1735 when he was writing his ''Life of Raleigh''.

Anne Raleigh married Sir Peter Tyrrell, of Castlethorpe, Bucks. Her granddaughter, Harriet, married Francis Mann, of Kidlington, Oxfordshire, and died in 1785, leaving descendants.

Philip Raleigh championed his grandfather's cause, publishing several of his hitherto unpublished papers. He had a family of four sons and three daughters. The youngest son, Carew Raleigh, page of honour to William III, was serving as a captain's servant on {{HMS|Bredah}} when he died of fever in the West Indies in 1697, aged seventeen. The second son, Lieut. Brudenell Raleigh, was also serving in the navy in the West Indies when he died of fever in June 1698, aged 22. The eldest son, Captain Walter Raleigh, Grenadier Guards, was page of honour to Queen Mary, and was killed at the siege of Schellenberg in 1704, aged 31. He was unmarried. After Walter's death, his father was granted a pension by the crown, 'in consideration of his 3 sons being slain in the late and present war'. The third son, Captain-Lieutenant Grenville Raleigh, served in the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]'s army throughout the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and died of fever in 1717, while guarding the prisoners at Chester after the 1715 [[Jacobite rising]]. He had married and had two sons and a daughter, Mary. On the death of his daughter in Bath in 1783, it was noted that she was 'the only surviving descendant in the direct line of Sir Walter Raleigh'.

Of Philip Raleigh's daughters, Anne and Elizabeth both died unmarried. The eldest daughter, Frances, married William Honywood, eldest son of Sir William Honywood, of Evington Place, Elmsted, Kent and died in 1730. Her many descendants include the present [[Norton Knatchbull, 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] and the actor [[Hugh Grant]].{{sfn|King|2019|p=}}

===Notes===
{{notelist|refs=

{{efn| name=pronunciation|Many alternative spellings of his surname exist, including ''Rawley'', ''Ralegh'', ''Ralagh'' and ''Rawleigh''. "Raleigh" appears most commonly today, but he is known to have used that spelling only once. His most consistent preference was for "Ralegh". His full name is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔː|l|t|ər|_|ˈ|r|ɔː|l|i}}, but in practice, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|l|i}} {{Respell|RAL|ee}} and even {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|l|i}} {{Respell|RAH|lee}} are the usual modern pronunciations in England.}}
