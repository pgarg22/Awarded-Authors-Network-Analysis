They founded the communities ''Bíborpalást'' ["Scarlet Robe"] and ''Öt Kenyér'' ["Five Loaves of Bread"] afterwards, in which he took an active part for more than a decade.<ref name="tablo">[http://www.otkenyer.hu/tablo.php Tabló – Öt Kenyér Közösség]</ref>

In 1995 and 1996 he studied [[psychology]] at the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Budapest. He took an intermediate level language exam in English and an advanced level one in Esperanto. Between 1988 and 1998 he earned a living by selling books and CDs; between 1996 and 1997 he taught English. After 1998 he worked at a notary public's office, editing legal instruments.<ref name="bemut"/> In 2005–2006, he completed the 200-hour method-specific course of the Integrative Psychotherapy Association.

He started publishing a blog in 2005. His main topics included religion, [[compassionate communication]], [[sustainable development]], literature, psychology, sociology and philosophy. A collection of his essays, formerly published in his blog, was published in 2008 as a book.
