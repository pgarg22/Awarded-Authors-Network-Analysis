==Personal life==
Charles de Lint was born in 1951 in [[Bussum]], the Netherlands, and his family emigrated to Canada when he was four months old. He grew up in Canada, as well as overseas, but has lived in [[Ottawa]] since he was eleven.

In 1974 he met [[MaryAnn Harris]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/mah/|title=MaryAnn Harris|website=www.sfsite.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701201724/https://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/mah/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/mah//tt-foreward.htm|title=The Meeting|website=www.sfsite.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705125348/https://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/mah//tt-foreward.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> and they married in 1980. They now live in Ottawa.  Harris is first editor of de Lint's fiction and also his business manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reclectica.com|title=MaryAnn Harris|website=www.reclectica.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=September 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909215807/http://www.reclectica.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
In his late twenties to early thirties, de Lint worked in a [[record store]] and played with a Celtic band on the weekends.<ref name="oxford">John Robert Colombo  "de Lint, Charles"  The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature.

===Writing===
Charles de Lint started writing in 1983 and has been a full-time writer ever since, publishing around forty books between 1984 and 1997, and 71 books (excluding foreign editions and reprints), in total, thus gaining a reputation as a master in his field.

He published three [[horror fiction|horror]] novels under the pseudonym Samuel M. Key<ref name="oxford"/> which have subsequently been reprinted by [[Orb Books]] as by Charles de Lint.  He has also published a children's book, ''A Circle of Cats'', illustrated by artist [[Charles Vess]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/circle-desc01.htm|title=Charles de Lint: A Circle of Cats (2003) Description|first=Rodger Turner|last=Webmaster|website=www.sfsite.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705150357/https://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/circle-desc01.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Style and settings====
His genre, that of [[contemporary fantasy]], which combines the real world with the "[[otherworld]]", allows the co-existence of the natural and the supernatural. This has been called a [[metaphor]] for the lack of indigenous folklore in most of multi-cultural Canada living side-by-side with the living oral traditions of the Native Americans.<ref name="lawrence">Steven, Lawrence. "Welwyn Wilton Katz and Charles de Lint: New Fantasy as a Canadian Post-colonial Genre." ''Worlds of Wonder: Readings in Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature.'' Ed. Jean-François Leroux and Camille R. La Bossière. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 2004. 57–72. Print.</ref>  De Lint, however, draws upon not only North American Aboriginal culture, but also the folklore of other cultures. For example, his novel, ''Moonheart'', uses elements of both Native American and Welsh folklore.<ref name="lawrence"/>

Many of his early books are set in Ottawa, while others (1990–2009) have centered around his fictional North American city of [[Newford]],<ref name="oxford"/> inspired by de Lint's favourite aspects of various North American cities. A regular cast of characters make reappearances in many different books. More recently, de Lint published an adult novel, ''The Mystery of Grace'' (Tor 2009), set in his fictional [[Southwestern US]] town, Santa de Vado Viejo, as was his most recent young adult novel, ''The Painted Boy'' (Viking 2010).

====Recognition====
de Lint has received many awards, including the 2000 [[World Fantasy Award]] for [[World Fantasy Award for Best Collection|Best Collection]] for ''Moonlight and Vines'', the Ontario Library Association's White Pine Award, as well as the Great Lakes Great Books Award for his young adult novel ''The Blue Girl'' (Viking, 2004). His novel ''Widdershins'' (Tor, 2006) won first place, Amazon.com Editors' Picks: Top 10 Science Fiction & Fantasy Books of 2006. In 1988 he won Canadian SF/Fantasy Award, the Casper, now known as the Aurora for his novel ''Jack, the Giant-killer'' (Ace 1987).<ref name="sfsite3">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/|title=Charles de Lint|first=Rodger Turner|last=Webmaster|website=www.sfsite.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704163130/https://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/|url-status=live}}</ref>  His 1984 urban fantasy novel, ''Moonheart'', was a best-selling trade paperback for Tor's Orb line. It has been described as a thriller, detective mystery, and otherworld mythic fantasy all in one.<ref name="lawrence"/>

====Other literary work====
In addition to being the author of numerous novels and short stories, de Lint is also a poet, folklorist, and critic. His poetry can be found online in the [[Endicott Studio]] ''Journal of Mythic Arts''. He has taught creative writing workshops in Canada and the United States, and was writer‑in‑residence for two public libraries in Ottawa. He has also written original songs; his main instruments are flute, fiddle, whistles, vocals and guitar. In 2011, de Lint released his first CD, ''Old Blue Truck''<ref name="sfsite3"/>

de Lint has also been a judge for the [[Nebula Award]], the [[World Fantasy Award]], the [[Theodore Sturgeon Award]] and the [[Bram Stoker Award]]. Furthermore, he has taught creative writing workshops in Canada and the United States, and served as writer-in-residence for two public libraries in [[Ottawa]].

===Music and art===
de Lint plays folk, Irish and Celtic music with his wife MaryAnn; at one time playing at a local pub, and most recently doing concerts at FaerieWorlds and FaerieCon West in Seattle. He plays multiple instruments and sings and writes his own songs. In 2011 De Lint released his first album, ''Old Blue Truck'',<ref name="sfsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/music-oldbluetruck01.htm|title=Charles de Lint: Music - Old Blue Truck|first=Rodger Turner|last=Webmaster|website=www.sfsite.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705134125/https://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/music-oldbluetruck01.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> which was released alongside his wife MaryAnn Harris's album, ''Crow Girls'' <ref name="sfsite2">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/music-crowgirls01.htm|title=Charles de Lint: Music - Crow Girls EP by MaryAnn Harris|first=Rodger Turner|last=Webmaster|website=www.sfsite.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705160013/https://www.sfsite.com/charlesdelint/music-crowgirls01.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> in which he also contributes.

===Fan and convention activity===
A fan message board was created and named in his honor: de Lintiad, Charles de Lint, MoonHeart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://com5.runboard.com/bdelintiad|title=deLintiad - Runboard|website=com5.runboard.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|archive-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095007/http://com5.runboard.com/bdelintiad|url-status=live}}</ref>

Among dozens of public appearances, on October 9, 2007, de Lint was one of the guests who appeared as part of the Bolen Books Fall Series (with [[Jack Whyte]] (Oct. 13), [[Will Ferguson]] (Oct. 16) and [[James Barber (author)|James Barber]] (Oct. 20)). Bolen Books was awarded the 2007 Libris Award for Bookseller of the Year. Co-ordinator [[Robert Wiersema]] said this of him: "He's a classic storyteller with a tremendously broad appeal. Readers who don't know him would, I think, be surprised at how much they would like his work."<ref>[http://www.vicnews.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=36&cat=47&id=1071868&more=0  Victoria News, Authors tell tales in person] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702075954/http://www.vicnews.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=36&cat=47&id=1071868&more=0 |date=July 2, 2007 }}</ref>
