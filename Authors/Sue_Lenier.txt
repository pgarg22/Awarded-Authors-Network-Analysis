'''Susan Jennifer Lenier''' (born 9 October 1957) is an English writer. She published two books of poetry and a number of plays.

==Biography==
Sue Lenier was born in [[Birmingham]], schooled in [[Tyneside]], and attended [[Clare College, Cambridge]]. After graduating from Cambridge in 1980, she spend a year writing and performing in Germany and the UK before taking a [[Harkness Fellowship]] in the US, where she studied acting and drama at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="wp"/>

Her first published collection of poems, ''Swansongs'', was published in 1982.<ref>{{cite book

  }}</ref> ''Swansongs'' was published while Lenier was studying in the United States, and the book and her author made enough of an impression to warrant articles by some of the best journalists of prestigious newspapers: [[D.J.R. Bruckner]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and Colman McCarthy in the ''[[Washington Post]]''.

She published a second volume of poems, ''Rain Following'', also with Oleander Press. While the popular press in America and England showed great interest in Sue Lenier and her work, literary critics and academics took no notice of her work, and only one of her poems, "Finale," from her first volume, has been anthologised.<ref>{{cite book

Since then, her poetic career appears to have ended; the only known works by her have been for the stage. Reportedly, she wrote ''Doctor's Orders'', ''Eden Song'', and ''Knight Fall'', the last two first being performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].<ref>{{cite web

==Poetic craft==
The most often noted thing about Lenier's poetic craft was that she composed poetry in an impromptu manner and didn't seem to revise any of her work; ''Swansong'' was sent to the publisher as a first-draft copy,<ref name="wp"/> and in the ''New York Times'' she was quoted, "'I just write the poems straight out. At first I tried to correct a few and I didn't like the corrections, so I don't do it any more."<ref name="prolific"/> Indeed, for her quick compositions made on the fly she was nicknamed "the possessed poet"â€”though it was acknowledged that such poetic production easily leads to "superficial glibness."<ref>{{cite book

  | accessdate = 3 March 2009}}</ref> This method of composition looked down upon with some disdain by literary critics such as John T. Shawcross (editor, critic, and bibliographer of [[John Milton]]) in his ''Intentionality and the New Traditionalism'', discussing the "truism of the need for planning and revision": "I am aware of such 'spontaneous' writing as that of Sue Lenier, who boasts of never altering a line after it has been put down, and of some critical assessments that have been quoted to increase sales. I rest my case on the reader's evaluation of her work."<ref>{{cite book

Newton claimed she was 'the only poet of our century of the order of Tennyson and comparable with Shakespeare.' This claim attracted a great deal of notice at the time (1980).
