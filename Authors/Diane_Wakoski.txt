During her time at this university she participated in [[Thom Gunn]]'s poetry workshops.

She also cites [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Charles Bukowski]] as influences. 
Her poetry career began in New York City, where she moved with [[La Monte Young]] in 1960. She remained a resident of New York City until 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/11/from-poetry-magazine-poet-photos/|title=Poet Photos|author=Poetry Foundation|work=Harriet: The Blog|access-date=12 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908004303/http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/11/from-poetry-magazine-poet-photos/|archive-date=8 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
