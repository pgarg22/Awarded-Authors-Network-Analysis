==Biography==

===Early life===
Christopher Nolan was born to parents Joseph and Bernadette Nolan. He grew up in [[Mullingar]], Ireland. Due to [[asphyxiation]] at birth, Christopher was born with permanent impairment of his "nerve-signaling system, a condition he said is now labelled [[dystonia]]."<ref name="PW"/> Because of these complications, Nolan was born with [[cerebral palsy]], and could only move his head and eyes. At the beginning of his life people believed he was intellectually disabled, but his mother proved them wrong. Bernadette brought her son to see Dr. Ciaran Barry. He was a consultant of physical medicine and rheumatology who possessed a particular interest in children with cerebral Palsy. Dr. Barry was attached to the Central Remedial Clinic. He played games with Christopher, the toddler, and in so doing noted the child anticipated his actions and informed his mother that he was of sound mind.

Due to the severity of the palsy, he used a wheelchair. In an interview, his father explained how, at the age of 10, he was placed on medication by Dr. Barry that "relaxed him so he could use a pointer attached to his head to type."<ref name="independent-obit"/> To write, Nolan used a special computer and keyboard; in order to help him type, his mother held his head in her cupped hands while Christopher painstakingly picked out each word, letter by letter, with a pointer attached to his forehead.

He communicated with others by moving his eyes, using a signal system. When he was young, his father told him stories and read passages from [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]] to keep his mind stimulated. His mother strung up letters of the alphabet in the kitchen, where she kept up a stream of conversation. His sister, Yvonne, sang songs and acted out skits.<ref name="Seattle">{{cite news|url=http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2008779050_nolan24.html|title=Writer Christopher Nolan overcame severe disability|date=25 February 2009|access-date=2010-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|author=William Grimes}}</ref> His mother stated that "he wrote extensively since the age of 11 and went on to write many poems, short stories and two plays, many of which were published." Many of the writings described here by Nolan's mother were compiled for his first publication, the [[chapbook]] Dam-Burst of Dreams.<ref name="nytimes-mcdowell-1988">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/06/books/rebirth-of-dam-burst-irish-author-s-first-book.html|title=REBIRTH OF 'DAM BURST,' IRISH AUTHOR'S FIRST BOOK|access-date=2014-08-10|date=1988-06-06|author=Edwin McDowell|newspaper=The New York Times Review of Books}}</ref>

===Mature work===
Upon becoming a teenager, Nolan received his education from the [[Central Remedial Clinic|Central Remedial Clinic School]], [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} At the age of fifteen, he published his first book, a collection of poems titled ''Dam-Burst of Dreams''.<ref name="economist-obituary">{{cite news |date=28 February 2009 |title=Christopher Nolan |url=https://www.economist.com/obituary/2009/02/26/christopher-nolan |newspaper=The Economist |access-date=13 October 2021}}</ref> He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in the UK, the medal of excellence from the [[United Nations Society of Writers]], and a Person of the Year award in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} He wrote an account of his childhood, ''[[Under the Eye of the Clock]]'', published by St. Martin's Press, which won him the UK's Whitbread Book of the Year Award in 1987 at the age of 21. He soon dropped out of Trinity College to write a novel entitled ''[[The Banyan Tree]]'' (1999).

Nolan spent more than a decade writing ''The Banyan Tree''. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' the book is a multi-generational story of a dairy-farming family in Nolan's native county of [[Westmeath]]. The story is seen through the eyes of the aging mother.<ref name="nytimes-obit"/> It was inspired, he told ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', by the image of "an old woman holding up her skirts as she made ready to jump a rut in a field."<ref name="PW"/> A review of the book was done in ''The New York Times'' by Maghan O’Rourke. She reviews the book and relates it to [[James Joyce]]'s ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'', in the story the protagonist leaves his mother in Ireland while he moves on to travel the world.<ref name="nytimes-orourke-2000">{{cite news |last=O’Rourke |first=Maghan |date=26 March 2000 |title=Left Behind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/books/left-behind.html |newspaper=The New York Times Review of Books |access-date=10 August 2014 }}</ref> Nolan however, gives the reader a version of the mother's story. "And so, in the end, one suspects that he wants Minnie's good-natured, commonplace ways to stand as their own achievement, reminding us that life continues in the places left behind."<ref name="nytimes-obit"/>

===Death===
While working on a new novel, on 20 February 2009, Nolan died suddenly, aged 43, in [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin|Beaumont hospital]] in Dublin, after a piece of salmon became trapped in his airway.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Irish president [[Mary McAleese]], upon hearing the news, said:<ref name="nytimes-obit" />

{{cquote|Christopher Nolan was a gifted writer who attained deserved success and acclaim throughout the world for his work, his achievements all the more remarkable given his daily battle with cerebral palsy.}}

Minister for Arts [[Martin Cullen]] TD reflected that people should draw inspiration from Nolan's life. "With grace and courage, and with the support of his family, he never gave up and he never gave in [...] His bold creativity has ensured a written legacy."<ref name="it-obituary"/>

Nothing has been released from the book in progress in 2009 since his death.

==Writing==

===Publications===
Nolan's autobiography ''Under the Eye of the Clock'' (published 1987), won the [[Whitbread Award]] and was named Book of the Year. Although an autobiography, it is narrated by a fictional character named Joseph Meehan who details Nolan's life as a third-person biography. The book reveals the deep relationship between Nolan and his mother, whom he calls Nora. ''Under the Eye of the Clock'' shows how Nolan's parents engaged him in conversation and outdoor activities like hiking and horseback riding. The book was a best-seller in Britain and the United States. Nolan's writing style is often compared to James Joyce and Dylan Thomas. Critics also point out Nolan's distinct writing style omits articles and uses participle construction other than relative clauses.<ref>Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Roger Matuz, Cathy Falk, and Sean R. Pollock. Vol. 58. Detroit: Gale Research, 1990. p361-367. From Literature Criticism Online.</ref>

Nolan wrote ''The Banyan Tree'' (published 1999) in perspective of a country woman, Minnie O’Brien. The novel spans 80 years of Minnie's life, cutting from present to past to show the individuality of a woman and a mother who is determined to save the family's farm. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' appreciated "Nolan's soaring language and lilting alliterative style [which] suffuse [...] much of the book with a sense of the miraculous" and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' found it "richly – even baroquely – told [...] Nolan writes with verve."<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385720687&view=quotes Random House]</ref>

''Dam-Burst of Dreams'' (published 1981), provided Nolan critical acclaim that compared him to the works of [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[James Joyce]]. The collection was published four years after Nolan was administered [[Lioresal]] but some of the poems were written when Nolan was just 12 years old. The title of the collection emphasized the recurrent theme of the overflow and release of his mental intellect. The collection's poems are heavy with alliteration and incorporate neologisms that draw from combinations of pre-existing root words.

===Influences and mentors===
Nolan often discouraged inquiries about his literary influences. During an interview he once wrote: "Everything is an influence to a person trapped in a nightmare!"<ref name="PW">{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/411351-PW_Christopher_Nolan_Against_All_Odds.php|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130131215753/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/411351-PW_Christopher_Nolan_Against_All_Odds.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-31|title=PW: Christopher Nolan: Against All Odds|access-date=2010-03-12|author=Geracimos, Ann}}</ref> Nolan's enthusiasm for literature however was largely attributed to his father's appreciation of [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Every night his father would read him several passages from Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and other literary works.<ref name="LA-obit">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/25/local/me-christopher-nolan25|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan dies at 43; Irish poet and novelist|access-date=2010-03-12|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Listening to such pieces not only kept Nolan stimulated but piqued his interest in writing his own poetry.

In a poetry competition hosted by the [[Scope (charity)|British Spastics Society]], Nolan received praise from writer [[Edna Healey]], wife of then Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Denis Healey]]. As a judge of the competition she was one of the early recognizers of Nolan's writing abilities. Healey was later invited as a guest on the [[BBC]] program titled "The World this Weekend." On the broadcast in response to the question "what was the most impressive moment," she remarked that reading Nolan's work: "Was the highspot of my year."<ref name="guard-obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/23/christopher-nolan-writer|work=The Guardian|date=23 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan|access-date=2010-03-12|author= Hawtree, Christopher|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref>

When enrolling him for secondary school, Nolan's family struggled to convince educators that Nolan would be able to function in a regular class setting. [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] headmaster John Medlycott believed it was possible to devise a set-up to accommodate Nolan:<ref name="irish-obit">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2009/0221/1224241576645.html|work=The Irish Times|date=23 February 2009|title=Gifted writer whose voice burst out of the silence|access-date=2010-03-15|publisher=The Irish Times Limited}}</ref>

{{cquote|We tried not to make concessions [...] He came into a mixed ability class and went to all his classes. We didn’t demand homework, but he followed the normal school curriculum. We didn’t smother him: it was up to him to sink or swim, and he swam.}}

Thanks to Medlycott, Nolan was accepted into Mount Temple and later was received by [[Trinity College, Dublin]] after Medlycott provided a personal recommendation.<ref name="PW" />

==Pop culture==

Nolan's life story and works have been referenced to in several musical works. Rock band [[U2]], whose members attended school with Nolan, wrote their song "[[Miracle Drug]]" (from ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'') about him.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.artscouncil.ie/aosdana/biogs/literature/christophernolan.html |title=Artscouncil |access-date=21 December 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418102525/http://www.artscouncil.ie/aosdana/biogs/literature/christophernolan.html |archive-date=18 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Bono]] said of Nolan:
{{cquote|We all went to the same school and just as we were leaving, a fellow called Christopher Nolan arrived. He had been deprived of oxygen for two hours when he was born, so he was quadriplegic. But his mother believed he could understand what was going on and used to teach him at home. Eventually, they discovered a drug that allowed him to move one muscle in his neck. So they attached this unicorn device to his forehead and he learned to type. And out of him came all these poems that he'd been storing up in his head. Then he put out a collection called ''Dam-Burst of Dreams'', which won a load of awards and he went off to university and became a genius. All because of a mother's love and a medical breakthrough.}}

On [[R.E.M.]]'s 1988 ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'' album, the song "[[The Wrong Child]]" was inspired by Nolan's memoir ''[[Under the Eye of the Clock]]''.<ref name="independent-obit">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/obituaries/christopher-nolan-1649080.html|work=Irish Independent|date=22 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan|access-date=2010-03-15|publisher=Independent News & Media PLC}}</ref> The song deals with a child who wishes to play with his peers outside but is instead laughed at. Throughout the song the refrain "I'm not supposed to be like this / But it's okay" is repeated several times.

Nolan was once approached by a Los Angeles film producer who was interested in making his biography into a movie. Nolan declined the offer and responded:<ref name="nytimes-obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/books/24nolan.html|work=The New York Times|date=24 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan, Irish Author, Dies at 43|author=William Grimes|access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref>

{{cquote|I want to highlight the creativity within the brain of a cripple [...] and while not attempting to hide the crippledom I want instead to filter all sob-storied sentiment from his portrait and dwell upon his life, his laughter, his vision, and his nervous normality. Can we ever see eye-to-eye on that schemed scenario?}}

==Honours==
Every year, his secondary school [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] holds an award show in his honour.
The "Eye of the Clock Awards" are hosted in the last week of school for all students.
These awards are given to students for extraordinary efforts in school and are inspired by Nolan's efforts in school.
