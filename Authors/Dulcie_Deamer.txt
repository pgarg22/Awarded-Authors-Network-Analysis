In the 1920–30s Dulcie Deamer was a poet, playwright and author in [[Sydney]], where she was Australia's first female boxing reporter.<ref name = "golden">{{Citation | author1=Deamer, Dulcie | author2=Kirkpatrick, Peter John | title=The queen of Bohemia : the autobiography of Dulcie Deamer : being "The golden decade" | year=1998 | publication-date=1998 | publisher=University of Queensland Press | isbn=978-0-7022-2726-4 }}</ref>

Deamer was known as the "Queen of Bohemia" due to her involvement with [[Norman Lindsay]]'s literary and artistic circle, the Bohemian world of [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]], Sydney, and vaudeville.<ref>Adelaide (1988) p. 48</ref> During the inter-war years, many balls were held in Sydney, including those known as the "[[Artists' Balls]]" which had been held as far back as the 1880s. Dulcie Deamer attended every Artists' Ball for 30 years.<ref name=Beck/> The leopard-skin costume with dog-tooth necklace that she wore to the 1923 Artists' Ball in Sydney "has come to symbolise the ''[[joie de vivre]]'' of the decade, despite Deamer's own protest regarding its relevance."<ref name=Beck>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Deborah|title=Scandalous Nights|journal=Inside History|date=Jul–Aug 2013|issue=17|publisher=Ben Mercer|issn=1838-5044|pages=56–57}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title=Dulcie Deamer.(Summer Herald) | journal=The Sydney Morning Herald | publication-date=30 December 2011 | pages=6 | issn=0312-6315 }}</ref>

The balls regularly made the newspapers and behaviour at the 1924 Ball, which Dulcie referred to as "The Night of the Great Scandal", resulted in the introduction of restrictions on alcohol and a greater police presence for subsequent events.<ref name=Beck/>

Hooligans took control of [[Sydney Town Hall]] basement during the progress of the Artists' Ball on Friday night, and had to be ejected by the police. Prior to this two persons had to be arrested for drunkenness, and two as being suspected persons. Several free fights developed, and many persons were injured when beer bottles were thrown. The Inspector-General of Police agrees that there were many instances of unseemly conduct. He attributes them to unlimited supplies of liquor and lack of efficient control.

A modern critic has noted that Deamer's work "demonstrates a fascination with religion, mythology and classical literature (typical of associates such as [[Norman Lindsay]], [[Rosaleen Norton]] and [[Hugh McCrae]]) and is characteristically ornamental in style."<ref name="Feminist" /> Poems written by Deamer appeared in the souvenir program of the 1924 ball along with those of [[Kenneth Slessor]].<ref name=Beck/>
