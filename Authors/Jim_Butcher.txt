After many unsuccessful attempts to enter the traditional fantasy genre (he cites [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Lloyd Alexander]], and [[C. S.

For two years, Butcher floated his manuscript among various publishers before hitting the convention circuit to make contacts in the industry. After meeting Butcher in person, [[Ricia Mainhardt]], the agent who discovered [[Laurell K. Hamilton]], agreed to represent him, which kick-started his writing career.<ref name="about jim">{{cite web

===Dresden Files series===
{{Main|The Dresden Files}}

Six months after Butcher was signed by Mainhardt, [[Storm Front (novel)|''Storm Front'']], the first novel in ''The Dresden Files'', was picked up by [[Roc (publisher)|Roc]]/[[Penguin Books]] for publishing. It was released as a paperback in April 2000. ''[[Fool Moon (novel)|Fool Moon]]'' followed nine months later on January 1, 2001, and the third book, ''Grave Peril'', was published in September 2001. Thereafter, the release schedule slowed, with ''Summer Knight'' appearing on September 3, 2002. The fifth and sixth books, ''Death Masks'' and ''Blood Rites'', appeared in August 2003 and 2004, respectively. Coinciding with the release of ''Blood Rites'', Butcher published a Harry Dresden short story, entitled ''Restoration of Faith'', on his website, chronicling Harry's life before ''The Dresden Files'' as a private eye for Ragged Angel Investigations. In December 2004, the [[Science Fiction Book Club]] picked up the first three novels in the series for release in a hardcover omnibus edition titled ''Wizard for Hire'' for a March–April 2005 rush release in order to arrive on store shelves before the seventh novel in May.<ref name="omnibus">{{cite web

===''Codex Alera'' series===
{{Main|Codex Alera}}
{{Codex Alera bibliography}}
After the success of Dresden, Butcher returned to the traditional fantasy genre with his second series, ''Codex Alera''. The series chronicles the life of a young man named Tavi from the Calderon Valley of Alera on the world of Carna. The people of Alera have grown complacent with the trappings of empire (the story is based loosely on the late [[Roman Empire]]) and their control of powerful elemental forces known as furies. The inspiration for the series came from a bet Butcher was challenged to by a member of the Del Rey Online Writer's Workshop.  The challenger bet that Butcher could not write a good story based on a lame idea, and he countered that he could do it using two lame ideas of the challenger's choosing.  The "lame" ideas given were "[[Legio IX Hispana|Lost Roman Legion]]", and "''[[Pokémon]]''".<ref name="interview">{{cite web

===Cinder Spires series===
On March 4, 2013, ''Publisher's Weekly'' revealed that Butcher had closed a deal with the Penguin Group for the first three books of a [[steampunk]]-inspired series called ''The Cinder Spires''. ''Publisher's Weekly'' quotes Butcher's agent Jennifer Jackson as saying the series "is set in a world 'of black spires that tower for miles over a mist-shrouded surface' and follows a war between two of the Spires: Spire Albion and Spire Aurora". At a [[Reddit]] AMA on November 12, 2012, Butcher said "It's kinda League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Sherlock meets Hornblower. There are goggles and airships and steam power and bizarre crystal technology and talking cats, who are horrid little bullies." ''[[The Aeronaut's Windlass]]'', the first book in the projected nine book series, was published in September 2015.
