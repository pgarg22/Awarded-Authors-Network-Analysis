==Life==
De Madariaga graduated with a degree in engineering in Paris, France. He then went to work as an engineer for the Northern Spanish Railway Company but abandoned that work to return to London and become a journalist by writing in English for ''[[The Times]]''. Meanwhile, he began publishing his first essays. He became a press member of the Secretariat of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 and chief of the [[Disarmament]] Section in 1922. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Spanish at [[Oxford]] University for three years during which he wrote a book on nation [[psychology]], ''Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards''.

In 1931, he was appointed Spanish ambassador to the United States and a permanent delegate to the League of Nations; he kept the latter post for five years. Chairing the [[Organisation of the League of Nations#Council|Council of the League of Nations]] in January 1932, he condemned [[Mukden Incident|Japanese aggression in Manchuria]] in such vehement terms that he was nicknamed "[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de la Manchuria]]".<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''Spain's First Democracy: The Second Republic, 1931-1936'' (Madison, WI: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1993), 159.</ref>

Between 1932 and 1934, he was ambassador to France. In 1933, he was elected to the National Congress and served as both Minister for Education and Minister for Justice. In July 1936, as a [[classic liberalism|classical liberal]] he went into [[exile]] in [[England]] to escape the [[Spanish Civil War]]. There, he became a vocal opponent of and organised resistance to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] and the [[Spanish State]] of [[Francisco Franco]].

In 1947, he was one of the principal authors of the [[Oxford Manifesto]] on liberalism. He participated in the [[Hague Congress (1948)|Hague Congress]] in 1948 as president of the Cultural Commission and he was one of the co-founders in 1949 of the [[College of Europe]].

In his writing career he wrote books and essays about ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Christopher Columbus]], Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', and the history of Latin America. He militated in favour of a united and integrated Europe. He wrote in French and German, Spanish, [[Galician language|Galician]] (his mother tongue) and English.

In 1973, he won the [[Karlspreis]] for his contributions to the European idea and European peace. In 1976, he returned to Spain after Franco's death.

The [[Madariaga European Foundation]] has been named after him and promotes his vision of a united Europe making for a more peaceful world. The 1979–1980 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.
