== Early life and career ==

Robert Paul "Tad" Williams was born in [[San Jose, California]] on March 14, 1957.<ref name=SFencyclopedia>{{cite web|title=Tad Williams|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/williams_tad|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> He grew up in [[Palo Alto]], the town that grew up around [[Stanford University]]. He attended [[Palo Alto High School|Palo Alto Senior High School]].<ref name=RITE>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Tad|title=RITE: Short Work|year=2006|publisher=Subterranean Press|location=Michigan|isbn=978-159606-066-1}}</ref> His family was close, and he and his brothers were always encouraged in their creativity.<ref name=About>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tad|title=About|url=http://www.tadwilliams.com/about/|publisher=Official website|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> His mother gave him the nickname "Tad" after the young characters in [[Walt Kelly]]'s comic strip ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]].''<ref name=FB1>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tad|title=Tad Williams (Facebook)|url=https://www.facebook.com/tad.williams/posts/10201784003392001?comment_id=6380988&offset=0&total_comments=9|publisher=Facebook author page|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> The semi-autobiographical character Pogo Cashman, who appears in some of his stories, is a reference to the nickname.<ref name=Ormsby>{{cite web|last=Ormsby|first=Stephen C.|title=Interview with Tad Williams on The Dirty Streets of Heaven|url=http://stephenormsby.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/tad-williams-20-august/|publisher=Stephen Ormsby (20 August 2012).|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

Before becoming a full time fiction author Williams held many jobs including delivering [[newspapers]], food service, [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and station music director for college radio station [[KFJC]], shoe sales, [[branch manager]] of a [[financial institution]], writing for the [[TheatreWorks (Silicon Valley)|TheatreWorks]] company and drawing [[military]] [[User guide|manuals]].<ref name=Stuttgart4>{{cite web|title=Tad Williams in Stuttgart (4)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIVH9YRaSdI|publisher=YouTube (5:29), July 15, 2013|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>
 
Williams also worked for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], developing an interest in [[Multimedia|interactive multi-media]]. He and his colleague Andrew Harris created a company, Telemorphix, in order to produce it. The result was "M. Jack Steckel's 21st Century Vaudeville", which was broadcast on [[San Francisco Bay Area]] local TV in 1992 and 1993.<ref name="timewarp">{{cite web|title=Links|url=http://www.digitaltimewarp.com/Links.html|publisher=Digital Time Warp|access-date=16 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="ITV">{{cite web|title=A List of Programming with Interactive Television in 2002 and Earlier|url=http://www.itvdictionary.com/interactive_television_enhanced_tv_etv_itv_shows.html|publisher=ITV Dictionary.|access-date=16 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="Bickelhaupt">{{cite web|last=Bickelhaupt|first=Susan|title=The future is now on Vaudeville|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8250142.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011162724/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8250142.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 October 2013|publisher=The Boston Globe, October 20, 1993, archived by Highbeam.com.|access-date=16 August 2013}}</ref>

In addition, he created "Valley Vision," a [[TV series]] concept, a show about a local TV station. A [[Pilot episode|pilot]] was shot featuring several people who would go on to become [[Bay Area]] acting alumni, including [[Greg Proops]], [[Mike McShane]], Joan Mankin, [[Marga Gomez]] and several members of the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]].<ref name=liquidradio>{{cite web|title=Liquid Radio Players|url=http://www.liquidradioplayers.com/guests/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101140352/http://www.liquidradioplayers.com/guests/|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 January 2013|publisher=Liquidradioplayers.com|access-date=5 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=gimcracks>{{cite web|title=Fly Little Gimcracks|url=http://www.tadwilliams.com/2012/08/fly-little-gimcracks/|publisher=Official website|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

In his mid twenties, he turned to writing and submitted the manuscript of his novel  ''[[Tailchaser's Song]]'' to [[DAW Books]].<ref name=About/> To get his publishers to look at his first manuscript he spun a story about needing a replacement copy because his had been destroyed. It worked.<ref name=Wired>{{cite web|last=Geek's Guide to the Galaxy|title=Why Dirty Streets of Heaven Writer Tad Williams Isn't Going to Hell ... Probably|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/09/geeks-guide-tad-williams/all/|work=Wired|date=19 September 2012|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> DAW Books liked it and published it, beginning a long association that continues to this day. Williams continued working various jobs for a few more years, including three years from 1987 to 1990 as a technical writer at [[Apple Computer]]'s Knowledge Engineering Department, taking problem-solving field material from engineers and turning it into research articles<ref>{{cite web|title=Author Interview - Tad Williams|url=http://www.bookwormblues.net/2012/09/19/author-interview-tad-williams/|publisher=Bookworm Blues|date=19 September 2012|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> (which led, in part, to the ''[[Otherland]]'' books), before making fiction writing his full-time career.<ref name=Stuttgart4/>

== Writing and influences ==

Writing long stories was an early hallmark for Williams. "I remember specifically one '[[Folklore|folktale]]' assignment when I was thirteen that was supposed to be three pages, and I wound up writing a seventeen-page [[Sword and sorcery|sword-and-sorcery epic]] with illustrations, etc."<ref name=Gor/> His first attempt at professional writing was "a rather awful science-fiction screenplay called ''The Sad Machines'' that I've never shown to anyone outside my family, I think. The only interesting thing about it now is that its main character, Ishmael Parks, was a definite precursor to Simon in the Osten Ard books."<ref name=Gor/><ref name=Imaginary>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tad|title=Thanks to that imaginary cat|url=http://www.tadwilliams.com/books/tailchasers-song/thanks-to-that-imaginary-cat/|publisher=Official website|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

Williams traces his interest in the [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[genre]] back to the books his mother read to him when he was a child, and that he later read to himself: [[E. Nesbit]], ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', and of course [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]].<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Bryan Thomas|title=A Chat With Author Tad Williams|url=http://www.graspingforthewind.com/2012/03/15/sffwrtcht-a-chat-with-author-tad-williams/|publisher=Grasping for the Wind (March 15, 2012)|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

{{cquote|The biggest single influence on me was reading ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when I was about eleven.<ref name=Centorcelli>{{cite web|last=Centorcelli|first=Kristin|title=Interview: Tad Williams, author of The Dirty Streets of Heaven|url=http://www.mybookishways.com/2012/09/interview-giveaway-tad-williams-author-of-the-dirty-streets-of-heaven.html|publisher=My Bookish Ways (13 September 2012).|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> I think it was the idea of created worlds and imaginary history that grabbed me. I was also very influenced by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]]'s early [[Marvel Comics]] and by [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. And later, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' knocked my socks off and made me want to be a grown-up writer. Art, theatre and music are a whole different set of influences. ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', and ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'' all got into my brain, just for instance.<ref name=Purcell>{{cite web|last=Purcell|first=John|title=Tad Williams, bestselling author of The Dirty Streets of Heaven and many more, answers Ten Terrifying Questions|url=http://blog.booktopia.com.au/2012/08/31/tad-williams-bestselling-author-of-the-dirty-streets-of-heaven-and-many-more-answers-ten-terrifying-questions/|publisher=Booktopia Blog (31 August 2012).|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>}}

A long list of authors have influenced and inspired Williams's work: [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Theodore Sturgeon]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], [[Hunter S. Thompson]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Ruth Rendell]], [[James Tiptree Jr.|James Tiptree Jr. (Alice Sheldon)]], [[Jane Austen]], [[T. S.

Weston (1 November 2012).|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

Williams has also had an influence on other authors in his genre. His ''[[Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn]]'' series was one of the works that inspired [[George R. R. Martin]] to write ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. "I read Tad and was impressed by him, but the imitators that followed—well, fantasy got a bad rep for being very formulaic and ritual. And I read ''[[The Dragonbone Chair]]'' and said, 'My god, they can do something with this form,' and it's Tad doing it. It's one of my favorite fantasy series."<ref name=Redwood>{{cite web|title=Redwood City Signing|url=http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/5527/|publisher=The Citadel (July 27, 2011)|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=io9>{{cite web|author1=Trendacosta, K. |author2=Anders, C.

In "Tad Williams: The American Tolkien?" Ash Silverlock observes that "echoes of Williams's work" can be seen in the works of [[Robin Hobb]], [[Terry Goodkind]] and [[Robert Jordan]].<ref name=Silverlock>{{cite web|last=Silverlock|first=Ash|title=Tad Williams: The American Tolkien?|url=http://ashsilverlock.com/2011/12/01/tad-williams-the-american-tolkien/|publisher=Fabulous Realms (December 1, 2011).|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> Blake Charlton, [[Christopher Paolini]], and [[Patrick Rothfuss]] have also indicated they've been inspired by Williams.<ref name=Geek>{{cite web|author1=Adams, John Joseph  |author2=Kirtley, David Barr |name-list-style=amp |title=GGG-008: Magic!
