==Life and work==
Born in [[south-east London]], Fanthorpe was the daughter of a judge,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/5252820/UA-Fanthorpe.html |title=UA Fanthorpe}}</ref> or as she put it "middle-class but honest parents".<ref name="Feminist">Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present'' (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 356.</ref> She was educated at [[St Catherine's School, Bramley]] in Surrey, and at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], where she "came to life,"<ref name="Feminist"/> receiving a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class]] [[Bachelor of Arts|degree]] in English language and literature. She taught English at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] for 16 years, but then left teaching for jobs as a secretary, receptionist and hospital clerk in [[Bristol]] – in her poems, she later remembered some of the patients for whose records she had been responsible.<ref>[http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/fanthorpe/3071062 Lasting Tribute site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527113844/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/fanthorpe/3071062 |date=27 May 2009}}</ref>

Fanthorpe's first volume of poetry, ''Side Effects'' (1978), has been said to "unsentimentally recover the invisible lives and voices of psychiatric patients."<ref name="Feminist"/> She was "Writer-in-Residence" at [[St Martin's College]], Lancaster (now the [[University of Cumbria]]) in 1983–1985, and later Northern Arts Fellow at [[Durham University|Durham]] [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] universities.<ref>[http://www.secondlightlive.co.uk/artemis/4bailey.pdf "UA Fanthorpe (1929–2009) by R V Bailey"] for ''Second Light''</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The North East Literary Fellowship |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/research/writing/fellowship.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522084042/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/research/writing/fellowship.htm |archive-date=22 May 2012 |access-date=2 September 2012 |publisher=School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics, University of Newcastle |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Her 1984 volume ''Voices Off'' explores student life, critical vocabulary, and the finding that "naming is power."<ref name="Feminist" /> Her most famous poem is probably ''Atlas'', which opens, "There is a kind of love called maintenance."

In 1987 Fanthorpe went freelance, giving readings around the country and occasionally abroad. In 1994 she was nominated for the post of [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]].<ref name="BBC">{{Cite web |date=30 April 2009 |title=British poet UA Fanthorpe dies |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8027526.stm |access-date=30 April 2009 |website=BBC News}}</ref> Her nine collections of poems were published by Peterloo Poets. Her ''Collected Poems'' was published in 2005. Many of her poems bring in [[dramatic poetry|two voices]]. In her readings the other voice is that of the Bristol academic and teacher R. V. "Rosie" Bailey, Fanthorpe's life partner of 44 years. The couple co-wrote a collection of poems, ''From Me To You: love poems'', illustrated by [[Nicholas Wadley|Nick Wadley]] and published in 2007 by Enitharmon.<ref>U. A. Fanthorpe and R. V. Bailey, ''From Me To You'', London: Enitharmon Press 2007.</ref> Both became [[Quakers]] in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bailey |first=Rosie |date=2014-03-28 |title=Comment: Fifty years of Quakers' support for same-sex relationships helped me to be honest about who I am |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/03/28/comment-fifty-years-of-quakers-same-sex-marriage-support-helped-me-to-be-honest-about-who-i-am/ |url-status=live |access-date=2021-11-30 |website=PinkNews {{!}} Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news {{!}} LGBT+ news |language=en-GB}}</ref>
