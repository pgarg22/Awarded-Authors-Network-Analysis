'''Robert Bringhurst''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}}<ref name="OC">Appointments to the Order of Canada (2013).</ref> (born 16 October 1946) is a Canadian poet, [[typographer]] and author. He has translated substantial works from [[Haida language|Haida]] and [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and from classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. He wrote ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'', a reference book of [[typefaces]], [[glyphs]] and the visual and geometric arrangement of type. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in June 2013.<ref name="OC" />

He lives on [[Quadra Island]], near [[Campbell River, British Columbia]] (approximately 170&nbsp;km northwest of [[Vancouver]]) with his wife, [[Jan Zwicky]], a poet and philosopher.

==Life==
Bringhurst was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in [[Utah]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], Alberta, and [[British Columbia]]. He studied architecture, [[linguistics]], and [[physics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[comparative literature]] and philosophy at the [[University of Utah]]. He holds a BA from [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in [[creative writing]] from the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of the Fraser Valley]],<ref name="UCFV">Russell (2006).</ref> and in 2016 was awarded a Doctor of Letters (hon. causa) by [[Simon Fraser University]].<ref name="SFU announces">SFU announces, 2016.</ref>

Bringhurst taught literature, [[art history]] and [[History of Western typography|history of typography]] at several universities and held [[fellow]]ships from the [[Canada Council for the Arts]], the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]], the American Philosophical Society, and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]].

==Literary career==
His 1992 publication, ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' was praised as "the finest book ever written about typography" by the type designers [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]].<ref name="Frequent">"Frequently Asked Questions".</ref> A collection of his poetry, ''The Beauty of the Weapons'', was short-listed for a [[1982 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in 1982, and ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'', his work on Haida symbolism, was nominated for a [[2000 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in 2000. Bringhurst won the [[Lieutenant Governor's Award for Literary Excellence]] in 2005, an award which recognizes British Columbia writers who have contributed to the development of literary excellence in the Province.

===Work in Haida===
Bringhurst has a strong interest in linguistics, translating works from classical Greek, Arabic, Navajo, and, most significantly, Haida. His interest in [[Haida people|Haida]] culture stems from his friendship and close association with the influential Haida artist [[Bill Reid]], with whom he wrote ''The Raven Steals the Light'' in 1984, among several other significant collaborations. It was this friendship that in 1987 "started Bringhurst on the philanthropic endeavour of recording the Haida canon".<ref name="Richler">Richler (2001).</ref> The result of this labour was a trilogy of works collectively titled ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers''. The essays in its first volume, A Story As Sharp As A Knife, and particularly its nineteenth chapter, "The Prosody of Meaning," constitute an important contribution to the understanding of the poetics of oral literatures.

His translations from Haida have been viewed as an attempt to preserve the Haida culture, which in 1991 was considered part of a group "likely to be lost unless strong efforts are made very quickly to perpetuate them".<ref name="Kinkade">Kinkade (1991).</ref>  The Haida translation has caused some controversy. Bringhurst was accused of academic exploitation and cultural appropriation.<ref name="Offence">Bradley (2007).</ref> In 2001, the [[CBC radio]] program [[Ideas (radio show)|''Ideas'']] aired a two part series called "Land to Stand On."  The series' first episode featured "a string of Haida claiming [...] that Bringhurst's work is 'about keeping us in our place,' written 'without asking us,'" and "replete with 'serious errors twisting it into the poetry that he wants'".<ref name ="Richler" />

In 1999,  the ''Globe and Mail'' published a report on the Haida reaction to ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'' by Adele Weder.<ref name="Weder">Weder (1999).</ref>  Weder's piece was later criticized for citing only two Haida sources, claiming they could speak for the entire Haida community, and was described as an "inflammatory article ... not likely to be mistaken for exemplary journalism".<ref name="Bradley895">Bradley (2007) 895.</ref> ''The Globe and Mail'' published Bringhurst's response,<ref name="Genetics">Bringhurst "Since when" (1999).</ref> which was later called "considerably more measured".<ref name="Bradley896">Bradley (2007) 896.</ref>

In 2001, Jeff Leer reviewed ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'' saying Bringhurst has neither formal linguistic education<ref name="Leer565">Leer (2000).</ref> nor significant experience with spoken Haida,<ref name="Leer576">Leer (2000), 576.</ref> and doubting Bringhurst's ability to translate from Haida. Leer's review compared Bringhurst's work unfavourably to Enrico's ''Skidegate Haida Myths and Histories'', and referred to the Weder review as an authoritative source. Leer's publisher, the ''International Journal of American Linguistics'',  retracted the review and apologized to Bringhurst for publishing:

{{Quote|text=some unfounded statements from another author that might be read to impugn Prof. Bringhurst's qualifications or integrity. The ''Journal''{{'}}s sole intention in publishing the book review was to bring an important work by a well-respected scholar to the attention of its readers. [...] it was not the ''Journal's'' intent to transmit erroneous perceptions of Prof. Bringhurst's training or scholarship.<ref name="Apology">"An Apology" (2001).</ref>}}

Most academic discussion and recognition of Bringhurst's work in Haida has been positive. Linguist [[Dell Hymes]] wrote a review of the ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers'' trilogy (of which ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'' is part) in ''Language in Society'',<ref name="Hymes">Hymes (2003).</ref> praising  the trilogy.  He said it "should become a classic reference point"<ref name="Hymes750">Hymes (2003), 750.</ref> for Haida scholars in the future. In 2004, Bringhurst won the Edward Sapir Prize for ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers''.<ref name="Sapir">"Edward Sapir Book Prize" (2004).</ref> The committee giving the award was headed by [[Leanne Hinton]], an expert in American Indian languages, and chair of the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref name="Edward">"Edward Sapir Prize" (2005).</ref>

[[File:Robert Bringhurst.jpg|thumb|Bringhurst in 2018]]

Bringhurst has been defended by [[Margaret Atwood]], who says that "territorial squabbling cannot obscure the fact that Bringhurst's achievement is gigantic as well as heroic", and that far from appropriating native voices, ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers'' "restores to life two exceptional poets we ought to know".<ref name="Atwood">Atwood (2004).</ref> The CBC documentary was attacked in print for relying "entirely on the fallacy, convenient to the producers, that Bringhurst had not consulted with any Haida".<ref name="Richler" />  Bringhurst with the help of Bill Reid had spent the better part of the previous decade working with members of the Haida community.<ref name="Richler" /> People from other indigenous Canadian communities, such as late Cree elder Wilna Hodgson, [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit|SOM]],<ref name="Sask">Past Recipients (2012).</ref> have also defended Bringhurst. In a letter to the editor of ''[[Books In Canada]]'', she called ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'' "a gift to First Nation people across [Canada]", and a true "masterpiece in the growing genre of spoken texts". In her opinion, Bringhurst's "efforts are clearly informed with the kind of integrity that all translators might strive to emulate".<ref name="Hodgson">Hodgson (2000).</ref>

Bringhurst says that "culture is not genetic" and that he pays respect to Native American languages like Haida by allowing works from those languages to be appreciated as art by as wide an audience as possible.<ref name="Prize">"Prize Winning Poet" (2011).</ref> He says he always intended his translations to be "[exercises] in literary history, not in the interpretation of present-day Haida culture".<ref name="Richler" />
