== Literary career ==
Bimal Guha entered the literary arena in 1968 while he was in school. He read the ''Sanchaita'' (collected poems) by Rabindranath Tagore during his leisure time after his secondary examination. He was inspired and began writing. His first poem, ''Akash'' (The Sky) was published in ''Rashmi'', the Satkania college magazine, in 1969. Shortly after, his poems began to appear in different literary periodicals and literary sections of the daily newspapers.

His first book of poems ''Ahongkar, Tomar Shabdo'' ("Pride, Your Words") was published in 1982. His style changed and he sought new perspectives from one volume to another. The imagery, simile, metaphors and symbolism that Guha applies in his poems imply the probabilities of his speciality in creating an individualistic style in the poetic world of Bangladesh.<ref>Preface by Siddique Mahmudur Rahman, Selected Poems of Bimal Guha, Shamabesh, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-8866-02-3}}, pp xii,.</ref>

He has 32 books to his credit; his works include poetry, research, travelogue, edited books and more than 100 articles on literature and culture. Uncompromising in life-struggles, Bimal never bends down to the ungraceful. He has revolting fire in himself; he struggles with quick-sand all through his life. During the 1970s, especially after the liberation war of Bangladesh, some young poets transformed Bangladesh poetry into a newer consciousness and human rejuvenation, and developed the expression of art to arrest time and space into a newer vision; Bimal Guha is remarkable among them. He is associated with many literary and cultural organisations including the Bangladesh Writers Club, Editing and Publication Association of Bangladesh, [[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] and [[Bangla Academy]].

== Critical acclaim ==
Poet-Critic Shudhasattwa Bose of West Bengal, India remarked on Bimal Guha's poem- "Since the seventies, poems developed a newer feelings and understanding, poetic diction has changed, delivery of words and phrases has totally changed overnight. It has started a new journey without touching the old totally. We can take references from Bimal's poems".<ref>Ekok (monthly journal) edited by Shudhasattwa Bose, vol. 44 no 1, 1392 (Begali Era).</ref>

Professor Syed Manzoorul Islam has described in an introductory note- "Bimal Guha's poems are about the problems of our time, more particularly about the difficulties of adjustment that a feeling and thinking individual faces in an increasingly alienating world. As values are forgotten or become obsolete, and relationships become problematic, individuals have to struggle to cling to their dreams. Guha writes movingly about love which can offer a way out but which is constantly thwarted by a mechanical universe. Guha also writes about the need for social change. What makes his poems remarkable is his crisp style which both invokes the rich tradition of the 1930s and charts its distance from it. His diction is personal, contemporary and colloquial. His poems are indeed records of a creative pursuit that excels when it find challenges".<ref>Introduction by Professor Syed Manzoorul Islam, Selected Poems of Bimal Guha, Shamabesh, Dhaka, ix {{ISBN|978-984-8866-02-3}}.</ref>

British poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] has remarked in an interview- "Bimal's poetry is so conversational, and he is also very passionate about the poetry of Bangladesh".<ref>[http://ahmedehussain.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-conversation-with-benjamin-zephaniah.html In Conversation with Benjamin Zephaniah by Ahmede Hussain, Jan 22, 2007]</ref>
