== Early life ==
Malliya Rechana was a Jain [[Komati caste|Komati]] from a place near [[Vemulawada, Karimnagar district|Vemulawada]], [[Karimnagar]] district of Telangana. Rechana was born to father "Bhima" and mother "Mallamma".<ref name=":3" />

''"He from Nizam Rashram and his father is Malliya"''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.373092/2015.373092.Sri-Andhra#page/n17/mode/2up|title=Sri Andhra Kavi Tarangini|last=Chaganti|first=Seshayya|publisher=Hindu dharma sastra grantha nilayam|year=1956|pages=7–11}}</ref>''"There are a lot of Jain Komatis in Karimnagar region even till this day(1917)"''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/kavijanaashrayam020695mbp|title=Kavijanaashrayamu-Chandashastramu|last=Jayanthi Ramaiah|date=1932|publisher=ANDHRA SAHITYA PARISHATH|others=SRI KRISHNA DEVARAYANDRA BHASHA NILAYAM, HYD PAR INFORMATICS}}</ref>''"Scholars uniformly agree that Kavijanasrayam's author is associated with Vemulawada"''<ref name=":2" />

[[Vemulawada, Karimnagar district|Vemulawada]] was the seat of Jain literature. The book Kavijanasrayam establishes the contributions of Jain Literature to Telugu. [[Chalukyas of Vemulavada]], the local rulers, were great patrons of Kannada Jain literature. Along with Kannada, we could see that an attempt was made in the same direction for Telugu Jain literature.

P. V. P Sastry also mentions that 'many Jain works got destroyed'.'''''<ref name=":2" />'''''

== Contemporaries ==

Malliya Rechana, Pampa, Jina Vallabha, Somadeva Suri are considered contemporaries.'''''<ref name=":2" />'''''

Malliya Rechana's guru is Vaadindra Chudamani. Pampa's guru is Jinendrudu. Rechana refers to "Madanavilasa", "Vachakabharana", "Jinendra"  which are all associated to the inscriptions of [[Vemulawada, Karimnagar district|Vemulawada]], [[Telangana]].

== Literary career ==
He wrote the first Telugu prosody (''[[chandas (poetry)|chandassu]]'') book called   Kavijanasrayam.  <ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.333847|title=Kavi Janasramamu|last=Malliya Rechana|date=7 July 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>Samagrandhra Sahitya Charitra , Arudra</ref>

"Nannayya’s Mahabharata shows highly developed technique of Telugu. It presupposes fairly long period of development. Even earlier to Nannayya there may have been Telugu works but which are not extant today. Very recently, [[P. V. Parabrahma Sastry|P.V.P P Sastry]] is of the opinion that Malliya Rechana's Kavi Janasrayamu now dated to 12th Gent. A.D. shows archaic Telugu language and it must be dated to 950-980 A.D. He points out that Malliya Rechana in the work refers to one Vachakabharana who helped him to write the work. Vachakabharana as pointed by [[P. V. Parabrahma Sastry|P.V .P PS astry]] is none other than Jinavallabha, brother of Pampa, of Kurikyala inscription datable to C.950 A.D. Hence, in his opinion Malliya Rechana' s Kavi Janasrayamu is datable to G.950 A.d. not to 13th Cent. A.D. If his suggestion is accepted, then it is likely that Telugu literary activities also started simultaneously with Kannada literature."<ref>{{Cite journal |hdl = 10603/100276|title = Karnataka Andhra relations a cultural study from the proto historic period to Circa 10th a D|journal = University|date = 1985-12-31}}</ref><!-- chapter 7 -->
