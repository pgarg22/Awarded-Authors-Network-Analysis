'''Edward FitzGerald''' or '''Fitzgerald'''<ref>His name is seen written as both FitzGerald and Fitzgerald. The use here of FitzGerald conforms to that of his own publications, anthologies such as [[Arthur Quiller-Couch|Quiller-Couch]]'s ''Oxford Book of English Verse'', and most reference books until about the 1960s.</ref> (31 March 1809{{snd}}14 June 1883) was an English poet and writer. His most famous poem is the first and best known English translation of ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', which has kept its reputation and popularity since the 1860s.

==Life==
Edward FitzGerald was born Edward Purcell at [[Bredfield House]] in [[Bredfield]], some 2 miles north of [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], Suffolk, England, in 1809. In 1818, his father, [[John Fitzgerald (1775–1852)|John Purcell]], assumed the name and arms of his wife's family, the FitzGeralds.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911 |inline=y |wstitle=FitzGerald, Edward |volume=10 |page=443 |first=Edmund |last=Gosse |author-link=Edmund Gosse}}</ref> His elder brother [[John Purcell-Fitzgerald|John]] used the surname Purcell-Fitzgerald from 1858.<ref>{{acad|id=FTST820J|name=Fitzgerald (formerly Purcell), John}}</ref>

The change of family name occurred shortly after FitzGerald's mother inherited a second fortune. She had previously inherited over half a million pounds from an aunt, but in 1818, her father died and left her considerably more than that. The FitzGeralds were one of the wealthiest families in England. Edward FitzGerald later commented that all of his relatives were mad; further, that he was insane as well, but was at least aware of the fact.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Catherine |last=Caufield |title=The Emperor of the United States and other magnificent British eccentrics |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1981 |isbn=0-7100-0957-7 |page=86}}</ref>

In 1816, the family moved to France, and lived in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St Germain]] as well as Paris, but in 1818, after the death of his maternal grandfather, the family had to return to England. In 1821, Edward was sent to [[King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds]]. In 1826, he went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Acad |id=FTST826E |name=Edward Fitzgerald }}</ref> He became acquainted with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[William Hepworth Thompson]].<ref name="EB1911"/> Though he had many friends who were members of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], most notably [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], FitzGerald himself was never offered an invitation to this famous group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1830, FitzGerald left for Paris, but in 1831 was living in a farmhouse on the [[Battle of Naseby|battlefield of Naseby]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

Needing no employment, FitzGerald moved to his native Suffolk, where he lived quietly, never leaving the county for more than a week or two while he resided there. Until 1835, the FitzGeralds lived in [[Wherstead]], then moved until 1853 to a cottage in the grounds of [[Boulge|Boulge Hall]], near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], to which his parents had moved. In 1860, he again moved with his family to Farlingay Hall, where they stayed until in 1873. Their final move was to Woodbridge itself, where FitzGerald resided at his own house close by, called Little Grange. During most of this time, FitzGerald was preoccupied with flowers, music and literature. Friends like Tennyson and Thackeray had surpassed him in the field of literature, and for a long time FitzGerald showed no intention of emulating their literary success. In 1851, he published his first book, ''[[Euphranor]]'', a [[Plato]]nic dialogue, born of memories of the old happy life in Cambridge. This was followed in 1852 by the publication of ''Polonius'', a collection of "saws and modern instances," some of them his own, the rest borrowed from the less familiar English classics. FitzGerald began the study of [[Spanish poetry]] in 1850 at [[Elmsett]], followed by [[Persian language|Persian]] literature at the [[University of Oxford]] with Professor [[Edward Byles Cowell]] in 1853.<ref name="EB1911"/>

FitzGerald married Lucy, daughter of the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] poet [[Bernard Barton]], in Chichester on 4 November 1856, after a death-bed promise to Bernard made in 1849 to look after her. The marriage was unhappy and the couple separated after only a few months,<ref name=poem>[http://www.poemhunter.com/edward-fitzgerald/biography/ "Edward Fitzgerald", Poem Hunter]</ref> despite having known each other for many years and collaborated on a book about her father's works in 1849.

==Early literary work==
In 1853, FitzGerald issued ''Six Dramas of Calderon'', freely translated.<ref name=poem/> He then turned to [[Oriental studies]], and in 1856 published anonymously a version of the ''Salámán and Absál'' of [[Jami]] in [[John Milton|Miltonic]] verse. In March 1857, Cowell discovered a set of Persian quatrains by [[Omar Khayyám]] in the [[Asiatic Society]] library, [[Calcutta]], and sent them to FitzGerald. At the time, the name with which FitzGerald has been so closely identified first occurs in his correspondence: "[[Hafez (poet)|Hafiz]] and Omar Khayyam ring like true metal." On 15 January 1859, an anonymous pamphlet appeared as ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''. In the world at large and the circle of FitzGerald's close friends, the poem seems at first to have attracted no attention. The publisher allowed it to gravitate to a fourpenny or even (as he afterwards boasted) to a penny box on the bookstalls.<ref name="EB1911"/>

[[File:FitzGerald Edward grave.jpg|right|thumb|Grave of Edward FitzGerald in [[Boulge]] churchyard<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1284168|grade=II}}</ref>]]
However, it was discovered in 1861 by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] and soon after by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] and Lord Houghton. The ''Rubaiyat'' slowly became famous, but it was not until 1868 that FitzGerald was encouraged to print a second, greatly revised edition of it. He had produced in 1865 a version of the ''Agamemnon'', and two more plays from [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]]. In 1880–1881, he privately issued translations of the two [[Oedipus]] tragedies. His last publication was ''Readings'' in Crabbe, 1882. He left in manuscript a version of [[Attar of Nishapur]]'s ''Mantic-Uttair''.<ref name="EB1911"/> This last translation FitzGerald called "A Bird's-Eye view of the Bird Parliament", whittling the Persian original (some 4500 lines) down to a more manageable 1500 lines in English. Some have called this translation a virtually unknown masterpiece.<ref name="Briggs">{{Cite book |first=A. D. P. |last=Briggs |title=The Rubaiyat and the Bird Parliament |publisher=Everyman's Poetry |year=1998 }}</ref>

From 1861 onwards, FitzGerald's greatest interest had been in the sea. In June 1863 he bought a [[yacht]], "The Scandal", and in 1867 he became part-owner of a herring [[lugger]], the ''Meum and Tuum'' ("mine and thine"). For some years up to 1871, he spent his summers "knocking about somewhere outside of [[Lowestoft]]." He died in his sleep in 1883 and was buried in the graveyard at St Michael's Church in [[Boulge]], Suffolk. He was in his own words "an idle fellow, but one whose friendships were more like loves." In 1885 his fame was enhanced by Tennyson's dedication of his ''Tiresias'' to FitzGerald's memory, in some reminiscent verses to "Old Fitz."<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Personal life==
Little was known of FitzGerald personally until his close friend and literary executor [[William Aldis Wright|W. Aldis Wright]], published his three-volume ''Letters and Literary Remains'' in 1889 and the ''Letters to Fanny Kemble'' in 1895. These letters reveal that FitzGerald was a witty, picturesque, and sympathetic letter writer.<ref>Joseph Sendry (1984) "Edward FitzGerald", in William E. Fredeman and Ira B. Nadel, eds (1984) ''Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 32: Victorian Poets Before 1850'' Gale Research Company, Detroit, Michigan, pp. 121–122, {{ISBN|0-8103-1710-9}}</ref> The late 19th-century English novelist [[George Gissing]] found them interesting enough to read the three-volume collection twice, in 1890 and 1896. This included some of Fitzgerald's letters to Fanny Kemble. Gissing also read the 1895 volume of letters in December of that year.<ref>Pierre Coustillas, ed., ''London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist''. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, pp. 232, 396, 413 and 415.</ref> FitzGerald was unobtrusive personally, but in the 1890s, his distinctive individuality gradually gained a broad influence over English ''[[belles-lettres]]''.<ref name="NYTimes1909"/>

FitzGerald's emotional life was complex. He was extremely close to many friends, among them William Browne, who was 16 when they met. Browne's tragically early death in a horse-riding accident was a catastrophe for FitzGerald. Later, FitzGerald became close to a fisherman named Joseph Fletcher, with whom he had bought a herring boat.<ref name=poem/> While it appears there are no contemporary sources on the matter, a number of present-day academics and journalists believe FitzGerald to have been a homosexual.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1995-11-05 |title=From Persia to Tyneside and the door of darkness |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/from-persia-to-tyneside-and-the-door-of-darkness-1538528.html|access-date=2020-07-07 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref> With Professor Daniel Karlin writing in his introduction to the 2009 edition of ''Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám'' that "His [FitzGerald] homoerotic feelings (...) were probably unclear to him, at least in the form conveyed by our word 'gay'",<ref>{{Cite book |last=Omar Khayyam |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/320958676 |title=Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |others=FitzGerald, Edward, 1809-1883, Karlin, Daniel, 1953- |isbn=978-0-19-156230-3 |location=Oxford |pages=6 |oclc=320958676}}</ref> it is unclear whether FitzGerald himself ever identified himself as a homosexual or acknowledged himself to be one.

FitzGerald grew disenchanted with Christianity and eventually ceased to attend church.<ref name="Plomer">{{Cite book |first=William |last=Plomer |title=Electric Delights |publisher=David R. Godine |year=1978 |isbn=0-87923-248-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/electricdelights00plom/page/89 89] |url=https://archive.org/details/electricdelights00plom/page/89 }}</ref> This drew the attention of the local pastor, who stopped by. FitzGerald reportedly told him that his decision to absent himself was the fruit of long and hard meditation. When the pastor protested, FitzGerald showed him the door and said, "Sir, you might have conceived that a man does not come to my years of life without thinking much of these things. I believe I may say that I have reflected [on] them fully as much as yourself. You need not repeat this visit."<ref name="Plomer"/>

The 1908 book ''Edward Fitzgerald and "Posh": Herring Merchants (Including letters from E. Fitzgerald to J. Fletcher)'' recounts the friendship of Fitzgerald with Joseph Fletcher (born June 1838), nicknamed "Posh", who was still living when [[James Blyth (writer)|James Blyth]] started researching for the book.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Blyth |first1=James |title=Edward Fitzgerald and 'Posh', 'herring merchants' Including letters from E. Fitzgerald to J. Fletcher |date=1908 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-SkPAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> Posh is also often present in Fitzgerald's letters. Documentary data about the Fitzgerald–Posh partnership are available at the Port of Lowestoft Research Society. Posh died at Mutford Union [[workhouse]], near Lowestoft, on 7 September 1915, at the age of 76.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Edward |title=The Letters of Edward Fitzgerald, Volume 3: 1867–1876 |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7L_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA194|isbn=9781400854011}}</ref>

Fitzgerald was termed "almost [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]", as he ate meat only in other people's houses.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/fitzgerald/bio.html "An Old Man in a Dry Month": a Brief Life of Edward FitzGerald (1809–1883)"]. The Victorian Web.</ref> His biographer Thomas Wright noted that "though never a strict vegetarian, his diet was mainly bread and fruit."<ref>Thomas Wright, [https://archive.org/details/lifeedwardfitzg05wriggoog/page/n124 ''The Life of Edward Fitzgerald'']. New York, 1904, p. 116.</ref> Several years before his death, FitzGerald said of his diet, "Tea, pure and simple, with bread-and-butter, is the only meal I do care to join in."<ref>John Glyde, 1900 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t77s87t6d&view=1up&seq=64 ''The Life of Edward Fitz-Gerald, by John Glyde'']. Chicago. p. 44.</ref>

==The Rubáiyát==
Beginning in 1859, FitzGerald authorized four editions (1859, 1868, 1872 and 1879) and there was a fifth posthumous edition (1889) of his translation of the ''Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám'' ({{lang-fa|رباعیات عمر خیام}}). Three (the first, second, and fifth) differ significantly; the second and third are almost identical, as are the fourth and fifth. The first and fifth are reprinted almost equally often,<ref>Christopher Decker, ed., "Introduction: Postscript" ''Edward FitzGerald, Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám: a critical edition'' University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nihvj8fPztEC&pg=PR45 page xlv], 1997. {{ISBN|0-8139-1689-5}}</ref><ref>Stanley Appelbaum, (editor) (1990) "Note" ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' [[Dover Publications]], Mineola, New York, back cover, {{ISBN|0-486-26467-X}}</ref> and equally often anthologized.<ref>Frederick A. Manchester and William F. Giese, eds, ''Harper's anthology for college courses in composition and literature'' [[Harper & Brothers]], New York, vol. 2, 1926, p. 685, [http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/1743706 OCLC 1743706 Worldcat.org].</ref>

{{quote|<poem>
A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread – and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness – 
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!
</poem>}}

[[File:Houghton AC85 M4977 Zz878o - Rubáiyát, title.jpg|thumb|Title page from the first American edition of FitzGerald's translation, 1878]]
[[Stanza]] XI above, from the fifth edition, differs from the corresponding stanza in the first edition, wherein it reads: "Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the bough/A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse – and Thou". Other differences are discernible. Stanza XLIX is more well known in its incarnation in the first edition (1859):

{{quote|<poem>
'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days
Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:
Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,
And one by one back in the Closet lays.
</poem>}}

The fifth edition (1889) of stanza LXIX, with different numbering, is less familiar: "But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays/Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;/Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,/And one by one back in the Closet lays."

FitzGerald's translation of the ''Rubáiyát'' is notable for being a work to which allusions are both frequent and ubiquitous.<ref name="NYTimes1909">Staff (10 April 1909) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902EEDB1539E733A25753C1A9629C946897D6CF "Two Centenaries"] ''New York Times: Saturday Review of Books'' p. BR-220</ref> It remains popular, but enjoyed its greatest popularity for a century following its publication, wherein it formed part of the wider English literary canon.<ref name="NYTimes1909"/>

One indicator of the popular status of the ''Rubáiyát'' is that, of the 101 stanzas in the poem's fifth edition, the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'' (2nd edition) quotes no less than 43 entire stanzas in full, in addition to many individual lines and couplets. Stanza LI, also well-known, runs:

{{quote|<poem>
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.
</poem>}}

Lines and phrases from the poem have been used as the titles of many literary works, among them [[Nevil Shute]]'s ''The Chequer Board'', [[James Michener]]'s ''The Fires of Spring'' and [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[The Moving Finger]]''. [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''Ah, Wilderness'' alludes to the ''Rubáiyát'' without making a direct quotation. Allusions are frequent in the short stories of [[O. Henry]].<ref>Victoria Blake, ed., "Notes" ''Selected Stories of O. Henry'' Barnes & Noble Books, New York, pp. 404 and 418, 1993. {{ISBN|1-59308-042-5}}</ref> [[Saki]]'s pseudonym makes reference to it. The popular 1925 song ''A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich, and You'', by [[Billy Rose]] and [[Al Dubin]], echoes the first of the stanzas quoted above.

===Parodies===
FitzGerald's translations were popular in the century of their publication, also with humorists for the purpose of parody.<ref name="NYTimes1909"/>
*''The Rubáiyát of Ohow Dryyam'' by J. L. Duff utilises the original to create a satire commenting on [[Prohibition]].
*''Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten'' by [[Oliver Herford]], published in 1904, is the illustrated story of a kitten in parody of the original verses.
*''The Rubaiyat of Omar Cayenne'' by [[Gelett Burgess]] (1866–1951) was a condemnation of the writing and publishing business.
*''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, Jr.'' (1971) by [[Wallace Irwin]] purports to be a translation from "Mango-Bornese" chronicling the adventures of Omar Khayyam's son "Omar Junior" – unmentioned in the original – who has emigrated from [[Persia]] to [[Borneo]].
*Astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] wrote a parody about his famous 1919 experiment to test [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] by observing a solar eclipse.
*''The new Rubaiyat: Omar Khayyam'' reincarnated by "Ame Perdue" (pen name of W. J. Carroll) was published in Melbourne in 1943. It revisits the plaints of the original text with references to modern science, technology and industry.
