'''Miron Białoszewski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈmirɔn bjawɔˈʂɛfskʲi}}; born June 30, 1922, [[Warsaw]] – died June 17, 1983, [[Warsaw]]), was a Polish [[poet]], [[novelist]], [[playwright]] and [[actor]].

==Biography==
Białoszewski studied [[linguistics]] at the clandestine courses of the [[University of Warsaw]] during the [[German occupation of Poland]]. Following the end of the [[Warsaw Uprising]], he was sent to a [[labour camp]] in the [[Third Reich]], and returned to Warsaw at the end of [[World War II]].

First, he worked at the central post office, and then as a [[journalist]] for a number of popular magazines, some of them for children. In 1955 Białoszewski took part in the foundation of a small theatre called ''Teatr na Tarczyńskiej'', where he premiered his plays ''Wiwisekcja'' and ''Osmędeusze'', and acted in them with Ludmiła Murawska. In the same year Białoszewski debuted in ''Życie literackie'' along with another renowned Polish poet and his contemporary, [[Zbigniew Herbert]]. Białoszewski was [[gay]] and for many years, he shared an apartment at Pl. Dąbrowskiego 7 with his live-in partner, the [[painter]] Leszek Soliński.

According to Joanna Nizynska from [[University of California in Los Angeles]]: {{cquote|This most "private" author of postwar [[Polish literature]] disregards discourses of history so deeply embedded in the Polish literary tradition; rather he focuses on the mundane aspects of the everyday life, usually from an autobiographical perspective and using an overtly colloquial language. Although Białoszewski's works have stirred many discussions, most of these have focused on his treatment of genres and language...<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://aatseel.org/program/aatseel/2001/abstracts/Nizynska.html |title="Almost Nothing is Happening": Miron Bialoszewski's Kairotic Everyday |first=Joanna |last=Nizynska |conference=[[AATSEEL]] 2001 |accessdate=2006-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041222061138/http://www.aatseel.org/program/aatseel/2001/abstracts/Nizynska.html |archivedate=2004-12-22 }}</ref>}}

His highly acclaimed [[memoir]], ''Pamiętnik z powstania warszawskiego'' ("Memoir of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]") was published in 1970 (and translated into [[English language|English]] in 1977). In it, Białoszewski gave a [[philosophy|philosophical]] account of his wartime experiences 27 years after the fact. In 1982, he was awarded the [[Jurzykowski Prize]] by the [[New York City|New York]]-based Alfred Jurzykowski Foundation. He died of a [[heart attack]] on June 17, 1983. There is a large body of literature devoted to the critical analysis of Białoszewski's works - most notably by such writers and academics as [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Maria Janion]], [[Stanisław Barańczak]], [[Jan Błoński]], [[Kazimierz Wyka]] and [[Artur Sandauer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wyborcza.pl/1,75410,959373.html |title=Miron Białoszewski - życiorys |access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>
