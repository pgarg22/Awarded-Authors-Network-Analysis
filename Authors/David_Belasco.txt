'''David Belasco''' (July 25, 1853 – May 14, 1931) was an American [[theatrical producer]], [[impresario]], [[theatre director|director]], and [[playwright]].<ref name=obit/> He was the first writer to adapt the short story ''[[Madame Butterfly (short story)|Madame Butterfly]]'' for the stage, and he launched the theatrical career of many actors, including [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Lenore Ulric]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Belasco pioneered many innovative new forms of stage lighting and special effects in order to create realism and naturalism.<ref name=Osnes>Osnes, Beth, and Gill, Sam. ''Acting: An International Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO (2001) p. 34</ref><ref name=Marker>Marker, Lise-Lone, ''David Belasco: Naturalism in the American Theater'', Princeton Univ. Press (1975)</ref>

==Early years==
David Belasco was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], the son of Abraham H. Belasco (1830–1911) and Reyna Belasco (née Nunes, 1830–1899), [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jews who had moved from London’s Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community during the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|13}} He began working in a San Francisco theater doing a variety of routine jobs, such as [[call boy (theatre)|call boy]], script copier or as an extra in small parts.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|14}} He received his first experience as a stage manager while on the road. He said, "We used to play in any place we could hire or get into{{mdash}}a hall, a big dining room, an empty barn; any place that would take us."<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|14}}

From late 1873 to early 1874, he worked as an actor, director, and secretary at [[Piper's Opera House]] in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], where he found "more reckless women and desperadoes to the square foot…than anywhere else in the world". His developmental years as a supporting player in Virginia City colored his thoughts eventually helping him to conceive realistic stage settings.<ref>Eichin, Carolyn Grattan, ''From San Francisco Eastward: Victorian'' ''Theater in the American West'', (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 181</ref> He said that while there, seeing "people die under such peculiar circumstances" made him "all the more particular in regard to the psychology of dying on the stage. I think I was one of the first to bring naturalness to bear in death scenes, and my varied Virginia City experiences did much to help me toward this. Later I was to go deeper into such studies."  His recollections of that time were published in ''Hearst's Magazine'' in 1914.<ref>Belasco, David. ''Gala Days of Piper's Opera House and the California Theater''. 1914. Sparks, NV:, Falcon Hill Press, 1991: v–vi, 18, 42</ref> By March 1874, he was back at work in San Francisco, eventually managing Thomas Maguire's Baldwin Theater. When Maguire lost the theater in 1882, Belasco relocated to the East Coast bringing his practical western experiences with him. The West allowed him to develop his talents as not only a performer, but in progressive production design and execution.<ref>Eichin, Carolyn Grattan, ''From San'' ''Francisco Eastward: Victorian Theater in the American West'', (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 180-182.</ref>

A gifted playwright, Belasco went to New York City in 1882 where he worked as stage manager for the [[Madison Square Theatre]] (starting with ''[[Young Mrs. Winthrop (play)|Young Mrs. Winthrop]]''), and then the [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885-1902)|old Lyceum Theatre]] while writing plays. By 1895, he was so successful that he was considered America's most distinguished playwright and producer.

==Career==
[[File:David Belasco 1873.jpg|thumb|Belasco in 1873]]
During his long creative career, stretching between 1884 and 1930, Belasco either wrote, directed, or produced more than 100 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, including ''[[Hearts of Oak (play)|Hearts of Oak]]'', ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'', and ''Du Barry'', making him the most powerful personality on the New York City theater scene. He also helped establish careers for dozens of notable stage performers, many of whom went on to work in films.

Among them were [[Mrs. Leslie Carter|Leslie Carter]], dubbed "The American Sarah Bernhardt,"<ref name=Wilson/> whose association with Belasco skyrocketed her to theatrical fame after her roles in ''[[Zaza (play)|Zaza]]'' (1898) and ''Madame Du Barry'' (1901).<ref name=Wilson/> [[Ina Claire]]'s lead in ''Polly with a Past'' (1917) and [[The Gold Diggers (1919 play)|''The Gold Diggers'']] (1919)  similarly propelled her career.<ref name=Wilson/> Belasco wrote a lead part for 18-year-old [[Maude Adams]] in his new play ''[[Men and Women (play)|Men and Women]]'' (1890), which ran for 200 performances.<ref name=Wilson/>

Other stars whose careers he helped launch included [[Jeanne Eagels]], who would later achieve immortality as Sadie Thompson in ''Rain'' (1923), which played for 340 performances.<ref name=Botto>Botto, Louis; Viagas, Robert. [https://archive.org/details/atthistheatre10000bott ''At this Theatre: 100 Years of Broadway Shows, Stories and Stars''], Hal Leonard Corp. (2002) p. 28</ref> Belasco discovered and managed the careers of [[Lenore Ulric]]<ref name=NYT-obit>"Lenore Ulric, Broadway Star of Belasco Era, Is Dead at 78", ''The New York Times'', December 31, 1970</ref> and [[David Warfield]], both of whom became major stars on Broadway. He launched the career of [[Barbara Stanwyck]], and was responsible for changing her name.<ref name=Wilson/>

Belasco is perhaps most famous for having adapted the short story ''[[Madame Butterfly (short story)|Madame Butterfly]]'' into [[Madame Butterfly (play)|a play with the same name]] and for penning ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (play)|The Girl of the Golden West]]'' for the stage, both of which were adapted as operas by [[Giacomo Puccini]] (''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' 1904—twice,  after revision) and ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (1910). More than forty [[motion pictures]] have been made from the many plays he authored.

Many prominent performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries sought the opportunity to work with Belasco; among them were [[D. W. Griffith]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]]<ref name=Wilson/> and [[Cecil B. DeMille]].<ref name=Wilson/> DeMille's father had been close friends with Belasco, and after DeMille graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he began his stage career under Belasco's guidance.<ref>Wallace, David. ''Lost Hollywood'', Macmillan (2001)  p. 21</ref> DeMille's later methods of handling actors, using dramatic lighting and directing films, were modeled after Belasco's staging techniques.<ref name=Wilson/>

Pickford appeared in his plays ''The Warrens of Virginia'' at the first Belasco Theatre in 1907 and ''A Good Little Devil'' in 1913. The two remained in touch after Pickford began working in Hollywood; Belasco appeared with her in the 1914 film adaptation of ''A Good Little Devil''. He is  credited as giving Pickford her stage name as well. He also worked with [[Lionel Barrymore]], who starred in his play ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'' opposite [[Lucille Kahn]], whose Broadway career Belasco launched. Belasco was a member of [[The Lambs]] from 1893 to 1931.

==Marriage==
David Belasco was married to Cecilia Loverich for over fifty years; they had two daughters, Reina (who was married to producer [[Morris Gest]]) and Augusta.

==Death==
Belasco died in 1931 at the age of 77 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=David Belasco Dies. Dean Of Theatre, 76, Had Long Been Ill.

==Influence on American theatre==
[[Image:Belasco's The Heart of Maryland.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'' with [[Maurice Barrymore]] and [[Mrs. Leslie Carter]]]]

Belasco demanded a natural acting style, and to complement that, he developed stage settings with authentic lighting effects to enhance his plays. His productions inspired several generations of theatre lighting designers.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}}

Belasco's contributions to modern stage and lighting techniques were originally not appreciated as much as those of his European counterparts, such as [[André Antoine]] and [[Constantin Stanislavski]], however today he is regarded as "one of the first significant directorial figures in the history of the American theatre," writes theatre historian Lise-Lone Marker.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|xi}}

[[Image:David_Belasco_Monogram.jpg|thumb|Belasco's monogram]]
He brought a new standard of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] to the American stage as the first to develop modern stage lighting along with the use of colored lights, via motorized color changing wheels, to evoke mood and setting.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|xi}}<ref name=Cox/> America's earliest stage lighting manufacturer, [[Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company|Kliegl Brothers]], began by serving the specialized needs of producers and directors such as Belasco and [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|157}} With regard to these modern lighting effects, Belasco is best remembered for his production of ''Girl of the Golden West'' (1905), with the play opening to a spectacular sunset which lasted five minutes before any dialogue started.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}}

Belasco became one of the first directors to eschew the use of traditional footlights in favor of lights concealed below floor level, thereby hidden from the audience. His lighting assistant, Louis Hartmann, realised Belasco's design ideas.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}} He also used follow spots to further create realism and often tailored his lighting configurations to complement the complexions and hair of the actors.<ref name=Cox>Cox, Jim. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RwVkMMLqMdkC Sold on Radio: Advertisers in the Golden Age of Broadcasting]''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2008; reprint 2013. {{ISBN|9780786433919}}.</ref>{{rp|135}} He ordered a specially made 1000-watt lamp developed just for his own productions, and was the only director to have one for the first two years after its introduction (1914–1915).<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|135}}

In his own theatres, the dressing rooms were equipped with lamps of several colors, allowing the performers to see how their makeup looked under different lighting conditions.

Supposedly he put appropriate scents to set scenes in the ventilation of the theaters, while his sets paid great attention to detail, and sometimes spilled out into the audience area. In one play, for instance, an operational laundromat was built onstage. In ''[[The Governor's Lady]]'', there was a reproduction of a [[Childs Restaurant]] kitchen where actors actually cooked and prepared food during the play. [[File:Childs Restaurant Scene in The Governor’s Lady.jpg|thumb|Childs Restaurant Scene in ''The Governor's Lady'']] He is even said to have purchased a room in a [[flophouse]], cut it out of the building, brought it to his theater, cut out one wall and presented it as the set for a production. Belasco's original scripts were often filled with long, specific descriptions of props and set dressings. He has not been noted for producing unusually naturalistic scenarios.

Belasco also embraced existing theatre technology and sought to expand on it. Both of Belasco's New York theatres were built on the cutting edge of their era's technology. When Belasco took over the Republic Theatre he drilled a new basement level to accommodate his machinery; the Stuyvesant Theatre was specially constructed with enormous amounts of flyspace, hydraulics systems and lighting rigs. The basement of the Stuyvesant contained a working machine shop, where Belasco and his team experimented with lighting and other special effects. Many of the innovations developed in the Belasco shop were sold to other producers.

[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] references Belasco's reputation for realism in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' when he has a drunken visitor in the library of Gatsby's mansion exclaim in amazement that the books are genuine: "See!" he cried triumphantly. "It's a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn't cut the pages."<ref>F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uRVGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT33 The Great Gatsby]'', chapter 3.</ref>

The first Belasco Theatre in New York was located at 229 West 42nd Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues, in the [[Times Square]] district of Manhattan. Belasco took over management of the theater and completely remodeled it in 1902, only two years after it was constructed as the Theatre Republic by [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] (the grandfather of the famous lyricist). He gave up the theater in 1910 and it was renamed the Republic. Under various owners, it went through a tumultuous period as a [[burlesque]] venue, hosted second-run and, eventually, pornographic films and fell into a period of neglect before being rehabilitated and reopened as the [[New Victory Theater]] in 1995.

The second [[Belasco Theatre]] is located at 111 West 44th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, only a few blocks away from the New Victory. It was constructed in 1907 as the Stuyvesant Theatre and renamed after Belasco in 1910. The theater was built to Belasco's wishes, with [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] lighting and ceiling panels, rich woodwork and murals. His business office and private apartment were also housed there. The Belasco is still in operation as a Broadway venue with much of the original decor intact. In 2010 it underwent a massive US $14.5 million restoration, which strove to renovate and restore the theater to the condition it was in when David Belasco was alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/theater/29isherwood.html?pagewanted=all|title=Belasco Theater Is Burnished, and Back|first=Charles|last=Isherwood|access-date=October 1, 2018}}</ref>

Belasco Theatres also existed in several other cities. In Los Angeles, the first Belasco Theatre was located at 337 S. Main St. The theater, which hosted the Belasco Stock Company, opened in 1904 and was operated by David Belasco's brother, Frederick. This theater was renamed twice: as the Republic in about 1913 and as the Follies, circa 1919. The theater eventually became a burlesque venue in the 1940s, fell into sharp decline, and was demolished in May 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/follies|title=Follies Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2202|title=Follies Theatre|work=cinematreasures.org}}</ref>

The second, and perhaps more well known theatre in Los Angeles, [[The Belasco]] is located at 1050 S. Hill St in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The theatre, which was built by Morgan, Walls & Clements, opened in 1926, and was managed by Edward Belasco, another of David's brothers. Many Hollywood stars with theatrical roots, as well as Broadway stars who were visiting the West Coast, appeared at the theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/belasco|title=Belasco Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}</ref> The theater declined after the death of Edward Belasco in 1937. After closing altogether in the early 1950s, the theater was used as a church for several decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogdowntown.com/2007/09/2854-historic-belasco-theater-awaits-its-next|title=Historic Belasco Theater Awaits Its Next Act|work=blogdowntown.com}}</ref> In 2010 - 2011, the theater underwent an extensive restoration, and is currently in operation as a nightclub and convention venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/bringing-back-the-belasco/article_b4dfa8ea-6c73-5b68-aa9e-751d7884321e.html|title=Bringing Back the Belasco|work=Los Angeles Downtown News - For Everything Downtown L.A.!}}</ref>

The Shubert-Belasco Theatre, located in Washington, D.C., was purchased by Belasco in September 1905. Originally built in 1895 as the [[Lafayette Square Opera House]], at 717 Madison Place, across from the [[White House]], the theater was razed in 1962 and replaced by the [[U.S. Court of Claims]] building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/2813/white/east.html |title=White House Area - Sites on the East side of Lafayette Park |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |access-date=January 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015040930/http://library.thinkquest.org/2813/white/east.html |archive-date=October 15, 2012 }}</ref>
