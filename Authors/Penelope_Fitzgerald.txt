==Biography==
Penelope Fitzgerald was born Penelope Mary Knox on 17 December 1916 at the Old Bishop's Palace, Lincoln, the daughter of [[E. V. Knox|Edmund Knox]], later editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', and Christina, ''née'' Hicks, daughter of [[Edward Hicks (bishop)|Edward Hicks, Bishop of Lincoln]], and one of the first women students at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. She was a niece of the theologian and crime writer [[Ronald Knox]], the cryptographer [[Dillwyn Knox]], the Bible scholar [[Wilfred Knox]], and the novelist and biographer [[Winifred Peck]].<ref>Jenny Turner, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/jenny-turner/in-the-potato-patch "In the Potato Patch: Review of ''Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life'' by Hermione Lee"]. ''London Review of Books''. 19 December 2013.</ref> Fitzgerald later wrote: "When I was young I took my father and my three uncles for granted, and it never occurred to me that everyone else wasn't like them. Later on, I found that this was a mistake, but I've never quite managed to adapt myself to it. I suppose they were unusual, but I still think that they were right, and insofar as the world disagrees with them, I disagree with the world."<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Knox Brothers |first=search |last=results |date=14 August 2000 |publisher=Counterpoint |id={{ASIN|1582430950|country=uk}} }}</ref>

She was educated at [[Wycombe Abbey]], an independent girls' boarding school, and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[Oxford University]], where she graduated in 1938 with a congratulatory First, being named a "Woman of the Year" in ''[[The Isis Magazine|Isis]]'', the student newspaper.<ref name=nyb/> She worked for the [[BBC]] in [[World War II|the Second World War]]. In 1942 she married Desmond Fitzgerald, whom she had met in 1940 at Oxford. He had been studying for the bar and enlisted as a soldier in the [[Irish Guards]]. Six months later, Desmond's regiment was sent to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. He won the [[Military Cross]] in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] in [[Libya]], but returned to civilian life an [[alcoholic]].<ref name=nyb/>

In the early 1950s the couple lived in [[Hampstead]], London, where she had grown up. They co-edited a magazine called ''World Review'', in which [[J. D. Salinger]]'s "For Esmé with Love and Squalor" was first published in the UK, as were writings of [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Norman Mailer]], and [[Alberto Moravia]]. Fitzgerald also contributed, writing about literature, music and sculpture. Soon afterwards Desmond was disbarred from the legal profession for "forging signatures on cheques that he cashed at the pub." This led to a life of poverty for the Fitzgeralds. At times they were even [[homeless]], living for four months in a homeless centre and for eleven years in subsidized public housing. To provide for her family in the 1960s, Fitzgerald taught at a drama school, [[Italia Conti Academy]], and at [[Queen's Gate School]], where her pupils included Camilla Shand (later [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]]). She also taught "at a posh [[Cram school|crammer]]", where her pupils included [[Anna Wintour]], [[Edward St Aubyn]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. Indeed she continued to teach until she was 70 years old.<ref name=nyb/> For a while she worked in a bookshop in [[Southwold]], Suffolk, and in another period lived in [[Battersea]] on a [[houseboat]] that sank twice – the second time for good, destroying many of her books and family papers.

The couple had three children: a son, Valpy, and two daughters, Tina and Maria.<ref name=nyb/> Penelope Fitzgerald died on 28 April 2000.

==Legacy==
Fitzgerald's archive was acquired by the [[British Library]] in June 2017. It consists of 170 files of correspondence and papers relating to her literary works, and of correspondence and other items belonging to family members, including her father, E. V. Knox, and papers of Fitzgerald's Literary Estate.<ref>[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-003441246 Penelope Fitzgerald Archive], archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library. Retrieved 7 May 2020.</ref>

==Literary career==
Fitzgerald launched her literary career in 1975 at the age of 58, with "scholarly, accessible [[biography|biographies]]"<ref>Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (eds): ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'' (London: Batsford, 1990), pp. 377–378.</ref> of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and two years later of ''The Knox Brothers'', her father and uncles, although she never mentions herself by name. Later in 1977 she published her first novel, ''[[The Golden Child (novel)|The Golden Child]]'', a comic [[murder mystery]] with a museum setting inspired by the [[Tutankhamun]] mania of the 1970s, written to amuse her terminally ill husband, who died in 1976.

Over the next five years she published four novels, each tied to her own experiences. ''[[The Bookshop]]'' (1978), which was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]], concerns a struggling store in the fictional [[East Anglia]]n town. Set in 1959, it includes as a pivotal event the shop's decision to stock ''[[Lolita]]''.<ref>Mark Bostridge (23 August 2008). [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/so-i-have-thought-of-you-the-letters-of-penelope-fitzgerald-ed-terence-dooley-5470807.html "So I Have Thought of You: The letters of Penelope Fitzgerald, ed Terence Dooley"]. ''The Independent'' (London).</ref> A 2017 film adaptation also entitled ''[[The Bookshop (film)|The Bookshop]]'' starred [[Emily Mortimer]] as Florence Green. It was written and directed by [[Isabel Coixet]]. Fitzgerald won the 1979 Booker Prize with ''[[Offshore (novel)|Offshore]]'', a novel set among houseboat residents in Battersea in 1961. ''[[Human Voices]]'' (1980) fictionalised wartime life at the BBC, while ''[[At Freddie's]]'' (1982) depicts life at a drama school.

In 1999 Fitzgerald was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |access-date=3 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc1UA3uhUlYC&pg=PA349 |page=349 |title=A Historical Dictionary of British Women |author=Hartley, Cathy |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2003|isbn=9780203403907}}</ref>

===Historical novels===
Fitzgerald said after ''At Freddie's'' that she "had finished writing about the things in my own life, which I wanted to write about."<ref>Harvey-Wood, Harriet (3 May 2000).[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,216535,00.html "Penelope Fitzgerald"]. ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> Instead she wrote a biography of the poet [[Charlotte Mew]] and began a series of novels with a variety of [[historical novel|historical]] settings. The first was ''[[Innocence (Penelope Fitzgerald novel)|Innocence]]'' (1986), a romance between the daughter of an impoverished aristocrat and a doctor from a southern Communist family set in 1950s [[Florence]], Italy. The Italian Marxist theorist [[Antonio Gramsci]] appears as a minor character.

''[[The Beginning of Spring]]'' (1988) takes place in [[Moscow]] in 1913. It examines the world just before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] through the family and work troubles of a British businessman born and raised in Russia. ''[[The Gate of Angels]]'' (1990), about a young [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] physicist who falls in love with a nursing trainee after a bicycle accident, is set in 1912, when physics was about to enter its own revolutionary period.

Fitzgerald's final novel, ''[[The Blue Flower]]'' (1995), centres on the 18th-century German poet and philosopher [[Novalis]] and his love for what is portrayed as an ordinary child. Other historical figures such as the poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and the philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel]], feature in the story. It won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] 1997 and has been called her masterpiece.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Hofmann |first1=Michael |title=Nonsense Is Only Another Language |url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/970413.13hofmant.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 April 1997}}</ref><ref>Harriet Harvey-Wood (3 May 2000)[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/03/guardianobituaries.books "Penelope Fitzgerald (obituary)"]. ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> In 1999 it was adapted and dramatised for [[BBC Radio]] by Peter Wolf.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/b/bl/blue_flower__the.html |title=Blue Flower, The |website=www.radiolistings.co.uk |access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref>

A collection of Fitzgerald's [[short stories]], ''The Means of Escape'', and a volume of her essays, reviews and commentaries, ''A House of Air'', were published posthumously. In 2013 the first full biography of Fitzgerald appeared: ''Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life'' by [[Hermione Lee]].<ref name=nyb/>
