'''Benito Pérez Galdós''' (May 10, 1843 &ndash; January 4, 1920) was a Spanish [[Spanish Realist literature|realist]] novelist. He was the leading literary figure in 19th-century Spain, and some scholars consider him second only to [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in stature as a Spanish novelist.<ref name="Davies">[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ctitext2/publish/occas/eurolit/davies.html Davies, Rhian. Teaching European Literature and Culture with Communication and Information Technologies: The Pérez Galdós Editions Project]</ref><ref>"...considered by some critics the greatest Spanish novelist since Cervantes, often compared to Balzac, Dickens, and Tolstoy." ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 15th Edition (1985)</ref>

Galdós was a prolific writer, publishing 31 novels, 46 ''Episodios Nacionales'' (''National Episodes''), 23 plays, and the equivalent of 20 volumes of shorter fiction, journalism and other writings.<ref name="Davies"/> He remains popular in Spain, and is considered as equal to [[Dickens]], [[Balzac]] and [[Tolstoy]].<ref name="Davies"/> Some of his works have been translated into English, as he has slowly become popular in the Anglophone world.

While his plays are generally considered to be less successful than his novels, ''Realidad'' (1892) is important in the history of realism in the Spanish theatre.

The Galdós museum in [[Las Palmas]], [[Gran Canaria]] features a portrait of the writer by [[Joaquín Sorolla]].

== Childhood and first years ==
Benito Pérez Galdós was born in his family’s home, located in Calle Cano in [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] (currently known as the ''Casa-Museo'' or House-Museum Pérez Galdós) on the 10th May 1843. He was the tenth and last son of the Lieutenant Colonel Don Sebastián Pérez and Doña Dolores Galdós. Two days after his birth, he was baptized under the name of Benito María de los Dolores in the church of San Francisco de Asís in the same city. 

He studied at San Agustín school, where he was taught by teachers trained in the principles of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]]. This event awakened in the young Benito a critical spirit, his love for history and his passion for the visual arts and literature. In 1862, after having completed his secondary studies, he travelled to [[Tenerife]] in order to obtain his certificate in [[Spanish Baccalaureate|''Bachillerato'']] in Arts. That same year he moved to [[Madrid]] to start his law degree, but he did not complete his studies.

While studying at university, he frequented the [[Ateneo de Madrid|Ateneo]] of Madrid and other intellectual and artists' gatherings. Through them and his walks around the city, he became acquainted with the life in Madrid and witnessed the political and historical events of the time. These experiences are reflected in his journalistic works and first novels: ''The Golden Fountain Café'' (''La Fontana de oro'') (1870) and ''El audaz'' (1871). 

==Career as a writer==

By 1865, he was publishing articles in ''La Nación'' on literature, art, music, and politics and it was clear that he was not going to pursue a legal career. His first attempt at a literary career came in 1867, when a didactic historical verse drama was rejected.<ref name="Berkowitz">Berkowitz</ref> His next venture into the theatre did not take place until 1892.

He had already become enthusiastic about the novels of [[Charles Dickens]] and, in 1868, his translation of ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'' introduced his work to the Spanish public.  The previous year, he had visited Paris and had begun to read the works of [[Balzac]]. In 1870, he was appointed editor of ''La Revista de España'' and began to express his opinions on a wide range of diverse topics such as history, culture, politics, art, music and literature.  Between 1867 and 1868, he wrote what would be his first novel, ''La Fontana de Oro'', a historical work set in the period 1820–1823. With the help of money from his sister-in-law, it was published privately in 1870.  Critical reaction was slow to gain momentum but it was eventually hailed as the beginning of a new phase in Spanish fiction, and was highly praised for its literary quality as well as for its social and moral purpose.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

[[Image:Benito Pérez Galdós 63.jpg|thumb|210px|Pérez Galdós, circa 1863.]]

==''National Episodes''==
He next developed the outline of a major project, the ''[[Episodios Nacionales]]'': a series of historical novels outlining the major events in Spanish history from the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805 to his own times. The ostensible aim of this project was to regenerate Spain through the awakening of a new sense of national identity. The first episode was called ''Trafalgar'' and appeared in 1873. Successive episodes appeared in fits and starts until the forty-sixth and final novel, ''Cánovas'', appeared in 1912. Every so often, Galdós seemed to grow tired of this project and stated that he would not write another episode. However, the public bought them avidly, despite the criticism that was levelled at his other works, and they remained the basis of his contemporary reputation and income. He conducted an enormous amount of research in the writing of these stories because official reports, newspaper accounts and histories were often rigidly partisan. To achieve balance and a wider perspective, Galdós sought out survivors and eyewitnesses to the actual events – such as an old man who had been a cabin boy aboard the ship ''Santísima Trinidad'' at Trafalgar, who became the central figure of that book. Galdós is often critical of the official versions of the events he describes and often ran into problems with the [[Catholic Church]], then a dominant force in Spanish cultural life.

==Other novels==

His other novels were classified into the groups by José Montesinos:<ref name="Montesinos">Montesinos "Galdos"</ref>

# The early works from ''La Fontana de Oro'' up to ''La familia de León Roch'' (1878). The best known of these is probably ''[[Doña Perfecta]]'' (1876), which describes the impact made by the arrival of a young radical on a stiflingly clerical town. In ''[[Marianela (novel)|Marianela]]'' (1878) a young man regains his eyesight after a life of blindness and rejects his best friend Marianela for her ugliness.
# The Novelas españolas contemporáneas, from ''La desheredada'' (1881) to ''Angel Guerra'' (1891), a loosely related series of 22 novels which are the author’s major claim to literary distinction, including his masterpiece ''[[Fortunata y Jacinta]]'' (1886–87). They are bound together by the device of recurring characters, borrowed from Balzac’s ''[[La Comédie humaine]]''. ''[[Fortunata y Jacinta]]'' is almost as long as ''[[War and Peace]]''. It concerns the fortunes of four characters: a young man-about-town, his wife, his lower-class mistress, and her husband. The character of Fortunata is based on a real girl whom Galdós first saw in a tenement building in Madrid, drinking a raw egg – which is the way in which the fictional characters come to meet.
# The later novels of psychological investigation, many of which are in dialogue form.

==Influences and characteristics==

Galdós was an enthusiastic traveller. His novels display a detailed knowledge of not only Madrid but many other cities, towns and villages of Spain – such as Toledo in ''Angel Guerra''. He visited Great Britain on many occasions, his first trip being in 1883.  The descriptions of the various districts and low-life characters that he encountered in Madrid, particularly in ''Fortunata y Jacinta'', are similar to the approaches of Dickens and the French Realist novelists such as Balzac. Galdós also shows a Balzacian interest in technology and crafts, for example the lengthy descriptions of the ropery in ''La desheredada'' or the detailed accounts of how the heroine of ''La de Bringas'' (1884) embroiders her pictures out of hair.

[[Image:Perez galdos.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Portrait of Benito Pérez Galdós]]'', by [[Joaquín Sorolla]], 1894.]]

He was also inspired by [[Émile Zola]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] in which, under the influence of the deterministic philosophy of [[Hippolyte Taine]], writers strove to show how their characters were forged by the interaction of heredity, environment and social conditions –  race, milieu, et moment. In addition, these writers were keen to suggest that their works were scientific dissections of society. This set of influences is, perhaps, at its clearest in ''Lo prohibido'' (1884–85),<ref name="Montesinos edition p. 21">Montesinos intro to Lo prohibido p. 21</ref> which is also noteworthy for being told in the first person by an unreliable narrator who, in addition, dies during the course of the work – it pre-dates similar experiments by [[André Gide]] such as ''[[The Immoralist|L'immoraliste]]''.

Another influence came from the philosophy of [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]], which became influential in Spain mainly due to the influence of the famous educationalist [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]]. The clearest example of this influence on Galdós is in his novel ''El Amigo Manso'' (1882). However, it is also clear that the mystical tendencies of ''krausismo'' led to his interest in insanity and the strange wisdom that can sometimes be shown by those people who appear to be mad. This becomes a theme of great importance in the works of Galdós from ''Fortunata y Jacinta'' onwards, for example in [[Miau]] (1888) and his final novel ''La razón de la sinrazón''.

All through his literary career, Galdós incurred the wrath of the Catholic press. He attacked what he saw as abuses of entrenched and dogmatic religious power rather than religious faith or Christianity per se. In fact, the need for faith is a very important feature in many of his novels and there are many sympathetic portraits of priests and nuns.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

==Return to the theatre==
[[File:Benito Pérez Galdós, de Franzen, Blanco y Negro, 09-02-1901.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Portrayed in his studio, by [[Christian Franzen (photographer)|Franzen]], 1901]]
His first mature play was ''Realidad'', an adaptation of his novel of the same name, which had been written in dialogue. Galdós was attracted to the idea of making direct contact with his public and seeing and hearing their reactions.  Rehearsals began in February 1892. The theatre was packed on the opening night and received the play enthusiastically. Galdós took about 15 curtain calls. However, although the audience reception was good, the play did not receive universal critical acclaim because of its realistic dialogue which did not accord with the general theatrical language of the time, the setting of a scene in the boudoir of a courtesan, and the un-Spanish attitude towards a wife’s adultery. The Catholic press did not attend the performance but this did not prevent them from denouncing the author as a perverse and wicked influence. The play ran for twenty nights.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

In 1901, his play ''Electra'' caused a storm of outrage and floods of equally hyperbolic enthusiasm. As in many of his works, Galdós targeted clericalism and the inhuman fanaticism and superstition that can accompany it. The performance was interrupted by audience reaction and the author had to take many curtain calls. After the third night, the conservative and clerical parties organised a demonstration outside the theatre. The police moved in and arrested two members of a workers’ organization who had reacted against the demonstration. Several people were wounded as a result of the clash and, the next day, the newspapers were divided between liberal support for the play and Catholic/conservative condemnation.  Over one hundred performances were given in Madrid alone and the play was also performed in the provinces. In 1934, 33 years later, a revival in Madrid produced much the same degree of uproar and outrage.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

==Later life and political involvement==

Despite his attacks on the forces of conservatism, Galdós had shown only a weak interest in being directly involved in politics. In 1886 the Prime Minister [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]] appointed him as the (absent) deputy for the town and district of [[Guayama]], [[Puerto Rico]] at the [[Cortes Generales|Madrid parliament]]; he never visited the place, but had a representative inform him of the status of the area and felt a duty to represent its inhabitants appropriately. This appointment lasted for five years and mainly seems to have given him the chance to observe the conduct of politics at first hand, which informs scenes in some of his novels. 
 
By 1907, however, there was no sign of national regeneration and the government of the day was making no attempt to control or limit the powers of the Catholic Church. At the age of 64, he re-entered the political arena as a Republican deputy. He seems to have undertaken the task of uniting the anti-monarchic groups, which included Democrats, Republicans, liberals and socialists. He even approached the Marxist leader [[Pablo Iglesias Posse|Pablo Iglesias]] and persuaded him to join a new organisation called ''La Conjunción Republicano-socialista'', with Galdós as its titular head.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

[[Image:Ramon Casas - MNAC- Benito Pérez Galdós- 004760-D 005920.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by [[Ramon Casas i Carbó]].]]

However, by 1912, Galdós was growing disillusioned with the way that the personal ambitions of his fellow Republicans conflicted with achieving genuine political change and it was becoming clear that the coalition of anti-monarchic groups was unable to exercise any great influence over developments. He began to fade from the scene of active political involvement. In 1914, he was the Republican candidate for Las Palmas, but this was more of a local tribute to him. In 1918, he joined in a protest with [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and Mariano de Cavia against the encroaching censorship and authoritarianism coming from the putatively constitutional monarch.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berkowitz |first1=H. Chonon |title=Unamuno's Relations with Galdós |journal=Hispanic Review |date=October 1940 |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=330|doi=10.2307/469762 |jstor=469762 }}</ref> He had been blind since 1912, was in financial difficulties and increasingly troubled by illness.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for five years, 1912–16, which would both have increased his prestige outside Spain and improved his financial status, but neither was successful.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7114 "Benito Pérez Galdós"], Nomination Database, Nobelprize.org.</ref> Among those who nominated Pérez Galdós was the 1904 winner [[José Echegaray]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=2673 "José Echegaray y Eizaguirre"], Nomination Database, Nobelprize.org.</ref> A national subscription scheme was set up to raise money to help Pérez Galdós, to which the King and his Prime Minister [[Álvaro Figueroa y Torres Mendieta|Romanones]] were the first to subscribe. The activities of the Catholic press, which sneered at the writer as a blind beggar, along with the outbreak of [[World War I]], led to the scheme being closed in 1916 with the money raised being less than half what would be required to clear his debts and set up a pension.  In that same year, however, the Ministry of Public Instruction appointed him to take charge of the arrangements for the Cervantes tercentenary, for a stipend of 1000 pesetas per month.  Although the event never took place, the stipend continued for the rest of Galdós’s life.<ref name="Berkowitz" />

In 1897, Pérez Galdós had been elected to the [[Real Academia Española]] (Royal Spanish Academy). After becoming blind he continued to dictate his books for the rest of his life. Pérez Galdós died at the age of 76. Shortly before his death, [[Monument to Galdós (Madrid)|a statue in his honour]] was unveiled in the [[Parque del Buen Retiro]], the most popular park in Madrid, financed solely by public donations.

==Film adaptations==

His novels have yielded many cinematic adaptations: ''Beauty in Chains'' (''Doña Perfecta'') was directed by [[Elsie Jane Wilson]] in 1918; ''[[Viridiana]]'' (1961), by [[Luis Buñuel]], is based upon ''Halma''; Buñuel also adapted ''[[Nazarín]]'' (1959) and ''[[Tristana (film)|Tristana]]'' (1970); ''[[The Doubt|La Duda]]'' was filmed in 1972 by [[Rafael Gil]]; ''[[The Grandfather (1998 film)|El Abuelo]]'' (1998) (''The Grandfather''), by [[José Luis Garci]], was internationally released a year later; it previously had been adapted as the Argentine film, ''[[The Grandfather (1954 film)|El Abuelo]]'' (1954). In 2018, Sri Lankan director, Bennett Rathnayke directed the film ''[[Nela (film)|Nela]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarasaviya.lk/2018/02/15/?fn=sa18021525 |title=Bennett brought Nela to silver screen |publisher=Sarasaviya |access-date=17 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217193207/http://www.sarasaviya.lk/2018/02/15/?fn=sa18021525 |archive-date=17 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Pérez Galdós' House-Museum ==
The Pérez Galdós' House-Museum (''Casa-Museo Pérez Galdós'' in Spanish) is located in the Triana neighbourhood, in the centre of [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. The house (the place where Galdós was born) was acquired and created in 1954 by the Cabildo de Gran Canaria and inaugurated on 9 July 1960 by María Pérez Galdós Cobián, the writer's daughter.

In the House-Museum visitors can see the house where the writer grew up, as well as a display of documents (letters, manuscripts...), furniture, musical instruments, paintings and photos that belonged to both the writer and his family.

The aim of the House-Museum is the conservation, study and dissemination of the legacy of Benito Pérez Galdós. For this matter, the management of the House-Museum has organised eleven international congresses, countless conferences and exhibitions, school visits, and has developed a publishing line with several collections of its own.

The House-Museum also has its own library with numerous works by Galdós in different languages, as well as the author's complete collection in ePub format (only in Spanish) and a virtual tour, among others.
