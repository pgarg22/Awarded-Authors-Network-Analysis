'''Babette Deutsch''' (September 22, 1895 – November 13, 1982) was an American [[poet]], [[critic]], [[translation|translator]], and [[novelist]].

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], the daughter of Michael and Melanie (Fisher) Deutsch, she matriculated from the Ethical Culture School and [[Barnard College]], graduating in 1917 with a B.A. She published poems in magazines such as the ''[[North American Review]]'' and the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' while she was still a student at Barnard.

On April 29, 1921, Deutsch married [[Avrahm Yarmolinsky]], chief of the Slavonic Division of The New York Public Library (1918–1955), also a writer and translator. They had two sons, [[Adam Yarmolinsky|Adam]] and Michael.

During the 1940s, 1950s and into the 1960s, Deutsch was teaching at [[Columbia University]], where her students included poet/publisher [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]. In 1946, she received an honorary D. Litt. from Columbia University.

She translated [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin's]] [[Eugene Onegin]] into English and also made some of the best English versions of Boris Pasternak's poems. Deutsch's own poems displayed what poet [[Marianne Moore]] called "her commanding stature as a poet."<ref>Poetry Handbook: A Dictionary of Terms. Funk and Wagnalls, NYC, 1969, notes in the 3rd edition.</ref>
