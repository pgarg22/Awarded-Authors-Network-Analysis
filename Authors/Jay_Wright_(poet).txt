'''Jay Wright''' (born May 25, 1935<ref>[http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/jay-wright Jay Wright] at poets.org.</ref>) is an [[African-American]] [[poet]], [[playwright]], and [[essayist]]. Born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],<ref name="poets.org">{{Cite web|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|title=About Jay Wright {{!}} Academy of American Poets|url=https://poets.org/poet/jay-wright|access-date=2021-02-08|website=poets.org}}</ref> he lives in [[Bradford, Vermont]]. Although his work is not as widely known as other American poets of his generation, it has received considerable critical acclaim, with some comparing Wright's poetry to the work of [[Walt Whitman]], [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] and [[Hart Crane]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2021-02-07|title=Jay Wright|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/jay-wright|access-date=2021-02-08|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref> Others associate Wright with the African-American poets [[Robert Hayden]] and [[Melvin B. Tolson]], due to his complexity of theme and language, as well as his work's utilization and transformation of the Western literary heritage.<ref>Bader, Philip. ''African-American Writers''. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2011.</ref> Wright's work is representative of what the Guyanese-British writer [[Wilson Harris]] has termed the "cross-cultural imagination," inasmuch as it incorporates elements of African, European, Native American and Latin American cultures.<ref name=":0" /> Following his receiving the [[Bollingen Prize in Poetry]] in 2005, Wright is recognized as one of the principal contributors to poetry in the early 21st century. Dante Micheaux has called Wright "unequivocally, the greatest living American poet."<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Different Center [by Dante Micheaux]|url=https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2010/09/a-different-center-by-dante-micheaux.html|access-date=2021-02-10|website=The Best American Poetry}}</ref>
 
== Life and education ==
Wright's family origins are emblematic of the multi-cultural nature of his literary work. His mother, Leona Dailey, was born in Virginia and had both African and Native American ancestry, while his father, George Murphy, or Mercer Murphy Wright, as he was also known, claimed African, Cherokee and Irish roots. Murphy held diverse blue-collar jobs, which included working construction, driving a jitney, and working as a handyman. However, Wright grew up in foster care in Albuquerque, and moved to San Pedro, California in his teens to live with his father.<ref name=":0">Vera M. Kutzinski, “Jay Wright”, in Andrews, William L., Frances Smith Foster, and Trudier Harris, eds. ''The concise Oxford companion to African American literature''. Oxford University Press, 2001: 446–447.</ref>

When he was in high school, Wright began to play bass,<ref name=":0" /> and when Neil Arditi met him in the late Nineties, Wright was still performing as a jazz bassist.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Dimensions of Jay Wright: An Appreciation : Parnassus Poetry|url=http://parnassusreview.com/archives/649|access-date=2021-02-09|language=en}}</ref> Jazz music informs Wright's work and aesthetic in various ways,<ref name=":7" /> in poems such as "Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting", "Billie's Blues", and "Twenty-Two Tremblings of the Postulant".<ref name=":8" /> The poet's experience as a jazz bassist is referenced in the poem "[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42741/the-end-of-an-ethnic-dream The End of an Ethnic Dream]": "Cigarettes in my mouth / to puncture blisters in my brain. / My bass a fine piece of furniture. / My fingers soft, too soft to rattle / rafters in second-rate halls."<ref name=":8" />

As a young man, Wright played minor-league baseball, appearing in 76 games over two seasons (1953–1954) with the Mexicali Eagles of the Arizona-Texas League and the Fresno Cardinals of the California League.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=wright001jay "Jay Wright"], ''Baseball Reference''.</ref> In 1954, Wright abandoned his baseball career to serve in the U.S. Army medical corps in Germany until 1957; in this period he was able to travel in many countries in Europe.<ref name=":0" />

Upon returning from Europe, Wright studied comparative literature at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Rutgers University]].<ref name="poets.org" /> He received his BA from Berkeley in 1961, and his MA from Rutgers in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jay Wright|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-1986/jay-wright|access-date=2021-02-10|website=www.macfound.org|language=en}}</ref> In 1964, he taught English and medieval history for a year at the Butler Institute in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico.<ref name=":0" /> After this experience, he returned to Rutgers to finish his MA and begin work on a PhD, but left before completing his doctoral degree.<ref name=":0" />

As a student at Rutgers, Wright lived in Harlem, where he met African-American writers associated with the [[Black Arts Movement]] (BAM), such as [[Larry Neal]], [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones]], and [[Henry Dumas]].<ref name=":0" /> Wright would later write the introduction Dumas' posthumously published collection of poetry, ''Play Ebony, Play Ivory: Poetry''.<ref>Wright, Jay. "Introduction", in Dumas, Henry. ''Play Ebony: Play Ivory''. Random House, 1974: xvii–xxiii.</ref> Wright has been described as a member of the Black Arts Movement,<ref>Smethurst, James. "The Black Arts Movement and Historically Black Colleges and Universities" in Nelson, Alondra, et al. ''New thoughts on the Black arts movement''. Rutgers University Press, 2006.</ref> although in a monograph dedicated to the movement, only Wright's first book, ''The Homecoming Singer'', is discussed in connection with the group.<ref>Smethurst, James Edward. ''The Black arts movement: Literary nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s''. University of North Carolina Press, 2005.</ref> Indeed, Wright's poem "Idiotic and Politic", from ''The Homecoming Singer'', has been read as "a virtual declaration of independence from BAM," addressed directly to LeRoi Jones (later Amiri Baraka), the founder of the Black Arts Movement.<ref name=":3" />

Over the years Wright has been poet in residence at [[Yale University]] as well as the [[University of Dundee]] and historically black colleges and universities such as [[Talladega College]], [[Tougaloo College]], [[Texas Southern University]].

== Poetry ==
Wright's first publication was a 22-page chapbook entitled ''Death as History'', which contained 15 poems, published in 1967 by Poets Press. Although this collection has never been republished, some of the poems were included in Wright's first full-length book, ''The'' ''Homecoming Singer''.<ref name=":1">Barrax, Gerald. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/293093 “The Early Poetry of Jay Wright”], ''Callaloo'', no. 19, 1983, pp. 85–102. ''JSTOR''. Retrieved February 8, 2021.</ref> Wright himself has disowned the book in print, saying that it was not intended as a unified work, but merely as "a group of poems selected from those [he] had on hand". At the time the book was published, Wright was employed on a tour of black schools in the South for the [[Woodrow Wilson]]-[[National Endowment for the Arts|National Endowment of the Arts]] program, and [[Carolyn Kizer]] thought he ought to have a book of poems; therefore, she helped him publish the book with [[Diane di Prima|Diane DiPrima]] of Poets Press.<ref name=":4">Rowell, Charles H. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930927 "‘The Unraveling of The Egg’ an Interview With Jay Wright"], ''Callaloo'', no. 19, 1983, pp. 3–15. ''JSTOR''. Retrieved February 8, 2021.</ref> In the poems that were not republished in ''The'' ''Homecoming Singer'', the language, imagery and sensibility have been described as romantic and conventional in nature. In other poems from this collection, however, the tone, style and subject matter are not dissimilar to those found in poems published many years later as regards their concern for religious experience and the exploration of African myth and religion.<ref name=":1" />

In 1971, Wright's first full-length collection of poetry, ''The Homecoming Singer'', was published by Corinth Press. This book included poems such as "[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42735/the-homecoming-singer The Homecoming Singer]', "[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42741/the-end-of-an-ethnic-dream The End of an Ethnic Dream]," and "[https://www.loc.gov/item/91740936/ An Invitation to Madison County]." In this book, Wright "attempts to bridge past and present and meditates on feelings of exclusion from society or personal identity using geographical settings as backdrops for the autobiographical persona’s spiritual, emotional, and intellectual growth."<ref name=":2" /> The poem that opens the volume, "Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting," has a narrator who is mostly detached from the scene described in the poem and then becomes ironically part of "the uncertain, inconclusive encounter between man and God in a Black church.".<ref name=":1" /> The poem suggests an ambiguous, questioning attitude towards traditional religion that is revealed in the congregants' Africanization of Christianity: "They have closed their night / with what certainty they could, / unwilling to change their freedom for a god."<ref name=":7">Welburn, Ron. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/468066 "Jay Wright's Poetics: An Appreciation"], ''MELUS'', vol. 18, no. 3, 1993, pp. 51–70. ''JSTOR''. Retrieved February 8, 2021.</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":8">Transfigurations: Collected Poems. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press. 2000.</ref> Critical reception of ''The Homecoming Singe''r was positive, and Wright was immediately recognized as a major voice.<ref name=":2" /> [[The New York Times]] hailed it as "a tense and memorable collection," in which Wright "is making his way among troubled alternatives," in search of an independent black voice.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kalstone|first=David|date=1972-07-30|title=The Homecoming Singer By Jay Wright.

While some critics argue for a change of direction in Wright's work after ''Death as History'' and ''The'' ''Homecoming Singer'' (and some parts of ''Soothsayers and Omens''),<ref name=":5">Pinckney, Darryl. “You’re in the Army Now.” ''Bloom’s Modern Critical Views'': ''Jay Wright'' (2004): 27-35. Originally published in ''Parnassus: Poetry in Review 9'', no.1 (Spring/Summer 1981).</ref><ref name=":6">Shaw, Robert B. [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=152&issue=1&page=49 "Short Review: Selected Poems of Jay Wright"], ''Poetry'', no. 1, April 1988, pp. 45–47. Retrieved February 8, 2021.</ref> others find instead continuity and unity in the poet's work.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> [[Darryl Pinckney]] has claimed that Wright's earlier poetry is more closely aligned with ‘the rebellious mood of the Sixties,’ referring in particular to the poems "Death as History" and "A Plea for the Politic Man".<ref name=":5" /> In his review of the volume ''Selected Poems of Jay Wright'', [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-b-shaw Robert B. Shaw] also contrasts the earlier volumes with the poet's later work, saying that one may "accept (and enjoy)" the earlier poems "with fewer questions", in contrast to the esoteric difficulty and rigor of the later poems.<ref name=":6" /> Charles H. Rowell associates the poems in ''The Homecoming Singer'' and in the second section of ''Soothsayers and Omens'' with confessional poetry in its focus on personal, autobiographical experience in contrast to the later poetry, which he characterizes as less immediately personal and grounded more in books and scholarship than in lived experience.<ref name=":4" />

However, in discussing Wright's first five volumes of poetry, from ''Death as History'' to ''The Double Invention of Komo'', [[Gerald Barrax]] saw a thematic and technical unity, describing these books as "so remarkably unified and consistent in subject, theme, tone, and technique that they might all constitute a single work."<ref name=":1" /> Indeed, Wright himself has suggested that his books up to ''Explications/Interpretations'' (excluding the disowned chapbook ''Death as History'') constitute a unified, ordered series, “a dramatic process, with all its tensions and resolutions.”<ref name=":4" /> Furthermore, the back cover copy of 2007's ''The Guide Signs: Book One and Book Two'' claims that that volume, together with the eight volumes brought together in ''Transfigurations: Collected Poems'', should be read as a single work.<ref>Wright, Jay.
