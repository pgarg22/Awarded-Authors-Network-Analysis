'''Emma Tatham''' (31 October 1829 – 4 September 1855) was a 19th-century English poet. Her work is seldom read today, but she was regarded in the [[Victorian era]] as a prodigy and a poetic genius.<ref>Walker, Edward Dwight. ''Reincarnation: A Study of Forgotten Truth'', 1888, p. 157.</ref>

==Life==
Tatham was born near [[Gray's Inn]], London, to George and Ann Tatham, and educated at Miss Jolly's school in [[Great Ormond Street]] up to the age of 16. Her older sister had died before she was born. Her biographer, a [[Methodist]] minister and family friend, states (pp.&nbsp;3 and 7) that her father's family came from [[West Witton]], North Yorkshire, and kept an upholstery shop in [[Holborn]]. Her mother came from [[Kent]].<ref name="Gregory" >Benjamin Gregory: ''Memoir of Emma Tatham... with "the Angel's Spell" and other pieces not published during her lifetime'' (London, Hamilton, 1859). A transcript of the legend on her gravestone appears on p. 124.</ref>

The family moved to 7 Addington Square, [[Margate]] in 1847, largely for the sake of Emma's health (p.&nbsp;35). She began to write poetry early, and from the age of 16 to 18, she rapidly wrote an abundance of poems. A collection of these appeared in 1854 as ''The Dream of Pythagoras and Other Poems'' and was reprinted at least three times.<ref name="Gregory" /> Thereafter some critics compared her to [[Mary Shelley]].

==Praise from Arnold==
[[Matthew Arnold]] wrote in praise of her. He compared her with the French poet [[Eugénie de Guérin]],<ref>Matthew Arnold: ''Lectures and Essays in Criticism'', ed. R. H. Super, University of Michigan Press, 1962.</ref> and remarked elsewhere that "she had a sincere vein of poetical feeling, a genuine aptitude for composition."<ref>Arnold, Matthew. ''Essays in Criticism: First Series'', 1903, p. 155.</ref> As she was then a Protestant who resided in [[Margate]], she was further described by Arnold as a "fervid Christian".

A book of verse dedicated to Tatham was published in 1857 as ''Etchings and Pearls; or, a Flower Planted on the Grave of Emma Tatham'', by Mrs. J. Cooke Westbrook. A biography of her by the Methodist minister Benjamin Gregory (1820–1900) appeared after her death.<ref>University of Manchester Library [http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/guide-to-special-collections/methodist/using-the-collections/biographicalindex/galland-gwyther/header-title-max-32-words-365828-en.htm Retrieved 20 June 2016.]</ref><ref name="Gregory" /><ref>''The Dream of Pythagoras and Other Poems''.

Emma Tatham died in 1855 while on a visit to [[Redbourn]], [[Hertfordshire]], and was buried there in the graveyard of the Independent Chapel.<ref name="Gregory" />
