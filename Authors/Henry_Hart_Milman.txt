[[File:Henry Hart Milman by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|Henry Hart Milman, by [[George Frederic Watts]], circa 1863]]
'''Henry Hart Milman''' (10 February 1791&nbsp;– 24 September 1868<ref>1911 Encyclopædia Britannica has it as 10 November but the son's history of the father asserts that it was 10 February.</ref>) was an [[England|English]] [[historian]] and ecclesiastic.

==Life==
He was born in [[London]], the third son of [[Sir Francis Milman, 1st Baronet]], physician to King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] (see [[Milman Baronets]]). Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], his university career was brilliant. He won the [[Newdigate prize]] with a poem on the ''Apollo Belvidere'' in 1812, was elected a fellow of Brasenose in 1814, and in 1816 won the English essay prize with his ''Comparative Estimate of Sculpture and Painting''. In 1816 he was ordained, and two years later became parish priest of [[Reading Minster|St Mary's, Reading]].

In 1821 Milman was elected [[professor of poetry at Oxford]]; and in 1827 he delivered the [[Bampton lectures]] on [https://archive.org/details/cu31924029180888 ''The character and conduct of the Apostles considered as an evidence of Christianity'']. In 1835, [[Sir Robert Peel]] made him Rector of St Margaret's, [[Westminster]], and Canon of Westminster, and in 1849 he became [[Dean of St Paul's]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1864.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Crypt Chapel, St. Paul's Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Milman's original tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral]] 
Milman was buried in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], where his grave was marked by an elaborate tomb.<ref>"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral" [[William Sinclair (Archdeacon of London)|Sinclair, W.]] p. 465: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909.</ref> When the Chapel of the [[Order of the British Empire]] was created, the original tomb was replaced by a slab in the floor.

==Works==
Milman made his appearance as a dramatist with his [[tragedy]] ''Fazio'' (produced on the stage under the title of ''The Italian Wife''). He also wrote ''Samor, the Lord of The Bright City'', the subject of which was taken from British legend, the "bright city" being [[Gloucester]]. In subsequent poetical works he was more successful, notably the ''Fall of Jerusalem'' (1820) and ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' (1822, based on the life of [[Saint Margaret the Virgin]]), which was used as the basis for an oratorio by [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The influence of [[Lord Byron|Byron]] is seen in his ''Belshazzar'' (1822). Another tragedy, ''[[Anne Boleyn]]'', followed in 1826.  Milman also wrote "When our-heads are bowed with woe," and other [[hymn]]s; a version of the [[Sanskrit]] episode of ''Nala and Damayanti'';<ref>Available online at [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529 Project Gutenberg]</ref> and translations of the ''Agamemnon'' of [[Aeschylus]] and the ''Bacchae'' of [[Euripides]]. His poetical works were published in three volumes in 1839.

Turning to another field, Milman published in 1829 his ''History of the Jews'', which is memorable as the first by an English clergyman which treated the Jews as an Oriental tribe, recognized [[sheikh]]s and amirs in the [[Old Testament]], sifted and classified documentary evidence, and evaded or minimized the miraculous. In consequence, the author was attacked and his preferment was delayed. His ''History of Christianity to the Abolition of Paganism in the Roman Empire''<ref>Milman, H. Hart. (1840). ''The history of Christianity from the birth of Christ to the abolition of paganism in the Roman empire.'' New and rev. ed. London: John Murray, vol. 1; vol. 2; vol. 3</ref> (1840) had been completely ignored; but the continuation of his major work, the ''History of Latin Christianity''<ref>Available online at [https://archive.org/details/latinchristianit01milmuoft Internet Archive]</ref> (1855), which has passed through many editions, was well received. In 1838 he had edited [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'',<ref>Available online at [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25717 Project Gutenberg]</ref> and in the following year published his ''Life of Gibbon''.

Milman was also responsible for an edition of [[Horace]], and when he died he had almost finished a history of St Paul's Cathedral, which was completed and published by his son, A. Milman (London, 1868), who also collected and published in 1879 a volume of his essays and articles.

Milman wrote the hymn, ''[[Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!]]'', often sung on [[Palm Sunday]].<ref>http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/r/i/rideride.htm {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref>

==Family==
By his wife, Mary Ann Cockell, a daughter of Lieut.-General William Cockell, Milman had four sons and two daughters. Among the sons were [[William Milman]] (1824–1908), Arthur Milman, who wrote a biography about his father, and Sir Archibald Milman (1834–1902), Clerk of the House of Commons. His nephew, [[Robert Milman]] (1816–1876), was [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Bishop of Calcutta]] from 1867 until his death, and was the author of a ''Life of [[Torquato Tasso]]'' (1850).
