His father died when he was a child. {{clarify|date=June 2020}} To overcome the depression that Rama faced, his mother Lakṣamma took him to Vijayanagar where he became an advisor to Sri Krishnadevaraya and the 8th scholar in his court. He was a great scholar and poet of Telugu language. Tenali ramakrishna was also a minister of the court.

== Life of Ramakrishna ==
Tenali Rama was born in a Telugu speaking [[Niyogi]] Hindu Brahmin family<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-W8AgAAQBAJ&q=tenali+ramakrishna |title=Tenali sharan krishna |author=T.SUNANDAMMA |date= 2014-01-06|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> as Garlapati Ramakrishna, in a village called Thumuluru or [[Tenali]] (currently a part of Tenali Maṇḍalam) during the late part of the sixteenth century. His father was Garlapathi Rama, who served as a priest in the [[Ramalingeswara Swami Temple|Ramalingesvara Swami temple]] in Santharavuru.

Rama died when Ramakrishna was young. His mother Lakṣamma returned to her native place in Tenāli to live with her brother. Ramakrishna grew up in his uncle's town and so came to be known as Tenali Ramakrishna.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-W8AgAAQBAJ&q=tenali+ramakrishna&pg=PP3 |title=Tenali Ramakrishna |author=T.SUNANDAMMA |page=3 |date= 2014-01-06|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref>

Tenali Rama did not receive any formal education during his childhood, but became a great scholar, due to his thirst for knowledge. As per a well-known tale, the [[Vaishnava]] (devotees of [[Vishnu]]) scholars rejected to accept him as a disciple, as he was a Śaiva. Rāmakr̥ṣṇa was still determined to get educated so he went to many paṇḍits and begged them humbly to accept him as his disciple but they called him names and threw him out. After that day he thought he will never beg anyone for his education. Next day Rāmakr̥ṣṇa went out to secure education but he did not approach any teacher. The village school wall was his teacher! Everyday he would stand by the wall and attentively listen to the lessons taught in the classroom and go back home and recite what he learned to his mother. This became his daily practice. But one unfortunate day Rāmakr̥ṣṇa got caught and was accused of being a thief so he narrated his story to the school teacher. After listening to Rāmakr̥ṣṇa's story the teacher felt proud but he could do nothing about it because of the stringent norms of the school administration so he was sent away. Later while roaming aimlessly, he met a sage, who advised him to worship the Goddess [[Kali]]. He worshipped and invoked the Goddess with his devotion. Legends say that Maa Kali appeared before him and admired his sense of humor and blessed him that one day, he would be acclaimed as a great poet in the court of King [[Krishnadevaraya]] of Vijayanagara.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691633688/the-king-and-the-clown-in-south-indian-myth-and-poetry|title=The King and the Clown in South Indian Myth and Poetry|date=2016-04-19|isbn=978-0-691-63368-8|language=en}}</ref> The Goddess also gave him the title "Vikaṭakavi", impressed by his wit and humour. His wife was Sharda and son was Bhaskaraisharma.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tenali Rama|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7401524/|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

== King's court ==
Ramakrishna held an important position in King Krishnadevaraya's court. He was one of the Ashtadiggajas appointed by the King.

=== Later years ===
One year before the death of King Krishnadevaraya, in 1528 Tenali Ramakrishna  died from a huge [[snakebite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yousigma.com/biographies/tenaliramakrishna.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112738/http://yousigma.com/biographies/tenaliramakrishna.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}</ref> The records also state that Ramakrishna was instrumental in protecting the King Krishnadevaraya many times, coming to his rescue in critical situations, and he was his best friend.

== Literary works ==
Tenali Rama was noted for his brilliance and wit.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8178060671|title=Tales of Tenali Rama|publisher=Unicorn Books|author=Jyotsna Atre|isbn=978-8178060675|date=September 2007}}</ref> Tenali Ramakrishna's great work ''Panduranga Mahatmyam''  is a [[Kāvya]] of high merit, remarkable for its sonorous dignity of phrasing, and is counted as one of the Pañcha Mahā Kāvyas (the Five Great Kavyas) of Telugu literature.{{sfn|Rao|1989|p=38}} It contains a legendary account of a shrine of [[Vishnu]] as [[Vithoba|Panduranga]], at [[Pandharpur]] consecrated by the ministration of Saint Pundarika. A [[brahmin]] named Nigama Sharma, who wasted his life in dissipation and debauchery, breathed his last in Pandharpur. A controversy ensures between servants of [[Yama]] and servants of Vishnu. The former were anxious to carry him to hell as he lived a wicked life and the latter claimed him for heaven, as he died in that sacred place. Indeed, the verdict is in favour of the servants of Vishnu{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=38}}
Tenali took the theme for ''Panduranga Mahatmyam'' from the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' and enhanced it with many stories about the devotees of Panduranga. An imaginary character named 'Nigama Sarma Akka' was created by Tenali Ramakrishna and he built a story around her without giving her a name. He also composed many extempore poems called 'Chatuvu'.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8178060671|title=Tales of Tenali Rama|publisher=Unicorn Books|author=Jyotsna Atre}}</ref>

Tenali Ramakrishna attained the status of a folk hero when he was the court poet of Krishnadevaraya, but at the same time, he composed serious works on religion. Three of his narrative poems are available today. His first poem, Udbhataradhya Charitamu about the [[Shaiva]] teacher Udbhata which is based on Palakuriki Somanatha's ''Basava Puranam''. ''Udbhataradhya Charitamu'' also deals with the sanctity of [[Varanasi]]. Because of Tenali Ramakrishna's affinity towards Shaivite religion, he was also known as Tenali Ramalinga Kavi.<ref name="google1" /><ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPdHAAAAMAAJ&q=Udbhataradhya|title=Studies in the history of Telugu journalism|publisher=Andhra Pradesh Book Distributors, Secunderabad, 1968|author=Nārla Veṅkaṭēśvararāvu
|year=1968}}</ref> However, he had great devotion for [[Vaishnavism]] as well which is reflected in his work ''Panduranga Mahatyam''.

Tenali Rama was called a Vikata Kavi <ref name="siruvarmalar.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.siruvarmalar.com/thenali-raman-stories-list |title=தெனாலி ராமன் கதைகள் (Thenali Raman Stories in Tamil) - சிறுவர் மலர் |website=Siruvarmalar.com |access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> (a palindrome in Telugu script) means clown-jester-poet. He was also entitled by "Kumara Bharathi", for his works.
