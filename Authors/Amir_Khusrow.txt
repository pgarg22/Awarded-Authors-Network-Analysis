'''Abu'l Hasan Yamīn ud-Dīn Khusrau''' (1253–1325 AD), better known as '''Amīr Khusrau'''  was an [[Indo-Persian culture|Indo-Persian]]{{sfn|Sharma|2017}} [[Sufi]] singer, musician, poet and scholar who lived under the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. He is an iconic figure in the cultural history of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was a [[mysticism|mystic]] and a spiritual disciple of [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] of [[Delhi]], India. He wrote poetry primarily in [[Persian language|Persian]], but also in [[Hindustani language|Hindavi]]. A vocabulary in verse, the ''Ḳhāliq Bārī'', containing Arabic, Persian and [[Hindustani language|Hindavi]] terms is often attributed to him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|work=The Hindu|access-date=5 August 2012|location=Chennai, India|date=23 July 2012}}</ref> Khusrau is sometimes referred to as the "voice of India" or "Parrot of India" (''Tuti-e-Hind''), and has been called the "father of [[Urdu literature]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Amir-Khosrow|title=Amīr Khosrow &#124; Indian poet|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref><ref>

Khusrau is regarded as the "father of [[qawwali]]" (a devotional form of singing of the Sufis in the Indian subcontinent), and introduced the [[ghazal]] style of song into India, both of which still exist widely in India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite book | last = Latif | first = Syed Abdulla | title = An Outline of the Cultural History of India | publisher = Institute of Indo-Middle East Cultural Studies (reprinted by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers) | orig-year = 1958 | year = 1979 | pages = 334 | isbn = 81-7069-085-4}}</ref><ref>Regula Burckhardt Qureshi, Harold S.

Khusrau was an expert in many styles of Persian poetry which were developed in [[Greater Iran|medieval Persia]], from [[Khaqani|Khāqānī's]] ''[[qasida]]s'' to [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami's]]  ''khamsa''. He used 11 metrical schemes with 35 distinct divisions. He wrote in many verse forms including ghazal, masnavi, qata, rubai, do-baiti and tarkib-band.

[[File:Basawan - Alexander Visits the Sage Plato.jpg|thumb|''[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] Visits the Sage [[Plato]]'', from the ''Khamsa'' of Amir Khusrau]]

==Family background==
Amīr Khusrau was born in 1253 in [[Patiyali]], [[Kasganj district]], in modern-day [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], in what was then the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the son of Amīr Saif ud-Dīn Mahmūd, a man of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] extraction and Bibi Daulat Naz, a native Indian mother.<ref name=Iranica/> Amir Khusrau was a [[Sunni]] Muslim. He grew up in [[Shahrisabz|Kesh]], a small town near [[Samarkand]] in what is now [[Uzbekistan]]. When he was a young man, the region was despoiled and ravaged by [[Genghis Khan]]'s invasion of [[Central Asia]], and much of the population fled to other lands, India being a favored destination. A group of families, including that of Amir Saif ud-Din, left Kesh and travelled to [[Balkh]] (now in northern Afghanistan), which was a relatively safe place; from here, they sent representations to the Sultan of distant [[Delhi]] seeking refuge and succour. This was granted, and the group then travelled to Delhi. Sultan [[Iltutmish|Shams ud-Din Iltutmish]], ruler of Delhi, was himself a Turk like them;{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} indeed, he had grown up in the same region of Central Asia and had undergone somewhat similar circumstances in earlier life.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} This was the reason the group had turned to him in the first place. Iltutmish not only welcomed the refugees to his court but also granted high offices and landed estates to some of them. In 1230, Amir Saif ud-Din was granted a [[fief]] in the district of Patiyali.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Amir Saif ud-Din married Bibi Daulat Naz, the daughter of Rawat Arz, an Indian noble and war minister of [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Ghiyas ud-Din Balban]], the ninth Sultan of Delhi. Daulatnaz's family belonged to the [[Rajput]] community of modern-day Uttar Pradesh.<ref name="Bashiri">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Poets/Dihlavi.html|title=Central Asia and Iran|website=angelfire.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4YSAAAAIAAJ|title=Islamic Culture|first=Muhammad|last=Asad|date=16 February 2018|publisher=Islamic Culture Board|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==Early years==
Amir Saif ud-Din and Bibi Daulatnaz became the parents of four children: three sons (one of whom was Khusrau) and a daughter. Amir Saif ud-Din Mahmud died in 1260, when Khusrau was only eight years old.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|2}} Through his father's influence, he imbibed Islam and Sufism coupled with proficiency in Turkish, Persian, and Arabic languages.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Great Masters of Hindustani Music|last=Misra|first=Susheela|publisher=Hem Publishers Pvt Ltd|year=1981|location=New Delhi}}</ref>{{Rp|2}} He was known by his sobriquet ''Tuti-i Hind'' ("Parrot of India"), which according to the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' "compares the eloquent poet to the sweet-talking parrot, indicates his canonical status as a poet of Persian."{{sfn|Sharma|2017}} Khusrau's love and admiration for his motherland is transparent through his work.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|3}}

Khusrau was an intelligent child. He started learning and writing poetry at the age of nine.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|3}} His first [[Diwan (poetry)|divan]], ''Tuhfat us-Sighr'' (The Gift of Childhood), containing poems composed between the ages of 16 and 18, was compiled in 1271. In 1273, when Khusrau was 20 years old, his grandfather, who was reportedly 113 years old, died.

==Career==
After Khusrau's grandfather's death, Khusrau joined the army of Malik Chajju, a nephew of the reigning Sultan, [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Ghiyas ud-Din Balban]]. This brought his poetry to the attention of the Assembly of the Royal Court where he was honored.

[[Nasiruddin Bughra Khan|Nasir ud-Din Bughra Khan]], the second son of Balban, was invited to listen to Khusrau. He was impressed and became Khusrau's patron in 1276. In 1277 Bughra Khan was then appointed ruler of [[Bengal]], and Khusrau visited him in 1279 while writing his second divan, ''Wast ul-Hayat'' (The Middle of Life). Khusrau then returned to Delhi. Balban's eldest son, Khan Muhammad (who was in [[Multan]]), arrived in Delhi, and when he heard about Khusrau he invited him to his court. Khusrau then accompanied him to Multan in 1281. Multan at the time was the gateway to India and was a center of knowledge and learning. Caravans of scholars, tradesmen and emissaries transited through Multan from [[Baghdad]], [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]] on their way to Delhi. Khusrau wrote that:
{{blockquote|I tied the belt of service on my waist and put on the cap of companionship for another five years. I imparted lustre to the water of Multan from the ocean of my wits and pleasantries.}}

On 9 March 1285, Khan Muhammad was killed in battle while fighting [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] who were invading the Sultanate. Khusrau wrote two elegies in grief of his death. In 1287, Khusrau travelled to [[Awadh]] with another of his patrons, Amir Ali Hatim. At the age of eighty, Balban called his second son Bughra Khan back from Bengal, but Bughra Khan refused. After Balban's death in 1287, his grandson [[Muiz ud din Qaiqabad|Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad]], Bughra Khan's son, was made the Sultan of Delhi at the age of 17. Khusrau remained in Qaiqabad's service for two years, from 1287 to 1288. In 1288 Khusrau finished his first [[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]], ''Qiran us-Sa'dain'' (Meeting of the Two Auspicious Stars), which was about Bughra Khan meeting his son Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad after a long enmity. After Qaiqabad suffered a stroke in 1290, nobles appointed his three-year-old son [[Shamsuddin Kayumars|Shams ud-Din Kayumars]] as Sultan. A Turko-Afghan named [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji|Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji]] then marched on Delhi, killed Qaiqabad and became Sultan, thus ending the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate and starting the [[Khalji dynasty]].

Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji appreciated poetry and invited many poets to his court. Khusrau was honoured and respected in his court and was given the title "Amir". He was given the job of "Mushaf-dar". Court life made Khusrau focus more on his literary works. Khusrau's ghazals which he composed in quick succession were set to music and were sung by singing girls every night before the Sultan. Khusrau writes about Jalal ud-Din Firuz:
{{blockquote|The King of the world Jalal ud-Din, in reward for my infinite pain which I undertook in composing verses, bestowed upon me an unimaginable treasure of wealth.}}

In 1290 Khusrau completed his second masnavi, ''Miftah ul-Futuh'' (Key to the Victories), in praise of Jalal ud-Din Firuz's victories. In 1294 Khusrau completed his third divan, ''Ghurrat ul-Kamaal'' (The Prime of Perfection), which consisted of poems composed between the ages of 34 and 41.

[[File:"Alexander is Lowered Into the Sea".jpg|thumb|''Alexander is Lowered into the Sea'', from a ''Khamsa'' of Amir Khusrau Dihlavi, attributed to Mukanda c. 1597–98, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/140003774?rpp=20&pg=8&ao=on&ft=mughal+empire&pos=145|title=Alexander is Lowered into the Sea|website=metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref> ]]
After Jalal ud-Din Firuz, [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala ud-Din Khalji]] ascended to the throne of Delhi in 1296. Khusrau wrote the ''Khaza'in ul-Futuh'' (The Treasures of Victory) recording Ala ud-Din's construction works, wars and administrative services. He then composed a khamsa (quintet) with five masnavis, known as ''Khamsa-e-Khusrau'' (Khamsa of Khusrau), completing it in 1298. The khamsa emulated that of the earlier poet of Persian epics, [[Nizami Ganjavi]]. The first masnavi in the khamsa was ''Matla ul-Anwar'' (Rising Place of Lights) consisting of 3310 verses (completed in 15 days) with ethical and Sufi themes. The second masnavi, ''Khusrau-Shirin'', consisted of 4000 verses. The third masnavi, ''Laila-Majnun'', was a romance. The fourth voluminous masnavi was ''Aina-e-Sikandari'', which narrated the heroic deeds of [[Alexander the Great]] in 4500 verses. The fifth masnavi was ''[[Hasht-Bihisht (poem)|Hasht-Bihisht]]'', which was based on legends about [[Bahram V]], the fifteenth king of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. All these works made Khusrau a leading luminary in the world of poetry. Ala ud-Din Khalji was highly pleased with his work and rewarded him handsomely. When Ala ud-Din's son and future successor [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji]] was born, Khusrau prepared the horoscope of Mubarak Shah Khalji in which certain predictions were made. This horoscope is included in the masnavi ''Saqiana''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hazratmehboob-e-elahi.org/chapter-IV-1.htm#a|title=Hazrat Mehboob-E-Elahi (RA)|website=hazratmehboob-e-elahi.org}}</ref>

In 1300, when Khusrau was 47 years old, his mother and brother died. He wrote these lines in their honour:
<poem style="margin-left:2em">
A double radiance left my star this year
Gone are my brother and my mother,
My two full moons have set and ceased to shine
In one short week through this ill-luck of mine.
</poem>
Khusrau's homage to his mother on her death was:
{{blockquote|Where ever the dust of your feet is found is like a relic of paradise for me.}}

In 1310 Khusrau became a disciple of [[Sufi]] saint of the [[Chishti Order]], [[Nizamuddin Auliya]].<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|2}} In 1315, Khusrau completed the romantic masnavi ''Duval Rani - Khizr Khan'' ([[Deval Devi|Duval Rani]] and Khizr Khan), about the marriage of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] princess Duval Rani to Khizr Khan, one of Ala ud-Din Khalji's sons.

After Ala ud-Din Khalji's death in 1316, his son Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji became the Sultan of Delhi. Khusrau wrote a masnavi on Mubarak Shah Khalji called ''Nuh Sipihr'' (Nine Skies), which described the events of Mubarak Shah Khalji's reign. He classified his poetry in nine chapters, each part of which is considered a "sky". In the third chapter he wrote a vivid account of India and its environment, seasons, flora and fauna, cultures, scholars, etc. He wrote another book during Mubarak Shah Khalji's reign by name of ''Ijaz-e-Khusravi'' (The Miracles of Khusrau), which consisted of five volumes. In 1317 Khusrau compiled ''Baqia-Naqia'' (Remnants of Purity). In 1319 he wrote ''Afzal ul-Fawaid'' (Greatest of Blessings), a work of prose that contained the teachings of Nizamuddin Auliya.

In 1320 Mubarak Shah Khalji was killed by [[Khusro Khan]], who thus ended the Khalji dynasty and briefly became Sultan of Delhi. Within the same year, Khusro Khan was captured and beheaded by [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq]], who became Sultan and thus began the [[Tughlaq dynasty]]. In 1321 Khusrau began to write a historic masnavi named ''Tughlaq Nama'' (Book of the Tughlaqs) about the reign of Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq and that of other Tughlaq rulers.

Khusrau died in October 1325, six months after the death of Nizamuddin Auliya. Khusrau's tomb is next to that of his spiritual master in the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] in Delhi.<ref>[[Nizamuddin Auliya]]</ref> ''Nihayat ul-Kamaal'' (The Zenith of Perfection) was compiled probably a few weeks before his death.

==Shalimar Bagh Inscription==
A popular fable which has made its way into scholarship ascribes the following famous Persian verse to Khusrau:
<poem style="margin-left:2em">
Agar Firdaus bar ru-ye zamin ast,
Hamin ast o hamin ast o hamin ast.
</poem>
In English: "If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/window-to-persia/article1930559.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Anjana | last=Rajan | title=Window to Persia | date=29 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/zubin-mehta-s-concert-mesmerises-kashmir-113090700518_1.html|title=Zubin Mehta's concert mesmerises Kashmir|newspaper=Business Standard India|date=7 September 2013|via=Business Standard|agency=Press Trust of India}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Zubin-Mehtas-concert-mesmerizes-Kashmir/articleshow/22397384.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Zubin Mehta's concert mesmerizes Kashmir - The Times of India}}</ref>
This verse is  believed to have been inscribed on several [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] structures, supposedly in reference to [[Kashmir]], specifically a particular building at the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Garden]] in Srinagar, Kashmir (built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://srinagar.nic.in/tourist-place/shalimar-garden/|title=Shalimar Garden {{!}} District Srinagar, Government of Jammu and Kashmir {{!}} India|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ0e0kfgttUC&pg=PA44|title=Shahjahanabad: The Sovereign City in Mughal India 1639-1739|first=Stephen P.|last=Blake|date=30 April 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521522991|via=Google Books}}</ref>

However, recent scholarship has traced the verse to a time much later than that of Khusrau and to a place quite distant from Kashmir.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/942273/who-really-wrote-the-lines-if-there-is-paradise-on-earth-it-is-this-it-is-this-it-is-this|title=Who really wrote the lines 'If there is Paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this'?|last=Safvi|first=Rana|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Historian Rana Safvi inspected all probable buildings in the Kashmir garden and found no such inscription attributed to Khusrau. According to her the verse was composed by Sa’adullah Khan, a leading noble and scholar in the court of Jahangir's successor and son Shah Jahan.<ref name=":2" /> Even in popular memory, it was Jahangir who first repeated the phrase in praise of Kashmir <ref name=":1" />

==Contributions to Hindustani Music==

=== Qawwali ===
{{Further|Qawwali}}
Khusrau is credited with fusing the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]], [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[Turkish music|Turkic]], and [[Music of India|Indian]] singing traditions in the late 13th century to create [[qawwali]], a form of [[Sufi]] [[devotional song]].<ref name="'Aaj rang hai'- Qawwali revisited">{{cite web|url = http://twocircles.net/2013mar07/%E2%80%98aaj_rang_hai%E2%80%99_qawwali_revisited.html| title = 'Aaj rang hai' - Qawwali revisited|publisher = TwoCircle.net|access-date = 2013-03-08}}, Retrieved 16 September 2015</ref> A well-punctuated chorus emphasizing the theme and devotional refrain coupled with a lead singer utilizing an ornate style of fast [[Taan (music)|taans]] and difficult [[svara]] combinations are the distinguishing characteristics of a qawwali.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|4}} Khusrau's disciples who specialized in Qawwali singing were later classified as Qawwals (they sang only Muslim devotional songs) and Kalawants (they sang mundane songs in the Qawwali style).<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|4}}

=== Tarana and Trivat ===
{{Further|Tarana}}

[[Tarana]] and Trivat are also credited to Khusrau.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|5}} Musicologist and philosopher [[Jaideva Singh|Jaidev Singh]] has said:
{{Blockquote|text=[Tarana] was entirely an invention of Khusrau. Tarana is a Persian word meaning a song. Tillana is a corrupt form of this word. True, Khusrau had before him the example of Nirgit songs using śuṣk-akṣaras (meaningless words) and pāṭ-akṣaras (mnemonic syllables of the mridang). Such songs were in vogue at least from the time of Bharat. But generally speaking, the Nirgit used hard consonants. Khusrau introduced two innovations in this form of vocal music. Firstly, he introduced mostly Persian words with soft consonants. Secondly, he so arranged these words that they bore some sense. He also introduced a few Hindi words to complete the sense…. It was only Khusrau’s genius that could arrange these words in such a way to yield some meaning. Composers after him could not succeed in doing so, and the tarana became as meaningless as the ancient Nirgit.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Singh, Thakur Jai Deva | chapter=Khusrau’s Musical Compositions | editor=Ansari, Zoe | title=Life, Times & Works of Amir Khusrau Dehlavi | year=1975 | publisher=National Amir Khusrau Society | location=New Delhi | pages=276}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}
It is believed that Khusrau invented the tarana style during his attempt to reproduce Gopal Naik's exposition in raag Kadambak. Khusrau hid and listened to Gopal Naik for six days, and on the seventh day, he reproduced Naik's rendition using meaningless words ([[Mridangam|mridang]] [[Bol (music)|bols]]) thus creating the tarana style.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|5}}

=== Sitar ===
Khusrau is credited for the invention of the sitar. At the time, there were many versions of the [[Veena]] in India. He rechristened the 3 stringed Tritantri Veena as a ''Sehtaar'' (Persian for 3 stringed), which eventually became known as the ''[[sitar]].''<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|6}}
