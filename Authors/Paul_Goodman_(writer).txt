'''Paul Goodman''' (1911–1972) was an American author and [[public intellectual]] best known for his 1960s works of [[social criticism]]. Goodman was prolific across numerous literary genres and non-fiction topics, including the arts, civil rights, decentralization, democracy, education, media, politics, psychology, technology, urban planning, and war. As a [[humanist]] and self-styled [[man of letters]], his works often addressed a common theme of the individual citizen's duties in the larger society, and the responsibility to exercise [[autonomy]], act creatively, and realize one's own [[human nature]].<!--struggle for acceptance/In the broader intellectual community, Goodman was a [[gadfly]] and [[tertium quid]]-->

Born to a Jewish family in [[New York City]], Goodman was raised by his aunts and sister and attended [[City College of New York]]. As an aspiring writer, he wrote and published poems and fiction before receiving his doctorate from the [[University of Chicago]]. He returned to writing in New York City and took sporadic magazine writing and teaching jobs, several of which he lost for his [[coming out|outward]] bisexuality and [[World War II]] [[draft resistance]]. Goodman discovered [[anarchism]] and wrote for [[libertarian (anarchist)|libertarian]] journals. His radicalism was rooted in psychological theory. He co-wrote the theory behind [[Gestalt therapy]] based on [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s radical [[Freudianism]] and held psychoanalytic sessions through the 1950s while continuing to write prolifically.

His 1960 book of social criticism, ''[[Growing Up Absurd]]'', established his importance as a mainstream cultural theorist. Goodman became known as "the philosopher of the [[New Left]]" and his anarchistic disposition was influential in [[1960s counterculture]] and the [[free school movement]]. Despite being the foremost American intellectual of non-Marxist radicalism in his time, his celebrity did not endure far beyond his life. Goodman is remembered for his utopian proposals and principled belief in human potential.

== Life ==

Paul Goodman was born in [[New York City]] on September 9, 1911, to Augusta and Barnette Goodman.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}} His [[Sephardic Jewish]] ancestors had emigrated to New York from Germany<!--{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}}--> a century before [[History of the Jews in New York#The Great Wave|the Eastern European wave]].{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=510}} His grandfather had fought in the [[American Civil War]]{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}} and the family was "relatively prosperous".{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=510}}<!-- middle-class {{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}}--> Goodman's insolvent<!--what happened?--> father abandoned the family prior to his birth, making Paul their fourth and last child, after Alice (1902–1969) and [[Percival Goodman|Percival]] (1904–1989).{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}}{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}} Their mother worked as a women's clothes [[Door-to-door|traveling saleswoman]], which left Goodman to be raised mostly by his aunts and sister in New York City's{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}}<!-- also pampered, precocious {{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=510}}--> [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] with [[petty bourgeois]] values.<!-- in "poverty"?-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=510}} He attended [[Hebrew school]] and the city's public schools, where he excelled and came to identify with [[Manhattan]].{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}} Goodman performed well in literature and languages during his time at [[Townsend Harris Hall High School]] and graduated in 1927. He started at [[City College of New York]] the same year, where he majored in philosophy, was influenced by philosopher [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], and found both lifelong friends and his intellectual [[social circle]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] in 1931, early in the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}}<!-- if needed, Depression mentioned in {{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=510}}-->

As an aspiring writer, Goodman wrote and published<!-- won small prize--> poems, essays, stories, and a play while living with his sister Alice, who supported him.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} He did not keep a regular job,{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}} but read scripts for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=178–179}} and taught drama at a [[Zionist]] youth camp during the summers 1934 through 1936.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}} Unable to afford tuition, Goodman [[academic audit|audited]] graduate classes at [[Columbia University]] and traveled to some classes at [[Harvard University]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}}<!--Harvard and McKeon mentioned in Smith, but better for quote about free education here--> When Columbia philosophy professor [[Richard McKeon]] moved to the [[University of Chicago]], he invited Goodman to attend and lecture.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}} Between 1936 and 1940, Goodman was a [[graduate student]] in literature and philosophy, a [[research assistant]], and part-time instructor. He took his [[preliminary exams]] in 1940,{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}} but was forced out for "nonconformist sexual behavior", a charge that would recur multiple times in his teaching career.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}} By this point of his life, Goodman was married and continued to [[cruising for sex|cruise]] for young men, as an active [[bisexual]].{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}}<!--"active bisexual"{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}}-->

Homesick{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} and absent his doctorate degree, Goodman returned to writing in New York City,{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}} <!-- when did he return? 1939? {{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}}-->where he was affiliated with the literary avant-garde. Goodman worked on his dissertation, though it would take 14 years to publish<!--grant?-->. Unable to find work as a teacher,{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} he reviewed films in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and in the next two years, published his first book of poetry (1941) and novel (''The Grand Piano'', 1942).{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}} He taught at [[Manumit School|Manumit]], a progressive [[boarding school]], in 1943 and 1944, but was let go for "homosexual behavior".{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} ''Partisan Review'' too removed Goodman for his bisexuality and [[draft resistance]] advocacy.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}} (Goodman himself was deferred and rejected from the [[World War II draft]].{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}}) [[World War II]] politicized Goodman from an avant-garde author into a vocal pacifist and decentralist.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=106}} His exploration of [[anarchism]] led him to publish in the libertarian journals of New York's [[Why? Group]] and [[Dwight Macdonald]]'s ''[[Politics (1940s magazine)|Politics]]''.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}}{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} Goodman's collected anarchist essays from this period, "[[The May Pamphlet]]", undergird the libertarian social criticism he would pursue for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}}

=== Gestalt therapy ===

Aside from anarchism, the late 1940s marked Goodman's expansion into psychoanalytic therapy and urban planning.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=179–180}} In 1945, Goodman started a second [[common-law marriage]] that would last until his death.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} Apart from teaching gigs at [[New York University]] night school and a summer at [[Black Mountain College]], the family lived [[poverty line|in poverty]] on his wife's salary.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} By 1946, Goodman was a popular yet "marginal" figure in [[New York bohemianism|New York bohemia]] and he began to participate in psychoanalytic therapy.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} Through contact with [[Wilhelm Reich]], he began a self-psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} Around the same time, Goodman and his brother, the architect Percival, wrote ''[[Communitas (book)|Communitas]]'' (1947). It argued that rural and urban living had not been functionally integrated and became known as a major work of urban planning following Goodman's eventual celebrity.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=180}}<!-- ... pick up Smith here? ... -->

[[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Lore Perls]] contacted Goodman after reading his writing on Reich and began a friendship that yielded the [[Gestalt therapy]] movement. Goodman authored the theoretical chapter of their co-written ''[[Gestalt Therapy (book)|Gestalt Therapy]]'' (1951).{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} In the early 1950s, he continued with his psychoanalytic sessions and began his own occasional practice.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} He continued in this occupation through 1960,{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} taking patients, running [[group therapy|groups]], and leading classes at the Gestalt Therapy Institutes.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|pp=511–512}}

During this psychoanalytic period, Goodman continued to consider himself foremost an artist and wrote prolifically even as his lack of wider recognition weathered his resolve.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} Before starting with Gestalt therapy, Goodman published the novel ''State of Nature'', the book of anarchist and aesthetic essays ''Art and Social Nature'', and the academic book ''[[Kafka's Prayer]]''. He spent 1948 and 1949 writing in New York and published ''The Break-Up of Our Camp'', stories from his experience working at [[summer camp]].{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} He also continued to write and published two novels: the 1950 ''The Dead of Spring''<!-- self-published by subscription on Dellinger's anarchist press {{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}}--> and the 1951 ''Parent's Day''.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} He returned to his writing and therapy practice in New York City in 1951{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} and received his Ph.D. in 1954 from the University of Chicago, which published his dissertation, ''[[The Structure of Literature]]'', the same year.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}} [[The Living Theatre]] staged his theatrical work.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}}

Mid-decade, Goodman entered a [[life crisis]] when publishers did not want his [[epic novel]] ''[[The Empire City]]'',  a new lay therapist licensing law excluded Goodman, and his daughter contracted polio. He embarked to Europe in 1958 where, through reflections on American social ills and respect for Swiss patriotism, Goodman became zealously concerned with improving America. He read the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]] and resolved to write patriotic social criticism that would appeal to his fellow citizens rather than criticize from the sidelines.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=112}} Throughout the late 1950s, Goodman continued to publish in journals including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'', ''[[Liberation (magazine)|Liberation]]'' (for which he became an unofficial editor{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}}), and ''[[The Kenyon Review]]''. His ''The Empire City'', was published in 1959.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} Until this point, his work brought little money or fame.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}}<!-- He still considered himself foremost an artist, even as he became better known for his social criticism.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} need better source?-->

=== Social criticism ===

Goodman's 1960 study of alienated youth in America, ''[[Growing Up Absurd]]'', established his importance as a mainstream cultural theorist and pillar of leftist thought during [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}} The book of social criticism assured the young that they were right to feel disaffected about growing up into a society without meaningful community, spirit, sex, or work.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=509}} He proposed alternatives in topics across the humanist spectrum from family, school, and work, through media, political activism, psychotherapy, quality of life, racial justice, and religion. In contrast to contemporaneous mores, Goodman praised traditional, simple values, such as honor, faith, and vocation, and the humanist history of art and heroes as providing hope for a more meaningful society. Goodman's frank vindications and outsider credentials resonated with the young. Throughout the sixties, Goodman would direct his work towards them,{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=509}}<!-- who came to view him as a father figure/dutch uncle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} --> and sought to cultivate youth movements such as [[Students for a Democratic Society]] that would take up his political message.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=117}} Goodman became known as "the philosopher of the [[New Left]]",{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}} the movement that rose from the participatory and democratic politics of the [[Berkeley Free Speech Movement]].{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=118–119}}

<!-- His fame, in turn, brought opportunities. -->While he continued to write for "little magazines", Goodman now reached mainstream audiences and began to make money. Multiple publishers were engaged in reissuing his books, reclaiming his backlog of unpublished fiction, and publishing his new social commentary. He continued to publish at least a book a year for the rest of his life,{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}}<!-- writing ten books of social thought, a novel, and multiple volumes of poetry in the 1960s, and then stuff from the backlog {{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}}--> including critiques of education (''[[The Community of Scholars]]'' and ''[[Compulsory Miseducation]]''), a treatise on decentralization (''[[People or Personnel]]''), a "memoir-novel" (''[[Making Do]]''), and collections of poetry, [[sketch stories]], and previous articles.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}} He produced a collection of critical broadcasts he had given in Canada as ''[[Like a Conquered Province]]''<!-- massey -->.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}} His books from this period influenced the [[free university]] and [[free school movement]]s.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}}

Goodman taught in a variety of academic institutions. He was the [[Institute for Policy Studies]]'s first visiting scholar<!-- in 1963.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}}--> before serving multiple semester-long university appointments{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}} in New York, London, and Hawaii.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|pp=14–15}} While continuing to lecture, Goodman participated in the [[1960s counterculture]] war protests and [[draft resistance]],{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}} including the first mass [[draft-card burning]]<!-- organized by [[Cornell University students]] including his son-->.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}} Goodman spoke regularly on campuses and discussed tactics with students.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}} He flew out to Berkeley at the start of the Free Speech Movement, which he identified as anarchist in character,<!--: its grassroots communication, headless steering committee, and use of the [[general strike]] 512–513-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}} and became the first [[San Francisco State College]] professor to be hired by students<!-- in 1966-->.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}} Goodman's son, a [[Cornell University]] student, was also active in draft resistance and was under investigation by the [[FBI]] before his accidental mountaineering death in 1967,{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=514}} which launched Goodman into a prolonged depression.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}} Despite early interest in the movement, Goodman was not as involved with youth activists of the [[civil rights movement]].{{sfn|Stoehr|1990|p=491}}

Towards the end of the decade, Goodman used his media stature to encourage Americans to reclaim Jeffersonian anarchism as their heritage. Radical vanguards, who interpreted this as an attempt to stifle their revolutionary fervor, began to heckle and vilify Goodman. Goodman, who enjoyed polemics, was undeterred by their words but dispirited by the movement's turn towards insurrectionary politics.<!--too romantic/desperate; resigned from Liberation-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=514}} In the early 70s, Goodman wrote works that summarized his experience, such as ''[[New Reformation]]'' and ''[[Little Prayers & Finite Experience]]''.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}} His health worsened due to a heart condition, <!--first heart attack 1971 {{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}}-->and Goodman died of a heart attack in New Hampshire on August 2, 1972. His in-progress works (''Little Prayers'' and ''[[Collected Poems (Goodman)|Collected Poems]]'') were published posthumously.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}}<!--

{{main|Fiction of Paul Goodman|Poetry of Paul Goodman}}

Though he was prolific across many literary forms and topical categories,{{refn|At the time of his death, his work spanned 21 different sections of the [[New York Public Library]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}}}} as a humanist, he thought of his writing as serving one common subject—"the organism and the environment"—and one common, pragmatic aim: that the writing should effect a change.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}} Indeed, Goodman's poetry, fiction, drama, literary criticism, urban planning, psychological, cultural, and educational theory addressed the theme of the individual citizen's duties in the larger society, especially the responsibility to exercise free action and creativity.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}} While his fiction and poetry was noted in his time, following ''Growing Up Absurd''{{'s}} success, he diverted his attention from literature and spent his final decade pursuing the social and cultural criticism that forms the basis of his legacy.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=178}}
<!--
Prior to his role as social critic, Goodman fashioned himself as an avant-garde artist, writing poetry, fiction, and drama.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=110}}  Throughout the 1950s, Goodman was frustrated by his lack of readership, though he believed that as an artist, he had a duty to create his own audience.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=111}}

=== Poetry ===

{{main|Poetry of Paul Goodman}}

Goodman modeled his early poems in the tradition of Greek and Latin poets despite the contemporaneity of modernist poetry.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}}

Goodman published his first book of poetry, ''Stop-Light: Five Dance Poems'', in 1941 and was featured in ''Five Young American Poets'' (1945, [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]]).{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}}

=== Fiction ===

{{main|Fiction of Paul Goodman}}

During World War II, he published a book of stories as ''The Facts of Life''{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} ...

Goodman sought to collaborate with his plays' actors, including rewriting scenes to fit specific actors.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}}

He replied on the tiny presses of friends to print his books. ''[[The Dead of Spring]]'', which Goodman considered his best work of fiction, was printed on [[David Dellinger]]'s press in 1950.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}}

He turned away from fiction during the 1950s.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}}
-->

== Thought ==

Regular themes in Goodman's work include education, "return to the land", community, civil planning, decentralization and self-regulation, civil liberties, and peace.{{sfn|Pachter|1973|p=60}} Goodman's oeuvre addressed humanism broadly across multiple disciplines and sociopolitical topics including the arts, civil rights, decentralization, democracy, education, ethics, media, technology, and war.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|pp=21–22}} When criticized for prioritizing breadth over depth, Goodman would reply that his interests did not break neatly into disciplines and that his works concerned the common topics of human nature and community as derived from his concrete experience.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=22}}

Goodman's intellectual development followed three phases. His experience in marginal subcommunities, small anarchist publications, and bohemian New York City through the 1940s formed his core, radical principles, such decentralization and pacifism.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=107}} His first transformation was in psychological theory, as Goodman moved past the theories of Wilhelm Reich to develop Gestalt therapy with Fritz Perls.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=107–108}} His second transformation opened his approach to social criticism.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=107}} He resolved to write positively, patriotically, and accessibly about reform for a larger audience rather than simply resisting conformity and "drawing the line" between himself and societal pressures. This approach was foundational to building the New Left.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=107–108}}

=== Politics and social thought ===

Goodman was most famous as a political thinker and social critic.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}} Following his ascent with ''Growing Up Absurd'' (1960), his books spoke to young radicals, whom he encouraged to reclaim [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s radical democracy as their anarchist birthright.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}} Goodman's anarchist politics of the forties had an afterlife influence in the politics of the sixties' New Left.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}} His World War II-era essays on the draft, moral law, civic duty, and resistance against violence were re-purposed for youth grappling with the Vietnam War.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}} Even as the United States grew increasingly violent in the late 1960s, Goodman retained hope that a new populism, almost religious in nature, would bring about a consensus to live more humanely.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=514}} His political beliefs shifted little over his life,{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}} though his message as a social critic had been fueled by his pre-1960 experiences as a Gestalt therapist and dissatisfaction with his role as an artist.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=110}}
<!--
Having been raised after the [[first World War]],{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}} Goodman was a staunch pacifist.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}
''Communitas'' called for a re-balance of urban and rural values, reliance on non-commercial criteria for decisions about technology, and departure from commodity-focused [[living standards]].{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}}-->
<!--
In the anti-authoritarian tradition of anarchism ... Goodman's intellectual forebears included utopian socialists and anarchists, an anti-authoritarian tradition against centralized government, such as the socialism championed by the Marxist and Social Democratic Left. He was particularly influenced by the works of [[Peter Kropotkin]].{{sfn|King|1972|p=78}}-->

<!--decentralization-->As a decentralist, Goodman was skeptical of power and believed that human fallibility required power to be deconcentrated to reduce its harm.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}} "Anarchists", Goodman wrote, "want to increase intrinsic functioning and diminish extrinsic power."{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=49}}  His "peasant anarchism" was less dogma than disposition: He held that the small things in life (little property, food, sex) were paramount, while power worship, central planning, and ideology were perilous. He rejected grand schemes to reorganize the world{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}} and instead argued for decentralized counter-institutions across society to downscale societal organization.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}} Goodman blamed political centralization and a [[power elite]] for withering [[populism]] and creating a "psychology of powerlessness".{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=100}} He advocated for alternative systems of order that eschewed "top-down direction, standard rules, and extrinsic rewards like salary and status"<!--, rather than systems of no order. Goodman believed that youth would see contemporary ideology as empty and dehumanizing, both capitalist or communist-->.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}} Goodman often referenced [[classical republican]] ideology, such as improvised, local political decision-making and principles like [[honor]] and [[craftsmanship]].{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=99}} He loved New York City and thought that [[Manhattan]]'s mixture of people, customs, and learning contributed to its inhabitants' growth.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=104}}<!-- move this? -->

<!--autonomy and pragmatism-->Goodman followed in the tradition of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]]. Like [[Kant]] in ''[[What Is Enlightenment?]]'' (one of Goodman's favorite essays), Goodman structured his core beliefs around autonomy, not freedom, that human ability to pursue one's own initiative and follow through.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=97–98}} Influenced by [[Aristotle]], Goodman additionally advocated for [[self-actualization]] through participating in societal discourse, rather than using politics solely to choose leaders and divvy resources.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=100}} He adhered to [[John Dewey]]'s [[pragmatism]] and spoke about its misappropriation in American society. Goodman praised classless, everyday, democratic values associated with [[American frontier culture]].{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=98}}<!-- add something about patriotism here? --> He lionized American radicals who championed such values. Goodman was interested in radicalism native to the United States, such as populism and [[Randolph Bourne]]'s anarcho-pacifism, and distanced himself from Marxism and European radicalism.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=99}}

<!-- New York Intellectuals -->Goodman is associated with the [[New York Intellectuals]] circle of college-educated, secular Jews,{{sfn|Howe|1970|p=[https://archive.org/details/declineofnew0000howe/page/228/mode/1up?q=goodman 228]}}{{sfn|Podhoretz|1967}}{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=24}}<ref name="Sorin2003">{{cite book|last=Sorin|first=Gerald|title=Irving Howe: A Life of Passionate Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DWhBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA67|year=2003|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-4077-4|page=67}}</ref> despite his political differences with the group.

=== Psychology ===
{{further|Gestalt therapy}}
Goodman's radicalism was based in psychological theory, which evolved throughout his life. He first adopted radical Freudianism based in fixed human instincts and the politics of Wilhelm Reich. Goodman believed that natural human instinct (akin to Freud's [[id (psychology)|id]]) served to help humans resist alienation, advertising, propaganda, and will to conform.<!-- anti neo-Freudian-->{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=102–104}} He moved away from Reichian individualistic id psychology towards a view of the nonconforming self integrated with society. Several factors precipitated this change. First, Reich, a Marxist, criticized Goodman's anarchist interpretation of his work. Second, as a follower of Aristotle, belief in a soul pursuing its intrinsic [[telos]] fit Goodman's idea of socialization better than the Freudian conflict model. Third, as a follower of Kant, Goodman believed in the self as a synthesized combination of internal [[human nature]] and the external world. Goodman met Fritz Perls around this time. The pair together challenged Reich and developed the theory of Gestalt therapy atop traits of Reich's radical Freudianism.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=108}}

Gestalt therapy emphasizes the living present over the past and conscious activity over the unconsciousness of dreams. The therapy is based in finding and confronting unresolved issues in one's habitual behavior and social environment to become a truer, more self-aware version of oneself.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=108–109}} It encourages clients to embrace spontaneity and active engagement in their present lives.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=109}} Unlike the silent Freudian analyst, Goodman played an active, confrontational role as therapist and believed his role was less to cure sickness than to adjust clients to their realities in accordance with their own desires by revealing their blocked potential. Goodman believed that the therapist, acting as a "fellow citizen", had a responsibility to reflect the shared, societal sources of these blockages. These themes, of present engagement and of duty to identify shared ills, provided a theory of human nature and community that became the political basis of Goodman's New Left vision and subsequent career in social criticism.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=109–110}} Goodman's collective therapy sessions functioned as mutual criticism on par with [[Oneida Community#Mutual criticism|Oneida Community communal self-improvement meetings]].{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=110}}

=== Education ===

{{external media |video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65mffxiEd00 Goodman discusses the role of public schools with William F. Buckley Jr. on ''Firing Line'', 1966]}}

Goodman's thoughts on education came from his interest in [[progressive education]] and his experience with the Berkeley Free Speech Movement and [[free university]] movement.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=121}}

Goodman invokes "human nature" as multifaceted and unearthed by new culture, institutions, and proposals. He offers no common definition of "human nature" and suggests that no common definition is needed even when claiming that some action is "against human nature".{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=41}} Goodman contends that humans are animals with tendencies and that a "human nature" forms between the human and an environment he deems suitable: a continually reinvented "free" society with a culture developed from and for the search for human powers.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=54}} When denied this uninhibited growth, human nature is shackled, culture purged, and education impossible, regardless of the physical institution of schooling.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=54}}

<!--{{Quote box |quote=Many explanations are given for the rebellion in the colleges and high schools—the students demand Student Power, blacks want community control, and administrators say they need more money; but nobody wants to suggest that maybe so much schooling for so many is not a good idea. |source=Goodman, ''New Reformation'', p. 67{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=67}} |width=30em |quoted=1}} -->To Goodman, education aims to form a common humanity and, in turn, create a "worthwhile" world.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=39}} He figured that "natural" human development has similar aims,{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=37}} which is to say that education and "growing up" are identical.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=39}} However, as outlined in ''Growing Up Absurd'', a dearth of "worthwhile opportunities" in a society precludes both education and growing up.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=39}} Goodman contended that a lack of community, patriotism, and honor stunts the normal development of human nature and leads to "resigned or fatalistic" youth. This resignation leads youth to "role play" the qualities expected of them.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=52}}

In ''Compulsory Mis-education'', Goodman explains "mis-education" as a process not on the spectrum of education, but rather a brainwashing process that advocates for a singular worldview, the "confusion" of personal experience and feelings, and the fearfulness and insecurity towards other worldviews.{{sfn|Boyer|1970|pp=37–38}} Goodman's books on education extol the medieval university and advocated for alternative institutions of instruction.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=513}} He saw himself as continuing the work started by [[John Dewey]].{{sfn|Boyer|1970|p=40}}
<!--see Widmer p. 161 for list of those he influenced
In ''New Reformation'', Goodman posited that the primary cause of youth alienation is the school system. He contrasted the needs of education to help young people find fulfillment with a school that ostracizes young people from community and does not serve their or society's well-being. Goodman argued that the school's nature was "coercive",{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=67}} and that student uprising would not happen if schools were voluntary or there were students who liked the school enough to defend it.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=68}} In its stead, Goodman suggests "incidental education", or education where individuals learn by participating in the world apart from regimented school institutions, and claims that societies mostly educated their young in this manner before the schooling apparatus.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=68}} He holds that incidental learners will be better socialized by having the opportunity to learn at their own pace and interest without outside pressure, so as to avoid "resentment, fear, and submission".{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=69}} Recounting his advocacy of incidental education as frequent, Goodman wrote that he "found no takers".{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=90}}

Goodman's main proposals for future education were to make incidental education the primary mode of learning, to shut down most high schools (with youth communities to usurp their social function), to put college training after professionalization rather than before, to task educators with facilitating incidental education, and to delay socialization of youth through the age of twelve.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|pp=85–86}} Goodman wrote that [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]] provides "an adequate model" for the preservative and life-giving environment children need through their late teens.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=90}} He additionally felt that the model was adaptable to city life.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=90}} Of the criticism that his contemporary progressive education was "a gimmick geared to the middle class", Goodman responded that other groups objected to being "experimented" upon and instead agreed to school their children to compete in conventional education so as to compete for the opportunities of power that ensues education.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=83}}{{refn|Goodman added that this philosophy was "wrongheaded". He argued that the ''[[Eight-Year Study]]'' proved the benefits of more experimental schools, and that "emotional freedom" was paramount to traditional education for its more useful affordance of increased autonomy in the face of inequitable conditions.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=83}}|group=note}}

Goodman proposed a school for children from six to eleven years of age, decentralized to the point of operation with four teachers and 28 children run by its local staff, students, and guardians. The teachers were to include a licensed teacher, a recent college graduate, a local mother, and a high school graduate. Goodman calculated the cost to be about the same per pupil as the existing New York City public school expenditure, and that his plan had the benefit of reducing administrative overhead. He acknowledged that his proposal was politically "unlikely, since it threatens both vested interests and popular prejudices".{{sfn|Goodman|1970|pp=97–98}} He felt that adolescents should be assured the cost of living, as paid for by the transference of the cost of high school and early college.{{sfn|Goodman|1970|p=87}}-->

== Personal life ==

While Goodman anchored himself to larger traditions—a [[Renaissance man]], a citizen of the world, a "child of [[the Enlightenment]]", and a [[man of letters]]{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|pp=21–22}}—he also considered himself an American patriot,{{sfn|Blake|2012|pp=22, 28}} valuing what he called the provincial virtues of the country's national character, such as dutifulness, frugality, honesty, prudence, and self-reliance.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=21}} He also valued curiosity, lust, and willingness to break rules for self-evident good.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=510}}

Both of Goodman's marriages were common law;{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13, 14}} neither state-officiated.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} Goodman was married to Virginia Miller between 1938 and 1943. Their daughter, Susan (1939), was born in Chicago.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}}{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=13}} Between 1945 and his death, Goodman was married to Sally Duchsten. Their son, Mathew Ready, was born in 1946.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} They lived below the [[poverty line]] on her salary as a secretary, supplemented by Goodman's sporadic teaching assignments.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} With the proceeds from ''Growing Up Absurd'' (1960), his wife left her job{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=512}} and Goodman bought a farmhouse outside of [[North Stratford, New Hampshire]], which they used as an occasional home.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}} His third child, Daisy, was born in 1963.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=15}}

<!--cover bisexuality & relation to identity -->Throughout his life, Goodman lost jobs for reasons related to his sexuality.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=179}} By the time he was in Chicago and married, Goodman was an active <!--[[coming out|out]], [[open relationship|open]] -->bisexual who cruised bars and parks for young men.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}}<!-- and was uncommonly public about this but need a source--> He was fired from his teaching position there for not taking his cruising off-campus.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} He was dismissed from the ''Partisan Review'',{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=511}} the progressive boarding school Manumit, and Black Mountain College for reasons related to his homosexuality or bisexuality.{{sfn|Widmer|1980|p=14}}<!-- Manumit seducing students{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=156}}-->

== Reception and influence ==

In his time, Goodman was the foremost American intellectual for non-Marxist, Western radicalism.<!-- Within the intellectual community, he was a "[[tertium quid]]".-->{{sfn|King|1972|p=78}} Goodman's idiosyncratic celebrity was tied to his physical presence: While known for his speech and campus appearances, his [[Gadfly (philosophy and social science)|gadfly]] personality was uncharismatic and unmannered for mass consumption. With his death, Goodman's public renown waned as quickly as it came but as a figure, Goodman remains remembered for his utopian proposals and principled belief in human potential.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}}<!-- consider a more resolute source for the final part -->
<!--
Many of Dwight Macdonald's ideas originated in Goodman.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|p=106}}
Goodman's influence on 1960s activists made him a "movement intellectual".{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=117–118}}
-->
Writing on Goodman's death, [[Susan Sontag]] described his intellect as underappreciated{{sfn|Sontag|1972|p=276}} and his literary voice as the most "convincing, genuine, [and] singular" since [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s.{{sfn|Sontag|1972|p=275}} She lamented how "Goodman was always taken for granted even by his admirers", praised his literary breadth, and predicted that his poetry would eventually find widespread appreciation.{{sfn|Sontag|1972|p=277}} Sontag called Goodman the "most important American writer" of her last twenty years.{{sfn|Sontag|1972|p=277}}<!-- Susan Sontag wrote that ''Growing Up Absurd''{{`s}} exclusion of adolescent women was its biggest flaw, and that she was told Goodman "didn't really like women as people".{{sfn|Sontag|1972|p=274}} --><!-- Le Guin; Ward -->

Harvard University's [[Houghton Library]] acquired Goodman's papers in 1989.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=20}} Though known for his social criticism in his life, Goodman's literary executor [[Taylor Stoehr]] wrote that future generations would likely appreciate Goodman foremost for his poetry and fiction, which are also the works for which Goodman wished to be known.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994c|p=22}} Writing years later, Stoehr thought that the poems, some stories, and ''The Empire City'' would have the most future currency. Though Stoehr considered Goodman's social commentary just "as fresh in the nineties as ... in the sixties", everything but ''Communitas'' and ''Growing Up Absurd'' had gone out of print.{{sfn|Stoehr|1994b|p=515}}
