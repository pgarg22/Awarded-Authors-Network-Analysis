'''Ragnhild Magerøy''' (9 July 1920 &ndash; 16 November 2010) was a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] novelist, essayist and poet. She is principally known as a historical novelist.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ragnhild Magerøy |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Ragnhild_Magerøy |language=no | access-date=18 October 2010 }}</ref>

Magerøy was born at [[Fræna]]  in [[Møre og Romsdal]] as the youngest of six siblings.  In 1958 she moved with her family to Oslo where she was given the opportunity to study historical material at the [[University of Oslo Library]]. She became focused in  historic but often forgotten female figures.  Her female characters are often high-spirited  and center to the plot.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/mageroey-ragnhild/

She made her literary début in 1957 with the novel ''Gunhild'', the first volume of a  novel trilogy about the lives of  women in a small rural village
in the 19th century.   Her subsequent novels were often placed within the Norwegian Medieval Period.
She was awarded the [[Dobloug Prize]] in 1975.
