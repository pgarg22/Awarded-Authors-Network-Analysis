'''Frances Mary Peard''' (16 May 1835 – 5 October 1923) was an English author and traveller who wrote over 40 works of fiction for children or adults between 1867 and 1909. Most were domestic novels or short-story volumes, often historical in nature and set abroad.<ref name=Orlando>[http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=pearfr Frances Mary Peard – The Orlando Project: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present] – [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref>

==Background==
Born in [[Exminster]] in [[Devon]], the daughter of Commander George Shuldham Peard (1793–1837), a naval officer who went to the Arctic regions in search of Sir [[John Franklin]], and Frances Cooke (née Ellicombe, 1805–1895), she was one of five siblings, of whom two died young.<ref name=Orlando/> Her grandfather was [[Shuldham Peard]] and her uncle was [[John Whitehead Peard]]. Her older brother George Shuldham Peard (1829–1918) was a veteran of the [[Crimean War]] and likewise an author. With so many distinguished soldiers and sailors in her family it is not surprising that military themes and battles frequently appear in her stories.<ref name=Google/> It appears that she was widely travelled, perhaps venturing as far as India, but in later life she lived in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], with her mother.<ref name=Google>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X2KuBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA501&lpg=PA501&dq=peard+spck&source=bl&ots=4JN9yRULvj&sig=5LRDA3daZX6RI4KAHR4UKbrIVZI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP3_mM2P7ZAhVKOMAKHcZJAxQQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&q=peard%20spck&f=false John Sutherland, ''The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction'', Routledge (Second edition, 2009), p. 501.]</ref>

==Fiction==
Frances Peard wrote children's books for boys and girls and fiction for adults, all drawing on her travels abroad, especially in France and India. Her fiction for adults includes ''Unawares'' (1870); ''The Rose-Garden'' (1872); ''Thorpe Regis'' (1874); ''Cartouche'' (1878); ''Schloss and Town'' (1882); ''The Asheldon School-Room'' (1883); ''Prentice Hugh'' (1887); ''The Blue Dragon''; ''The Interloper''; ''The Abbot's Bridge''; ''Donna Teresa'' (1899) and ''Number One and Number Two'' (1900). Her novel ''The Ring from Jaipur'' (1904) is rather more sober than its title, which suggests jewels and Far Eastern promise.

She also wrote for the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK) and was a friend of [[Christabel Rose Coleridge]], [[Charlotte Mary Yonge]] and [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],<ref name=Google/> and in later life in [[Torquay]] of fellow novelist [[Anna Harriett Drury]].

==Death==
Peard died unmarried in [[Torquay]] in [[Devon]] in 1923. She left her estate of £15,276 0s 4d to her sister Helen Charlotte Peard.<ref>Frances Mary Peard in the England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995</ref> She is buried with her parents in the Church of St Martin of Tours, [[Exminster]], Devon.<ref>[http://memorials.rmg.co.uk/m2147/ Peard Family Monument - Maritime Memorials database]</ref>
