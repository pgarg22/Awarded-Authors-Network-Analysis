'''John Crowne''' (6 April 1641 – 1712) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[dramatist]].

His father "[[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]]" [[William Crowne]], accompanied the [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel and Surrey|earl of Arundel]] on a diplomatic mission to [[Vienna]] in 1637, and wrote an account of his journey. He emigrated to Nova Scotia where he received a grant of land from [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], but the [[France|French]] took possession of his property, and the home government did nothing to uphold his rights.

==Biography==
He was born in [[London]] on 6 April 1641,<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/search/frameset_search.asp?PAGE=ancestorsearchresults.asp FamilySearch.org - Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and emigrated to [[Nova Scotia]] in 1657 with his father, a joint proprietor of the colony, aboard the ship ''Satisfaction'', and studied at [[Harvard College]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/miscellaneouswor04dryduoft/page/44?q="nova+scotia" Reference indicates he was born in Nova Scotia]</ref> While studying at Harvard, Crowne lived with Puritan divine [[John Norton (divine)|John Norton]]. Crowne left without graduating, however, and returned to England with his father in 1660.

When the son came to England his poverty compelled him to act as gentleman usher to an independent lady of quality, and his enemies asserted that his father had been an Independent minister. He began his literary career with a romance, ''Pandion and Amphigenia, or the History of the coy Lady of Thessalia'' (1665). In 1671 he produced a romantic play, ''[[Juliana (play)|Juliana, or the Princess of Poland]]'', which has, in spite of its title, no pretensions to rank as a historical drama.

The [[John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester|earl of Rochester]] procured for him, apparently with the sole object of annoying [[John Dryden|Dryden]] by infringing on his rights as [[Poet Laureate|poet-laureate]], a commission to supply a masque for performance at court. ''Calisto'' gained him the favour of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but Rochester proved a fickle patron, and his favour was completely alienated by the success of Crowne's heroic play in two parts, ''The Destruction of Jerusalem by Titus Vespasian'' (1677). This piece contained a thinly disguised satire on the [[Puritan]] party in the description of the [[Pharisees]], and about 1683 he produced a distinctly political play, ''[[City Politiques]]'', satirizing the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party and containing characters which were readily recognized as portraits of [[Titus Oates]] and others. This made him many enemies, and he petitioned the king for a small place that would release him from the necessity of writing for the stage.

The king exacted one more comedy, which should, he suggested, he based on the ''No puede ser guardar una mujer'' of [[Agustín Moreto y Cavana|Moreto]]. This had already been unsuccessfully adapted, as Crowne discovered later, by Sir Thomas St Serfe, but in Crowne's hands it developed into ''[[Sir Courtly Nice]]'' (1685), a comedy which kept its place as a stock piece for nearly a century. Unfortunately Charles II died before the play was completed, and Crowne was disappointed of his reward. In 1698, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] attended a performance of his play ''Caligula'' during which [[Mary Lindsey]] sang a special composition by [[Richard Leveridge]].<ref name=cali>{{Cite ODNB|title=Lindsey, Mary (fl. 1697–1713), singer|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-70111|access-date=2020-11-13|year = 2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/70111}}</ref> Crowne continued to write plays, and it is stated that he was still living in 1703. According to an article in the Gentleman's Magazine John was still alive in the first decade of the 18th century when the writer recalls drinking with him. Letters to the royal household indicates he relied on the charity of Queen [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] who remembered performing one of his plays for Charles II when they were young princesses.

Crowne was a fertile writer of plays with an historical setting, in which heroic love was, in the fashion of the French romances, made the leading motive. The prosaic level of his style saved him as a rule from the rant to be found in so many contemporary heroic plays, but these pieces are of no particular interest. He was much more successful in comedy of the kind that depicts "humours".

Little is known of Crowne's later life although records show an Elias Crowne (birthplace listed as outside the county) marrying in Norfolk in the late 1680s, the son of a John and Sarah Crowne. There was also a John Crown born in 1667 in London.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Crowne died around 1712 and was buried at St Giles in the Fields, London.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Works==

* ''[[Charles VIII of France (play)|Charles VIII of France]]'' (1671) was dedicated to Rochester. In ''Timon'', generally supposed to have been written by the earl, a line from this piece--"whilst sporting waves smil'd on the rising sun "—was held up to ridicule
