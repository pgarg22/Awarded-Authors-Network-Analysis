'''Lars Hans Carl Abraham Forssell''' (14 January 1928{{spaced ndash}}26 July 2007) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer and member of the [[Swedish Academy]]. Forssell was a versatile writer who worked within many [[genre]]s, including [[poetry]], [[drama]] and [[songwriting]]. He was married from 1951 until his death to Kerstin Hane, and was the father of Jonas and Malte Forssell.

Lars Forssell was born in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1928. He attended a local elementary school called [[Kungsholms Folkskola]], which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was the world's largest [[Primary education|elementary school]] - the school had a capacity of 3,800 pupils, but since not all of them attended school every day, they were taught in shifts and according to the [[City Museum of Stockholm]], the total number of enrolled pupils was over 6,000.

He studied in the [[United States]] during the 1940s, returned to Sweden to study for a degree at the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1952 and became a cultural reporter for various Swedish newspapers and journals (''[[Utsikt]], [[Bonniers Litterära Magasin]], [[Poesi]], [[Dagens Nyheter]]'' and ''[[Expressen]]''). At the same time, he became established as a lyricist for [[cabaret]] shows and his own reviews (including ''Två åsnor'' (''A Pair of Donkeys'') which was staged in [[Gothenburg]] in 1957). In 1966 he was a member of the jury at the [[16th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="berlinale 1966">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1966/04_jury_1966/04_Jury_1966.html |title=Berlinale 1966: Juries |accessdate=22 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

His collections of poetry won him membership of the Swedish Academy in 1971, while his song lyrics brought him widespread public recognition. During the 1970s he worked tirelessly as a poet and as a song-contest lyricist, including writing for the 1973 Swedish [[Eurovision Song Contest]] entry selection round ([[Melodifestivalen]]) and for performer [[Lill-Babs]] in 1980.

He was awarded the [[Bellman Prize]] in both 1968 and 1981, the [[Pilot Prize]] in 1992, the [[Litteris et Artibus]] award in 1993, the [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] scholarship in 1997 and the Swedish Academy's Nordic Prize in 1998. His works include anthologies of poetry, books of song lyrics, children's books, plays, operatic [[libretto]]s and translations. Lars Forssell died in Stockholm in 2007.
