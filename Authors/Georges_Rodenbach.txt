'''Georges Raymond Constantin Rodenbach''' (16 July 1855 – 25 December 1898) was a Belgian [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet and novelist.

== Biography ==
Georges Rodenbach was born in [[Tournai]] to a [[French people|French]] mother and a [[Germans|German]] father from the Rhineland ([[Andernach]]). He was related to the famous [[Germans|German]] poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]].<ref>Romain Vanlandschoot, ''Albrecht Rodenbach: biografie'', Lannoo Uitgeverij (2002), p. 72</ref> He went to school in [[Ghent]] at the prestigious [[Sint-Barbaracollege]], where he became friends with the poet [[Emile Verhaeren]]. Rodenbach worked as a lawyer and journalist. He spent the last ten years of his life in Paris as the correspondent of the ''[[Journal de Bruxelles]]'', and was an intimate of [[Edmond de Goncourt]]. He published eight collections of verse and four novels, as well as short stories, stage works and criticism. He produced some Parisian and purely imitative work; but a major part of his production is the outcome of a passionate idealisation of the quiet Flemish towns in which he had passed his childhood and early youth. In his best known work, ''[[Bruges-la-Morte]]'' (1892), he explains that his aim is to evoke the town as a living being, associated with the moods of the spirit, counselling, dissuading from and prompting action. ''Bruges-la-Morte'' was used by the composer [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] as the basis for his opera [[Die tote Stadt]]. [[Albrecht Rodenbach]], his cousin, was a poet and novelist as well, and a leader in the [[Flemish movement|revival of Flemish literature]] of the 19th century.
