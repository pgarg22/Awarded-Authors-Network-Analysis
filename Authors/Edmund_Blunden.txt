'''Edmund Charles Blunden''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|MC}} (1 November 1896 – 20 January 1974) was an English poet, author and [[literary critic|critic]]. Like his friend [[Siegfried Sassoon]], he wrote of his experiences in [[World War I]] in both verse and prose. For most of his career, Blunden was also a reviewer for English publications and an academic in Tokyo and later Hong Kong. He ended his career as [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] six times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1092|title=Nomination Database|website=nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-18}}</ref>

==Early years==
Born in London, Blunden was the eldest of the nine children of Charles Edmund Blunden (1871–1951) and his wife, Georgina Margaret ''née'' Tyler, who were joint-headteachers of [[Yalding]] school.<ref name=dnb>Bergonzi, Bernard, "Blunden, Edmund Charles (1896–1974)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30828, accessed 28 Nov 2008]</ref> Blunden was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford]].<ref name=whoswho>"Blunden, Edmund Charles", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U152421, accessed 28 Nov 2008]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==World War I==
In September 1915,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29290|page=8993|date=10 September 1915}}</ref> during [[World War I]], Blunden was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Sussex Regiment]]. He was posted to the 11th (Service) Battalion (1st South Down), Royal Sussex Regiment, a [[Kitchener's Army]] unit that formed part of the [[116th Brigade (United Kingdom)|116th Brigade]] of the [[39th Division (United Kingdom)|39th Division]] in May 1916, two months after the battalion's arrival in France. He served with the battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to the end of the war, taking part in the actions at [[Ypres]] and the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], followed in 1917 by the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. In January 1917, he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) for "conspicuous gallantry in action".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29921 |supp=y|page=1016|date=26 January 1917}} "For conspicuous gallantry in action. He displayed great courage and determination when in charge of a carrying party under heavy fire. He has previously done fine work."</ref>

Blunden survived nearly two years in the front line without physical injury (despite being [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gassed]] in October 1917<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edmundblunden.org/productservice.php?productserviceid=294 |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 March 2017 |archive-date=22 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222170307/http://edmundblunden.org/productservice.php?productserviceid=294 |url-status=dead }}</ref>) but, for the rest of his life, he bore mental scars from his experiences.<ref name=dnb /> With characteristic self-deprecation he attributed his survival to his diminutive size, which made "an inconspicuous target".<ref name=guardian>''[[The Guardian]]'' obituary</ref> His own account of his experiences was published in 1928, as ''[[Undertones of War]]''.

==University==
Blunden left the army in 1919 and took up the scholarship at Oxford that he had won while he was still at school.<ref name=dnb /> On the same English literature course was [[Robert Graves]], and the two were close friends during their time at Oxford together, but Blunden found university life unsatisfactory and left in 1920 to take up a literary career, at first acting as assistant to [[Middleton Murry]] on the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''.

==Writer==
An early supporter was Siegfried Sassoon, who became a lifelong friend. In 1920, Blunden published a collection of poems, ''The Waggoner'', and with Alan Porter, he edited the poems of [[John Clare]] (mostly from Clare's manuscript).<ref name=dnb />

Blunden's next book of poems, ''The Shepherd'', published in 1922 won the [[Hawthornden Prize]], but his poetry, though well reviewed, did not provide enough to live on. In 1924, he accepted the post of Professor of English at the [[University of Tokyo]]. In December 1925, he dedicated a poem « UP!UP! » to the rugby men of the University and this became the anthem of the Tokyo University RFC. He returned to England in 1927, and was literary editor of the ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum|Nation]]'' for a year. In 1927, he published a short book, ''On the Poems of [[Henry Vaughan]], Characteristics and Intimations, with his principal Latin poems carefully translated into English verse'' (London: H. Cobden-Sanderson, 1927), expanding and revising an essay that he had published, in November 1926, in the ''[[London Mercury]]''. In 1931, he returned to Oxford as a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], where he was highly regarded as a tutor.<ref name=dnb /><ref name="MCreg">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900–1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=222}}</ref> During his years in Oxford, Blunden published extensively: several collections of poetry including ''Choice or Chance'' (1934) and ''Shells by a Stream'' (1944), prose works on [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]; [[Edward Gibbon]]; [[Leigh Hunt]]; [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (''[[Shelley: A Life Story]]''); [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]]; and [[Thomas Hardy]]; and a book about a game he loved, ''Cricket Country'' (1944). He returned to full-time writing in 1944, becoming assistant editor of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. In 1947, he returned to Japan as a member of the British liaison mission in Tokyo. In 1953, after three years back in England he accepted the post of Professor of English Literature at the University of Hong Kong.<ref name=dnb />

==Later life==
Blunden retired in 1964 and settled in [[Suffolk]]. In 1966, he was nominated for the Oxford [[Professor of Poetry|Professorship of Poetry]] in succession to Graves; with some misgivings, he agreed to stand and was elected by a large majority over the other candidate, [[Robert Lowell]]. However, he now found the strain of public lecturing too much for him, and after two years, he resigned.<ref name=dnb />

He died of a heart attack at his home at [[Long Melford]], Suffolk, in 1974, and is buried in the churchyard of [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]].

==Personal life==
Blunden was married three times. While still in the army, he met and married Mary Daines in 1918. They had three children, the first of whom died in infancy. They divorced in 1931, and in 1933, Blunden married Sylva Norman, a young novelist and critic. That marriage, which was childless, was dissolved in 1945. The same year, he married Claire Margaret Poynting (1918–2000), one of his former pupils. Together they had four daughters who included Margaret, Lucy, and Frances. While in Japan in the summer of 1925, he met Aki Hayashi, and he began a relationship.<ref>Barry Webb, Edmund Blunden: A Biography, p. 151.</ref> When Blunden returned to England in 1927, Aki accompanied him and would become his secretary.<ref>Webb, p. 156.</ref> The relationship later changed from a romantic one to a platonic friendship, and they remained in contact for the rest of her life.<ref name=dnb />

Blunden's love of cricket, celebrated in his book ''Cricket Country'', is described by the biographer [[Philip Ziegler]] as fanatical. Blunden and his friend [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] regularly opened the batting for a publisher's eleven in the 1930s (Blunden insisted on batting without gloves).<ref>Ziegler, pp. pp and 116–17</ref> An affectionate obituary tribute in ''The Guardian'' commented, "He loved cricket… and played it ardently and very badly",<ref name=guardian /> and in a review of ''Cricket Country'', [[George Orwell]] described him as "the true cricketer":

<blockquote>The test of a true cricketer is that he shall prefer village cricket to 'good' cricket [.... Blunden's] friendliest memories are of the informal village game, where everyone plays in braces, where the [[blacksmith]] is liable to be called away in mid-innings on an urgent job, and sometimes, about the time when the light begins to fail, a ball driven for four kills a rabbit on the boundary.<ref>Quoted in Menon 2009.</ref></blockquote>

In a 2009 appreciation of the book and its author, [[Bangalore]] writer [[Suresh Menon (sports writer)|Suresh Menon]] wrote:

<blockquote>Any cricket book that talks easily of [[Henry James]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[K. S. Ranjitsinhji|Ranji]] and [[WG Grace|Grace]] and [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] (the writer, not the [[Richard Burton|actor]]) and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] is bound to have a special charm of its own. As Blunden says, "The game which made me write at all, is not terminated at the boundary, but is reflected beyond, is echoed and varied out there among the gardens and the barns, the dells and the thickets, and belongs to some wider field."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Perhaps that is what all books on cricket are trying to say.<ref>Menon 2009.</ref></blockquote>

Blunden had a robust sense of humour. In [[Hong Kong]], he relished linguistic misunderstandings such as those of the restaurant that offered "fried prawn's balls" and the schoolboy who wrote, "In Hong Kong there is a queer at every bus-stop".<ref>Hart-Davis, Volume 5, Letter of 5 June 1960</ref>

His fellow poets' regard for Blunden was illustrated by the contributions to a dinner in his honour for which poems were specially written by [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] and [[William Plomer]]; [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Walter de la Mare]] were guests; and Sassoon provided the [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]].<ref>Ziegler, p. 150</ref>

==Honours==
Blunden's public honours included the [[C.B.E.]], 1951; the Queen's gold medal for Poetry, 1956; The [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Benson Medal; the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], 3rd Class (Japan), 1963; and Honorary Membership of the [[Japan Academy]].<ref name=whoswho />

On 11 November 1985, Blunden was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html|title=Poets|website=net.lib.byu.edu|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922074012/http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/WWI/poets/poets.html|archive-date=22 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The inscription on the stone was written by fellow World War I poet [[Wilfred Owen]]: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/Preface.html|title=Preface|first=Robert|last=Means|website=net.lib.byu.edu|access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref>

==Works==
Blunden's output was prolific. To those who thought that he published too much he quoted [[Walter de la Mare]]'s observation that time was the poet's best editor.<ref>''[[The Times]]'' obituary</ref>
