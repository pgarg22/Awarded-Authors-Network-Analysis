==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Abernethy was born October 10, 1872, in [[Rutherford College, North Carolina]], a town named for the [[Rutherford College (North Carolina)|college]] of which his grandfather was founder and president.<ref name="notable Americans">{{cite book|title=The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans|year=1904|publisher=The Biographical Society|location=Boston|url=https://archive.org/details/twentiethcentury02john|last1=Johnson |first1= Rossiter |last2=Brown |first2= John Howard|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref name=DNCB>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=William Stevens|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography.

Robert Labon and Mary Ann Hayes Abernethy.<ref name="BDA1906" /> Arthur proved to be a precocious child, teaching himself [[Electrical telegraph|telegraphy]] by the age of nine<ref name="BDA1906" /> and passing the exams to get his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree from Rutherford at the age of 14. He was denied this degree, however, due to his age.<ref name="notable Americans" /> He remained at Rutherford College becoming professor of Latin in 1887 (making him one of the youngest professors in the nation), teaching there for several years. Already a Latin and Greek scholar, he went on to receive his [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] degree from Trinity College (now [[Duke University]]) in 1891 and his doctoral degree from [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref name=DNCB />

===Journalism and activism===
Abernethy soon turned his attention to journalism, becoming editor of ''The Telegrapher'' from 1895 to 1897 and a biographical writer for ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'' from 1897 to 1899.<ref name="BDA1906" /> He befriended [[Edgar Wilson Nye]] who was an adviser to him.<ref name="notable Americans" /> He contributed columns to ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'' as well as newspapers around the country including Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, New York and Philadelphia.<ref name="past laureates">{{cite web|title=Past North Carolina Poets Laureate |url=http://www.ncarts.org/freeform_scrn_template.cfm?ffscrn_id=177& |publisher=North Carolina Arts Council |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027233637/http://www.ncarts.org/freeform_scrn_template.cfm?ffscrn_id=177& |archivedate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref> Some of his work appeared in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]''.<ref name=Phifer>{{cite book|last=Phifer|first=Edward W., Jr|title=Burke: The History of a North Carolina County|year=1977|location=Morganton, North Carolina}}</ref>{{RP|302}}

He had been married several times, the last time to widow Edna Beatty Lachot of Pennsylvania. She had two children and Abernethy adopted her daughter Anna Mary.<ref name="Heritage of BC" /> He met his wife while serving as business manager for the Philadelphia College of Commerce.<ref name=DNCB />

Abernethy was active in politics as well, becoming a leader in the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition movement]].<ref>{{cite news|title=SAYS HE'S 'SWORN OFF' AS A PROHIBITIONIST; Rev. A.T. Abernethy, Who Prayed for Dry Law, Calls It Pathetic Disappointment|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 23, 1926}}</ref> He ran for [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1928 as an anti-[[Al Smith]] candidate, losing in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary to incumbent [[Alfred L. Bulwinkle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NC District 09 - D Primary|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=231861|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

He was instrumental in helping establish a [[Carnegie library]] in Rutherford College, the first free public library in [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]].<ref name=Phifer />{{RP|305}}

In 1938, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] named him an "American Ambassador of Sunshine."<ref name=NCpedia>{{cite web|title=Arthur Talmage Abernethy|url=http://ncpedia.org/biography/poetslaureate/abernethy|work=NCpedia|publisher=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> That same year, Governor [[Clyde R. Hoey]] declared Abernethy to be an honorary citizen for life of [[Charlotte]], [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]], [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], and [[Valdese, North Carolina]].<ref name="Heritage of BC" />

===Later life and poet laureateship===
Abernethy turned to the ministry later in life, becoming pastor of several churches including First Methodist Church, [[Belmont, New York]]; a church in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; and just prior to retirement, Asheville Christian Church. He returned to North Carolina, becoming mayor of the town of Rutherford College for a time and a [[magistrate]].<ref name=DNCB /> As magistrate and later, Justice of the Peace, he frequently filed his reports with the Clerk of Court in verse.<ref name="Heritage of BC" />

Throughout his life, Abernethy wrote many books and had many poems published. By his own account, he had written 50 books and over 3,000 poems.<ref name="past laureates" /> Abernethy was close friends with North Carolina Governor R. Gregg Cherry who appointed him to the poet laureate position in November 1948.<ref name=NCpedia /> Originally, the term of office was supposed to last only a few weeks<ref name=DNCB />—until the end of Cherry's governorship—but Abernethy was reappointed by the next governor, [[William Kerr Scott]], remaining in the post until Governor [[William B. Umstead]] appointed [[James Larkin Pearson]]. It is notable that even though he was named poet laureate, Abernethy had never published any poetry in book form.<ref name="past laureates" />

Abernethy died in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] on May 15, 1956, and is buried at Rutherford College Cemetery.<ref name=DNCB />
