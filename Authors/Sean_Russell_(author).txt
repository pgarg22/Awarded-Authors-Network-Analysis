== Life ==
Sean Russell was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], in 1952. At the age of three his family moved to the outskirts of the city, where they lived in a cottage at the beach of [[Lake Ontario]]. At the age of ten he decided to become an author, and the fantasy genre caught him years later, while reading [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''. After university, he moved to [[Vancouver]], and two years later to [[Vancouver Island]], where he still lives with his family. He published his first novel in 1991.

His first historical [[nautical fiction|naval novel]] ''Under Enemy Colours'', published in 2007, introduced a new Royal Navy hero, Charles Hayden, and HMS ''Themis'', a fictional [[fifth-rate]] ship of the Royal Navy.
