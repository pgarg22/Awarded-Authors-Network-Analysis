'''Charles Boardman Hawes''' ({{daterangedash|January 24, 1889|July 16, 1923|mdy}}<ref name="Bostrom2003">{{cite book|last=Bostrom|first=Kathleen Long|title=Winning Authors: Profiles of the Newbery Medalists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtjKpgdZS00C&pg=PA9|accessdate=23 January 2018|year=2003|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781563088773|page=9}}</ref>) was an American writer of fiction and nonfiction [[sea stories]], best known for three [[historical novels]]. He died suddenly at age 34, after only two of his five books had been published.<ref name=nyt192308/> He was the first U.S.-born winner of the annual [[Newbery Medal]], recognizing his third novel ''[[The Dark Frigate]]'' (1923) as the year's best American children's book. Reviewing the Hawes Memorial Prize Contest in 1925, ''The New York Times'' observed that "his adventure stories of the sea caused him to be compared with [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Stevenson]], [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Dana]] and [[Herman Melville|Melville]]".<ref name=prize1/>

== Life ==

Hawes was the elder son of Charles Taylor Hawes and Martha Tibbetts Boardman. Born in [[Clifton Springs, New York]], he was raised in [[Bangor, Maine]], and graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1911 where he was "editor of ''The Quill'' and a devoted student of the classics".<ref name=ac/> He was a graduate student at Harvard for one year, on the staff of ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' to 1920, and associate editor of ''[[The Open Road for Boys|The Open Road]]'' to his death in 1923.<ref name=ac/> On June 1, 1916, Hawes married Dorothea Cable of [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], the youngest daughter of the novelist [[George Washington Cable]] and Louise Stewart Bartlett. At that time he lived in [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge]] and worked for ''The Youth's Companion''.<ref name=ac/><ref name=nyt/><ref name=bg/>

Hawes' first book was an adventure novel published by [[Atlantic Monthly Press]] and<!--see TALK and Notes defgh --> [[Little, Brown and Company]] in 1920: ''The Mutineers: a tale of old days at sea and of adventures in the Far East as Benjamin Lathrop set it down some sixty years ago''. His second book, ''The Great Quest: a romance of 1826 [...]'' was first runner-up for the inaugural [[Newbery Medal]] in 1922, the first American award for children's books.<ref name=newbery/>{{efn|''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''The Great Quest'' tallied 163 and 22 (or 77% and 10%) of the nominating votes by children's librarians, with 27 votes cast for thirteen other books. That was considered decisive without postal deliberation by the jury.<br> Smith, pp. 40–42.}}

Hawes died suddenly of pneumonic meningitis in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], on July 16, 1923, two days before the publication of ''Gloucester, by Land and Sea'', a 226-page mainly historical book about his chosen home city of  [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].<ref name=nyt192308/><ref name=glouc/> He was survived by his wife and two sons.<ref name=nyt192308/>

He had recently delivered the completed manuscript of ''The Dark Frigate: wherein is told the story of Philip Marsham [...]'', a 17th-century adventure set in England and Barbados as well as at sea. It was published by Atlantic in October and was a ''Boston Globe'' fiction best-seller that fall.<ref name=prize1/><ref name=nyt192309/><ref>''Boston Daily Globe''. October 27 and December 29, 1923.</ref> The children's librarians voted him "author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children", winner of the third annual Newbery Medal and the first for a writer born in the U.S.<ref name=newbery/>{{efn|Van Loon and [[Hugh Lofting]] were immigrants from the Netherlands and England. After 1924 (Hawes), the nominating votes by children's librarians were formally relegated to mere nominations; the committee would deliberate regardless of the tally, in order to secure the high standard. The 1924 tally is unknown and no runner-up was named.<br> Smith, pp. 40–42, 51–53, 124.}}

Hawes dedicated ''The Dark Frigate'' to his father-in-law G. W. Cable and his widow received the Newbery Medal at the [[American Library Association]] conference next summer.<ref name=ac/> ''The Atlanta Constitution'' remarked, "Mr. Hawes' great gift was the ability to write sea stories ... His literary skill in capturing the style and atmosphere of the eighteenth century gained him many adult admirers ... The loss of Mr. Hawes is irreparable. But it is to be hoped that this posthumous recognition may stimulate others to perpetuate the standard he has created."<ref name=ac/> In 1962 ''The Dark Frigate'' was named to the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] list.{{efn|Regarding the first 40 or so Newbery Medal winners, Irene Smith listed ''The Dark Frigate'' among twelve that children's librarians considered "lowest in popularity". In partial explanation she observed that five of those including ''The Dark Frigate'' were "more or less historic and distant in setting".<br> Smith, p. 89.}}

Two articles by Hawes were posthumously published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<!--google books, LC cat--> His wife completed one more book, ''Whaling'', published in 1924. One review of the 358-page<!--LC cat--> history highlighted the remark by Hawes, "Time has given the business a glamour that would astound the luckless victims of its reality".<ref name=whaling/>

== Hawes Memorial Prize Contest ==

In September 1923, Atlantic Monthly Press opened a contest with $2000 prize, plus royalties, for "an adventure story of not less than 60,000 words, of the characters and excellence of the works of the late Charles Boardman Hawes" (quoting a newspaper)<ref name=nyt192309/> The winner was a novel by Clifford MacClellan Sublette, ''The Scarlet Cockerel'' (March 1925).<!--google books https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Scarlet_Cockerel.html?id=NUVUAAAAYAAJ -- also shows a 1927 Little, Brown; both 293pp --> His research before writing concerned "the French–Spanish difficulties in Florida". Sublette was "an agricultural field worker in the summer" who had toured the American West and written adventure short stories. The Press was so pleased with the submissions that it published two runners-up as well as the prize winner simultaneously.<ref name=prize1/> A joint review in ''The New York Times'' called them the Hawes Memorial Prize Contest books.<ref name=prize3/>

One review of ''Gloucester'' observed that Hawes harvests the history of New England from all available sources. He features Gloucester before the Clipper ship—not the "modern corporation of fishmongers" or "the Summer colony of wealthy transients" (quoting the review).<br> &nbsp;

The reviewer struck a sentimental note regarding ''Whaling'' and other books under joint review: "[T]he sailing ship has all but vanished within the memory of living men ...
