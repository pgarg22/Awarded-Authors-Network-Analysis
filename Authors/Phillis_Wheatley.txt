'''Phillis Wheatley Peters,''' also spelled '''Phyllis''' and '''Wheatly''' (c. 1753 – December 5, 1784) was the [[List of African-American firsts|first African-American author of a published book of poetry]].<ref name=Trials5>[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]], ''Trials of Phillis Wheatley: America's First Black Poet and Her Encounters with the Founding Fathers'', Basic Civitas Books, 2010, p. 5.</ref><ref>For example, in the name of the [[Phyllis Wheatley YWCA]] in Washington, D.C., where "Phyllis" is etched into the name over its front door (as can be seen in [http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Photos/83003532.pdf photos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915222434/http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Photos/83003532.pdf |date=September 15, 2016 }} and corresponding [http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/83003532.pdf text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915231951/http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/83003532.pdf |date=September 15, 2016 }} for that building's National Register nomination).</ref> Born in [[West Africa]], she was sold into slavery at the age of seven or eight and transported to North America, where she was bought by the Wheatley family of [[Boston]]. After she learned to read and write, they encouraged her poetry when they saw her talent.

On a 1773 trip to London with her master's son, seeking publication of her work, Wheatley met prominent people who became patrons. The publication in [[London]] of her ''[[Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral]]'' on September 1, 1773, brought her fame both in England and the American colonies. Figures such as [[George Washington]] praised her work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Meehan|first1=Adam|author2=J. L.

Wheatley was [[emancipated]] by her masters shortly after the publication of her book.<ref name="Women 2000, page 123">Smith, Hilda L. (2000), ''Women's Political and Social Thought: An Anthology'', Indiana University Press, p. 123.</ref> They soon died, and she married poor grocer John Peters, lost three children, and died in poverty and obscurity at the age of 31.

==Early life==

Although the date and place of her birth are not documented, scholars believe that Phillis Wheatley was born in 1753 in [[West Africa]], most likely in present-day [[Gambia]] or [[Senegal]].<ref>Carretta, Vincent. ''Complete Writings by Phillis Wheatley,'' New York: Penguin Books, 2001.</ref> She was sold by a local chief to a visiting trader, who took her to Boston in the British [[Colony of Massachusetts]], on July 11, 1761,<ref>Odell, Margaretta M. ''Memoir and Poems of Phillis Wheatley, a Native African and a Slave,'' Boston: Geo. W. Light, 1834.</ref> on a [[slave ship]] called ''The Phillis''.<ref name=Doak>Doak, Robin S. ''Phillis Wheatley: Slave and Poet,'' Minneapolis: Compass Point Books, 2007.</ref> It was owned by Timothy Fitch and captained by Peter Gwinn.<ref name=Doak />

On arrival in Boston, she was bought by the wealthy Boston merchant and tailor John Wheatley as a slave for his wife Susanna. John and Susanna Wheatley named her Phillis, after the ship that had transported her to America. She was given their last name of Wheatley, as was a common custom if any surname was used for enslaved people.<ref>{{cite journal

The Wheatleys' 18-year-old daughter, Mary, was Phillis's first tutor in reading and writing. Their son, Nathaniel, also helped her. John Wheatley was known as a progressive throughout New England; his family afforded Phillis an unprecedented education for an enslaved person, and one unusual for a woman of any race. By the age of 12, she was reading Greek and Latin classics in their original languages, as well as difficult passages from the Bible. At the age of 14, she wrote her first poem, "To the University of Cambridge [Harvard], in New England".<ref name=Brown>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Sterling|title=Negro Poetry and Drama|date=1937|publisher=Westphalia Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1935907549}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral|last = Wheatley|first = Phillis|publisher = W.H.

The Wheatleys often showed off her abilities to friends and family. Strongly influenced by her readings of the works of [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Milton]], [[Homer]], [[Horace]], and [[Virgil]], Phillis began to write poetry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Deborah|title=Freedom on My Mind|date=2015|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston/New York|isbn=978-0-312-64883-1|page=145}}</ref>

==Later life==
In 1773, at the age of 20, Phillis accompanied Nathaniel Wheatley to London in part for her health (she suffered from chronic asthma),<ref name="Phillis Wheatley">{{cite web|title=Phillis Wheatley|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/phillis-wheatley|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref> but largely because Susanna believed Phillis would have a better chance of publishing her book of poems there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Portraits of American Women: From Settlement to the Present|url=https://archive.org/details/portraitsofameri00gjba_0|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/portraitsofameri00gjba_0/page/106 106]|author=Charles Scruggs|chapter=Phillis Wheatley|isbn=978-0-19-512048-6|editor=G.

(An audience with King [[George III]] was arranged, but Phillis returned to Boston before it could take place.) [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], became interested in the talented young African woman and subsidized the publication of Wheatley's volume of poems, which appeared in London in the summer of 1773. As Hastings was ill, she and Phillis never met.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVl_Huh7FbMC |title=Love of Freedom: Black Women in Colonial and Revolutionary New England|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|author=Catherine Adams|author2=Elizabeth H. Pleck|isbn=9780195389081}}</ref>{{page number needed|date=August 2020}}

After her book was published, by November 1773, the Wheatleys emancipated Phillis. Her former enslaver Susanna died in the spring of 1774, and John in 1778. Shortly after, Wheatley met and married John Peters, a [[free people of color|free black]] grocer. They lived in poor conditions and two of their babies died.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Shining Thread of Hope|year=2009|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=26|author=Darlene Clark Hine|author2=Kathleen Thompson|author-link=Darlene Clark Hine|author2-link=Kathleen Thompson}}</ref>

John was improvident and was imprisoned for debt in 1784. With a sickly infant son to provide for, Phillis became a [[scullery maid]] at a boarding house, work she had not done before. She died on December 5, 1784, at the age of 31.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African American Women Writers, Volume 1|page=611|chapter=Phillis Wheatley|editor=Page|year=2007}}</ref> Her infant son died soon after.{{fact|date=October 2021}}

===Other writings===
Phillis Wheatley wrote a letter to Reverend [[Samson Occom]], commending him on his ideas and beliefs stating that enslaved people should be given their natural-born rights in America. Wheatley also exchanged letters with the British philanthropist [[John Thornton (philanthropist)|John Thornton]], who discussed Wheatley and her poetry in correspondence with [[John Newton]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bilbro|first1=Jeffrey|title=Who are lost and how they're found: redemption and theodicy in Wheatley, Newton, and Cowper|journal=[[Early American Literature]]|date=Fall 2012|volume=47|issue=3|pages=570–75|doi=10.1353/eal.2012.0054|s2cid=162875678}}</ref> Along with her poetry, she was able to express her thoughts, comments and concerns to others.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|title=Freedom On My Mind|date=2015|pages=146–147}}</ref>

In 1775, she sent a copy of a poem entitled "To His Excellency, George Washington" to the then-military general. The following year, Washington invited Wheatley to visit him at his headquarters in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which she did in March 1776.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grizzard|first=Frank E.|title=George Washington: A Biographical Companion|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Greenwood, CT|page=349}}</ref> [[Thomas Paine]] republished the poem in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' in April 1776.<ref>{{cite book|title=Unchained Voices: An Anthology of Black Authors in the English-Speaking World of the Eighteenth Century|year=2013|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|location=Louisville|page=70|editor=Vincent Carretta}}</ref>

In 1779 Wheatley issued a proposal for a second volume of poems but was unable to publish it because she had lost her patrons after her emancipation; publication of books was often based on gaining subscriptions for guaranteed sales beforehand. The [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) was also a factor. However, some of her poems that were to be included in the second volume were later published in pamphlets and newspapers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African American Women Writers, Volume 1|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=610|chapter=Phillis Wheatley|editor=Yolanda Williams Page}}</ref>

In 1768, Wheatley wrote "To the King's Most Excellent Majesty", in which she praised King George III for repealing the [[Stamp Act]].<ref name="Women 2000, page 123"/> As the [[American Revolution]] gained strength, Wheatley's writing turned to themes that expressed ideas of the rebellious colonists.

In 1770 Wheatley wrote a poetic tribute to the evangelist [[George Whitefield]]. Her poetry expressed Christian themes, and many poems were dedicated to famous figures. Over one-third consist of [[Elegy|elegies]], the remainder being on religious, classical, and abstract themes.<ref>[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/treasures/american/wheatley.html Phillis Wheatley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131100804/http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/treasures/american/wheatley.html |date=January 31, 2011 }} page, comments on ''[[Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral]]'', University of Delaware.

{{quote|<poem>
Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic dye."
Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

Many colonists found it difficult to believe that an African slave was writing "excellent" poetry. Wheatley had to defend her authorship of her poetry in court in 1772.<ref name="Africana 1999">Henry Louis Gates and Anthony Appiah (eds), ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience,'' Basic Civitas Books, 1999, p. 1171.</ref><ref>[[Ellis Cashmore]], review of ''The Norton Anthology of African-American Literature'', Nellie Y. McKay and Henry Louis Gates, eds, ''New Statesman'', April 25, 1997.</ref> She was examined by a group of Boston luminaries, including [[John Erving]], Reverend [[Charles Chauncy (1705–1787)|Charles Chauncey]], [[John Hancock]], [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], the governor of Massachusetts, and his lieutenant governor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They concluded she had written the poems ascribed to her and signed an [[:wiktionary:attestation|attestation]], which was included in the preface of her book of collected works: ''[[Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral]],'' published in London in 1773. Publishers in Boston had declined to publish it, but her work was of great interest to influential people in London.

There, [[Selina, Countess of Huntingdon]], and the [[Earl of Dartmouth]] acted as patrons to help Wheatley gain publication. Her poetry received comment in ''[[The London Magazine]]'' in 1773, which published as a "specimen" of her work her poem 'Hymn to the Morning', and said: "these poems display no astonishing works of genius, but when we consider them as the productions of a young, untutored African, who wrote them after six months careful study of the English language, we cannot but suppress our admiration for talents so vigorous and lively."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021278604;view=1up;seq=520|title=The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer 1773.|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> ''Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral'' was printed in 11 editions until 1816.<ref>[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], "Phillis Wheatley", in ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', London: Jonathan Cape: 1992, p. 18.</ref>

In 1778, the African-American poet [[Jupiter Hammon]] wrote an [[ode]] to Wheatley ("An Address to Miss Phillis Wheatley").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52292/an-address-to-miss-phillis-wheatley|title=An Address to Miss Phillis Wheatley|first=Jupiter|last=Hammond|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=March 22, 2021}}</ref> His master Lloyd had temporarily moved with his slaves to [[Hartford, Connecticut]], during the Revolutionary War. Hammon thought that Wheatley had succumbed to what he believed were pagan influences in her writing, and so his "Address" consisted of 21 rhyming quatrains, each accompanied by a related Bible verse, that he thought would compel Wheatley to return to a Christian path in life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_q6VhhkczIYWjB5VEc4OVdIdHc/view?usp=sharing|author=Faherty, Duncan F.|title=Hammon, Jupiter|publisher=[[American National Biography Online]]|access-date=November 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127090658/https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_q6VhhkczIYWjB5VEc4OVdIdHc/view?usp=sharing|archive-date=November 27, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1838 Boston-based publisher and abolitionist [[Isaac Knapp]] published a collection of Wheatley's poetry, along with that of enslaved North Carolina poet [[George Moses Horton]], under the title ''Memoir and Poems of Phillis Wheatley, A Native African and a Slave. Also, Poems by a Slave''.<ref>Cavitch, Max. ''American Elegy: The Poetry of Mourning from the Puritans to Whitman''. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2007: 193. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-4892-4}}.</ref> Wheatley's memoir was earlier published in 1834 by Geo W. Light but did not include poems by Horton.

Thomas Jefferson, in his book ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]],'' was unwilling to acknowledge the value of her work or the work of any black poet. He wrote:<blockquote>Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry. Love is the peculiar oestrum of the poet. Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses only, not the imagination. Religion indeed has produced a Phyllis Whately but it could not produce a poet. The compositions published under her name are below the dignity of criticism.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|date=1781|title=Notes on the State of Virginia|url=https://www.pbs.org/jefferson/archives/documents/frame_ih198156.htm|website=PBS|page=234}}</ref></blockquote>

==Style, structure, and influences on poetry==
Wheatley believed that the power of poetry was immeasurable.<ref name="jstor.org">Shields, John C. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 Phillis Wheatley's Use of Classicism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409174457/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 |date=April 9, 2016 }}, ''American Literature'' 52.1 (1980): 97–111. Retrieved November 2, 2009, p. 101.</ref> John C. Shields, noting that her poetry did not simply reflect the literature she read but was based on her personal ideas and beliefs, writes:
<blockquote>"Wheatley had more in mind than simple conformity. It will be shown later that her allusions to the sun god and to the goddess of the morn, always appearing as they do here in close association with her quest for poetic inspiration, are of central importance to her."</blockquote>This poem is arranged into three stanzas of four lines in [[iambic tetrameter]], followed by a concluding couplet in [[iambic pentameter]]. The [[rhyme scheme]] is ABABCC.<ref name="jstor.org"/><ref name="Shields, John C 1980 page 100">Shields, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 "Phillis Wheatley's Use of Classicism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409174457/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 |date=April 9, 2016 }}, ''American Literature'' 52.1 (1980), p. 100.</ref> Shields sums up her writing as being "contemplative and reflective rather than brilliant and shimmering."<ref name="Shields, John C 1980 page 100"/>

She repeated three primary elements: Christianity, classicism, and hierophantic solar worship.<ref name="Shields, John C 1980 page 103">Shields, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 "Phillis Wheatley's Use of Classicism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409174457/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 |date=April 9, 2016 }}, ''American Literature'' 52.1 (1980), p. 103.</ref> The hierophantic solar worship was part of what she brought with her from Africa; the worship of sun gods is expressed as part of her African culture, which may be why she used so many different words for the sun.  For instance, she uses Aurora eight times, "Apollo seven, Phoebus twelve, and Sol twice."<ref name="Shields, John C 1980 page 103"/> Shields believes that the word "light" is significant to her as it marks her African history, a past that she has left physically behind.<ref name="Shields, John C 1980 page 103"/> He notes that Sun is a homonym for Son, and that Wheatley intended a double reference to Christ.<ref name="Shields, John C 1980 page 103"/> Wheatley also refers to "heav'nly muse" in two of her poems: "To a Clergy Man on the Death of his Lady" and "Isaiah LXIII," signifying her idea of the Christian deity.<ref>Shields, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 "Phillis Wheatley's Use of Classicism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409174457/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 |date=April 9, 2016 }}, ''American Literature'' 52.1 (1980), p. 102.</ref>

Classical allusions are prominent in Wheatley's poetry, which Shields argues set her work apart from that of her contemporaries: "Wheatley's use of classicism distinguishes her work as original and unique and deserves extended treatment."<ref>Shields, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 "Phillis Wheatley's Use of Classicism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409174457/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2925190?seq=5 |date=April 9, 2016 }}, ''American Literature'' 52.1 (1980), p. 98.</ref> Particularly extended engagement with the Classics can be found in the poem "To Maecenas", where Wheatley uses references to [[Maecenas]] to depict the relationship between her and her own patrons,<ref name="Greenwood">{{cite book |last=Greenwood |first=Emily |editor-last1=Hall |editor-first1=Edith |editor-last2=McConnell |editor-first2=Justine |editor-last3=Alston |editor-first3=Richard |title=Ancient Slavery and Abolition.

<blockquote>The happier Terence all the choir inspir'd,<br>
His soul replenish'd, and his bosom fir'd;<br>
But say, ye Muses, why this partial grace,<br>
To one alone of Afric's sable race;<ref name="Greenwood" />{{rp|168}}</blockquote>
While some scholars have argued that Wheatley's allusions to classical material are based on the reading of other [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] poetry (such as the works of [[Alexander Pope]]), [[Emily Greenwood]] has demonstrated that Wheatley's work demonstrates persistent linguistic engagement with Latin texts, suggesting good familiarity with the ancient works themselves.<ref name="Greenwood" />{{rp|159–62}} Both Shields and Greenwood have argued that Wheatley's use of classical imagery and ideas was designed to deliver "subversive" messages to her educated, majority white audience, and argue for the freedom of Wheatley herself and other enslaved people.<ref name="Greenwood" />{{rp|170–2}}<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=John C. |title=Phillis Wheatley's Subversion of Classical Stylistics |journal=Style |date=1993 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=252–270 |jstor=42946040 |issn=0039-4238 }}</ref>{{rp|252}}

== Scholarly critique ==
Black literary scholars from the 1960s to the present in critiquing Wheatley's writing have noted the absence in it of her sense of identity as a black enslaved person.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Reising, Russell.|title=Loose ends : closure and crisis in the American social text|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-1891-1|location=Durham, N.C.|oclc=34875703}}</ref> A number of black literary scholars have viewed her work—and its widespread admiration—as a barrier to the development of black people during her time and as a prime example of [[Uncle Tom syndrome]], believing that Wheatley's lack of awareness of her condition of enslavement furthers this syndrome among descendants of Africans in the Americas.<ref name=":0" />

Some scholars thought Wheatley's perspective came from her upbringing. The Wheatley family took interest in her at a young age because of her timid and submissive nature.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eleanor|date=1974|title=Phillis Wheatley: A Black Perspective|journal=The Journal of Negro Education |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=401–407 |doi=10.2307/2966531|jstor=2966531}}</ref> Using this to their advantage, the Wheatley family was able to mold and shape her into a person of their liking.<ref name=":1" /> The family separated her from other slaves in the home and she was prevented from doing anything other than very light housework.<ref name=":1" />  This shaping prevented Phillis from ever becoming a threat to the Wheatley family or other people from the white community.<ref name=":1" />  As a result, Phillis was allowed to attend white social events and this created a misconception of the relationship between black and white people for her.<ref name=":1" />

The matter of Wheatley's biography, "a white woman's memoir", has been a subject of investigation. In 2020, American poet [[Honorée Fanonne Jeffers]] published her ''The Age of Phillis'', based on the understanding that Margaretta Matilda Odell's account of Wheatley's life portrayed Wheatley inaccurately, and as a character in a sentimental novel; the poems by Jeffers attempt to fill in the gaps and recreate a more realistic portrait of Wheatley.<ref name=winkler>{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-phillis-wheatley-was-recovered-through-history |title=How Phillis Wheatley Was Recovered Through History: For decades, a white woman's memoir shaped our understanding of America's first Black poet.
