== Biography ==
Conlon-McKenna was born in [[Dublin]] and raised in [[Goatstown]]. She attended school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Mount Anville. She excelled at school but deferred a place at university to care for her father.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/a-woman-s-place-1.235796|title=A woman's place|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>

She married James McKenna at age 20 and had jobs in the family business, in a bank, and with a travel agency.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" /> She took an interest in writing and enrolled in writing classes in UCD, including courses in Anglo-Irish literature, women's studies and children's literature.<ref name=":2" />

While a mother of young children, she began writing a picture book for her daughter. She credits Dr Pat Donlon, director of the Children's Literature course, with encouraging and supporting her to publish her work.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> The inspiration for her first children's novel ''Under the Hawthorn Tree'' came when she heard a radio report on the discovery of an unmarked grave under a hawthorn tree, where three children from the Famine era were buried.<ref name=":0" /> ''Under the Hawthorn Tree'' was a worldwide success and sold over 250,000 copies in the Irish market alone, earning its status as a classic children's novel.<ref name=":1" />

Conlon-McKenna went on to write more books for young readers. Her characters are often depicted in challenging situations or life events. Among her historical children's books are ''Safe Harbour'', set during [[World War II]], which was shortlisted for the [[CBI Book of the Year Awards|Bisto Book of the Year Award]], and two follow-up books to ''Under the Hawthorn Tree: Wildflower Girl'' and ''Fields of Home'', which completed the ''Children of the Famine'' trilogy. Other children's books include ''The Blue Horse'', which won the Bisto Irish Book of the Year Award and reached the top of the bestseller's list in 1993,<ref name=":0" /> ''No Goodbye'', and ''A Girl Called Blue''.

Her debut novel for adults, ''The Magdalen'', was a number-one bestseller in 1999, telling the story of a young pregnant woman sent to a [[Magdalene Laundries in Ireland|Magdalene Laundry]] in 1950s Ireland.<ref name=":1" /> Conlon-McKenna said that she naturally made a shift from children to adult's writing when she decided to write a story about the Magdalene Laundries.<ref name=":2" /> This subject interested her because of her personal adoption story.<ref name=":4" />

Conlon-McKenna carried out extensive historical research for her 1916-era novel ''Rebel Sisters''. Based on real-life Gifford sisters [[Nellie Gifford|Nellie]], Muriel and [[Grace Gifford|Grace]], who were involved in the [[Easter Rising|1916 Rising]] in Dublin, ''Rebel Sisters'' became a number-one bestseller when it was released in 2016 on the centenary year of the 1916 Rising.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/books-gripping-true-story-of-the-gifford-girls-34385789.html|title=Books: Gripping true story of the Gifford girls|website=Independent.ie|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>

In 2020, Conlon-McKenna published ''The Hungry Road'', a historical novel set in [[Skibbereen]], Co. Cork during the Great Famine. Published 30 years after ''Under the Hawthorn Tree'', ''The Hungry Road'' was inspired partly by the diaries of Dr Daniel Donovan, a dispensary doctor in the Skibbereen Workhouse during the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/culture/2020/0114/1107337-back-to-the-famine-marita-conlon-mckenna-on-the-hungry-road/|title=Back to the Famine: Marita Conlon-McKenna on The Hungry Road|last=|first=|date=|website=RTE.ie/culture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=15 January 2020|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref>
