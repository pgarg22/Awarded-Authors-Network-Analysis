'''Roald Dahl'''{{efn|name=pronounce}} (13 September 1916&nbsp;– 23 November 1990) was a British novelist, short-story writer, poet, screenwriter, and wartime [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot.{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|p=19|ref=none}} His books have sold more than 250&nbsp;million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Nunis|2016}}

Dahl was born in [[Wales]] to affluent [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] immigrant parents, and spent most of his life in [[England]]. He served in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) during the [[Second World War]]. He became a fighter pilot and, subsequently, an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting [[wing commander]]. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors.<ref name=Global/><ref name=BDC/> He has been referred to as "one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century".<ref name=IND/> His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]] and the [[Specsavers National Book Awards|British Book Awards']] Children's Author of the Year in 1990. Though he and his work have been criticised for [[antisemitism]], [[racism]] and [[misogyny]], in 2008, ''The Times'' placed Dahl 16th on its list of "The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".<ref name=TIM />

Dahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his children's books for their unsentimental, macabre, often darkly comic mood, featuring villainous adult enemies of the child characters.<ref name=INT/>{{sfn|Criado|2014}} His children's books champion the kindhearted and feature an underlying warm sentiment.{{sfn|Hamlin |2015}}{{sfn|de Castella|2011}} His works for children include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'', ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'', ''[[The BFG]]'', ''[[The Twits]]'', and ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]''. His adult works include ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (short story collection)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
[[File:Roald Dahl Asta Else Alfhild Cardiff 1927A.jpg|thumb|160px|Dahl at age 10 with his sisters Alfhild, Else and Asta. [[Cardiff]], 1927.]]
Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in [[Llandaff]], [[Cardiff]], Wales, to Norwegians Harald Dahl (1863–1920) and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (''née'' Hesselberg) (1885–1967).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vestraat.net/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I87052&tree=IEA |title=Harald Dahl b. 1863 Sarpsborg, Østfold d. 1920 Wales: Erik Berntsens slektssider |last=Berntsen |first=Erik |date=2020-10-21 |website=Erik Berntsens slektssider |access-date=2020-10-21 }}</ref>{{sfn|Howard|2017}} Dahl's father, a wealthy [[shipbroker]], had immigrated to the UK from [[Sarpsborg]] in Norway and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s with his first wife, a Frenchwoman named Marie Beaurin-Gresser. They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907.<ref name="Dahl timeline"/> His mother immigrated to the UK and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else. The children were raised in Norway's Lutheran state church, the [[Church of Norway]], and were baptised at the [[Norwegian Church, Cardiff]].{{sfn|Palfrey|2006|p=76}} His grandmother Ellen Wallace was a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dahl |first= Roald|date=1999 |title=I Roald Dahls kjøkken|chapter=Min mor |location=Oslo |publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]] |page=65 |isbn= 8205256136}}</ref>

BBC. Retrieved 24 December 2014.</ref>]]
Dahl's sister Astri died from appendicitis at age 7 in 1920 when Dahl was 3 years old, and his father died of pneumonia at age 57 several weeks later.<ref name="biography"/> Later that year, his youngest sister, Asta, was born.<ref name="Dahl timeline" /> Upon his death, Harald Dahl left a fortune assessed for probate of £158,917 10s. 0d.

Dahl first attended [[The Cathedral School, Llandaff]]. At age eight, he and four of his friends were [[caning|caned]] by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of [[gobstoppers]] at the local sweet shop,<ref name=IND/> which was owned by a "mean and loathsome" old woman named Mrs Pratchett.<ref name=IND/> The five boys named their prank the "[[Boy (book)#Great mouse plot of 1924|Great Mouse Plot of 1924]]".{{sfn|Sharp|2005|p=516}} Gobstoppers were a favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, and Dahl referred to them in his fictional [[Everlasting Gobstopper]] which was featured in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.{{sfn|Ayto|2012|p=154}}

Dahl transferred to St Peter's boarding school in [[Weston-super-Mare]]. His parents had wanted him to be educated at an [[Public school (United Kingdom)|English public school]], and this proved to be the nearest because of the regular [[Aust Ferry|ferry link]] across the [[Bristol Channel]]. Dahl's time at St Peter's was unpleasant; he was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed his unhappiness to her. After her death in 1967, he learned that she had saved every one of his letters;<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/roald-dahl/pages/media-2000-school.shtml | title= Roald Dahl's School Days | publisher=BBC Wales | access-date=24 January 2010}}</ref> they were broadcast in abridged form as BBC Radio 4's ''[[Book of the Week]]'' in 2016 to mark the centenary of his birth.<ref name="BBC Book of the Week 2016" /> Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter's in his autobiography ''[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]]''.{{sfn|Dahl|2013|pp=85—161}}

=== Repton School ===
[[File:Repton_School_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1303684.jpg|thumb|Dahl attended [[Repton School]] in Derbyshire from 1929 to 1934|alt=Repton School, Derbyshire]]
From 1929, when he was 13, Dahl attended [[Repton School]] in Derbyshire. Dahl disliked the hazing and described an environment of ritual cruelty and status domination, with younger boys having to act as [[fagging|personal servants]] for older boys, frequently subject to terrible beatings. His biographer Donald Sturrock described these violent experiences in Dahl's early life.<ref name="Dahl" /> Dahl expresses some of these darker experiences in his writings, which is also marked by his hatred of cruelty and [[corporal punishment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/webschuk.htm|title=WEB LINKS: corporal punishment in British schools|website=www.corpun.com|access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

According to Dahl's autobiography, ''[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]]'', a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster [[Geoffrey Fisher]]. Writing in that same book, Dahl reflected: "All through my school life I was appalled by the fact that masters and senior boys were allowed literally to wound other boys, and sometimes quite severely... I couldn’t get over it. I never have got over it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/boarding-school-magic/#!|title=Boarding School Magic |work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=6 July 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Fisher was later appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|crowned]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. However, according to Dahl's biographer [[Jeremy Treglown]],{{sfn|Treglown|2016|loc=Ch.2 note 28}} the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton; the headmaster was in fact [[John Traill Christie|J. T. Christie]], Fisher's successor as headmaster. Dahl said the incident caused him to "have doubts about religion and even about God".{{sfn|Dahl|2013|p=178}}

He was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report "I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rdahl.htm |title=Roald Dahl |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rdahl.htm |archive-date=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Dahl was exceptionally tall, reaching {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in adult life.<ref>[http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000008184,00.html Roald Dahl&nbsp;– Penguin UK Authors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201173227/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000008184,00.html |date=1 December 2007 }}&nbsp;– Penguin UK</ref> He played sports including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]] and [[golf]], and was made captain of the [[Squash (sport)|squash]] team.{{sfn|Shavick|1997|p=12}} As well as having a passion for literature, he developed an interest in photography and often carried a camera with him.<ref name="biography" />

During his years at Repton, the [[Cadbury]] chocolate company occasionally sent boxes of new chocolates to the school to be tested by the pupils.<ref>{{cite news|title=Repton School 'helped inspire Dahl' to write Charlie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-14896806|publisher=BBC|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Dahl dreamt of inventing a new chocolate bar that would win the praise of [[Cadbury family|Mr Cadbury]] himself; this inspired him in writing his third children's book, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), and to refer to chocolate in other children's books.<ref name="DahlChocolate" />

Throughout his childhood and adolescent years, Dahl spent the majority of his summer holidays with his mother's family in [[Norway]]. He wrote about many happy memories from those visits in ''Boy: Tales of Childhood'', such as when he replaced the tobacco in his half-sister's fiancé's pipe with goat droppings.{{sfn|Dahl|2013|pp=156–158}} He noted only one unhappy memory of his holidays in Norway: at around the age of eight, he had to have his [[adenoid]]s removed by a doctor.{{sfn|Dahl|2013|pp=80–82}} His childhood and first job selling kerosene in [[Midsomer Norton]] and surrounding villages in [[Somerset]] are subjects in ''Boy: Tales of Childhood''.{{sfn|Dahl|2013|p=213}}

=== After school ===
After finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the {{RMS|Nova Scotia|1926|6}} and hiked through [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] with the [[British Exploring Society|Public Schools Exploring Society]].{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|pp=93–94|ref=none}}<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149746/Roald-Dahl|title=Roald Dahl (British author)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref>

In July 1934, Dahl joined the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Petroleum]] Company. Following two years of training in the United Kingdom, he was assigned first to [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], then to [[Dar-es-Salaam]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] (now part of Tanzania). Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in [[wikt:Special:Search/luxury|luxury]] in the Shell House outside [[Dar es Salaam]], with a cook and personal [[servants]]. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered [[black mamba]] snakes and [[lions]], among other [[wildlife]].{{sfn|Dahl|2013|p=217}}

==Fighter pilot==
[[File:Roald Dahl's leather flying helmet.jpg|thumb|Dahl's leather flying helmet on display in the [[Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre]] in Great Missenden|alt=Dahl's flying helmet]]
In August 1939, as the Second World War loomed, the British made plans to round up the hundreds of [[Germans]] living in [[Dar-es-Salaam]]. Dahl was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] into the [[King's African Rifles]], commanding a platoon of [[Askari]] men, indigenous troops who were serving in the colonial army.{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|p=116|ref=none}}

In November 1939, Dahl joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as an [[aircraftman]] with service number 774022.<ref name="LG5907" /> After a {{convert|600|mi|km|adj=on}} car journey from [[Dar es Salaam]] to [[Nairobi]], he was accepted for flight training with sixteen other men, of whom only three survived the war. With seven hours and 40 minutes experience in a [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]], he flew solo;{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|p=120|ref=none}} Dahl enjoyed watching the [[wildlife]] of [[Kenya]] during his flights. He continued to advanced flying training in [[Iraq]], at [[RAF Habbaniya]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of [[Baghdad]]. Following six months' training on [[Hawker Hart]]s, Dahl was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[pilot officer]] on 24 August 1940, and was judged ready to join a [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] and face the enemy.<ref name="LG5907"/>{{sfn|Conant|2008|p=3}}

[[File:Gloster Gladiator.jpg|thumb|Dahl was flying a [[Gloster Gladiator]] when he crash landed in Libya|alt=A Gloster Gladiator plane]]

He was assigned to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF]], flying obsolete [[Gloster Gladiator]]s, the last [[biplane]] [[fighter aircraft]] used by the RAF. Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in [[aerial combat]] or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl was ordered to fly his Gladiator by stages from Abu Sueir (near [[Ismailia]], in Egypt) to 80 Squadron's forward [[airstrip]] {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Mersa Matruh]]. On the final leg, he could not find the airstrip and, running low on [[fuel]] and with night approaching, he was forced to attempt a [[Accidents and incidents in aviation#Causes|landing]] in the desert.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7934421/Roald-Dahl-the-plane-crash-that-gave-birth-to-a-writer.html|title=Roald Dahl: the plane crash that gave birth to a writer|date=9 August 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 September 2014|last1=Sturrock|first1=Donald}}</ref> The undercarriage hit a boulder and the aircraft crashed. Dahl's skull was fractured and his nose was smashed; he was temporarily blinded.{{sfn|Warren|1988|pp=12, 87}} He managed to drag himself away from the blazing wreckage and lost consciousness. He wrote about the crash in his first published work.{{sfn|Warren|1988|pp=12, 87}}

Dahl was rescued and taken to a [[first aid|first-aid]] post in [[Mersa Matruh]], where he regained [[consciousness]], but not his [[sight]]. He was transported by [[train]] to the [[Royal Navy]] hospital in [[Alexandria]]. There he fell in and out of love with a nurse, Mary Welland. A RAF [[inquiry]] into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was completely wrong, and he had mistakenly been sent instead to the [[no man's land]] between the Allied and Italian forces.{{sfn|Dahl|1988|p=103}}

[[File:Hurricane_mk1_r4118_fairford_arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk 1, the aircraft type in which Dahl engaged in aerial combat over Greece.|alt=A Hawker Hurricane Mk 1]]

In February 1941, Dahl was discharged from the hospital and deemed fully fit for flying duties. By this time, 80 Squadron had been transferred to the [[Battle of Greece|Greek campaign]] and based at [[Eleusina]], near [[Athens]]. The squadron was now equipped with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s. Dahl flew a replacement Hurricane across the Mediterranean Sea in April 1941, after seven hours' experience flying Hurricanes. By this stage in the Greek campaign, the RAF had only 18 combat aircraft in Greece: 14 Hurricanes and four [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers. Dahl flew in his first aerial combat on 15 April 1941, while flying alone over the city of [[Chalcis]]. He attacked six [[Junkers Ju 88]]s that were bombing ships and shot one down. On 16 April in another air battle, he shot down another Ju 88.{{sfn|Thomas|2003|p=36}}

On 20 April 1941, Dahl took part in the [[Battle of Athens (1941)|Battle of Athens]], alongside the highest-scoring British Commonwealth ace of World War II, [[Pat Pattle]], and Dahl's friend [[David Coke]]. Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle. Greek observers on the ground counted 22 German aircraft downed, but because of the confusion of the aerial engagement, none of the pilots knew which aircraft they had shot down. Dahl described it as "an endless blur of enemy fighters whizzing towards me from every side".{{sfn|Dahl|1988|p=151}}

In May, as the Germans were pressing on Athens, Dahl was evacuated to Egypt. His squadron was reassembled in [[Haifa]]. From there, Dahl flew sorties every day for a period of four weeks, shooting down a [[Vichy French Air Force]] [[Potez 63]] on 8 June and another Ju 88 on 15 June, but he began to get severe headaches that caused him to black out. He was invalided home to Britain where he stayed with his mother in [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Roald Dahl: The fighter pilot |url=https://www.roalddahl.com/blog/2015/november/roald-dahl-the-fighter-pilot |access-date=21 January 2020 |website=Roald Dahl.com}}</ref> Though at this time Dahl was only a pilot officer on probation, in September 1941 he was simultaneously confirmed as a [[pilot officer]] and promoted to war substantive [[flying officer]].<ref name=LG35292 />

==Diplomat, writer and intelligence officer==
After being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in [[Uxbridge]]. He attempted to recover his health enough to become an instructor.{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|p=163|ref=none}} In late March 1942, while in London, he met the [[Under-Secretary of State for Air]], Major [[Harold Balfour]], at his club. Impressed by Dahl's war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed the young man as assistant air attaché at the [[British Embassy]] in Washington, D.C. Initially resistant, Dahl was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the {{MS|Batory}} from Glasgow a few days later. He arrived in Halifax, Canada, on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to [[Montreal]].{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|p=165|ref=none}}

Coming from war-starved Britain (in what was a wartime period of [[rationing in the United Kingdom]]), Dahl was amazed by the wealth of food and amenities to be had in North America.{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|pp=163–165|ref=none}} Arriving in Washington a week later, Dahl found he liked the atmosphere of the US capital. He shared a house with another attaché at 1610 34th Street, NW, in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. But after ten days in his new posting, Dahl strongly disliked it, feeling he had taken on "a most ungodly unimportant job".{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|pp=166–167|ref=none}} He later explained, "I'd just come from the war. People were getting killed. I had been flying around, seeing horrible things. Now, almost instantly, I found myself in the middle of a pre-war cocktail party in America."{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|p=167|ref=none}}

Dahl was unimpressed by his office in the British Air Mission, attached to the embassy. He was also unimpressed by the ambassador, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], with whom he sometimes played tennis and whom he described as "a courtly English gentleman". Dahl socialized with Charles E. Marsh, a Texas publisher and oilman, at his house at 2136 R Street, NW, and the Marsh country estate in Virginia.<!-- Also at this time he joined the [[British Security Coordination]], that covertly sought to influence US policy to favor Great Britain. -->{{sfn|Dahl|1986}}<ref name=Dietsch_2013 /> As part of his duties as assistant air attaché, Dahl was to help neutralise the isolationist views still held by many Americans by giving pro-British speeches and discussing his war service; the United States had entered the war only the previous December, following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Conant|2008|p=3}}

At this time Dahl met the noted British novelist [[C. S. Forester]], who was also working to aid the British war effort. Forester worked for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Information]] and was writing propaganda for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cause, mainly for American consumption.{{sfn|Head|2006|p=269}} ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' had asked Forester to write a story based on Dahl's flying experiences; Forester asked Dahl to write down some RAF anecdotes so that he could shape them into a story. After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it.<ref name="BBC Studios 2016" /> He originally titled the article as "A Piece of Cake" but the magazine changed it to "Shot Down Over Libya" to make it sound more dramatic, although Dahl had not been shot down; it was published on 1 August 1942 issue of the ''Post''. Dahl was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] (war-substantive) in August 1942.<ref name=LG35971 /> Later he worked with such other well-known British officers as [[Ian Fleming]] (who later published the popular ''James Bond'' series) and [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]], promoting Britain's interests and message in the US and combating the "[[America First Committee|America First]]" movement.{{sfn|Conant|2008|p=3}}

This work introduced Dahl to espionage and the activities of the Canadian spymaster [[William Stephenson]], known by the codename "Intrepid".{{sfn|Schoeck|2006|p=221}} During the war, Dahl supplied intelligence from Washington to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. As Dahl later said: "My job was to try to help Winston to get on with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]], and tell Winston what was in the old boy's mind."<ref name="BBC Studios 2016">The Marvellous World of Roald Dahl. BBC Studios. 2016</ref> Dahl also supplied intelligence to Stephenson and his organisation, known as [[British Security Coordination]], which was part of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]].<ref name=Dietsch_2013/> Dahl was once sent back to Britain by British Embassy officials, supposedly for misconduct—"I got booted out by the big boys," he said. Stephenson promptly sent him back to Washington—with a promotion to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] rank.{{sfn|MacDonald|2001|p=249}} Toward the end of the war, Dahl wrote some of the history of the secret organisation; he and Stephenson remained friends for decades after the war.{{sfn|MacDonald|2001|p=243}}

Upon the war's conclusion, Dahl held the rank of a temporary wing commander (substantive flight lieutenant). Owing to the severity of his injuries from the 1940 accident, he was pronounced unfit for further service and was invalided out of the RAF in August 1946. He left the service with the substantive rank of [[squadron leader]].<ref name=LG37681sup /> His record of five aerial victories, qualifying him as a [[flying ace]], has been confirmed by post-war research and cross-referenced in Axis records. It is most likely that he scored more than those victories during 20 April 1941, when 22 German aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Shores|Williams|2008|p=206}}

On 5 December 1960, four-month-old Theo Dahl was severely injured when his baby carriage was struck by a taxicab in New York City. For a time, he suffered from [[hydrocephalus]]. As a result, his father became involved in the development of what became known as the "[[Wade-Dahl-Till valve|Wade-Dahl-Till]]" (or WDT) valve, a device to improve the [[Cerebral shunt|shunt]] used to alleviate the condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2005/07/water_on_the_br.html|title=Water on the Brain|date=15 July 2005|access-date=11 May 2006|work=MedGadget: Internet Journal of Emerging Medical Technologies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522112305/http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2005/07/water_on_the_br.html|archive-date=22 May 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{sfn|Larner|2008|p=22}} The valve was a collaboration between Dahl, hydraulic engineer Stanley Wade, and London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] neurosurgeon Kenneth Till, and was used successfully on almost 3,000 children around the world.<ref name="Olivia" />

In November 1962, Dahl's daughter [[Death of Olivia Dahl|Olivia]] died of [[Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis|measles encephalitis]], age seven. Her death left Dahl "limp with despair", and feeling guilty about not having been able to do anything for her.<ref name="Olivia"/> Dahl subsequently became a proponent of [[immunisation]] and dedicated his 1982 book ''[[The BFG]]'' to his daughter.<ref>Singh, Anita (7 August 2010) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7930637/Roald-Dahls-secret-notebook-reveals-heartbreak-over-daughters-death.html "Roald Dahl's secret notebook reveals heartbreak over daughter's death"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

In 1965, his wife Patricia Neal suffered three burst [[cerebral aneurysm]]s while pregnant with their fifth child, Lucy. Dahl took control of her rehabilitation over the next months; Neal had to re-learn to talk and walk, but she managed to return to her acting career.{{sfn|Farrell|1971|p=}} This period of their lives was dramatised in the film ''The Patricia Neal Story'' (1981), in which the couple were played by [[Glenda Jackson]] and [[Dirk Bogarde]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/aug/09/patricia-neal-beauty|title=Patricia Neal: a beauty that cut like a knife|author=David Thomson|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=16 September 2014|date=9 August 2010}}</ref>

==Writing==
[[File:Deviousdahl.jpg|right|thumb|Roald Dahl's story "The Devious Bachelor" was illustrated by Frederick Siebel when it was published in ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' (September 1953).]]

Dahl's first published work, inspired by a meeting with [[C. S. Forester]], was "A Piece of Cake", on 1 August 1942. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by ''The Saturday Evening Post'' for US$1,000 (a substantial sum in 1942) and published under the title "Shot Down Over Libya".{{sfn|Ruffin|2006|p=17}}

His first children's book was ''[[The Gremlins]]'', published in 1943, about mischievous little creatures that were part of Royal Air Force folklore.{{sfn|Donald|2008|p=147}} The RAF pilots blamed the [[gremlin]]s for all the problems with the aircraft.{{sfn|Sasser|1971|p=1094}} While at the British Embassy in Washington, Dahl sent a copy to the [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] who read it to her grandchildren,{{sfn|Donald|2008|p=147}} and the book was commissioned by [[Walt Disney]] for a film that was never made.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/20/roalddahl|title=Dahl's Gremlins fly again, thanks to historian's campaign|first=Nick|last=Tanner|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=16 September 2014|date=20 December 2006}}</ref> Dahl went on to write some of the best-loved children's stories of the 20th century, such as ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'', ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'', ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'', ''[[The BFG]]'', ''[[The Twits]]'' and ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]''.<ref name="IND" />

Dahl also had a successful parallel career as the writer of macabre adult short stories, which often blended humour and innocence with surprising plot twists.{{sfn|Maunder|2007|p=96}} The [[Mystery Writers of America]] presented Dahl with three [[Edgar Awards]] for his work, and many were originally written for American magazines such as ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' ("The Collector's Item" was ''Collier's'' Star Story of the week for 4 September 1948), ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roald Dahl Day: From Tales of the Unexpected to Switch Bitch, Dahl's undervalued stories for adults |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/roald-dahl-day-adult-books-tales-unexpected-switch-bitch-kiss-kiss-short-stories-a7944351.html |work=The Independent|date=6 October 2017}}</ref> Works such as ''[[Kiss Kiss (book)|Kiss Kiss]]'' subsequently collected Dahl's stories into anthologies, and gained significant popularity. Dahl wrote [[List of Roald Dahl short stories|more than 60 short stories]]; they have appeared in numerous collections, some only being published in book form after his death. His three Edgar Awards were given for: in 1954, the collection ''Someone Like You''; in 1959, the story "[[The Landlady (Roald Dahl)|The Landlady]]"; and in 1980, the episode of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' based on "[[Skin (short story)|Skin]]".{{sfn|Maunder|2007|p=96}}

One of his more famous adult stories, "The Smoker", also known as "[[Man from the South]]", was filmed twice as both 1960 and 1985 episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', filmed as a 1979 episode of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', and also adapted into [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s segment of the film ''[[Four Rooms]]'' (1995).{{sfn|Mottram|2006|p=95}} This oft-anthologised classic concerns a man in Jamaica who wagers with visitors in an attempt to claim the fingers from their hands.

Dahl was credited with teleplay for two episodes, and four of his episodes were directed by Hitchcock himself, an example of which was "[[Lamb to the Slaughter]]" (1958).

Dahl acquired a traditional [[Romanichal]] [[vardo (Romani wagon)|vardo]] in the 1960s, and the family used it as a playhouse for his children at home in [[Great Missenden]], Buckinghamshire. He later used the vardo as a writing room, where he wrote ''[[Danny, the Champion of the World]]'' in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gypsywaggons.co.uk/varsuk.htm |title=English Gypsy caravan, Gypsy Wagon, Gypsy Waggon and Vardo: Photograph Gallery 1 |publisher=Gypsywaggons.co.uk |access-date=28 January 2011}}</ref> Dahl incorporated a Gypsy wagon into the main plot of the book, where the young English boy, Danny, and his father, William (played by [[Jeremy Irons]] in the film adaptation) live in a vardo.{{sfn|Dahl|2010|p=13}} Many other scenes and characters from Great Missenden are reflected in his work.

The last book published in his lifetime, ''[[Esio Trot]]'', released in January 1990, marked a change in style for the author.

}}
Dahl's children's works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult [[villain]]s who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one "good" adult to counteract the villain(s).<ref name="IND" /> These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the [[boarding school]]s he attended.<ref name="IND" /> Dahl's books see the triumph of the child; children's book critic Amanda Craig said, "He was unequivocal that it is the good, young and kind who triumph over the old, greedy and the wicked."{{sfn|de Castella|2011}} Anna Leskiewicz in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote "It's often suggested that Dahl's lasting appeal is a result of his exceptional talent for wriggling his way into children’s fantasies and fears, and laying them out on the page with anarchic delight. Adult villains are drawn in terrifying detail, before they are exposed as liars and hypocrites, and brought tumbling down with retributive justice, either by a sudden magic or the superior acuity of the children they mistreat."<ref name="Leszkiewicz" />

While his whimsical fantasy stories feature an underlying warm sentiment, they are often juxtaposed with grotesque, [[black comedy|darkly comic]] and sometimes harshly violent scenarios.<ref name="INT" />{{sfn|Hamlin |2015}} ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]'' and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' are examples of this formula. ''[[The BFG]]'' follows, with the good giant (the BFG or "Big Friendly Giant") representing the "good adult" archetype and the other giants being the "bad adults". This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''. Class-conscious themes also surface in works such as ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' and ''[[Danny, the Champion of the World]]'' where the unpleasant wealthy neighbours are outwitted.<ref name="BBC Studios 2016" /><ref>{{cite news|title='Fantastic Mr. Fox' movie review: Wes Anderson joyfully re-creates Roald Dahl's foxy family |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/11/post_25.html|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=21 January 2016}}</ref>

Dahl also features characters who are very fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins are a few of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge features in ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' and the nasty farmer Boggis in ''Fantastic Mr Fox'' is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from [[Willy Wonka]]'s chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In ''Matilda'', Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, [[Miss Trunchbull]], and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school; when he unexpectedly succeeds at this, Trunchbull smashes the empty plate over his head. In ''The Witches'', Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches (whose leader is the [[Grand High Witch]]) into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse.{{sfn|Marlow|2009|p=46}} Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. When Dahl was a boy his mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures, and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in ''The BFG'', the fox family in ''Fantastic Mr Fox'' and the trolls in ''[[The Minpins]]''.{{sfn|Volvovski|Rothman|Lamothe|2014|p=28}}

Receiving the 1983 [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]], Dahl encouraged his children and his readers to let their imagination run free. His daughter Lucy stated "his spirit was so large and so big he taught us to believe in magic."<ref name="BBC Studios 2016" />

{{Quote|Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.|Roald Dahl, ''The Minpins''}}

Dahl was also famous for his inventive, playful use of language, which was a key element to his writing. He invented new words by scribbling down his words before swapping letters around and adopting [[spoonerisms]] and [[malapropisms]].<ref name="Dahl Dictionary" /> The lexicographer Susan Rennie stated that Dahl built his new words on familiar sounds, adding:

{{quote|He didn't always explain what his words meant, but children can work them out because they often sound like a word they know, and he loved using [[onomatopoeia]]. For example, you know that something ''lickswishy'' and ''delumptious'' is good to eat, whereas something ''uckyslush'' or ''rotsome'' is definitely not! He also used sounds that children love to say, like ''squishous'' and ''squizzle'', or ''fizzlecrump'' and ''fizzwiggler''.<ref name="Dahl Dictionary"/>}}

A UK television special titled ''Roald Dahl's Revolting Rule Book'' which was hosted by [[Richard E. Grant]] and aired on 22 September 2007, commemorated Dahl's 90th birthday and also celebrated his impact as a children's author in popular culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1113720/|title=Roald Dahl's Revolting Rule Book (TV Movie 2007)|work=IMDb|date=22 September 2007}}</ref> It also featured eight main rules he applied on all his children's books:
# Just add chocolate
# Adults can be scary
# Bad things happen
# Revenge is sweet
# Keep a wicked sense of humour
# Pick perfect pictures
# Films are fun...but books are better!
# Food is fun!

In 2016, marking the centenary of Dahl's birth, Rennie compiled ''The Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary'' which includes many of his invented words and their meaning.<ref name="Dahl Dictionary" /> Rennie commented that some of Dahl's words have already escaped his world, for example, ''Scrumdiddlyumptious'': "Food that is utterly delicious".<ref name="Dahl Dictionary" /> In his poetry, Dahl gives a humorous re-interpretation of well-known nursery rhymes and [[fairy tales]], providing surprise endings in place of the traditional happily-ever-after. Dahl's collection of poems ''[[Revolting Rhymes]]'' is recorded in [[audiobook]] form, and narrated by actor [[Alan Cumming]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7aeAAAAMAAJ&q=alan+cumming|title=AV guide, Volumes 77–82|publisher=Scranton Gillette Communications|date= 1998|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref>

===Screenplays===
For a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', were adaptations of novels by Ian Fleming.<ref>{{cite news|title='Sean Connery?

''The Guardian''. Retrieved 22 November 2014</ref> Dahl also began adapting his own novel ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', which was completed and rewritten by [[David Seltzer]] after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was "disappointed" because "he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie".<ref>Liz Buckingham, trustee for the Roald Dahl Museum, quoted in Tom Bishop: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm ''Willy Wonka's Everlasting Film Plot''], BBC News, July 2005</ref> He was also "infuriated" by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaptation for the sequel ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.<ref>Tom Bishop (July 2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm "Willy Wonka's Everlasting Film Plot"].

===Influences===
[[File:Dylan Thomas Writing Shed (7896662300).jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of [[Dylan Thomas]]'s writing shed. Dahl made a replica of it in his own garden in Great Missenden where he wrote many of his stories|alt=Interior of Dylan Thomas's writing shed]]

A major part of Dahl's literary influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. Amongst his favourite authors were [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[Frederick Marryat]], and their works made a lasting mark on his life and writing.{{sfn|Craats|2014|p=1957}} Joe Sommerlad in ''[[The Independent]]'' writes, "Dahl’s novels are often dark affairs, filled with cruelty, bereavement and [[Dickensian]] adults prone to gluttony and sadism. The author clearly felt compelled to warn his young readers about the evils of the world, taking the lesson from earlier fairy tales that they could stand hard truths and would be the stronger for hearing them."<ref name="Influences" />

Dahl was also influenced by [[Lewis Carroll]]’s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The "Drink Me" episode in ''Alice'' inspired a scene in Dahl's ''George's Marvellous Medicine'' where a tyrannical grandmother drinks a potion and is blown up to the size of a farmhouse.<ref name="Influences" /> Finding too many distractions in his house, Dahl remembered the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home. Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the 1950s and, after taking a look inside, decided to make a replica of it to write in.<ref>{{cite news|title=How Dylan Thomas's writing shed inspired Roald Dahl|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37342271|agency=BBC|date=18 September 2016}}</ref>

Dahl liked ghost stories, and claimed that ''Trolls'' by [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]] was one of the finest ghost stories ever written. While he was still a youngster, his mother, Sofie Dahl, related traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her native homeland to Dahl and his sisters. Dahl always maintained that his mother and her stories had a strong influence on his writing. In one interview, he mentioned: "She was a great teller of tales. Her memory was prodigious and nothing that ever happened to her in her life was forgotten."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3559378/Roald-Dahl-young-tales-of-the-unexpected.html|title=Roald Dahl: young tales of the unexpected|date=30 August 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> When Dahl started writing and publishing his famous books for children, he included a grandmother character in ''The Witches'', and later said that she was based directly on his own mother as a tribute.<ref name="infloox" /><ref name="infloox-1" />

==Death and legacy==
[[File:RoaldDahlgrave.jpg|thumb|Dahl's gravestone, [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Missenden]], Buckinghamshire|alt=Dahl's gravestone]]

Roald Dahl died on 23 November 1990, at the age of 74 of a rare cancer of the blood, [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], in [[Oxford]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Deaths England and Wales 1984–2006 |publisher=Findmypast.com |access-date=28 January 2011}}</ref> and was buried in the cemetery at the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Missenden]], Buckinghamshire, England.

In 2002, one of [[Cardiff Bay]]'s modern landmarks, the Oval Basin plaza, was renamed ''[[Roald Dahl Plass]]''.

In honour of Dahl, the [[Royal Gibraltar Post Office]] issued a set of four stamps in 2010 featuring [[Quentin Blake]]'s original illustrations for four of the children's books written by Dahl during his long career; ''[[The BFG]]'', ''[[The Twits]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstampnews.com/2010/05/gibraltar-will-launch-a-roald-dahl-set-of-stamps/#more-213 |title=UK world's best selling children author on Gibraltar stamps |publisher=World Stamp News (worldstampnews.com) |date=15 May 2010 |access-date=28 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114636/http://www.worldstampnews.com/2010/05/gibraltar-will-launch-a-roald-dahl-set-of-stamps/#more-213 |archive-date=18 July 2011 }}</ref> A set of six stamps was issued by [[Royal Mail]] in 2012, featuring Blake's illustrations for ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', ''The Twits'', ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''Matilda'', ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'', and ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''.<ref name="guardian royal mail stamps" /> Dahl's influence has extended beyond literary figures. For instance film director [[Tim Burton]] recalled from childhood "the second layer [after [[Dr. Seuss]]] of connecting to a writer who gets the idea of the modern fable—and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that kids get. I've always like that, and it's shaped everything I've felt that I've done."{{sfn|Burton|2006|p=223}} [[Steven Spielberg]] read ''The BFG'' to his children when they were young, stating the book celebrates the fact that it's OK to be different as well as to have an active imagination: "It's very important that we preserve the tradition of allowing young children to run free with their imaginations and magic and imagination are the same thing."<ref>{{cite news|title=10 celebrities have picked their favourite Roald Dahl book ready for a public vote|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/10-celebrities-picked-favourite-roald-11820342|agency=Wales Online|date=6 September 2016}}</ref> Actress [[Scarlett Johansson]] named ''Fantastic Mr Fox'' one of the five books that made a difference to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/book/Fantastic-Mr-Fox|title=Books That Made a Difference to Scarlett Johansson |author=Holt, Karen, as told to |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref>

{{quote|Dahl has an incredibly distinctive style: his [[subversive]], unpredictable plots, musical prose and [[Caustic humour|caustic wit]] are impossible to imitate. And yet his stories have proved astonishingly malleable. Often adapted by equally idiosyncratic writers and directors, when translated onto stage and screen, his works seamlessly take on the impression of their new maker. Like in many of his stories, Dahl offers a narrative where troublemaking is rewarded, and games and tricks are more successful than following rules. Perhaps this, more than anything, is the reason why Dahl’s stories excite the imagination of so many adults and children, and why so many storytellers across stage and screen can’t resist remaking his tales in their own individual style. Right across his body of work, playfulness and inventiveness are always prized over boring qualities like obedience and deference. In Dahl's world, creative disruption is presented in such an appealing, delicious light, that you can't help but join in the fun.|Anna Leskiewicz in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', “Why we love the mischievous spirit of Roald Dahl”.<ref name="Leszkiewicz"/>}}

Dahl had Jewish friends, including the philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]], who commented: "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line.

Jeremy Treglown, in his 1994 biography, writes of Dahl's first novel ''Sometime Never'' (1948): "plentiful revelations about Nazi anti-Semitism and the Holocaust did not discourage him from satirizing 'a little pawnbroker in Hounsditch called Meatbein who, when the wailing started, would rush downstairs to the large safe in which he kept his money, open it and wriggle inside on to the lowest shelf where he lay like a hibernating hedgehog until the all-clear had gone.{{'"}}<ref name="Kerridge">{{cite news|last=Kerridge|first=Jake|date=7 November 2018|title=The dark truth about Roald Dahl: how anti-Semitism tainted his work|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/dark-truth-roald-dahl-antisemitism-tainted-work/|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref> In a short story entitled "Madame Rosette", the eponymous character is termed "a filthy old Syrian Jewess".<ref name="Kerridge" />

In 2020, Dahl's family published a statement on the official Roald Dahl website apologising for his antisemitism.<ref name="npr-MS">{{cite news

"We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words." / / It's unclear when the apology was posted, but it came to light after [[The Sunday Times]] reported it Sunday, along with further regrets from his family.

=== Other racism ===
In 1972, [[Eleanor Cameron]], also a children's book author, published an article in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine|The Horn Book]]'' criticizing ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', stating: "What I object to in ''Charlie'' is its phony presentation of poverty and its phony humor, which is based on punishment with overtones of sadism". She took issue with the depiction of the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s as imported African slaves and suggested that teachers look for better literature to use in the classroom.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cameron|first=Eleanor|date=19 Oct 1972|title=McLuhan, Youth, and Literature: Part I|url=https://www.hbook.com/?detailStory=mcluhan-youth-and-literature-part-i-2|access-date=2020-10-14|website=The Horn Book}}</ref> In 1973, Dahl posted a reply, calling Cameron's accusations "insensitive" and "monstrous".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dahl|first=Roald|date=27 Feb 1973|title=The Horn Book {{!}} "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory": A Reply|url=https://www.hbook.com/?detailStory=charlie-chocolate-factory-reply|access-date=2020-10-14|website=The Horn Book}}</ref> The Horn Book published Cameron's response, where she clarified that she intended her article not to be a personal attack on Dahl, but to point out that though the book is a work of fiction, it still influences reality. She again objected to the Oompa-Loompa depiction, writing, "the situation of the Oompa-Loompas is real; it could not be more so, and it is anything but funny".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cameron|first=Eleanor|date=19 Apr 1973|title=A Reply to Roald Dahl|url=https://www.hbook.com/?detailStory=a-reply-to-roald-dahl|access-date=2020-10-14|website=The Horn Book}}</ref> The debate between the two authors sparked much discussion and a number of letters to the editor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eleanor Cameron vs. Roald Dahl|url=https://www.roalddahlfans.com/dahls-work/books/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory/eleanor-cameron-vs-roald-dahl/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Roald Dahl Fans|language=en-US}}</ref> A 1991 article by [[Michael Dirda]] published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', echoed Cameron's comments, writing "the Oompa-Loompas... reveal virtually every stereotype about blacks".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Dirda|first=Michael|date=1990-12-07|title=Opinion {{!}} Roald Dahl Also Left a Legacy of Bigotry (Published 1990)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/07/opinion/l-roald-dahl-also-left-a-legacy-of-bigotry-880490.html|access-date=2020-10-14|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Misogyny ===
Dirda's article discussed many of the other criticisms of Dahl's writing as well, including his alleged misogyny. He wrote "''The Witches'' verges on a general misogyny"<ref name=":0" /> and Michele Landsberg's 1998 article analyzing the alleged issues in Dahl's work also stated: "Throughout his work, evil, domineering, smelly, fat, ugly women are his favorite villains."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Think Twice about Roald Dahl|url=https://www.lilith.org/articles/think-twice-about-roald-dahl/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Lilith Magazine|date=27 September 1998|language=en-US}}</ref> Una Malley's 2008 article mentioned Dahl's short story collection ''[[Switch Bitch]]'', calling it "a collection better forgotten, laden with crude and often disturbing sexual fantasy writing". However, Malley argued that there are feminist messages in Dahl's work, even if they may be obscured: "''The Witches'' offers up plenty of feminist complexities. The witches themselves are terrifying and vile things, and always women... The book is often viewed as sexist, but that assessment ignores one of the heroines of the story, the child narrator’s grandmother."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mullally|first=Una|title=Women, as written by Roald Dahl|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/women-as-written-by-roald-dahl-1.2775898|access-date=2020-10-14|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref>
