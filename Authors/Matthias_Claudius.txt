'''Matthias Claudius''' (15 August 1740 – 21 January 1815) was a German poet and journalist, otherwise known by the pen name of “Asmus”.

==Life==
Claudius was born at [[Reinfeld, Holstein|Reinfeld]], near [[Lübeck]], and studied at [[Jena]]. He spent the greater part of his life in the town of [[Wandsbek (quarter)|Wandsbeck]], where he earned his first literary reputation by editing from 1771 to 1775, a newspaper called ''Der Wandsbecker Bote'' (The Wandsbeck Messenger) (''Wandsbeck'' until the year 1879 still written with "ck". Today only with "k".), in which he published a large number of prose essays and poems. They were written in pure and simple German, and appealed to the popular taste; in many there was a vein of extravagant humour or even burlesque, while others were full of quiet meditation and solemn sentiment. In his later days, perhaps through the influence of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], with whom he had formed an intimate acquaintance, Claudius became strongly pietistic, and the graver side of his nature showed itself. In 1814 he moved to [[Hamburg]], to the house of his son-in-law, the publisher [[Friedrich Christoph Perthes]], where he died on 21 January 1815.

==Work==
Claudius's poem ''Death and the Maiden'' was used by composer [[Franz Schubert]] in 1817 for one of his most celebrated [[Death and the Maiden (song)|songs]], which in turn became the basis for the 1824 [[Death and the Maiden Quartet (Schubert)|string quartet]] of the same name.

Claudius's collected works were published under the title of '''''Asmus''' omnia sua secum portans, oder Sämtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten'' (8 vols., 1775–1812; 13th edition, by C. Redich, 2 vols., 1902). His biography has been written by Wilhelm Herbst (4th ed., 1878). See also M. Schneidereit, ''M. Claudius, seine Weltanschauung und Lebensweisheit'' (1898).
