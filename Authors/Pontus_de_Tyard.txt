He was born at [[Bissy-sur-Fley]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], of which he was ''seigneur'', but the exact year of his birth is uncertain.  He became a friend of [[Antoine Héroet]] and [[Maurice Scève]].  His first published work, ''Erreurs amoureuses'' 1549, was augmented with other poems in successive editions till 1573.  His work anticipated that of [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]].  He was one of the first to write sonnets in the [[French language]] (preceded by [[Clément Marot]] and [[Mellin de Saint-Gelais]]). He is also said to have introduced the ''[[sestina]]'', originally a [[Provençal literature|Provençal]] invention, into [[French poetry]].

Tyard contributed to the poetic and metaphysical program of La Pléiade by elaborating, in his ''Solitaire Premier, ou Prose des Muses, et de la fureur poétique'' (1552),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Solitaire-premier|title=Solitaire premier &#124; work by Tyard|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> a full theory of [[furor poeticus|divine fury]], derived in large part from the Latin translations and commentaries by the neo-platonic author [[Marsilio Ficino]] of [[Plato]]'s dialogues ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and (especially) ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' at the end of the 15th century.  Tyard distinguished divine inspiration from madness or "alienation" brought on by other causes, and subdivided divine inspiration into four kinds: (1) poetic fury, gift of the Muses; (2) knowledge of religious mysteries, through [[Bacchus]]; (3) prophecy and divination through [[Apollo]]; (4) inspiration brought on by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]/Eros.<ref>Grahame Castor.  ''Pléiade Poetics: A Study in Sixteenth-Century Thought and Terminology.'' Cambridge U: 1964. pp. 30-31.</ref>

In his later years he devoted himself to the study of [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]]. He became [[bishop of Chalon-sur-Saône]] in 1578, and in 1587 published his ''Discours philosophiques''. He was a zealous defender of King [[Henry III of France]] against the claims of the [[House of Guise]]. This attitude led to his persecution; he was driven from Chalon and his château at Bissy-sur-Fley was plundered.  Nevertheless, he survived all the other members of the Pléiade and lived to see the onslaught made on their doctrines by [[François de Malherbe]]. Pontus resigned his bishopric in 1594, and retired to the [[Bragny-sur-Saône|Château de Bragny]], where he died.
