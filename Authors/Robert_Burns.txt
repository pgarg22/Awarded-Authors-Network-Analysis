'''Robert Burns''' (25 January 1759{{spaced ndash}}21 July 1796), also known familiarly as '''Rabbie Burns''', the '''National''' '''Bard''', '''Bard of Ayrshire''', the '''Ploughman Poet''' and various other names and [[epithet]]s,{{refn|Including '''Rabbie Burns''', '''Scotland's favourite son''', '''Robden of Solway Firth''' and simply '''the Bard'''.<ref>O'Hagan, A: "[http://books.guardian.co.uk/poetry/features/0,,2243038,00.html The People's Poet]", ''The Guardian'', 19 January 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web |work= scottishexecutive.gov.uk |url= http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/01/24104549 |title= Scotland's National Bard |publisher= Scottish Executive |date=25 January 2008 |access-date=10 June 2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>|group=nb}} was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is widely regarded as the [[List of national poets|national poet]] of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the [[Scots language]], although much of his writing is in a "light [[Central Scots|Scots dialect]]" of English, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.

He is regarded as a pioneer of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]], and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both [[liberalism]] and [[socialism]], and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the [[Scottish diaspora]] around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national [[charismatic cult]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on [[Scottish literature]]. In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel [[STV (TV network)|STV]].

As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected [[Folk music|folk songs]] from across Scotland, often revising or [[Literary adaptation|adapting]] them. His poem (and song) "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and "[[Scots Wha Hae]]" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world today include "[[A Red, Red Rose]]", "[[A Man's a Man for A' That]]", "[[To a Louse]]", "[[To a Mouse]]", "[[The Battle of Sherramuir]]", "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]" and "[[Ae Fond Kiss]]".

[[File:The burns family.JPG|right|thumb|Inside the Burns Cottage]]

====Alloway====
Burns was born two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of [[Ayr]], in [[Alloway]], the eldest of the seven children of [[William Burnes]] (1721–1784), a self-educated tenant farmer from [[Dunnottar]] in the [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]], and [[Agnes Broun]] (1732–1820), the daughter of a [[Kirkoswald, South Ayrshire|Kirkoswald]] tenant farmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/learning/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-a-z/burns-robert |title=Hall of Fame: Robert Burns (1759-1796) |date=31 May 2013 |publisher=National Records of Scotland |access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Burnes, William|url=http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/BurnesWilliam172115184.142.shtml|encyclopedia=The Burns Encyclopedia|access-date=25 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldburnsclub.com/schools/learning_resources/the_poets_life.htm|title=Robert Burns 1759&nbsp;– 1796|publisher=The Robert Burns World Federation|access-date=25 April 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002547/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/schools/learning_resources/the_poets_life.htm|archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

He was born in a house built by his father (now the [[Burns Cottage]] Museum), where he lived until [[Easter]] 1766, when he was seven years old. William Burnes sold the house and took the tenancy of the {{convert|70|acre|m2|adj=on}} Mount Oliphant farm, southeast of Alloway. Here Burns grew up in poverty and hardship, and the severe manual labour of the farm left its traces in a premature stoop and a weakened constitution.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=62}}{{clarify|date=March 2021}}

He had little regular schooling and got much of his education from his father, who taught his children reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and history and also wrote for them ''A Manual of Christian Belief''.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=62}} He was also taught by John Murdoch (1747–1824), who opened an "[[History of education in Scotland#adventure schools|adventure school]]" in Alloway in 1763 and taught Latin, French, and mathematics to both Robert and his brother [[Gilbert Burns (Farmer)|Gilbert]] (1760–1827) from 1765 to 1768 until Murdoch left the parish. After a few years of home education, Burns was sent to Dalrymple Parish School in mid-1772 before returning at harvest time to full-time farm labouring until 1773, when he was sent to lodge with Murdoch for three weeks to study grammar, French, and Latin.

By the age of 15, Burns was the principal labourer at Mount Oliphant. During the harvest of 1774, he was assisted by [[Nelly Kilpatrick]] (1759–1820), who inspired his first attempt at poetry, "[[Handsome Nell|O, Once I Lov'd A Bonnie Lass]]". In 1775, he was sent to finish his education with a tutor at Kirkoswald, where he met [[Peggy Thompson]] (born 1762), to whom he wrote two songs, "Now Westlin' Winds" and "I Dream'd I Lay".

====Tarbolton====
Despite his ability and character, [[William Burnes]] was consistently unfortunate, and migrated with his large family from farm to farm without ever being able to improve his circumstances.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=62}} At [[Whitsun]], 1777, he removed his large family from the unfavourable conditions of Mount Oliphant to the {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm at [[Lochlea (South Ayrshire)|Lochlea]], near [[Tarbolton]], where they stayed until William Burnes's death in 1784. Subsequently, the family became integrated into the community of Tarbolton. To his father's disapproval, Robert joined a country dancing school in 1779 and, with Gilbert, formed the [[Bachelors' Club, Tarbolton|Tarbolton Bachelors' Club]] the following year. His earliest existing letters date from this time, when he began making romantic overtures to [[Alison Begbie]] (b. 1762). In spite of four songs written for her and a suggestion that he was willing to marry her, she rejected him.

Robert Burns was [[Entered Apprentice|initiated]] into the [[Masonic lodge]] St David, Tarbolton, on 4 July 1781, when he was 22.

In December 1781, Burns moved temporarily to [[Irvine, Ayrshire|Irvine]] to learn to become a [[flax]]-dresser, but during the workers' celebrations for [[New Year]] 1781/1782 (which included Burns as a participant) the flax shop caught fire and was burnt to the ground. This venture accordingly came to an end, and Burns went home to Lochlea farm.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=62}} During this time he met and befriended [[Richard Brown (Captain)|Captain Richard Brown]] who encouraged him to become a poet.

He continued to write poems and songs and began a [[commonplace book]] in 1783, while his father fought a legal dispute with his landlord. The case went to the [[Court of Session]], and Burnes was upheld in January 1784, a fortnight before he died.

====Mauchline====
Robert and Gilbert made an ineffectual struggle to keep on the farm, but after its failure they moved to the farm at Mossgiel, near [[Mauchline]], in March, which they maintained with an uphill fight for the next four years. In mid-1784 Burns came to know a group of girls known collectively as The Belles of Mauchline, one of whom was [[Jean Armour]], the daughter of a [[stonemason]] from Mauchline.

====Love affairs====
His first child, [[Elizabeth Bishop (Burns)|Elizabeth "Bess" Burns]] (1785–1817), was born to his mother's servant, [[Elizabeth Paton]] (1760–circa 1799), while he was embarking on a relationship with [[Jean Armour]], who became pregnant with twins in March 1786. Burns signed a paper attesting his marriage to Jean, but her father "was in the greatest distress, and fainted away". To avoid disgrace, her parents sent her to live with her uncle in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Although Armour's father initially forbade it, they were married in 1788.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/090717.asp|title=Mauchline kirk session records, National Archives of Scotland|work='The Legacy of Robert Burns' feature on the National Archives of Scotland website|publisher=National Archives of Scotland|date=1 July 2009|access-date=21 July 2009}}</ref> Armour bore him nine children, three of whom survived infancy.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

Burns was in financial difficulties due to his lack of success in farming, and to make enough money to support a family he took up an offer of work in Jamaica from Patrick Douglas of Garrallan, [[Old Cumnock]], whose [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]]s outside [[Port Antonio]] were managed by his brother Charles, under whom Burns was to be a "book keeper" (assistant overseer of slaves).<ref name="Crawford2011">{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Robert|title=The Bard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhtQrQr4E4QC&pg=PA222|access-date=26 March 2018|date=30 April 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781446466407|pages=222–223}}; {{cite book|editor-last=Carruthers|editor-first=Gerard|first=Nigel|last=Leask|title=Edinburgh Companion to Robert Burns|date=25 June 2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748636501|page=51|chapter=Burns and the Poetics of Abolition}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.burnsscotland.com/items/l/letter-of-charles-douglas-to-patrick-douglas-dated-port-antonio-19th-june-1786-(page-3-of-3).aspx|title=Letter of Charles Douglas to Patrick Douglas dated Port Antonio 19th June 1786 (page 3 of 3) - Burns Scotland|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> It has been suggested that the position was for a single man, and that he would live in rustic conditions, not likely to be living in the great house at a salary of [[pound sterling|£]]30 per annum.<ref name=bold19>{{harvnb|Burns|1993|p=19}}</ref><ref name=HighlandMary>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenock-town.co.uk/highland_mary.html |title=Highland Mary (Mary Campbell) |work=Famous Sons and Daughters of Greenock |publisher=Nostalgic Greenock |access-date=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220124508/http://www.greenock-town.co.uk/highland_mary.html |archive-date=20 February 2010 }}</ref> It is said in Burns's defence that in 1786 the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement was just beginning to be broadly active.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/history-tradition-and-roots/features/culture/burns-and-slavery.html |title=Feature on The Poet Robert Burns |work=Robert Burns History |publisher=Scotland.org |date=13 January 2004 |access-date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227025949/http://scotland.org/about/history-tradition-and-roots/features/culture/burns-and-slavery.html |archive-date=27 February 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theplayethic.com/2009/01/folkin-for-jamaica-sly-robbie-and-robert-burns.html|title=Folkin' For Jamaica: Sly, Robbie and Robert Burns|publisher=The Play Ethic|date=1 January 2009|access-date=10 June 2009}}</ref> Burns's authorship of "[[The Slave's Lament]]" (1792), a work claimed to typify his egalitarian views, is disputed. Burns’s name is absent from any abolition petition and according to Lisa Williams "is strangely silent on the question of chattel slavery compared to other contemporary poets. Perhaps this was due to his government position, severe limitations on free speech at the time or his association with beneficiaries of the slave trade system".<ref>[https://sceptical.scot/2016/03/the-myth-of-scottish-slaves/ "The myth of Scottish slaves"], Stephen Mullan, published March 4, 2016, accessed 22 June 2021</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/features/remaking-our-histories-scotland-slavery-and-empire "Scotland and Slavery"], https://www.nationalgalleries.org/, Lisa Williams, published 9 October 2020, accessed 22 June 2021</ref>

At about the same time, Burns fell in love with [[Mary Campbell (Highland Mary)|Mary Campbell]] (1763–1786), whom he had seen in church while he was still living in Tarbolton. She was born near [[Dunoon]] and had lived in [[Campbeltown]] before moving to work in Ayrshire. He dedicated the poems "The Highland Lassie O", "Highland Mary", and "To Mary in Heaven" to her. His song "Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary, And leave auld Scotia's shore?" suggests that they planned to emigrate to Jamaica together. Their relationship has been the subject of much conjecture, and it has been suggested that on 14 May 1786 they exchanged Bibles and [[Oath|plighted]] their troth over the [[Water of Fail]] in a traditional form of marriage. Soon afterwards Mary Campbell left her work in Ayrshire, went to the seaport of [[Greenock]], and sailed home to her parents in Campbeltown.<ref name=bold19/><ref name=HighlandMary/>

In October 1786, Mary and her father sailed from Campbeltown to visit her brother in Greenock. Her brother fell ill with [[typhus]], which she also caught while nursing him. She died of typhus on 20 or 21 October 1786 and [[Greenock#Notable residents|was buried there]].<ref name=HighlandMary/>

====Kilmarnock volume====
[[File:Kilmarnockvolume.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the Kilmarnock Edition]]
As Burns lacked the funds to pay for his passage to the West Indies, Gavin Hamilton suggested that he should "publish his poems in the mean time by subscription, as a likely way of getting a little money to provide him more liberally in necessaries for Jamaica." On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his ''Scotch Poems'' to John Wilson, a printer in [[Kilmarnock]], who published these proposals on 14 April 1786, on the same day that Jean Armour's father tore up the paper in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for [[rebuke]] in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July, and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that, "Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail until I can find a warrant for an enormous sum&nbsp;... I am wandering from one friend's house to another."<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|1993|pp=19–20}}</ref>

On 31 July 1786 John Wilson published the volume of works by Robert Burns, ''[[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Burns)|Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect]]''.<ref name=bold20>{{harvnb|Burns|1993|p=20}}</ref> Known as the [[Kilmarnock volume]], it sold for 3 shillings and contained much of his best writing, including "The Twa Dogs" (which features Luath, his [[Border Collie]]),<ref>[https://ntsusa.org/twa-dogs/ "The Twa Dogs"] - [[National Trust for Scotland]]</ref> "[[Address to the Deil]]", "[[Halloween (poem)|Halloween]]", "[[The Cotter's Saturday Night]]", "[[To a Mouse]]", "[[Epitaph for James Smith]]", and "[[To a Mountain Daisy]]", many of which had been written at Mossgiel farm. The success of the work was immediate, and soon he was known across the country.

Burns postponed his planned emigration to Jamaica on 1 September, and was at Mossgiel two days later when he learnt that Jean Armour had given birth to twins. On 4 September [[Thomas Blacklock]] wrote a letter expressing admiration for the poetry in the Kilmarnock volume, and suggesting an enlarged second edition.<ref name=bold20/> A copy of it was passed to Burns, who later recalled, "I had taken the last farewell of my few friends, my chest was on the road to Greenock; I had composed the last song I should ever measure in Scotland&nbsp;– 'The Gloomy night is gathering fast'&nbsp;– when a letter from Dr Blacklock to a friend of mine overthrew all my schemes, by opening new prospects to my poetic ambition. The Doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose applause I had not dared to hope. His opinion that I would meet with encouragement in Edinburgh for a second edition, fired me so much, that away I posted for that city, without a single acquaintance, or a single letter of introduction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/blacklock_thomas.htm|title=Significant Scots&nbsp;– Thomas Blacklock|editor=Chambers, R|editor-link=Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|author=Rev.

[[File:Alexander Nasmyth - Robert Burns, 1759 - 1796. Poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Nasmyth]], Robert Burns (1828)]]

On 27 November 1786 Burns borrowed a pony and set out for [[Edinburgh]]. On 14 December William Creech issued subscription bills for the first Edinburgh edition of ''[[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Edinburgh Edition)|Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect]]'', which was published on 17 April 1787. Within a week of this event, Burns had sold his copyright to Creech for 100 guineas.<ref name=bold20/> For the edition, Creech commissioned [[Alexander Nasmyth]] to paint the oval bust-length portrait now in the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]], which was engraved to provide a frontispiece for the book. Nasmyth had come to know Burns and his fresh and appealing image has become the basis for almost all subsequent representations of the poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/N/3547/artistName/Alexander%20Nasmyth/recordId/1962|title=Artists A-Z − − N − Artists A-Z − Online Collection − Collection − National Galleries of Scotland|author=National Galleries of Scotland}}</ref> In Edinburgh, he was received as an equal by the city's men of letters—including Dugald Stewart, Robertson, Blair and others—and was a guest at aristocratic gatherings, where he bore himself with unaffected dignity. Here he encountered, and made a lasting impression on, the 16-year-old [[Walter Scott]], who described him later with great admiration:

{{quote|[His person was strong and robust;] his manners rustic, not clownish, a sort of dignified plainness and simplicity which received part of its effect perhaps from knowledge of his extraordinary talents. His features are presented in Mr Nasmyth's picture but to me it conveys the idea that they are diminished, as if seen in perspective. I think his countenance was more massive than it looks in any of the portraits&nbsp;... there was a strong expression of shrewdness in all his lineaments; the eye alone, I think, indicated the poetical character and temperament. It was large, and of a dark cast, and literally glowed when he spoke with feeling or interest. [I never saw such another eye in a human head, though I have seen the most distinguished men of my time.]|author=Walter Scott{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=63}}<!-- the square brackets text are not in the cited source, but probably exist-->}}

[[File:Robert Burns statue, Bernard Street.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Burns statue by David Watson Stevenson (1898) in [[Leith|Bernard Street, Leith]]]]

The new edition of his poems brought Burns £400. His stay in the city also resulted in some lifelong friendships, among which were those with [[James Cunningham, 13th Earl of Glencairn|Lord Glencairn]], and [[Frances Anna Dunlop]] (1730–1815),{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=63}} who became his occasional sponsor and with whom he corresponded for many years until a rift developed. He embarked on a relationship with the separated [[Agnes Maclehose|Agnes "Nancy" McLehose]] (1758–1841), with whom he exchanged passionate letters under pseudonyms (Burns called himself "Sylvander" and Nancy "Clarinda"). When it became clear that Nancy would not be easily seduced into a physical relationship, Burns moved on to [[Jenny Clow]] (1766–1792), Nancy's domestic servant, who bore him a son, Robert Burns Clow, in 1788. He also had an affair with a servant girl, [[May Cameron|Margaret "May" Cameron]]. His relationship with Nancy concluded in 1791 with a final meeting in Edinburgh before she sailed to Jamaica for what turned out to be a short-lived reconciliation with her estranged husband. Before she left, he sent her the manuscript of "[[Ae Fond Kiss]]" as a farewell.{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}

In Edinburgh, in early 1787, he met [[James Johnson (engraver)|James Johnson]], a struggling music engraver and music seller with a love of old Scots songs and a determination to preserve them. Burns shared this interest and became an enthusiastic contributor to ''The Scots Musical Museum''. The first volume was published in 1787 and included three songs by Burns. He contributed 40 songs to volume two, and he ended up responsible for about a third of the 600 songs in the whole collection, as well as making a considerable editorial contribution. The final volume was published in 1803.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/JohnsonJamesc17501511811.474.shtml|title=Robert Burns Country: The Burns Encyclopedia: Johnson, James (c. 1750 — 1811)|website=www.robertburns.org|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>{{Clear}}

[[File:River Nith at Ellisland.JPG|left|thumb|The River Nith at Ellisland Farm.]]
[[File:Ellisland Farm and the River Nith.jpg|right|thumb|Ellisland Farm in the time of Robert Burns]]
On his return from Edinburgh in February 1788, he resumed his relationship with Jean Armour and took a lease on Ellisland Farm, Dumfriesshire, settling there in June. He also trained as a gauger or [[excise]]man in case farming continued to be unsuccessful. He was appointed to duties in Customs and Excise in 1789 and eventually gave up the farm in 1791. Meanwhile, in November 1790, he had written his masterpiece, the narrative poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O' Shanter]]". The Ellisland farm beside the river Nith, now holds a unique collection of Burns's books, artefacts, and [[manuscripts]] and is mostly preserved as when Burns and his young family lived there.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} About this time he was offered and declined an appointment in London on the staff of ''The Star'' newspaper,<ref name=poetry-poems-poets>Robert Burns: "[http://www.zeugma.co.uk/RobertBurnsScottishPoet.htm Poetry&nbsp;– Poems&nbsp;– Poets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512183740/http://www.zeugma.co.uk/RobertBurnsScottishPoet.htm |date=12 May 2011}}." Retrieved on 24 September 2010</ref> and refused to become a candidate for a newly created Chair of Agriculture in the [[University of Edinburgh]],<ref name=poetry-poems-poets /> although influential friends offered to support his claims.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=63}} He did however accept membership of the [[Royal Company of Archers]] in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diploma of the Royal Company of Archers|url=http://www.burnsscotland.com/items/d/diploma-admitting-robert-burns-to-membership-of-the-royal-company-of-archers.aspx|website=Burns Scotland|access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref>

====Lyricist====
After giving up his farm, he removed to Dumfries. It was at this time that, being requested to write lyrics for ''The Melodies of Scotland'', he responded by contributing over 100 songs.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=63}} He made major contributions to [[George Thomson (musician)|George Thomson]]'s ''A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice'' as well as to James Johnson's ''[[Scots Musical Museum]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Arguably his claim to immortality chiefly rests on these volumes, which placed him in the front rank of [[Lyric poetry|lyric poets]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=63}} As a songwriter he provided his own lyrics, sometimes adapted from traditional words. He put words to Scottish folk melodies and airs which he collected, and composed his own arrangements of the music including modifying tunes or recreating melodies on the basis of fragments. In letters he explained that he preferred simplicity, relating songs to spoken language which should be sung in traditional ways. The original instruments would be [[fiddle]] and the guitar of the period which was akin to a [[cittern]], but the transcription of songs for piano has resulted in them usually being performed in classical concert or music hall styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertburns.plus.com/EssaySongWriter.htm|title=Robert Burns the Song Writer|author=David Sibbald}}</ref> At the 3 week [[Celtic Connections]] festival [[Glasgow]] each January, Burns songs are often performed with both fiddle and guitar.

Burns described how he had to master singing the tune before he composed the words:
[[File:Robert Burns House, Dumfries.jpg|thumb|left|Burns House in Dumfries, Scotland]]
{{quote|My way is: I consider the poetic sentiment, correspondent to my idea of the musical expression, then chuse my theme, begin one stanza, when that is composed—which is generally the most difficult part of the business—I walk out, sit down now and then, look out for objects in nature around me that are in unison or harmony with the cogitations of my fancy and workings of my bosom, humming every now and then the air with the verses I have framed. when I feel my Muse beginning to jade, I retire to the solitary fireside of my study, and there commit my effusions to paper, swinging, at intervals, on the hind-legs of my elbow chair, by way of calling forth my own critical strictures, as my, pen goes.|author=Robert Burns}}
Burns also worked to collect and preserve Scottish [[folk song]]s, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the [[music hall]]s of Scotland as late as the 20th century. At Dumfries, he wrote his world famous song "[[A Man's a Man for A' That]]", which was based on the writings in [[The Rights of Man]] by [[Thomas Paine]], one of the chief political theoreticians of the [[American Revolution]]. Burns sent the poem anonymously in 1795 to the Glasgow Courier. He was also a radical for reform and wrote poems for democracy, such as – Parcel of Rogues to the Nation, The Slaves Lament and the Rights of Women. 
 
Many of Burns's most famous poems are songs with the music based upon older traditional songs. For example, "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is set to the traditional tune "Can Ye Labour Lea", "[[A Red, Red Rose]]" is set to the tune of "Major Graham" and "[[The Battle of Sherramuir]]" is set to the "Cameronian Rant".

[[File:Robert Burns Mausoleum, Dumfries.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Burns Mausoleum at St Michael's churchyard in [[Dumfries]]]]

Burns's worldly prospects were perhaps better than they had ever been but he alienated some acquaintances by freely expressing sympathy with the French,{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=64}} and American Revolutions, for the advocates of democratic reform and votes for all men and the [[Society of the Friends of the People]] which advocated Parliamentary Reform. His political views came to the notice of his employers, to which he pleaded his innocence. Burns met other radicals at the Globe Inn Dumfries. As an Exciseman he felt compelled to join the Royal Dumfries [[British Volunteer Corps|Volunteers]] in March 1795.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/collections/object_detail/3.6201|title=MS: 'The Dumfries Volunteers' – Robert Burns Birthplace Museum}}</ref> 
He lived in Dumfries in a two-storey red sandstone house on Mill Hole Brae, now Burns Street. The home is now a museum. He went on long journeys on horseback, often in harsh weather conditions as an [[Excise]] Supervisor. He was kept very busy doing reports, father of four young children, song collector and [[songwriter]]. 
As his health began to give way, he aged prematurely and fell into fits of despondency.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=64}} The habits of intemperance (alleged mainly by temperance activist James Currie)<ref name=R-B-Gallery>Robert Burns: "[http://www.robertburnsgallery.com/life.htm The R.B.

On the morning of 21 July 1796, Burns died in Dumfries, at the age of 37. The funeral took place on Monday 25 July 1796, the day that his son Maxwell was born. He was at first buried in the far corner of St. Michael's Churchyard in Dumfries; a simple "slab of freestone" was erected as his gravestone by Jean Armour, which some felt insulting to his memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/joerocksresearchpages/thomas-hamilton-architect|title=Thomas Hamilton, architect – Joe Rock's Research Pages}}</ref> His body was eventually moved to its final location in the same cemetery, the Burns Mausoleum, in September 1817.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Burns Mausoleum|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/dumfries/burnsmausoleum/|work=Undiscovered Scotland|access-date=27 August 2014}}</ref> The body of his widow Jean Armour was buried with his in 1834.<ref name="Hogg, Patrick Scott 2008 p. 321"/>

==Literary style==
[[File:Tam O’Shanter’s Ride, Robbie Burns Statue, Halifax, Nova Scotia.png|thumb|left|[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O’Shanter's Ride]], [[Victoria Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia]]]]
Burns's style is marked by spontaneity, directness, and sincerity, and ranges from the tender intensity of some of his lyrics through the humour of "Tam o' Shanter" and the satire of "Holy Willie's Prayer" and "The Holy Fair".{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=63}}

Burns's poetry drew upon a substantial familiarity with and knowledge of [[Classics|Classical]], [[Bible|Biblical]], and [[English literature]], as well as the Scottish [[Makar]] tradition.<ref name=Literary-Style>Robert Burns: "[http://www.blurbwire.com/topics/Robert_Burns::sub::Literary_Style Literary Style] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016215809/http://www.blurbwire.com/topics/Robert_Burns::sub::Literary_Style |date=16 October 2013 }}." Retrieved on 24 September 2010</ref> Burns was skilled in writing not only in the [[Scots language]] but also in the [[Scottish English]] dialect of the English language. Some of his works, such as "Love and Liberty" (also known as "The Jolly Beggars"), are written in both Scots and English for various effects.<ref name=some-hae-meat>Robert Burns: "[http://poetrydispatch.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/robert-burns-some-hae-meat/some hae meat]."

His themes included [[republicanism]] (he lived during the [[French Revolution|French Revolutionary period]]) and [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]]ism, which he expressed covertly in "[[Scots Wha Hae]]", [[Scottish patriotism]], [[Anti-clericalism|anticlericalism]], class inequalities, gender roles, commentary on the [[Scottish Kirk]] of his time, Scottish cultural identity, poverty, sexuality, and the beneficial aspects of popular socialising (carousing, Scotch whisky, folk songs, and so forth).<ref name=Address-to-the-Kibble>Red Star Cafe: "[http://redstarcafe.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/address-to-the-kibble/Address to the Kibble]."

The strong emotional highs and lows associated with many of Burns's poems have led some, such as Burns biographer Robert Crawford,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-bard-by-robert-crawfordbr-a-night-out-with-robert-burns-ed-andrew-ohagan-1379914.html|title=The Bard, By Robert Crawford|work=Books|publisher=The Independent|first=C|last=Rumens|date=16 January 2009|access-date=10 June 2009|location=London}}</ref> to suggest that he suffered from [[bipolar disorder|manic depression]]—a hypothesis that has been supported by analysis of various samples of his handwriting. Burns himself referred to suffering from episodes of what he called "blue devilism". The [[National Trust for Scotland]] has downplayed the suggestion on the grounds that evidence is insufficient to support the claim.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/scotland/Bard-in-the-hand-Trust.5342051.jp|title=Bard in the hand: Trust accused of hiding Burns's mental illness|work=Scotland on Sunday|first=J|last=Watson|date=7 June 2009|access-date=10 June 2009}}</ref>

==Influence==
===Britain===
Burns is generally classified as a proto-[[Romantic Poetry|Romantic poet]], and he influenced [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] greatly. His direct literary influences in the use of Scots in poetry were [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] and [[Robert Fergusson]]. The Edinburgh literati worked to sentimentalise Burns during his life and after his death, dismissing his education by calling him a "heaven-taught ploughman". Burns influenced later Scottish writers, especially [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], who fought to dismantle what he felt had become a sentimental cult that dominated Scottish literature.

An example of Burns's literary influence in the US is seen in the choice by novelist [[John Steinbeck]] of the title of his 1937 novel, ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', taken from a line in the second-to-last stanza of "[[To a Mouse]]": "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men&nbsp;/ Gang aft agley."

The author [[J. D.

===Russia===
Burns became the "people's poet" of Russia. In [[Imperial Russia]] Burns was translated into Russian and became a source of inspiration for the ordinary, oppressed Russian people. In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Russia, he was elevated as the archetypal poet of the people. As a great admirer of the egalitarian ethos behind the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s who expressed his own egalitarianism in poems such as his "Birthday Ode for George Washington" or his "[[Is There for Honest Poverty]]" (commonly known as "A Man's a Man for a' that"), Burns was well placed for endorsement by the [[Communist]] regime as a "progressive" artist. A new translation of Burns begun in 1924 by [[Samuil Marshak]] proved enormously popular, selling over 600,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standrews.com/burns/HERALDWRITINGS/feature30.html |title=Burns Biography |publisher=Standrews.com |date=27 January 1990 |access-date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211055558/http://www.standrews.com/burns/HERALDWRITINGS/feature30.html |archive-date=11 December 2004 }}</ref> The USSR honoured Burns with a commemorative stamp in 1956.

Burns's birthplace in Alloway is now a [[National Trust for Scotland]] property called the [[Robert Burns Birthplace Museum]]. It includes: the humble Burns Cottage where he was born and spent the first years of his life, a modern museum building which houses more than 5,000 Burns artefacts including his handwritten manuscripts, the historic Alloway Auld Kirk and Brig o Doon which feature in Burns's masterpiece 'Tam o Shanter', and the Burns Monument which was erected in Burns's honour and finished in 1823.
His house in Dumfries is operated as the Robert Burns House, and the Robert Burns Centre in Dumfries features more exhibits about his life and works. [[Ellisland Farm, Dumfries|Ellisland Farm]] in [[Auldgirth]], which he owned from 1788 to 1791, is maintained as a working farm with a museum and interpretation centre by the Friends of Ellisland Farm.

Significant 19th-century monuments to him stand in Alloway, Leith, and Dumfries. An early 20th-century replica of his birthplace cottage belonging to the [[Burns Club Atlanta]] stands in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. These are part of a large [[List of Robert Burns memorials|list of Burns memorials and statues]] around the world.

Organisations include the [[Robert Burns Fellowship]] of the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand, and the [[Burns Club Atlanta]] in the United States. Towns named after Burns include [[Burns, New York]], and [[Burns, Oregon]].

In the suburb of [[Summerhill, Dumfries]], the majority of the streets have names with Burns connotations.

A life-size statue was dedicated in Burns's honour within the Back Bay Fens of the West Fenway neighbourhood in 1912. It stood until 1972 when it was relocated downtown, sparking protests from the neighbourhood, literary fans, and preservationists of Olmsted's vision for the Back Bay Fens.

There is a statue of Burns in [[The Octagon, Dunedin]], in the same pose as the one in Dundee. Dunedin's first European settlers were Scots; Thomas Burns, a nephew of Burns, was one of Dunedin's founding fathers.

A crater on Mercury is named after Burns.

In November 2012, Burns was awarded the title Honorary Chartered Surveyor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/uk/knowledge/news-insight/news/posthumous-recognition-of-burns-the-land-surveyor/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130415183927/http://www.rics.org/uk/knowledge/news-insight/news/posthumous-recognition-of-burns-the-land-surveyor/|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 April 2013|title=Posthumous recognition of Burns, the land surveyor|publisher=RICS|date=19 November 2012|access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref> by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the only posthumous membership so far granted by the institution.

===Musical tributes===
[[File:Robert Burns 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraved version of the [[Alexander Nasmyth]] 1787 portrait]]
In 1976, singer [[Jean Redpath]], in collaboration with composer [[Serge Hovey]], started to record all of Burns's songs, with a mixture of traditional and Burns's own compositions. The project ended when Hovey died, after seven of the planned twenty-two volumes were completed. Redpath also recorded four cassettes of Burns's songs (re-issued as 3 CDs) for the [[Scots Musical Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanredpath.com/pages/individ.html#Anchor3|title=THE SONGS OF ROBERT BURNS from the Scots Musical Museum|publisher=Jean Redpath Sings|access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref>

In 1996, a musical about Burns's life called ''[[Red Red Rose]]'' won third place at a competition for new musicals in Denmark. Robert Burns was played by [[John Barrowman]]. On 25 January 2008, a musical play about the love affair between Robert Burns and Nancy McLehose entitled ''Clarinda'' premiered in Edinburgh before touring Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarindathemusical.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009202156/http://www.clarindathemusical.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 October 2006|title=Clarinda&nbsp;– The Musical&nbsp;– No woman shunned Robert Burns' advances, until he met Clarinda!|publisher=Clarindathemusical.com|access-date=10 June 2009}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The plan was that ''[[Clarinda (musical)|Clarinda]]'' would make its American premiere in Atlantic Beach, FL, at Atlantic Beach Experimental Theatre on 25 January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abettheatre.com/2012-2013-season-21/clarinda|title=Clarinda&nbsp;– The Musical&nbsp;– United States Premiere!|publisher=abettheatre.com|access-date=15 December 2012}}</ref> [[Eddi Reader]] has released two albums, ''[[Sings the Songs of Robert Burns]]'' and ''[[The Songs of Robert Burns Deluxe Edition#Deluxe edition|The Songs of Robert Burns Deluxe Edition]]'', about the work of the poet.

===Burns suppers===
{{main|Burns supper}}
[[File:Cutting the haggis.jpg|thumb|"Great chieftain o' the puddin-race!" – cutting the haggis at a [[Burns supper]]]]
Burns Night, in effect a second [[national day]], is celebrated on Burns's birthday, 25 January, with [[Burns supper]]s around the world, and is more widely observed in Scotland than the official national day, [[St. Andrew's Day]]. The first Burns supper in The [[Burns Clubs|Mother Club]] in Greenock was held on what was thought to be his birthday on 29 January 1802; in 1803 it was discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was 25 January 1759.<ref name=mother/>

The format of Burns suppers has changed little since. The basic format starts with a general welcome and announcements, followed with [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders#The Selkirk Grace|the Selkirk Grace]]. After the grace comes the piping and cutting of the [[haggis]], when Burns's famous "[[Address to a Haggis]]" is read and the haggis is cut open. The event usually allows for people to start eating just after the haggis is presented. At the end of the meal, a series of toasts, often including a 'Toast to the Lassies', and replies are made. This is when the toast to "the immortal memory", an overview of Burns's life and work, is given. The event usually concludes with the singing of "Auld Lang Syne".

===Greatest Scot===
In 2009, [[STV (TV network)|STV]] ran a television series and public vote on who was "The Greatest Scot" of all time.  Robert Burns won, narrowly beating [[William Wallace]].<ref>[http://news.stv.tv/scotland/141018-robert-burns-voted-greatest-scot/ Robert Burns voted Greatest Scot] [[STV (TV network)|STV]]. Retrieved 10 December 2010.</ref> A bust of Burns is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].

===Crater===
A [[Burns (crater)|crater]] on the planet Mercury has been named after Burns.
