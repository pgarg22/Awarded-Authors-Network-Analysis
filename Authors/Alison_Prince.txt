==Background==
Prince was born on 26 March 1931 in [[Beckenham, Kent]]<ref name=isfdb/> (now in Greater London) to Louise (née David) and Charles Prince. Her mother trained as a nurse and was later Mayor of [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] while her father was manager of the [[Yorkshire Bank]] in London.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/alison-prince-obituary|title=Alison Prince obituary|last=Eccleshare|first=Julia|date=2019-10-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> She grew up in South London and attended a girls' grammar school<ref name=":0" /> where she enjoyed grammar and Latin, but not maths.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Her parents were from Scotland and Yorkshire. Her father was a keen pianist, and she played the clarinet. As a child she visited Scottish relatives in [[Glasgow]].

After completing a degree course at the [[Slade School of Art]], where she had won a scholarship, Prince found work in casual, low-paid jobs unrelated to art. She later took a postgraduate teaching diploma at [[Goldsmith's College]], then taught art at the [[Elliott School (London)|Elliott Comprehensive School]], in [[Putney]]. She married a fellow teacher, Goronwy Parry, and together they had three children.<ref name=":0" /> With this interruption to her teaching career, she turned instead to occasional journalism. After the marriage ended, she ran a small farm in [[Suffolk]] for eight years.<ref name=walker>{{cite web |url=http://www.walker.co.uk/contributors/Alison-Prince-4558.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225655/http://www.walker.co.uk/contributors/Alison-Prince-4558.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Publisher's page on Alison Walker |accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>

==From television to books==
Prince later moved into writing for children's television, gaining notice with her scripts for the [[stop motion]] animated puppet series ''[[Trumpton]]'' (1967) for young children produced by [[Gordon Murray (puppeteer)|Gordon Murray]]. Prince also wrote the lyrics for the songs performed by [[Brian Cant]]. "I didn’t have a television, but I had three kids to feed, so I said yes," she recalled in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/alison-prince-obituary-qptqgv2dv|title=Alison Prince obituary|work=The Times|location=London|date=25 November 2019|access-date=26 November 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

Her first book was ''Joe and a Horse and other stories about Joe from 'Watch with Mother{{'}}'', with <!-- not the actress -->Joan Hickson, a 1968 spin-off from the [[BBC]] pre-school program ''[[Watch with Mother]]''.<ref name=bcouncil/><ref name="worldcat-joe"/>{{efn|Prince was scriptwriter for the ''Watch with Mother'' "Joe" subseries in autumn 1966 and spring 1971. Joan Hickson (not the actress) was production designer for "Joe".<!-- IMDb -->}} In the late 1970s, she turned to writing books for children, some based on historical characters. They include ''[[My Royal Story]]'' about [[Catherine of Aragon]], which was re-released in 2010. ''How's Business'' (1987), set in [[World War II]], made the shortlist for the [[Nestle Smarties Book Prize]].<!-- which age group? we don't list runners-up before 1996 -->

''The Sherwood Hero'' (1995) is a modern-day [[Robin Hood]] story for young adults, about a girl stealing a credit card from her father's client, drawing £100, attempting to hand it out to the poor in the streets of [[Glasgow]], and then coping with the guilt. For this Prince was a joint winner (with [[Philip Pullman]]) of the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize|''Guardian'' Children's Fiction Prize]], a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=relaunch>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/12/guardianchildrensfictionprize2001.guardianchildrensfictionprize |title=Guardian children's fiction prize relaunched: Entry details and list of past winners |work=guardian.co.uk |date=12 March 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Her thriller ''Oranges and Murder'' was the [[Scottish Arts Council]] Children's Book of the Year in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scottish Arts Council Book Awards 2002-2009 |work=Books from Scotland site |url=http://www.booksfromscotland.com/Books/Award-Winning-Scottish-Books/SAC-Book-Awards-2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208102531/http://www.booksfromscotland.com/Books/Award-Winning-Scottish-Books/SAC-Book-Awards-2002 |archive-date=2013-12-08}}</ref> Translations of her books have been published in several languages, including Danish, German, Japanese and Welsh.<ref name = worldcat>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n80-025967 |title=WorldCat on Alison |access-date=5 August 2012}}</ref><!-- source lists five other languages not including Dutch, 1 each -->

Mainly for adults, Prince wrote well-received biographies of [[Kenneth Grahame]] (1994, reissued 2009) and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1998), a collection of essays on formative thinking,<ref>''The Necessary Goat'' (Glasgow: Taranis, 1992).
