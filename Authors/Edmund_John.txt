'''Edmund John''' (27 November 1883 â€“ 28 February 1917) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[poet]] of the [[Uranian poetry]] school. His verses were modeled on the [[Symbolist]] poetry of [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and other earlier poets.  Much of his work was condemned by critics for being overly decadent and unfashionable. He fought in the [[World War I|First World War]] but was invalided out in 1916.  He died a year later in [[Taormina]], [[Sicily]].<ref>*D'Arch Smith, Timothy (1970). ''Love in Earnest''.
