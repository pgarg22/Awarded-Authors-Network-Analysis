==Work==
Nichol was born in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. Though his early writing consisted of [[fiction]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poems]], he first received international recognition in the 1960s for [[concrete poetry]]. The first major publications included ''Journeying & the returns'' (1967),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpnichol.ca/archive/documents/journeying-returns|title=Journeying & the Returns|website=Bpnichol.ca|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> a purple box containing visual & lyrical poems and ''Konfessions of an Elizabethan Fan Dancer'' (1969)<ref name="bpNichol">{{cite book|last1=Nichol|first1=bp|title=Konfessions of an Elizabethan Fan Dancer|date=1969|publisher=Coach House Books|location=Toronto|isbn=9781552451373 |url=https://chbooks.com/Books/K/Konfessions-of-an-Elizabethan-Fan-Dancer }}</ref> a book of concrete poetry. He won the 1970 [[Governor General's Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bp-nichol/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912181725/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bp-nichol/ |archivedate=2016-09-12 }}</ref> for poetry with not one but four publications: the prose booklet ''The True Eventual Story of Billy the Kid'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecompleteworks.ca/2015/04/12/the-true-eventual-story-of-billy-the-kid/|title=THE TRUE EVENTUAL STORY OF BILLY THE KID|date=12 April 2015|website=Thecompleteworks.ca|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> a collection of lyrical poems, ''Beach Head'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beach-Head-Transitions-66-67/dp/B000U8X4AK|title=Beach Head: Transitions 66 & 67.|first=bp|last=NICHOL|date=21 October 1970|publisher=Sacramento: Runcible Spoon|accessdate=21 October 2017|via=Amazon}}</ref> the boxed concrete sequence, ''Still Water'' and ''The Cosmic Chef'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelhousepress.com/essays/Gil%20McElroy%20-%20Nichol%20essay.pdf|title=Ground States : The Visual Contexts of bpNichol|website=Angelhousepress.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> a boxed [[anthology]] of concrete and [[visual poetry]].

His best known work, ''The Martyrology'' (1972-1992) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chbooks.com/content/search?search_in%5B%5D=all&SearchText=bp+nichol|title = Search}}</ref> is an open-ended, lifelong poem that investigates language. The 'saints' are drawn from 'st' words (storm becomes St. Orm) and their spiritual quest provides a springboard from which linguistic issues of [[textuality]], reading and writing are explored.

One of Nichol's strengths was his ability to collaborate with other artists. The work of the sound poetry group, [[The Four Horsemen (poetry)|The Four Horsemen]] (Nichol, Rafael Barreto-Rivera,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n83221452|title=The conjured ones : a collection of poems /|website=Worldcat.org|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> [[Paul Dutton]] and [[Steve McCaffery]]) has been documented in Volcano Theatre's <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volcano.ca/thefourhorsemenproject|title=The Four Horsemen Project|website=Volcano.ca|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> stage performances of The Four Horsemen Project ([[Dora Mavor Moore Award]] 2007 & 2015). He collaborated with Steve McCaffrey to form The Toronto Research Group (TRG),<ref name="Peter Jaeger">{{cite book|last1= Jaeger |first1=Peter|title= ABC of Reading TRG |date=1997|publisher= Talon Books |location=Toronto|isbn=9780889224230 |url= http://talonbooks.com/books/abc-of-reading-trg }}</ref> with Barbara Caruso,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parisstaronline.com/2012/09/25/discovering-the-art-of-barbara-caruso|title=Discovering the art of Barbara Caruso|website=Paris Star|accessdate=21 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022085054/http://www.parisstaronline.com/2012/09/25/discovering-the-art-of-barbara-caruso|archive-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/special/weedflower|title=Weed/Flower Press Collection - Special Collections - The University Library - The University of Sheffield|first=University of|last=Sheffield|website=Sheffield.ac.uk|date=30 September 2016|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> visual artist, with [[R.

Nichol's zest for publishing other writers was reflected in founding Ganglia Press <ref>{{cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Ganglia_Press|title=Publisher: Ganglia Press - Open Library|last=OpenLibrary.org|website=Openlibrary.org|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> with David Aylward in 1964 and [[grOnk]] in 1967 with [[bill bissett]] and [[David UU]] ( David W. Harris). He was a volunteer editor at [[Coach House Books]] from 1975 to his death. In 1977, he was one of the [[collective]] that established Underwhich Editions <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccca.concordia.ca/history/ozz/english/presses/underwhich_editions.html|title=One Zero Zero Virtual Library|website=Ccca.concordia.ca|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> which edited, designed, published and distributed the works of worthy writers. During the 1970s and 80s, bp was a contributing editor of Open Letter,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~fdavey/history.htm|title=Open Letter - History and Mandate|website=publish.uwo.ca}}</ref> a [[literary magazine]].

Nichol also had a large presence on screens of various sizes. In the mid-1980s, he became a writer for the children's television show, ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'', created by [[Jim Henson]]. Soon, scriptwriting for other children's television shows<ref name="auto"/> followed: ''[[The Raccoons]]'', ''[[Under the Umbrella Tree]]'', ''[[Care Bears]]'' and ''[[Babar (TV series)|Babar]]''. Several films include bp and his work, starting with [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s short film, ''Sons of Captain Poetry'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubu.com/film/ondaatje_poetry.html|title=UbuWeb Film & Video: Michael Ondaatje - The Sons of Captain Poetry (1970)|website=Ubu.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> [[Ron Mann]]'s ''[[Poetry in Motion (film)|Poetry in Motion]]'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=843O0bTVKHQ|title=''The Four Horsemen's'' emotional poetry

Since his death, there has been an upsurge of interest in ''First Screenings'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vispo.com/bp|title=First Screening by bp Nichol|website=Vispo.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> Nichol's 1984 computer poem (updated by Jim Andrews and his team <ref>{{cite web|url=http://vispo.com/bp/jim.htm|title=Jim Andrews on bpNichol's First Screening|website=Vispo.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>) which has been part of electronic exhibitions from [[Mexico]] to [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]].
