'''Srečko Kosovel''' ({{Audio|Srecko Kosovel.ogg|pronunciation}}) (18 March 1904 &ndash; 26 May 1926) was a Slovenian poet, now considered one of central Europe's major modernist poets.<ref name="AustralianPoetica">[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/poetica/kosovel/4643684 A bi-lingual feature on the Slovenian poet Srečko Kosovel], ''Poetica'' radio series, 3 August 2013, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]</ref> He was labeled an impressionistic poet of his native [[Karst Plateau|Karst region]], a political poet resisting forced [[Italianization]] of the [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)|Slovene areas annexed by Italy]], an expressionist, a dadaist, a satirist, and as a voice of international socialism, using [[Avant garde|avant-garde]] [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] forms.<ref name="JacksonR">Jackson, R. (2010): Introduction, in: ''Look Back, Look Ahead: Selected Poems by Kosovel'', Ugly Duckling Press, 2010, {{ISBN|1933254548}}</ref> He is now considered a Slovenian poetic icon.

Most of Kosovel's works were published almost four decades after his early death at 22. In his homeland, Kosovel entered the 20th-century Slovene [[literary canon]] as a poet who produced an impressive body of work of more than 1000 drafts, among them 500 complete poems, with a quality regarded as unusually high for his age.<ref name="AustralianPoetica"/>

==Life==
[[File:Tomaj - Kosovelova domačija.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The house in [[Tomaj]] where Kosovel spent his childhood]]
Srečko Kosovel was born as the youngest of five children to father Anton Kosovel, a Slovene teacher, who was not allowed to continue teaching in Slovene after the [[Austrian Littoral]] was annexed by Italy with Treaty of Rapallo (1920),<ref>Pirjevec, Marija (2004). "Srečko Kosovel in slovenstvo", ''Primorska srečanja'' 273</ref> and mother Katarina (née Streš) who was 40 years old at the time of his birth and nurtured the artistic talents of their children. Kosovel's sister played the piano and one of his brothers was an aspiring writer, too. Born in [[Sežana]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Kosovel lived in the nearby village of [[Tomaj]] until 1924.

Before the annexation of his native Karst by Italy, he familiarized himself with works of [[Slovene culture]] in general, especially [[Slovene literature]], as well as drama at the [[Slovene theatre in Trieste]], housed in the [[Trieste National Hall]], the cultural center of Slovenes in Trieste.<ref>[http://www.siol.net/scena/druzabna_kronika/2012/02/kosovel_monografija_vrecko.aspx K kot Kosovel, kons, konstruktivizem, Kvintilijan], ''Žurnal24'', 9 February 2012</ref>

Kosovel has been compared to [[Rimbaud]],<ref>Brooks, David (2008), [http://www.saltpublishing.com/assets/samples/9781844718559samp.pdf Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232542/http://www.saltpublishing.com/assets/samples/9781844718559samp.pdf |date=2013-10-04 }}, in: ''The Golden Boat: Selected Poems of Srečko Kosovel'', p. 2, {{ISBN|1844714373}}</ref> sharing the young age at which they were exposed to human suffering during war. The [[Isonzo Front]]—one of the worst engagements of the First World War, which began when Kosovel was 12 and officially ended when he was 17—was near Kosovel's native village, and Rimbaud's native village was near the battles of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Kosovel had regular contacts with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|wounded soldiers]] and saw corpses because the [[Battles of the Isonzo|battlefield]] was only some 15 kilometers from his home, which had a [[Survivor guilt#Survivor syndrome|traumatizing effect]] on him. His parents wanted him to be removed from the vicinity of the war, and so in 1916 both he and his sister moved to [[Ljubljana]], where he stayed until his early death.

With the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] and Italian annexation of Slovene territories, including his native [[Karst Plateau|Karst region]], Kosovel felt robbed of his beloved landscape because this and all Slovene schools and organizations were forbidden by the Fascist regime. Slovene intellectuals were subjected to reprisals, and this has been called one of the tragedies of his short life, evoking in him grief, anger, displacement, and disorientation.<ref>Brooks, David (2008), [http://www.saltpublishing.com/assets/samples/9781844718559samp.pdf Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232542/http://www.saltpublishing.com/assets/samples/9781844718559samp.pdf |date=2013-10-04 }}, in: ''The Golden Boat: Selected Poems of Srečko Kosovel'', p.8, {{ISBN|1844714373}}</ref> This was especially because his new homeland, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, also showed no interest in the suffering of the [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)]] under the Fascist regime in Italy. Even in his negotiations with Italy in 1923, when [[Benito Mussolini]] wanted to modify the Rapallo borders in order for Italy to annex the still-independent state of [[Rijeka]], King Alexander preferred "good relations" with Italy over the proposals for border corrections at Postojna and Idrija proposed by SHS Prime Minister [[Nikola Pašić]].<ref>Čermelj, L. (1955). [http://sistory.si/SISTORY:ID:12218 Kako je prišlo do prijateljskega pakta med Italijo in kraljevino SHS] (How the Friendship Treaty between Italy and the Kingdom of SHS Came About in 1924), ''Zgodovinski časopis'', 1-4, p.195</ref> This led to Kosovel's political and artistic radicalization. He had contacts with the radical political and insurgent anti-Fascist organization [[TIGR]].<ref>[http://www.primorske.si/Primorska/Srednja-Primorska/Bil-je-zelo-zivahen-mladenic-a--sam.aspx Bil je zelo živahen mladenič, a sam], ''Primorske novice'', 26 March 2012</ref> In 1926, he visited the Yugoslav town of [[Zagorje ob Savi|Zagorje]] to perform one of his recitals, and while waiting for the train to return to Ljubljana caught a cold, which eventually developed into [[meningitis]]. He returned to his home village of [[Tomaj]], where he died on 26 May 1926.

==Work==
His early works were mainly about his feelings of longing for his family and native [[Karst]] landscape. Kosovel met his peers, Slovenes that have left Italy-annexed ethnic Slovene areas, at the [[University of Ljubljana]] and they established literary magazine called ''[[Lepa Vida]]'' ("The Fair Vida", a motive from Slovene [[folk poetry]]), where Kosovel served as the magazine's editor. Kosovel became acquainted with more radical ideas at the "[[Ivan Cankar]] Club", named after the Slovenian radical author, and increasingly became attracted by the revolutionary ideas and the [[avant-garde]] Soviet and German works that [[Ivo Grahor]] introduced him to.

===The constructivist turn===
[[File:Srečko Kosovel - Kons 5.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Manuscript of ''Kons 5'', one of Kosovel's most famous late poems. It reads:<br/>Dung is gold
and gold is dung.<br/>Both = 0<br/>0 = ∞<br/>∞ = 0<br/>AB <br/>1, 2, 3.<br/>Whoever has no soul<br/>doesn't need gold.<br/>Whoever has a soul<br/>doesn't need dung.<br/>EE-AW]]

In 1925, together with a [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] artist [[Avgust Černigoj]], Kosovel was considering establishing a new magazine ''Konstruktor'' ("Constructor") and started writing his constructivist poems, called ''konsi'' (''kons'' in singular), short for ''konstrukcije'' ("constructions"). With the constructivism he turned away from a silent lyric to a loud, presumptuous, offensive poetry full of linguistic innovations: language free of syntax and logical ordering, freedom of imagery, use of typography, styles and colors, mathematical symbols, equations, paper collages, and all other sorts of experimental writing.<ref>[http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poet/item/5043/23/Srecko-Kosovel Srečko Kosovel], Poetry International Foundation, Netherlands</ref>

At about the same time, Kosovel prepared to publish a collection of his early poems, entitled ''Zlati čoln'' ("Golden Boat"). With this selection of poems, he intended to put an end to his early style, strongly influenced by the [[impressionism|impressionist]] poetry of [[Josip Murn]]. He was however crushed by the negative response of both publishing houses and some of his closest friends.

Kosovel then turned exclusively to his constructivist poetry, which he wanted to publish in a collection entitled ''Konsi''. He however never managed to achieve this; his constructivist poetry would remain unknown to the public until as late as 1967, when [[Anton Ocvirk]] decided to release Kosovel's collection under the title ''Integrali '26''.

The same year, in 1925, Kosovel became editor of the magazine ''[[Mladina]]'' (Youth). This had an enormous impact on his life: he had very ambitious plans with the journal, intending to transform it into a nationwide left-wing publication that would attract all modernist and avant-gardiste artists from [[Slovene Lands]] and [[Yugoslavia]], as well as serving as the platform for a radical Slovenian political agenda. He remained the programme editor of the paper until his death.

===Late works===
The year 1925 was Kosovel's most productive period. It was also a time that saw him shift his politics to the left. As his prose became simpler in style, it had a greater appeal to the [[proletariat]]. Kosovel conceived the idea of a proletarians' writers union and a publishing house called ''Strelci'' ("Archers"), in which his collection of constructivist poetry could also be published.

==Reception==
The poetry of Kosovel is seen to come from three artistic movements: [[Impressionism]], [[Expressionism]] and [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]. Kosovel's poetry also incorporates elements with [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]]. His style is too complex to be identified by a particular movement or current. His works show his concern with social and political oppression in the Slovene Lands, the fate of Slovenes threatened by foreign powers, the feeling of a decadence of Europe and the hope for a "new dawn". The Karst region, with its ascetic and rigid scenery, is one of the main motifs in Kosovel's poetry. His verses are full of [[wit]], [[irony]], depth and a sentiment of [[tragedy]].

He has been often compared to other brilliant and tragic European authors from his same generation, such as the Hungarian [[Attila József]], Italian [[Cesare Pavese]], or Spanish [[Federico García Lorca]].

===Posthumous publications===
In 1927, Alfonz Gspan published his late friend's early poems in a booklet consisting of 66 works. In 1946, Anton Ocvirk published Kosovel's "Collected Works", which were received by interest from the literary community. Ocvirk further published "The Golden Boat" in 1954. These publications however omitted Kosovel's late works. Only in 1967, a book called "Integrals '26" was published, edited by Ocvirk. The third volume of "Collected Works" was published in 1977.

Kosovel also left unfinished works in lyrical prose form, sketches, note, diaries and essays and criticisms concerning cultural problems. Much of it was published in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of Kosovel's birth, in the monograph entitled ''Ikarjev sen'' ("[[Icarus]]'es Dream"), edited by the literary critics [[Aleš Berger]] and Ludwig Hartinger.

A new selection of Kosovel's poetry has been translated into English by Bert Pribac, [[David Brooks (author)|David Brooks]], assisted by Teja Brooks Pribac: "The Golden Boat: Selected Poems of Srečko Kosovel" (Salt 2008). Many further works by Srečko Kosovel have been translated into English by Lesley Zore: "Best of Srečko Kosovel's Work, Translated by Lesley Zore" (self-published, 2020-2021).
