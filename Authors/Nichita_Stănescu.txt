'''Nichita Stănescu''' ({{IPA-ro|niˈkita stəˈnesku}}; born '''Nichita Hristea Stănescu'''; 31 March 1933 – 13 December 1983) was a [[Romania]]n poet and essayist.

==Biography==
Stănescu's father was Nicolae Hristea Stănescu (1908–1982). His mother, Tatiana Cereaciuchin, was Russian (originally from [[Voronezh]], she had fled Russia and married in 1931). Nichita Stănescu graduated from the [[Ion Luca Caragiale National College (Ploiești)|Ion Luca Caragiale High School]] in [[Ploiești]], then went on to study Romanian language and literature at the [[University of Bucharest]], graduating in 1957. He made his literary debut in the ''Tribuna'' literary magazine.

Stănescu married Magdalena Petrescu in 1952, but the couple separated a year later. In 1962 he married Doina Ciurea. In 1982 he married Todorița "Dora" Tărâță.

For much of his career, Stănescu was a contributor to and editor of ''Gazeta  Literară'', ''[[România Literară]]'', and ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]''.

His editorial debut was the poetry book ''[[Sensul iubirii]]'' ("The Aim of Love"), which appeared under the ''Luceafărul'' selection, in 1960. He also was the recipient of numerous awards for his verse, the most important being the [[Herder Prize]] in 1975 and a nomination for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] in 1980. The last volume of poetry published in his lifetime was ''Noduri și semne'' ("Knots and Signs"), published in 1982. A heavy drinker, he died of [[cardiac arrest|cardiopulmonary arrest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/bucuresti/scriitorii-Si-alcoolul--nichita-stanescu-bea-doua-sticle-vodca-zi-marin-preda-murit-betie-crunta-1_50bde91c7c42d5a663cfc90f/index.html|title=Scriitorii și alcoolul.
