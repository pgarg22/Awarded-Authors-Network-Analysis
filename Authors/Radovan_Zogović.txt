He was born in [[Mašnica]], [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], in northeastern [[Montenegro]] on 19 August 1907.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon">{{cite book |author= Boško Novaković |editor = Živan Milisavac |date=1971 |title=Jugoslovenski književni leksikon |trans-title=Yugoslav Literary Lexicon |publisher=[[Matica srpska]] |language=sh |location= [[Novi Sad]] ([[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|SAP Vojvodina]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]]) |pages=589-590 }}</ref> Before [[World War II]] he lived in [[Skopje]], [[Zagreb]] and Belgrade, working as a literary critic and a secondary school teacher,<ref name=enciklopedija.hr>[http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=67372 enciklopedija.hr]</ref> and joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]. His first book of poetry, ''Glineni golubovi'' (Clay Pigeons, 1937), was banned by the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav royal regime]].

He joined the Partisans in 1941, and after World War II he was briefly one of the most prominent figures in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government, as head of the propaganda of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, authoring several programmatic and polemical articles and criticism from the standpoint of dogmatic real socialism (''Na poprištu'', "At the scene", 1948).<ref name=enciklopedija.hr/> He was expelled from the League of Communists and put under house arrest in 1948 in connection with the Tito-Stalin split. He was accused of being [[Stalinist]] and for [[Montenegrin nationalism]] among else.

In the late 1960s [[Zogović]] was semi-rehabilitated, and in that period his best works were published: poetry collections ''Prkosne strofe'' ("Defiant verses", 1947), ''Žilama za kamen'' ("Veins for the rock"), ''Artikulisana riječ'' ("Articulated word", 1965), ''Lično, sasvim lično'' ("Personal, very personal"), ''Noć i pola vijeka'' ("A night and half a century", 1978) and ''Knjaževska kancelarija'' (The Prince's Office). He also wrote the novel ''Pejsaži i nešto se dešava'' ("The landscape and something happens", 1968).
His poetry at first was very socially engaged, critical and polemical towards social reality, while in the later songs predominate landscape and homeland motifs and reflection on youth, the passage of time and fate.<ref name=enciklopedija.hr/>
His poems have been translated in many languages, and he himself translated works from Russian, Bulgarian, Turkish and Macedonian authors, including [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Nazim Hikmet]].

Among his close friends were the [[Serbia]]n poet [[Desanka Maksimović]] and the Montenegrin novelist [[Mihailo Lalić]].
He was a member of the [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

He died of [[cancer]] on 5 January 1986 in [[Belgrade]].

His wife Vera (who died in 2003) was also a translator from Russian, and his daughter Mirka from Italian.
