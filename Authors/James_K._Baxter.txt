'''James Keir Baxter''' (29 June 1926 – 22 October 1972) was a New Zealand poet and playwright. He was also known as an activist for the preservation of [[Māori culture]]. He is one of New Zealand's most well-known and controversial literary figures. He was a prolific writer who produced numerous poems, plays and articles in his short life, and was regarded as the preeminent writer of his generation. He suffered from alcoholism until the late 1950s. He converted to Catholicism and established a controversial commune at [[Jerusalem, New Zealand]] in 1969. He was married to [[Jacquie Sturm]], a writer in her own right.

==Early life==
Baxter was born in [[Dunedin]] as the second son to [[Archibald Baxter]] and [[Millicent Baxter|Millicent Brown]] and grew up near [[Brighton, New Zealand|Brighton]], 20&nbsp;km south of Dunedin city.<ref name="DNZB">{{DNZB|last=Millar|first=Paul|id=5b14|title=Baxter, James Keir|access-date=4 November 2020|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Car">{{cite web |title=James K.

Baxter's father had been a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War I]], and both his parents were active [[pacifists]] and [[socialists]].<ref name="NZEDGE">{{cite web |last1=Ward |first1=Paul Stanley |title=NZEDGE Legends – James Keir Baxter |url=https://www.nzedge.com/legends/james-keir-baxter/ |website=NZEDGE |date=6 March 2013 |access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref> His mother had studied Latin, French and German at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney]], the [[University of Sydney]] and [[Newnham College]], University of Cambridge.

In 1936, when Baxter was ten, the family moved to [[Whanganui|Wanganui]] where he and his brother attended [[St Johns Hill]] School, and the following year they moved to England and attended [[Sibford School]] in the [[Cotswolds]].<ref name="DNZB" /> Both schools were [[Quaker]] schools and [[boarding schools]].<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|9–10}}  In 1938 the family returned to New Zealand.<ref name="DNZB" /> Baxter said of his early life that he felt a gap between himself and other people, "increased considerably by the fact that I was born in New Zealand, and grew up there till I was nine, and then attended an English boarding school for a couple of years, and came back to New Zealand at thirteen, in the first flush of puberty, quite out of touch with my childhood companions and uncertain whether I was an Englishman or a New Zealander".<ref name="Beginnings">{{cite journal |last1=Baxter |first1=James K. |title=Beginnings |journal=Landfall |date=September 1965 |issue=75 |page=237 |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Bax1Pros-t1-g1-g2-t316.html |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref>

Baxter began writing poetry at the age of seven, and he accumulated a large body of technically accomplished work both before and during his teenage years.<ref name="DNZB" />

In 1940, Baxter began attending [[King's High School, Dunedin]], where he was bullied, because of his differences to other students (in personality, voice and background), his lack of interest in team sports and his family's pacifism.<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|14–15}} His older brother, Terence, was a conscientious objector like their father and was detained in military camps between 1941 and 1945 for his refusal to fight in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Baxter, Terence John, 1922– |url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/22592405 |website=National Library of New Zealand |date=January 1922 |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> Between 1942 and 1946, Baxter drafted around 600 poems, saying later in life that his experiences as a teenager were painful but "created a gap in which the poems were able to grow".<ref name="Beginnings" /><ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|15}}

In 1943, Baxter's final year of high school, he wrote to a friend that he was considering becoming a lawyer, but was "not decided on it": "If I should find it possible to live by writing I would gladly do so. Yet many men have thought they could, and found it an illusion."<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|17}}

==Life and career==
===Early literary career===
[[File:Māori Jesus at Te Papa.JPG|thumb|A casting in concrete of "The Māori Jesus", a poem by Baxter]]
In March 1944, at age seventeen, Baxter enrolled at the [[University of Otago]].<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|18}} That same year, he published his first collection of poetry, ''Beyond the Palisade'',<ref Name="Car"/> to much critical acclaim. [[Allen Curnow]] selected six poems from the collection for 1945 collection ''A Book of New Zealand Verse 1923–1945'', and described Baxter's poems as "a new occurrence in New Zealand: strong in impulse and confident in invention, with qualities of youth in verse which we have lacked".<ref name="OCNZL Beyond">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Millar |first=Paul |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Roger |editor2-last=Wattie |editor2-first=Nelson |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature |title=Beyond the Palisade |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001/acref-9780195583489-e-118 |access-date=4 November 2020 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-3519-6 |oclc=865265749 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001}}</ref> In this year, Baxter also won the Macmillan Brown Prize for his poem "Convoys". The prize was coincidentally named after his Scottish maternal grandfather, [[John Macmillan Brown]].<ref name="Gilchrist">{{cite news |last1=Gilchrist |first1=Shane |title=Chapter and prose |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/lifestyle/magazine/chapter-and-prose |access-date=4 November 2020 |work=Otago Daily Times |date=19 August 2015}}</ref>

Baxter's work during this time was, as with his contemporary compatriots, most notably the experimental novelist [[Janet Frame]], largely influenced by the modernist works of [[Dylan Thomas]]. He was a member of the so-called "[[Wellington Group]]" of writers that also included [[Louis Johnson (poet)|Louis Johnson]], [[W.H. Oliver]] and [[Alistair Campbell (poet)|Alistair Campbell]]. Baxter typically wrote short lyrical poems or cycles of the same rather than longer poems.

After his eighteenth birthday on 29 June 1944, like his father and brother, Baxter registered as a conscientious objector, citing "religious and humanitarian" grounds. The authorities did not pursue him however due to the late stage of the war.<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|20}}

Baxter failed to complete his course work at the University of Otago due to increasing [[alcoholism]], and was forced to take a range of odd jobs from 1945–7.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref Name="Car"/> He fictionalised these experiences in his only novel ''Horse'', published posthumously in 1985.<ref name="DNZB" /> It was during this time that he had his first significant relationship, with a young medical student, but the relationship ended due to his alcoholism.<ref name="OCNZL Baxter" /> He wrote the collection of poems ''Cold Spring'' about this early failed relationship, but it was not published until after his death in 1996.<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|24}}  In 1947 he met [[Jacquie Sturm]], a young Māori student, who would later become his wife.<ref name="DNZB" />

In late 1947, Baxter moved to [[Christchurch]] where he continued working odd jobs.<ref name="DNZB" /> Although he did not enrol at the [[University of Canterbury]] he became the literary editor of its student magazine, [[Canta (magazine)|''Canta'']], and attended some lectures.<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|35}} His behaviour could be erratic due to his alcoholism.<ref name="OCNZL Baxter" />  His second collection, ''Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness'' was published in 1948, and its themes included the New Zealand landscape and solitude. Curnow, in a review, described Baxter as "the most original of New Zealand poets now living".<ref name="OCNZL Blow">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Millar |first=Paul |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Roger |editor2-last=Wattie |editor2-first=Nelson |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature |title=Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001/acref-9780195583489-e-135 |access-date=4 November 2020 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-3519-6 |oclc=865265749 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001}}</ref>

===Marriage and later career===
In 1948 Baxter married Jacquie Sturm at [[Waiapu Cathedral of Saint John the Evangelist, Napier|St John's Cathedral, Napier]], and his developing interest in Christianity culminated in his joining the [[Anglican church]] and being [[baptised]] during that same year.<ref name="DNZB" /> They moved to Wellington and in February 1951 Baxter enrolled at [[Wellington Teachers' College]].<ref name="DNZB" /> In 1952 Baxter's poems were published in a collaborative volume, ''Poems Unpleasant'', alongside poems from Louis Johnson and Anton Vogt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baxter |first1=James K. |last2=Johnson |first2=Louis |last3=Vogt |first3=Anton |title=Poems unpleasant |date=1952 |publisher=Pegasus Press |location=Christchurch, New Zealand |url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/22152025 |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> He completed his teaching course in December 1952, and subsequently published his third major collection of poems, ''The Fallen House''.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Baxter |first1=James K. |title=The fallen house |date=1953 |publisher=Caxton Press |location=Christchurch, New Zealand |url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/22158806 |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> In 1954 he was appointed assistant master at [[Epuni]] School, [[Lower Hutt]], and it was here that he wrote a series of children's poems published later as ''The Tree House, and Other Poems for Children'' (1974).<ref name="DNZB" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Baxter |first1=James K. |title=The tree house, and other poems for children |date=1974 |publisher=Price Milburn |location=Wellington, New Zealand |url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/21935726 |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref>

Baxter and his wife had a daughter, Hilary, in 1949, and a son, John, in 1952.<ref name="NZEDGE" />

In late 1954, Baxter joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], successfully achieving sobriety, and in 1955, he finally graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College]].<ref name="DNZB" /> He had also received a substantial inheritance from a great-aunt in 1955 and was able to purchase a house for the family in [[Ngaio, New Zealand|Ngaio]], Wellington.<ref name="OCNZL Baxter" /><ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|45}} He left Epuni School early in 1956 to write and edit primary school bulletins for the [[Department of Education (New Zealand)|Department of Education's]] School Publications Branch. This period is likely to have influenced his later writing which criticised bureaucracy.<ref name="DNZB" />

In 1957 Baxter took a course in [[Roman Catholicism]] and his collection of poems ''In Fires of No Return'', published in 1958 by [[Oxford University Press]], was influenced by his new faith. This was his first work to be published internationally, though it was not critically well-received.<ref name="OCNZL In Fires">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Millar |first=Paul |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Roger |editor2-last=Wattie |editor2-first=Nelson |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature |title=In Fires of No Return |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001/acref-9780195583489-e-576 |access-date=4 November 2020 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-3519-6 |oclc=865265749 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001}}</ref> Baxter's wife, a committed Anglican, was dismayed by his conversion to Catholicism, and it was partly because of his conversion that they separated in 1957.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="McDonald">{{cite news |last1=McDonald |first1=Jack |title=Baxter Week: My Nana, Jacquie Sturm |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/books/15-02-2019/baxter-week-my-nana-jacqui-sturm/ |access-date=4 November 2020 |work=The Spinoff |date=15 February 2019}}</ref> Baxter admitted however in a letter to a friend that his conversion was "just one more event in a series of injuries, alcoholism, and gross mistakes".<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|51}} Through the late 50s and 60s Baxter visited the [[Southern Star Abbey]], a [[Cistercian]] monastery at [[Kopua]] near [[Central Hawke's Bay]].<ref name="Kopua">{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Richard |title=James K.

Later in 1958, Baxter received a [[UNESCO]] stipend to study educational publishing and began an extended journey through Asia, and especially India, where [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s university [[Shantiniketan]] was one of the inspirations for Baxter's later community at [[Jerusalem, New Zealand]]. In India he was reconciled with his wife and contracted [[dysentery]].<ref name="DNZB" /> His writing after returning from India was more overtly critical of New Zealand society, evident in the collection ''Howrah Bridge and Other Poems'' (1961).<ref name="DNZB" /> He was particularly concerned about the displacement of Māori within the country.<ref name="Beattie">{{cite web |last1=Beattie |first1=Elizabeth |title=Outside Looking In: Remembering James K Baxter and Jerusalem |url=https://pantograph-punch.com/posts/outside-looking-in-james-k-baxter-jerusalem |website=The Pantograph Punch |access-date=5 November 2020 |date=14 January 2016}}</ref>

In the late 1950s and 1960s Baxter became a powerful and prolific writer of both poems and drama, and it was through his 1958 radio play ''Jack Winter's Dream'' that he became internationally known.<ref name="DNZB" /> The play was produced by the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Service]] for radio,<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|53}} and in 1978 was adapted for the screen by New Zealand filmmaker [[David Sims (director)|David Sims]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Diana |title=Jack Winter's Dream |journal=Art New Zealand |date=Summer 1979–80 |issue=14 |url=https://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues11to20/cinema1402.htm |access-date=8 November 2020}}</ref>

The first half of the 1960s also saw, however, Baxter struggling to make ends meet on a postman's wage, having resigned from the Department of Education in 1963 and refused to take work as a schoolmaster.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|64–65}} He also controversially criticised ''The Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse'', an anthology published by his former champion Allen Curnow, for under-representing younger New Zealand poets.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|55}} However, in 1966 Baxter's critically acclaimed collection of poems ''Pig Island Letters'' was published in which his writing found a new level of clarity.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="NZEDGE" /> In 1966, Baxter took up the [[Robert Burns Fellowship]] at the University of Otago, which eased the money worries for a time.<ref name="DNZB" /> He held the fellowship for two years during which time he participated in protests against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="DNZB" /> During the fellowship he also had a number of his plays staged at the [[Globe Theatre, Dunedin|Globe Theatre]] by Dunedin director Patric Carey.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Millar|first=Paul|date=2019|title=Baxter, James Keir|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5b14/baxter-james-keir|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

===Jerusalem===
In 1968 Baxter claimed in a letter to his friend [[John Weir (New Zealand writer)|John Weir]] that he had been instructed in a dream to "Go to Jerusalem".<ref name="Beattie" /> [[Jerusalem, New Zealand]] was a small Māori settlement (known by its Māori transliteration, Hiruhārama) on the [[Whanganui River|Wanganui River]]. He left his university position and a job composing catechetical material for the [[Roman Catholicism in New Zealand#Education|Catholic Education Board]], with nothing but a bible. This was the culmination of a short period in which he struggled with family life and his vocation as a poet.<ref name="DNZB" />

While planning his move to Jerusalem, in early 1969, Baxter spent some time in [[Grafton, New Zealand|Grafton]], Auckland where he set up a drop-in centre for drug addicts, acting on the same principles as Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref name="DNZB" /> Around this time, Baxter worked for three weeks as a cleaner at [[Chelsea Sugar Refinery]], which inspired the poem ''Ballad of the Stonegut Sugar Works''.<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|91}} He had been referred to the job by poet [[Hone Tuwhare]].<ref name="Read NZ">{{cite web |title=Baxter, James K |url=https://www.read-nz.org/writer/baxter-james-k |website=Read NZ |access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> He also adopted the Māori version of his name, Hemi.<ref name="DNZB" />

Around July or August 1969, Baxter travelled to Jerusalem, which according to John Weir was at that time "a tiny Māori settlement – it had a marae, a resident priest, a church, a convent, resident nuns and some abandoned dwellings."<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|93–94}} Baxter stayed in a cottage owned by the [[Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion|Sisters of Compassion]], and obtained permission for a long stay from the [[superior general|mother general]] of the sisters.<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|94}} He proceeded to form a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] structured around "spiritual aspects of Māori communal life".<ref name="DNZB" /> It was a place where he felt he could embody both his Catholic faith and his interest in Māori culture.<ref name="Beattie" /> He lived a sparse and isolated existence and made frequent trips to the nearby cities where he worked with the poor and spoke out against what he perceived as a social order that sanctions poverty. His poems of this time, published in his final collections ''Jerusalem Sonnets'' (1970) and ''Autumn Testament'' (1972), have a conversational style but speak strongly of his social and political convictions.<ref name="DNZB" />

The commune's popularity grew, in part due to an article in the [[Sunday Star-Times|''Sunday Times'']] newspaper in June 1970, and by mid-1970 around 25 people were living in the community.<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|107}} The population increased to 40 permanent residents by May 1971, mostly aged between 16 and 25, living in three abandoned houses, and the number of visitors was estimated by Baxter at about a thousand over the year.<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|110}} The five goals Baxter devised for the commune were: "To share one's goods; To speak the truth, not hiding one's heart from others; To love one another and show it by the embrace; To take no job where one has to lick the boss's arse; To learn from the Maori side of the fence".<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|109}} He was, however, reluctant to impose any kind of rules or work roster.<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|111}}

The increased numbers of residents and visitors, and the lack of order and regulation, led to growing concern from the Sisters of Compassion and [[Whanganui District Council|Wanganui District Council]], and opposition from local residents, particularly the local Māori [[iwi]], [[Ngāti Hau]].<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="Beattie" /><ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|111}} Baxter himself was often absent from the commune participating in protests or other social work.<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|111}} In September 1971, the commune was disbanded under pressure from the Council and local farmers.<ref name="Beattie" /> Baxter returned to live in Wellington, but in February 1972 was permitted to return to Jerusalem provided that only 10 people would be allowed to live on the land at any one time.<ref name="DNZB" /><ref name="Beattie" />

===Final years and death===
[[File:James K. Baxter memorial plaque in Dunedin.jpg|thumb|James K. Baxter memorial plaque in Dunedin]]
The harsh deprivations Baxter adopted at this time took their toll on his health. By 1972 he was too ill to continue living at Jerusalem and moved to another commune near Auckland. On 22 October 1972 he suffered a [[coronary thrombosis]] in the street and died in a nearby house, aged 46. He was buried at Jerusalem on Māori land in front of "the Top House" where he had lived, in a ceremony combining Māori and Catholic traditions.<ref name="DNZB" /> A river boulder on the burial site was inscribed with his Māori name Hemi.<ref name="Complete V4"/>{{rp|122}}

Sturm was Baxter's [[literary executor]] after his death. She collected and catalogued his prolific writing, arranged new and revised publications of his work, and negotiated the use and adaptation of his works.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maori author to receive Honorary Doctorate |url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED0301/S00017.htm |access-date=5 November 2020 |work=Scoop Independent News |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington |date=28 January 2003}}</ref> She set up the James K.

==Evidence and allegations of sexual assault==
In January 2019, the [[Victoria University Press]] published a collection of Baxter's personal letters as ''James K Baxter: Letters of a Poet''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baxter |first1=James |editor1-last=Weir |editor1-first=John |title=James K Baxter: Letters of a Poet |date=January 2019 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-1-7765-6203-9 |url=https://vup.victoria.ac.nz/james-k-baxter-letters-of-a-poet/ |access-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> The collection was edited by his friend, John Weir. One letter in the collection revealed that Baxter confided to a friend that he raped his wife, Jacquie Sturm, after she expressed low interest in sex. New Zealanders reacted with dismay to the revelations, describing them as "awful", "terrible" and "shocking".<ref name="Roy">{{cite web |last1=Roy |first1=Eleanor Ainge |title=James K Baxter: venerated poet's letters about marital rape rock New Zealand |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/james-k-baxter-venerated-poets-letters-about-marital-rock-new-zealand |website=The Guardian |access-date=15 February 2019 |date=15 February 2019}}</ref> In ''The Spinoff'' [[John Newton (poet)|John Newton]] wrote that it is no longer possible to talk about Baxter without addressing how Baxter thinks and writes about women.<ref Name="Spinoff">{{cite web |last1=Newton |first1=John |title=James K Baxter, rapist |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/books/14-02-2019/james-k-baxter-rapist/ |website=The Spinoff |access-date=15 February 2019 |date=14 February 2019}}</ref>

[[Paul Millar (poet)|Paul Millar]], a Baxter scholar and personal friend of Sturm, who had been appointed as her literary executor after her death, cautioned against reading the letter as turning Sturm into a victim: "Leaving apart how appalling this letter is – a betrayal on so many levels from the brutal act described, the lack of shame in the description, and the profound betrayal of trust – its publicity is once again putting Jacquie in a subordinate position to Baxter, a bit player in his narrative. ... Jacquie deserves much more than to be remembered as Baxter’s victim ... despite everything she endured, she emerged victorious. If people really want to know Jacquie they should seek our her writing, not Baxter's."<ref name="Roy" /> [[Mark Williams (writer)|Mark Williams]], [[Emeritus#In academia|emeritus Professor]] of English at Victoria University, said the admission was consistent with what he knew of Baxter: "He observed his own adulteries objectively as part of the fallen human condition. This even extended to marital rape. I’m not sure if he was simply a phoney, as some have observed. He was genuinely religious. The problem is that his religious faith allowed him to regard his sexual failings—small and great—at a quizzical remove."<ref name="Spinoff"/>

Baxter and Sturm's great-grandson, Jack McDonald, wrote that the account was "sickening" and that he believed his great-grandmother "would never have wanted these brutal details made public". He also noted that she never received sufficient credit for connecting Baxter to the Māori world: "The reality is that Nana had introduced Baxter to everything he knew about [[Māori culture|Māoritanga]]".<ref name="McDonald" />

An allegation of attempted rape followed when, in April 2019, the New Zealand news outlet ''[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]'' published an account by Rosalind Lewis (Ros), who had been at the Jerusalem commune in 1970 when she was aged 18 years. Ros described an "attempted rape", which would have succeeded were it not for Baxter's [[erectile dysfunction]]. She mentioned a friend of hers, "Angela", who had told Ros that she was permitted to watch him [[Flagellation|flagellate]] himself (presumably a variety of religious penance), and that she, Angela, knew of two other women who she claims were sexually abused. No charges were pressed at the time by the women. Lewis said: "This truth needs to sit alongside Baxter's literary achievements. It must be fully acknowledged and never glossed over. This is for the sake of women such as myself and for those who may not be able to find a voice as I have. As ever, in celebrating the genius of Baxter the artist, we cannot overlook the evils of Baxter the human being."<ref name="Lewis">{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Ros |title=Ros Lewis was sexually assaulted by James K Baxter at Jerusalem.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Criticism of Baxter's poetry has generally focussed on his incorporation of European myths into his New Zealand poems, his interest in Māori culture and language, and the significance of his religious experiences and conversion to Roman Catholicism.<ref name="Hawkins">{{cite book |last1=Hawkins-Dady |first1=Mark |title=Reader's Guide to Literature in English |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-1353-1417-0 |page=217 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww5ddqXGPVYC&pg=PT216 |access-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> New Zealand [[New Zealand Poet Laureate|poet laureate]] [[Vincent O'Sullivan (New Zealand poet)|Vincent O'Sullivan]] wrote in 1976 that Baxter is an inherently New Zealand poet: "that is the proportion of Baxter's achievement – the most complete delineation yet of a New Zealand mind. The poetic record of its shaping is as original an act as anything we have."<ref name="O'Sullivan">{{cite book |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Vincent |title=James K. Baxter |date=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-1955-8010-5}}</ref> A common theme in Baxter's extensive body of writing was strong criticism of New Zealand society. His biographer Paul Millar said: "If, at times, Baxter appears to evaluate New Zealand society harshly, his judgements are always from the perspective of one intimately involved in the social process."<ref name="DNZB" />

Baxter's use of [[te reo Māori]] has inspired both praise and criticism. W.H. Oliver described it as "often a cosmetic device, or worse, an earnest affectation".<ref name="Double">{{cite book |last1=Newton |first1=John |title=The Double Rainbow: James K. Baxter, Ngāti Hau and the Jerusalem Commune |date=2009 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-8647-3603-1}}</ref>{{rp|13}} By contrast, John Newton noted that at least some Māori welcomed Baxter's engagement with their language and culture,<ref name="Double" />{{rp|14}} and John Weir regards his use as "a genuine attempt at using a bicultural language in this country when no other Pākehā was doing so".<ref name="Complete V4" />{{rp|146}}

In his critical study ''Lives of the Poets'', [[Michael Schmidt (poet)|Michael Schmidt]] claimed that Baxter was "one of the most precocious poets of the century" whose neglect outside of New Zealand is baffling.<ref name="Schmidt">{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first=Michael |title=Lives of the Poets |publisher= [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] |author-link=Michael Schmidt (poet) |year=2007 |isbn=9780297840145}}</ref>{{rp|835}} In Schmidt's view, Baxter's writing was affected by his alcoholism. Schmidt also commented on Baxter's influences, noting that his work drew upon [[Dylan Thomas]] and [[W. B. Yeats]]; then on [[Louis MacNeice]] and [[Robert Lowell]]. Michael Schmidt identified "an amalgam of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], Thomas and native [[atavisms]]" in Baxter's ''Prelude N.Z.''.<ref name="Schmidt" />{{rp|836}}

The critic [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] ranked Baxter above Robert Lowell ("Baxter knew all about narcissism and vanity, and is a much superior poet"), and defended Baxter's high reputation on the grounds of his spiritual and intellectual seeking: "Baxter's energy and sheer intelligence, his refusal to give way to mean cerebral impulses or to give up his terrible struggle with himself, are sufficient to justify his high position in New Zealand poetry". On the other hand, Smith said that Baxter "remained, disappointingly, over-intoxicated with his own energy, and never convincingly manifested qualities of restraint to balance it."<ref>Seymour-Smith, Michael | "Guide to World Literature", Macmillan, 1985, p. 978</ref>

A number of Baxter's poems were written in the [[ballad]] form, and Baxter has been described by critics as "New Zealand's principal lyricist".<ref name="NZEDGE" /> A number of Baxter's works have since been translated into music by New Zealand musicians.<ref name="NZEDGE" /> In 2000, a collection of songs written to Baxter's poems was released, titled ''Baxter'', and featuring some of New Zealand's most well-known musicians: for example [[Dave Dobbyn]], [[The Chills|Martin Phillipps]], [[Emma Paki]], [[Greg Johnson (musician)|Greg Johnson]], [[David Downes (New Zealand composer)|David Downes]] and [[Mahinārangi Tocker]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Baxter (2000) |url=https://music.apple.com/nz/album/baxter/1442814236 |website=Apple Music |access-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> It was devised by New Zealand singer-songwriter Charlotte Yates.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reekie |first1=Trevor |title=Moments Like These: Charlotte Yates |url=https://nzmusician.co.nz/features/moments-charlotte-yates/ |access-date=6 November 2020 |work=NZ Musician |date=May 2018}}</ref>
