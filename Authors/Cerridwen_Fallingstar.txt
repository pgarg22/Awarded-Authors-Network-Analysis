I also spoke constantly, as soon as I could talk, about Witches, herbs and spells, a development which made my agnostic parents slightly uneasy."<ref>[http://marjirhea.com/edspots.html Cerridwen Fallingstar – Guest Editor: A Books.com Special Feature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081110/http://marjirhea.com/edspots.html |date=2016-03-04 }}.

==Career==

===Journalism and early Wiccanism===
In the mid to late 1970s, Fallingstar pursued a career as a [[journalist]] in [[Los Angeles]], writing mainly for the [[alternative media|alternative press]].

She studied also with noted Wiccan teacher and author [[Starhawk]], and in 1980 was a founding member of a coven called the Holy Terrors, along with fellow Starhawk students Bone Blossom, Sophia Sparks, and [[M. Macha Nightmare|M. Macha NightMare]].<ref>[http://www.wicpagtimes.com/nightmare.htm "Witchcraft and the Web: TWPT Talks to M Macha NightMare"].

In an academic paper in the early 1980s, she wrote:

<blockquote>Women within this religion [Wicca] have a positive feminine principle to relate to, a mirror in which to find validation, self-worth and self-love. The Goddess possesses all the best aspects and attributes of femaleness.&nbsp;... Wicca is the most Goddess-oriented of the pagan faiths, and places the most emphasis on developing the intuitional psychic side of the personality – the side that has to do with the craft of magic. Wicca emphasizes the power of the individual, and in a society where women have been denied access to power, this is a crucial concept indeed.<ref>Lesh, Cheri. ''Feminist Spiritual Alternatives''. Circa early 1980s; unpublished paper in American Religions Collections, Davidson Library, [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Quoted in: Hutchinson, Dawn L.

In the 1980s, living in [[Marin County]] in Northern California, Fallingstar continued her professional work in the areas of shamanism, witchcraft, trancework, healing, and psychic work. She also studied with spiritual teachers from various other traditions, including Native American, West African, [[Neotantra|Tantra]], [[Reiki]], [[Zen]], [[Kundalini Yoga]], and [[New Age]] teachings.<ref name=about />

===First book===
Following the publication of her 1990 book, ''The Heart of the Fire'', seen as an authentic look at 16th-century Celtic paganism, Fallingstar became an established voice for Wicca, witchcraft, and paganism. In 1991 she founded an organization called EarthRite,<ref name=holzer /> which offered public rituals in Northern California for 12 years,<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerridwenfallingstar.com/about.html|title=Cerridwen Fallingstar: About Cerridwen|access-date=2011-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823100521/http://www.cerridwenfallingstar.com/about.html|archive-date=2011-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Fagan, Kevin and Tyra Lucile Mead.

September 19, 1998.</ref> and that year she also founded her third coven, Eye of the Crescent.<ref name=holzer /> She was interviewed for the 1995 compendium book, ''People of the Earth: The New Pagans Speak Out''.

In 2009, she was one of the 14 authorities on Goddess culture who expound on the subject in the  feature-length [[documentary film]], ''Dancing with Gaia''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1418991 ''Dancing with Gaia''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/video/wab/vi1022690329/ Trailer for the 2009 documentary ''Dancing with Gaia''] featuring Cerridwen Fallingstar</ref> She has also been featured on and in numerous media outlets, which range from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine<ref>[[Joel Stein|Stein, Joel]].

She lectures and teaches classes and workshops, including a year-long apprenticeship program, and has also led spiritual journeys to sacred sites in Scotland. Additionally, she works as a professional psychic. She also provides past-life [[hypnotic regression]]s, and trance journeys, which she describes as [[hypnotherapy]] in a [[shaman]]ic context.<ref name=dwg />

According to Fallingstar:

{{quote|My approach to magic and ritual is Celtic/European in its base, but I am very much an eclectic "whatever works" kind of person. As one of my friends once said, "I practice magic exactly the way my ancestors did 60,000 years ago; I make it up." In that way, I'm very traditional. Magic is about learning to let go and move with the energy of the moment.

The word "Wicca" comes from the same root word as "wicker" – from willow – which is about moving and bending with the wind. It's about fluidity.<ref>Fallingstar, Cerridwen.

In: "Notes on European Pagan Traditions and Modern Pagan Practices: Through the Eyes of Five Women". ''Sojourn''. Volume 2: Issue 3, Summer 1998.</ref>}}

She also states, regarding Wiccanism and witchcraft:

{{quote|It's a spiritual tradition, a form of Celtic European shamanism. A shaman is a person who mediates between the physical and the invisible worlds. They may use sorcery or healing. The primary work of the shaman is to restore harmony.<ref name= witchy />}}

==Books==
Fallingstar has written three [[historical novels]]. According to her, these books are descriptions of her own past lives, accessed via a form of hypnotic regression, which she combines with historical research.<ref name=spell /><ref name=hnr />

===''The Heart of the Fire''===
In 1990, she published her first book, ''The Heart of the Fire'' – about a young witch named Fiona McNair and her coven, in rural 16th-century Scotland, during the time of the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|witch trials]]. The book was well received by many alternative press journals, including ''[[Yoga Journal]]''<ref>Devi, Nischala Joy.

{{quote|In the business of writing, few authors can successfully write about their own experiences and have them accepted by the reading public. Very little has been published by authors who were actually writing about experiences they had in another lifetime. Taylor Caldwell claimed to have lived her own novels, but nobody really believed her.

===''White as Bone, Red as Blood''===
Fallingstar's second historical novel, about a [[Shinto]] priestess, poet, and imperial companion in classical 12th-century Japan, was published in 2009 as ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress''. It was followed in 2011 by ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Storm God''. Together, these two books chronicle the transition of Japanese culture from the refined and poetic [[Heian period]] to the warlike Shogunate period, as seen through the eyes of the protagonist, Seiko Fujiwara. Seiko's father is an erudite court poet, and her mother is an [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]] priestess.<ref name=hnr>[http://historicalnovelreview.blogspot.com/2009/11/interview-with-cerridwen-fallingstar.html Interview with Cerridwen Fallingstar.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708002203/http://historicalnovelreview.blogspot.com/2009/11/interview-with-cerridwen-fallingstar.html |date=2011-07-08 }} Historical Novel Review.

The ''San Francisco Book Review'' wrote of the first volume: "Cerridwen Fallingstar's second historical novel, ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress'', is by far one of the best reads to come along in a while, historical fiction or otherwise.&nbsp;...

The history of Japanese religion forms a large part of the story: Shinto gods ([[kami]]), [[Fujiyama]], the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], tanuki and [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]] deities all have narrative space.
