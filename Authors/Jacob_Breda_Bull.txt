==Biography== 
Jacob Bull was born at [[Rendalen]] in [[Hedmark]], Norway. 
He was the son of parish priest Mathias Bull (1815–1876) and Henriette Margrethe Breda (1817–1887). In May 1876 he graduated with a ''[[cand.theol.]]'' degree and received the university title “haud laudibilis” (not without praise). He then served a year as a teacher at Nickelsen's Girls' School in [[Kristiania]] (now Oslo). In April 1878 he founded the newspaper ''Dagen'' and subsequently earned his living as a journalist. He served as leader of the [[Norwegian Authors' Union]] from 1900 to 1903.<ref name="nbl"/>

His debut novel ''Paa Grænsen'' was published in 1879. Bull is best known as the author of the short story ''Vesleblakken''. The story about the horse named Vesleblakken is based upon a childhood memory from the author's upbringing in Rendalen. The story was first published in ''Skisser'' (1891). His other novels and stories often described folk life in the valley of [[Østerdalen]]. He also wrote historical novels, contemporary novels and poetry. In 1911, Bull became a Knight 1st grade in the [[Order of St. Olav]]. After 1914, he resided in [[Copenhagen]] where he died during 1930.<ref name=snl>{{cite web|url = https://snl.no/Jacob_Breda_Bull |title= Jacob Breda Bull

He was the father of poet [[Olaf Bull]] (1883–1933) and grandfather of author [[Jan Bull]] (1927–1985).<ref name="nbl"/>

The former church rectory in Rendalen where he grew up is now the [[Bull Museum]] (''Bull-Museet''). Opened in 1964, it is a biographical and cultural history museum. Since 1997, Rendalen municipality has annually awarded ''Vesleblakkenprisen'', named after Bull's most notable work, to individuals or organizations who have excelled in altruistic work.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://rendalenbygdemuseum.wordpress.com/about/ |title= Bull-Museet |publisher = Rendalen Bygdemuseum|accessdate= April 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rendalen.kommune.no/9863.Vesleblakkenprisen-til-22-juli-frivillige.html Vesleblakkenprisen til "22. juli-frivillige"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128094009/http://www.rendalen.kommune.no/9863.Vesleblakkenprisen-til-22-juli-frivillige.html |date=2014-11-28 }} {{in lang|no}} Rendalen municipality, retrieved 22 June 2013</ref>
