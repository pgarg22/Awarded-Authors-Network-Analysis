Riley was born and grew up in [[Leeds]]. He served in the [[Royal Air Force]] from 1956 to 1958 and then attended [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1961. He then worked as a teacher in various schools around the Cambridge area. During this period, he became acquainted with many of the poets who made up the [[British Poetry Revival#Cambridge|Cambridge]] group, one of the key elements of the Revival.

He left to take up a teaching post near [[Oxford]] in 1966. That same year, he set up the Grosseteste Press with his friend [[Tim Longville]]. The pair started a magazine, ''Grosseteste Review'', two years later. Riley retired from teaching in 1970 and returned to Leeds to write full-time. In 1977, he was received into the [[Orthodox Church]]. He was murdered in a robbery near his home on the night of October 27–28, 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exhibitions.lib.cam.ac.uk/czargrad/|title = John Riley and Czargrad &#124; 'rhythm and line and necessity': John Riley and Czargrad}}</ref>

Riley's poetry was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]], whose poetry he translated into English. His first book, ''Ancient and Modern'' was published in 1967 and the posthumous ''The Collected Works'' in 1980. The latter includes the first full printing of his major long poem, ''Czargrad''. A ''Selected Poems'' was published by [[Carcanet Press]] in 1995.
