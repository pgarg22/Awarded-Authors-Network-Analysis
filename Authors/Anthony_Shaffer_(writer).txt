==Early life==
Shaffer was born to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Liverpool]], the son of Reka (née Fredman) and Jack Shaffer, who was an [[estate agent]] with his wife's family.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/95/Anthony-Shaffer.html Film Reference bio]</ref><ref>[http://www.forward.com/articles/14301/ www.forward.com]</ref> He was the identical twin brother of writer and dramatist [[Peter Shaffer]], and they had another brother, Brian. He graduated with a law degree from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

==Career==
Shaffer worked as a barrister and advertising copywriter before becoming a full-time writer.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/nov/07/news.nigelfountain Obituary] in [[The Guardian]], 7 november 2001</ref>

Shaffer's most notable work was the play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' (1970), which won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]]. The play was later adapted for the [[Sleuth (1972 film)|film version]] starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Michael Caine]]. He received [[Edgar Award]]s from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for both versions: for Best Play in 1971, and Best Screenplay in 1973.

His other major screenplays include the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] thriller ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) and the British cult thriller ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' (1973) with whose director, [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]], Shaffer had previously set up a television production company Hardy, Shaffer & Associates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Allan|title=Inside the Wicker Man: How Not to Make a Cult Classic|date=2012|publisher=Birlinn|location=New York|isbn=9780857902177}}</ref>

Shaffer was married three times—to Henrietta Glaskie, Carolyn Soley (with whom he had two children, Claudia and Cressida), and [[Australia]]n actress [[Diane Cilento]].

Shaffer met Cilento in 1973, when she appeared in ''The Wicker Man''. He moved to Australia in 1975 and married Cilento in 1985. Together they built a house (''The Castle'') and a theatre (''The Karnak Playhouse''). Shaffer was legally domiciled in Australia (where he owned land and a restaurant, paid taxes and voted in elections), although he did maintain a flat in [[London]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1453901/Shaffers-lover-fails-in-battle-over-his-estate.html "Shaffer's lover fails in battle over his estate"]. Article of 10 February 2004 by Sean O'Neill in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''</ref>

In the last years of his life Shaffer had an extramarital relationship with Marie Josette "JoJo" Capece-Minutolo when in London. Cilento did not accompany Shaffer to England but remained in Australia. After Shaffer's death, Capece-Minutolo made a claim on his estate in the British High Court, arguing that Shaffer had intended to divorce Cilento and marry her and that he had given her an engagement ring. The Shaffer estate argued that Shaffer had no desire to end his marriage to Cilento. The British judge found that despite Shaffer's being in "an intimate and loving relationship" with Capece in London,  Shaffer and his estate were not legally domiciled in the United Kingdom at the time of his death and that therefore Capece-Minutolo had no legal claims on his estate, other than any bequest in Shaffer's will, which had been changed in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |title=Playwright's family fight off mistress's claim to share legacy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/10/arts.artsnews |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 February 2004 |access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref>
