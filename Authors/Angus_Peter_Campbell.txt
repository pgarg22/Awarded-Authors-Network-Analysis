After attending Gearradh na Monadh school, Campbell left Uist for secondary school in [[Oban]], where he developed a keen interest in literature under the expert guidance and encouragement of his English teacher, the late [[Iain Crichton Smith]].

He graduated with Double Honours in Politics and History from [[Edinburgh University]], after which he worked in the media. In 2001 he was awarded the [[Bardic Crown]] for Gaelic poetry and a [[Creative Scotland Award]]. The following year he was given a Creative Scotland Award for Literature. His novel, ''[[An Oidhche Mus do Sheòl Sinn]]'', published by [[CLÀR]], was voted by the public into the Top Ten of the 100 Best-Ever Books from Scotland in the Orange/List Awards. [[Sorley MacLean]] said of Campbell:<blockquote>“I have no doubts that Angus Peter Campbell is one of the few really significant living poets in Scotland, writing in any language.” [[Sorley MacLean]] (West Highland Free Press, October 1992)<ref>[http://www.anguspetercampbell.co.uk/biography Official website]</ref></blockquote>

His first [[English language]] work of fiction, ''Invisible Islands'' ({{ISBN|0-9552283-0-1}}), was published in 2006. It was inspired by [[Italo Calvino]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. The book consists of twenty-one chapters, each illuminating a specific island in the mythic Invisible Islands [[archipelago]]. The work draws heavily on Gaelic culture and history, [[magic realism]] and a number of other influences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/creativeconversations/headline_547631_en.html|title=University of Glasgow : Creative Conversations - Writer and actor Angus Peter Campbell|website=gla.ac.uk|access-date=2018-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012703/https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/creativeconversations/headline_547631_en.html|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also wrote a short English language novel 'Archie and The North Wind' (Luath Press; 2010).
