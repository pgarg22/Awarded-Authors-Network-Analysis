;Black Jewels

The first volume of the original trilogy, and first novel set in the [[The Black Jewels|Black Jewels]] universe, ''Daughter of the Blood'', was published in March 1998. ''Heir to the Shadows'' and ''Queen of the Darkness'', published in April 1999 and January 2000, completed the trilogy. An omnibus edition was released in 2003. Also in 2000, Bishop released her first stand alone novel for the Black Jewels universe, ''The Invisible Ring''. Taking place prior to the trilogy itself, readers were able to pick up the novel either before or after reading the trilogy, though Bishop recommends reading it after. In 2005, Bishop then released the book of four short stories known as ''Dreams Made Flesh''. Once again, this collection of short stories allowed a reader to taste the rich universe Bishop had created without needing to have read the core trilogy. Although, reading the trilogy added to the depth of the individual short stories and vice versa. 2008 brought about another stand-alone novel, ''Tangled Webs''. Then in 2009, Bishop's novel ''The Shadow Queen'' was published and here she did something a little different. Unlike her prior releases, this novel was related to characters and events which occurred during another of her stand-alone novels, ''The Invisible Ring'' as well as the events of the original trilogy. ''Shalador's Lady'', released in 2010, is the sequel to "The Shadow Queen" and in March 2011, ''Twilight's Dawn'' hit the shelves. It contains four more short stories which help to answer some questions reader's had about different parts of the universe/story. Two short stories, "By the Time the Witchblood Blooms" and "The Price" were originally published (March 2000 and October 2004 respectively) in anthologies of short stories from a variety of authors. "By the Time the Witchblood Blooms" can also be found at the end of ''Tangled Webs''.
