'''Jane Porter''' (17 January 1776 – 24 May 1850) was a Scottish [[historical novel]]ist, dramatist and literary figure.<ref name=ox>{{Cite encyclopedia |editor-last=McCalman |editor-first=Iain |date=2009 |title=Porter, Jane |encyclopedia=An Oxford Companion to the Romantic Age |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Porter, Jane |last=Lee |first=Elizabet |authorlink=Elizabeth Lee (author) |volume=46 |pages=182&ndash;184 |no-icon=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Todd |editor-first=Janet |editor-link=Janet Todd |date=1989 |title=Porter, Jane |encyclopedia=British Women Writers: a critical reference guide |publisher=Routledge |pages=542–543}}</ref> Her work ''The Scottish Chiefs'' is seen as one of the earliest historical novels and remains popular among children in Scotland.

==Life==
Jane Porter was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, the third of five children of the Scot William Porter and Jane (''[[née]]'' Blenkinsop). Tall and beautiful as she grew up, Jane Porter's grave air earned her the nickname ''La Penserosa'' (The Pensive One). After her father's death, her family moved to [[Edinburgh]], where she studied under the schoolmaster George Fulton and [[Sir Walter Scott]] was a regular visitor. Some time after, the family moved to [[London]], where the sisters became acquainted with several literary women: [[Elizabeth Inchbald]], [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], [[Hannah More]], [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]], [[Selina Davenport]], [[Elizabeth Benger]] and Mrs Champion de Crespigny.

Porter's siblings also achieved some fame. Her sister [[Anna Maria Porter]] was likewise a novelist. Her brother Sir [[Robert Ker Porter]] became a noted painter.<ref name=sutherland>{{Cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Virginia |editor=Otago Students of Letters |chapter=Jane Porter and the Heroic Past |title=In Her Hand: Letters of Romantic-Era British Women Writers in New Zealand Collections |date=2013 |publisher=University of Otago |location=Dunedin}}</ref>

She died in Bristol at the age of 74.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=MacPherson |first=Hamish |date=9 November 2021 |title=A look into the women of the Scottish Enlightenment |url=https://www.thenational.scot/culture/19703291.look-women-scottish-enlightenment/ |url-status=live |access-date=2021-11-22 |website=The National |page=21 |language=en}}</ref>

==Works==
Porter is seen to have "crafted and pioneered many of the narrative tools most commonly associated with both the national tale and the historical novel,"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McLean |first=Thomas |title=Nobody's Argument: Jane Porter and the Historical Novel |journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=88–103 |date=2007|doi=10.2979/JEM.2007.7.2.88 |doi-access=free }}</ref> though her claims in her lifetime to have done so were often ridiculed and dismissed.<ref name="What'sHerName and Dr. Devoney Looser">{{Cite web |url=https://www.whatshernamepodcast.com/jane-and-anna-maria-porter/ |title=THE SISTERS: Jane and Anna Maria Porter |last=What'sHerName and Dr. Devoney Looser |date=2018-04-02 |website=What'shername |language=en-US |access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref> Her 1810 work ''The Scottish Chiefs'', about [[William Wallace]], was one of the earliest examples of the [[Historical romance|historical novel]],<ref>"Historical novel", ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. [[Margaret Drabble]]. OUP, 1995, p. 470.</ref> was very successful.<ref name=":0"/> The French version was banned by Napoleon. It was said to have influenced Scott and other writers<ref name=":0"/> and has remained popular with Scottish children. ''The Pastor's Fireside'' (1817) was a story set in the 18th century about the later members of the [[House of Stuart]].<ref name=comp/> Though one of the most popular writers of her time, the profligacy and financial indecisions of her brothers kept her very poor, as she and Anna Maria were constantly obliged to use their incomes to pay off their brothers' debts.<ref name="What'sHerName and Dr. Devoney Looser"/>

Porter wrote ''[[Thaddeus of Warsaw]]'' in 1803, set in the late 18th century [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name=":0"/> Despite its success, Porter did not benefit financially, as its copyright was held by its various publishers. To gain income from it, she resorted to ostensibly new editions published with prefaces and minor changes.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Looser |first1=Devoney |title=Women Writers and Old Age in Great Britain, 1750–1850 |date=2010 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0022-8 |pages=157}}</ref> She applied unsuccessfully for a literary pension, and being personally "totally destitute or nearly so", had to move between homes of her friends.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Looser |first1=Devoney |title=Women Writers and Old Age in Great Britain, 1750–1850 |date=2010 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0022-8 |pages=159}}</ref>

Porter contributed to periodicals and wrote the play ''Switzerland'' (1819), which seems to have been deliberately sabotaged by its lead, [[Edmund Kean]], and closed after its first performance.<ref name=doro/> She is sometimes associated with the 1822 production ''Owen, Prince of Powys'', which closed after only three performances,<ref name=comp>{{Cite book |editor-last=Birch |editor-first=Dinah |title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2011}}</ref> but this was actually by [[Samson Penley]].<ref name="doro">{{Cite ODNB |title=Porter, Jane |last=McMillan |first=Dorothy |author-link=Dorothy McMillan |id=22571}}</ref> Porter also wrote ''Tales Round a Winter Hearth'' (1821), ''Coming Out'' (1828) and ''The Field of Forty Footsteps'' (1828) with her sister, Anna Maria.<ref name=ox/> A romance, ''Sir Edward Seaward's Diary'' (1831), purporting to record actual circumstances and edited by Jane, was written by her brother, Dr William Ogilvie Porter, as letters in the University of Durham Porter archives show.

In her later years, Porter continued to write pieces for journals. Many appeared anonymously or were simply signed "J. P." Her wide-ranging topics included [[Peter the Great]], [[Simón Bolívar]], and the African explorer [[Dixon Denham]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McLean |first=Thomas |title=Jane Porter's Later Works, 1825-1846 |journal=Harvard Library Bulletin |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=45–62 |date=2009}}</ref>

==Influences==
Porter, like many contemporaries, was fascinated by [[Lord Byron]]. The villain in ''The Pastor's Fireside'', Duke Wharton, has been said to cast "an unmistakably Byronic shadow".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McLean |first=Thomas |title=Jane Porter and the Wonder of Lord Byron |journal=Romanticism |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=250–59 |date=2012|doi=10.3366/rom.2012.0096}}</ref> Additional influences on her writing included her schoolmaster George Fulton, [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''Arcadia''.<ref name=sutherland /><ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Kelly |editor-first=Gary |title=Varieties of Female Gothic |volume=1 |date=2002 |publisher=Pickering & Chatto |location=London}}</ref> She in turn influenced writers in her time.<ref name=":0"/>
