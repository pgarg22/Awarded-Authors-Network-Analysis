| quote = : "We laid him in a cool and shadowed grove
: One evening in the dreamy scent of thyme
: Where leaves were green, and whispered high above —
: A grave as humble as it was sublime;

: There, dreaming in the fading deeps of light —
: The hands that thrilled to touch a woman's hair;
: Brown eyes, that loved the Day, and looked on Night,
: A soul that found at last its answered Prayer...

: There daylight, as a dust, slips through the trees.
: And drifting, gilds the fern around his grave —
: Where even now, perhaps, the evening breeze
: Steals shyly past the tomb of him who gave

: New sight to blinded eyes; who sometimes wept —
: A short time dearly loved; and after, — slept."}}

John Gillespie Magee was born in Shanghai, China, to an American father and a British mother, who both worked as [[Anglican]] [[missionaries]].<ref name="RAF Digby"/><ref name="wood"/> His father, [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee Sr.]], was from a family of some wealth and influence in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. Magee Senior chose to become an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] priest and was sent as a missionary to China. Whilst there he met his future wife, Faith Emmeline Backhouse, who came from [[Helmingham]] in Suffolk and was a member of the [[Church Missionary Society]]. Magee's parents married in 1921, and their first child, John Junior, was born 9 June 1922, the eldest of four brothers.

Magee began his education at the American School in [[Nanjing|Nanking]] in 1929. In 1931 he moved with his mother to England and spent the following four years at St Clare, a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] for boys, in [[Walmer]], in the county of [[Kent]]. From 1935 to 1939 he attended [[Rugby School]], where he developed the ambition to become a poet, and whilst at the school won its Poetry Prize in 1938. He was impressed by the school's Roll of Honour listing its pupils who had fallen in the [[First World War]], which included the [[Edwardian]] poet [[Rupert Brooke]] (1887–1915), whose writing style Magee emulated. Brooke had won the school's Poetry Prize 34 years prior to Magee. The prize-winning poem by Magee centred upon the burial of Brooke's body at 11 o'clock at night in an olive grove on the Greek island of [[Skyros]] in April 1915.

Whilst at Rugby Magee fell in love with [[Elinor Lyon]], the daughter of [[P. H. B. Lyon]], the headmaster. She became the inspiration for many of Magee's poems.<ref>''Sunward I've Climbed.'' Hermann Hagedorn, The Macmillan Company, New York, 1942. (In this biography, Elinor was referred to as "Diana.")</ref> Though his love was not returned, he remained friends with Elinor and her family.

Magee visited the United States in 1939. Because of the outbreak of [[World War II]], he was unable to return to Rugby for his final school year, and instead attended [[Avon Old Farms School]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macla.co.uk/scopwick/magee.php |title=Pilot Officer John Gillespie Magee |website=Macla.co.uk |access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref> He earned a scholarship to [[Yale University]] in July 1940, but did not enroll, choosing instead to volunteer for war service with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (R.C.A.F.).

==World War II==
Magee joined the R.C.A.F. in October 1940 and received flight training in [[Ontario]] at No.9 Elementary Flying Training School, located at [[St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport|RCAF Station St. Catharines]] ([[St. Catharines]]), and at No. 2 Service Flying Training School at [[RCAF Station Uplands]] ([[Ottawa]]). He passed his Wings Test in June 1941.

Shortly after his promotion to the rank of [[Pilot Officer]], after having been awarded his [[Aircrew brevet|wings]], Magee was sent to the [[United Kingdom]], where on arrival he was posted to No. 53 [[Operational Training Unit]] at [[RAF Llandow]], in [[Wales]]. His first flight in a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] occurred on 7 August 1941. On 18 August, while still stationed at Llandow, he flew a Spitfire to 33,000 feet, by far his highest flight to that date. This is the flight usually accepted as having inspired his famous poem.<ref>Rob Kostecka, "Finding Magee – the Story Behind the High Flight Harvard." Vintage Wings of Canada. http://www.vintagewings.ca/VintageNews/Stories/tabid/116/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/44/Finding-Magee--In-search-of-the-High-Flight-Poet.aspx   Photograph of logbook page here: http://www.vintagewings.ca/Portals/0/Vintage_Stories/ArchivedStories/Magee12.jpg</ref> <ref>see also: Elinor Florence, "High Flight Written 75 Years ago." 17 February 2016. https://www.elinorflorence.com/blog/high-flight/</ref>

After completing his training with No. 53 Operational Training Unit he was assigned to [[No. 412 Squadron RCAF|No. 412 (Fighter) Squadron, R.C.A.F.]],<ref name="BB"/> a Canadian unit formed at [[RAF Digby]] on 30 June 1941. No. 412 Squadron was part of the "Digby Wing", commanded by the legendary [[Howard Peter Blatchford|"Cowboy" Blatchford]]. One of the other pilots serving at Digby that September was Flight Lieutenant "Hart" Massey, the son of [[Vincent Massey]], the first Canadian-born [[Governor General of Canada]].<ref>Stephen M. Fochuk, "Maggie's War – John Gillespie Magee's One and Only Time he engaged the Luftwaffe", Air Force Magazine, Vol. 41, No. 3, 15 December 2017, p. 44, p. 49; http://www.raf-lincolnshire.info/digby/digbyhistory_ch3_1941.htm</ref>

Magee arrived at Digby on 23 September 1941, where he continued to train on the Spitfire. When Magee joined No.412 Squadron it was flying the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk II; the squadron switched to the more powerful Mk Vb shortly after his arrival. He first took a Mk Vb aloft on 8 October 1941. On 20 October 1941, he took part in a convoy patrol, and on that same day the Squadron moved from the Digby Aerodrome to the nearby [[RAF Wellingore]] in [[Lincolnshire]], a satellite station of Digby.

===Raid on Lille===
On 8 November 1941, he took part in a sortie to [[Occupied France]] escorting bombers attacking railway workshops at [[Lille]]. Twelve aeroplanes from No.412 Squadron flew from Wellingore to [[RAF West Malling]] to refuel, and then headed out over the [[English Channel]] near [[RAF Manston]]. They crossed the hostile coast east of [[Dunkirk]], encountering [[anti-aircraft guns|flak]], after which they were attacked by [[Luftwaffe]] fighters.<ref>The Composite Combat Report filed by No.412 Squadron states these were [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s: Stephen M. Fochuk, "Maggie's War – John Gillespie Magee's One and Only Time he engaged the Luftwaffe", Air Force Magazine, Vol. 41, No. 3, 15 December 2017, p.48; however, Fochuk in his article refers to them as Focke-Wulf 190s, and the entry on [[Joachim Muncheberg]] says his unit was flying FW190s at that time</ref> Of Magee's four-ship section that entered the engagement, only he survived; all the others (including No.412's acting-Squadron Leader) were shot down and killed in action by the leading German ace [[Joachim Müncheberg]]. In the course of the engagement Magee fired 160 rounds of .303 ammunition, but made no claim for the infliction of damage to the enemy on returning to base in England. This was Magee's lone engagement with the Luftwaffe during the war.<ref>Stephen M. Fochuk, "Maggie's War – John Gillespie Magee's One and Only Time he engaged the Luftwaffe", Air Force Magazine, Vol. 41, No. 3, 15 December 2017, p. 48</ref>

In late November- early December 1941 Magee took part in three more convoy patrols.<ref>Stephen M. Fochuk, "Maggie's War – John Gillespie Magee's One and Only Time he engaged the Luftwaffe", Air Force Magazine, Vol. 41, No. 3, 15 December 2017, p. 47</ref>

===Death===
On 11 December 1941, in his tenth week of active service, Magee was killed while flying Spitfire VZ-H (Serial No.AD291, the same aircraft he had flown in the engagement with the Luftwaffe over France four weeks earlier).<ref name="Stephen M. Fochuk 2017, p. 49">Stephen M. Fochuk, "Maggie's War – John Gillespie Magee's One and Only Time he engaged the Luftwaffe", Air Force Magazine, Vol. 41, No. 3, 15 December 2017, p. 49</ref> He had taken off in the late morning with other members of No.412 Squadron from [[RAF Wellingore]] (the airfield post-war has now reverted to agriculture) to practise air fighting tactics, during the performance of which Magee's aircraft was involved in a mid-air collision with an [[Airspeed Oxford]] trainer (Serial No.T1052) flying out of [[RAF Cranwell]], piloted by 19-year-old Leading Aircraftman/Pilot Under-Training Ernest Aubrey Griffin.<ref>'Bomber County Aviation Resource' website, 1941 Lincolnshire Aviation Incident Logs, entries for 11 December 1941. http://www.bcar.org.uk/1941-incident-logs</ref>  The two aircraft collided just below the cloud base at about 1,400&nbsp;feet AGL, at 11:30, over the hamlet of [[Roxholme]], which lies between RAF Cranwell and RAF Digby, in [[Lincolnshire]].<ref name="RAF Digby"/> Magee was descending at high speed through a break in the clouds in concert with three other Spitfires when his struck the Airspeed Oxford.<br>At the inquiry afterwards a local farmer who witnessed the accident testified that he saw Magee after the collision struggling to push back the canopy of his Spitfire as it descended apparently out of control.<ref name="RAF Digby"/> Magee succeeded in opening the canopy and bailing out of the out of control aeroplane, but was at too low an altitude for his parachute to have time to open, and he fell to earth and was killed instantly on impact with the ground in farmland near the village of [[Ruskington]].[[Image:Magee Grave.JPG|right|thumb|100px|Magee's grave]] He was 19 years of age.<ref name="Stephen M.

[[File:High Flight.ogg|thumb|Reading of the poem "High Flight"]]
Magee's posthumous fame rests mainly on his [[sonnet]] "High Flight", which he started on 18 August 1941, just a few months before his death, whilst he was based at [[List of Royal Air Force Operational Training Units|No. 53 OTU]].  In his seventh flight in a [[Supermarine Spitfire Variants|Spitfire Mk I]], he had flown up to 33,000 feet. As he climbed upward, he was struck by words he had read in another poem — "To touch the face of God." He completed his verse soon after landing.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

The first person to read Magee's poem later that same day in the officers' mess, was his fellow Pilot Officer Michael Henry Le Bas (later [[Air Vice-Marshal]] M. H. Le Bas, {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CB| CBE|DSO|AFC}}, Air Officer Commanding [[No. 1 Group RAF]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/LeBas_MH.htm |title=M H Le Bas |website=Rafweb.org |access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref>), with whom Magee had trained.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

Magee enclosed the poem in a letter to his parents, dated 3 September 1941. His father, then curate of [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square (Washington, D.C.)|Saint John's Episcopal Church]] in Washington, DC, reprinted it in church publications. The poem became more widely known through the efforts of [[Archibald MacLeish]], then [[Librarian of Congress]], who included it in an exhibition of poems called "Faith and Freedom" at the [[Library of Congress]] in February 1942. The [[manuscript]] copy of the poem remains at the Library of Congress.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

=== Sources of inspiration ===
The last words of "High Flight" — "...and touched the face of God" — can also be found in a poem by Cuthbert Hicks, published three years earlier in ''Icarus: An Anthology of the Poetry of Flight''. <!-- (Macmillan, London, 1938), compiled by R de la Bere and three flight cadets of the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|Royal Air Force College, Cranwell]]. --> The last two lines in Hicks' poem, "The Blind Man Flies", are:
:For I have danced the streets of heaven,
:And touched the face of God.

The anthology includes the poem "New World", by G. W. M. Dunn, which contains the phrase "on laughter-silvered wings". Dunn wrote of "the lifting mind", another phrase that Magee used in "High Flight", and refers to "the shouting of the air", in comparison to Magee's line, "chased the shouting wind". Another line by Magee, "The high untrespassed sanctity of space", closely resembles "Across the unpierced sanctity of space", which appears in the anthology in the poem "Dominion over Air", previously published in the ''RAF College Journal''.

During April and May 1942, many Hollywood stars including [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Bob Hope]] joined the [[Hollywood Victory Caravan]] as it toured the United States on a mission to raise war bonds.  Actress [[Merle Oberon]] recited "High Flight" as part of this show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.oscars.org/onesearch/ |title=Search Library Databases &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref> During the performance on 30 April 1942, at the Loew's Capitol Theatre in Washington, D.C., and before her recitation of "High Flight", Oberon acknowledged the attendance of Magee's father, [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]], and brother Christopher Magee.

=== Musical adaptations ===
[[File:John Gillespie Magee Memorial.JPG|thumb|left|The plaque at St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport that commemorates J G. Magee Jr.]]
[[Miklós Rózsa]] composed the earliest known setting of "High Flight", for [[tenor]] voice, in 1942. It was later published as one of his ''Five Songs'' in 1974. Canadian composer and Royal Canadian Air Force veteran Robert J. B. Fleming wrote a through-composed musical setting of the poem for the Divine Services Book of the Canadian Armed Forces published in 1950. The composer [[Bill Pursell]] wrote his own arrangement with narration for the [[United States Air Force]] Band, which was broadcast on their radio show in the late 1940s. Several songs and symphonic compositions have been based on Magee's text, including [[Bob Chilcott]]'s 2008 setting, premiered on 1 May 2008 by the [[King's Singers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/wk19/tue.shtml |title=Press Office – Network Radio Programme Information Week 19 Tuesday 6 May 2008 |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref>

The poem has been set to music by several composers, including by [[John Denver]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjzcdvF3gDc |title=John Denver sings High Flight |via=YouTube |date=1 August 2012 |access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref> and Lee Holdridge as performed on the Bob Hope television show and is included in his 1983 album [[It's About Time (John Denver album)|''It's About Time'']] and by [[Christopher Marshall (composer)|Christopher Marshall]], whose composition was commissioned for and premiered by The Orlando Chorale with saxophonist George Weremchuk ([[Orlando, Florida]]) in March 2009, under the direction of Gregory Ruffer. The first performance of a setting of words, known as "Even Such Is Time", from [[Gabriel Faure|Fauré]]’s [[Requiem (Fauré)|Requiem]], plus additional non-liturgical texts that included "High Flight", was performed by the Nantwich Choral Society, conducted by John Naylor, on Saturday 26 March 2011, in St Mary's Church, [[Nantwich]], Cheshire. The music was written by Andrew Mildinhall, the former organist at the church, who accompanied the performance with the Northern Concordia Orchestra.

Singer [[Al Jarreau]] paid brief homage to "High Flight" by using the closing lines in the bridge of his 1983 song "[[Mornin']]".

Phill Driscoll, a trumpet player, Christian artist, and singer, has also performed the poem in song.  In his rendition of the song, he alludes to being caught up to be with God.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/High-Flight/dp/B0058ZL8RQ |title=High Flight: Phil Driscoll: MP3 Downloads |access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref>

The American composer [[James Curnow]] was commissioned by the Graduates Association of Tenri High School Band in [[Nara, Japan]] to write a piece for [[concert band]] in honour of the 50th anniversary of its association.  The piece is entitled ''Where Never Lark or Eagle Flew'' with the subtitle "Based on a poem by John Gillespie Magee Jr."{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In 2012, the Australian composer Daniel Walker was commissioned by [[North Sydney Boys High School]] to compose a piece for the school's centenary celebrations. This composition, 'Through Footless Halls of Air', which was written for choir and symphonic winds, features the poem in the lyrics.

British composer [[Jonathan Dove]] included the poem in his 2009 oratorio ''There Was a Child'', written as a memoriam to Robert Van Allen, who also died at the age of nineteen.  It has also been set by British composer Nicholas Scott Burt as a short motet and dedicated to the choir of Rugby Parish Church.

In 2011, Emmylou Harris, wrote and recorded a song, "Darlin' Kate", dedicated to her late friend, Kate McGarrigle, which included the lines, " As you slip the surly bonds of earth and sail away..."

In 2014, Canadian composer [[Vince Gassi]] composed a piece for concert band entitled ''Chase The Shouting Wind''.

In 2015, the Hardcore DJ [[Nosferatu]] used the poem in his track "sanctity of space".

:Britain and left such a shining example to us who follow,

:They that have climbed the white mists of the morning;
:They that have soared, before the world's awake,
:To herald up their foeman to them, scorning
:The thin dawn's rest their weary folk might take;
:Some that have left other mouths to tell the story
:Of high, blue battle, quite young limbs that bled,
:How they had thundered up the clouds to glory,
:Or fallen to an English field stained red.
:Because my faltering feet would fail I find them
:Laughing beside me, steadying the hand
:That seeks their deadly courage –
:Yet behind them
:The cold light dies in that once brilliant Land ....
:Do these, who help the quickened pulse run slowly,
:Whose stern, remembered image cools the brow,
:Till the far dawn of Victory, know only
:Night's darkness, and Valhalla's silence now?

Shortly after Magee's first combat action on 8 November 1941, he sent his family part of another poem, referring to it as "another trifle which may interest you". It is possible that the poem, "Per Ardua", is the last that Magee wrote. There are several corrections to the poem, made by Magee, which suggest that the poem was not completed when he sent it. ''[[Per ardua ad astra]]'' ("Through adversity to the stars") is the motto of a number of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] air forces, such as the [[Royal Air Force]], [[RAAF]], [[RNZAF]] and the [[RCAF]]. It was first used in 1912 by the newly formed [[Royal Flying Corps]].
