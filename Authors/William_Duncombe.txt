'''William Duncombe''' (19 January 1690 â€“ 26 February 1769) was a [[British people|British]] author and [[playwright]].

==Life==
Duncombe worked in the [[Navy Board|Navy Office]] from 1706 until 1725. That year, he and Elizabeth Hughes won a very large [[lottery]] sum on a joint ticket. He married Elizabeth in 1726 and "retired into literary leisure". The nature of their match is unknown, but the two did have a son together, [[John Duncombe (writer)|John]], later a clergyman, writer and antiquary. Elizabeth died in 1736, leaving Duncombe a widower for 33 years.

==Works==
Duncombe's literary work was generally in translation from [[Latin]].  He translated [[Horace]] in 1721 and translated [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s ''Athalie'' as ''Athaliah'' in 1722.  His sole successful play was ''Junius Brutus'' in 1734, which ran for six nights at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].  His competition was [[Farinelli]] singing at the [[Little Theatre, Haymarket]], and Duncombe said that the "quivering Italian eunuch" was too much for the stiff Roman statesman.  All the same, six nights was a respectable run, and the play went to a second edition in the first year it was in print, 1735.  The play makes frequent appeals to "liberty," in keeping with the [[Patriot Whigs|Patriot]] plays of disaffected [[British Whig Party|Whigs]].  Duncombe, however, had apparently intended a more traditional Whig play, along the lines of [[Joseph Addison|Addison's]] ''Cato,'' for he was aligned squarely against the "Tory" [[Scriblerians]].

Duncombe published in both the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'' and the ''London Journal.''  [[Alexander Pope]] satirized the ''London Journal'' by name in ''[[The Dunciad]],'' and Duncombe had written a letter to it criticizing [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' for its vitiating effects on public morals.  He had, in the letter, counterposed the sermons of [[Thomas Herring]] on [[Jonathan Wild]] and thievery.  Herring, who would later become the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] under the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]], became a friend of Duncombe's.

Duncombe wrote on education in 1744, and his ''The Choice of Hercules'' was included in [[Robert Dodsley]]'s ''Miscellanies'' of 1748.  Between 1757 and 1759, he and his son, [[John Duncombe (writer)|John Duncombe]] (who married the daughter of [[Joseph Highmore|Joseph]] and [[Susanna Highmore]]), published ''The Works of Horace in English Verse.''  His likeness was painted by Joseph Highmore.
