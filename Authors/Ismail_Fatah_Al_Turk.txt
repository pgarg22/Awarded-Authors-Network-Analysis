==Life and career==
Al-Turk was born in Basra in 1934.<ref>el-Tablawy, T., "Ismail Fattah al-Turk, 69, Iraqi Abstract Artist," [Obituary], ''Boston Globe,'' 23 July 2004, [http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2004/07/23/ismail_fatah_al_turk_69_iraqi_abstract_artist/ Online:]</ref> He graduated from  the [[Baghdad College of Fine Arts|Baghdad Institute of Fine Arts]] in 1956 with a Bachelor of Painting and in 1958 with a Bachelor of Sculpture.<ref>Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., ''Modernism and Iraq,'' Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery and Columbia University, 2009 , p. 93</ref><ref name=chilvers/> and received a Master's degree in fine art from the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma]] in 1962.<ref name=eigner>{{cite book |title=Art of the Middle East |last=Eigner |first=Saeb |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-8589-4500-2}}</ref> While in Rome, he also studied ceramics at San Giacomo.<ref name="Bahrani, Z 2009, p.93">Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., ''Modernism and Iraq,'' Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery and Columbia University, 2009, p.93</ref>

He was very active in Baghdad's arts culture, joining a number of art groups including the Baghdad Modern Art Group (1957) and the ''al-Zawiya'' group, both groups were concerned with using art to reassert a sense of national identity by integrating Iraq's artistic heritage with international trends.<ref>Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art'', Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9;  Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art & Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 72</ref>

Fatah taught sculpture at the Baghdad Institute of Fine Arts and ceramics at the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Baghdad.<ref name="Bloom, J 2009, p. 72">Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art & Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 72</ref> In 1986, he was the Chairman of the Iraqi Association of Plastic Arts.<ref>Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71</ref>

Fatah executed a number of murals and sculptures for public display in Baghdad. Many of these pay homage to notable Iraqi poets, both current and historical; including bronze statues of  Maaruf al-Risafi, an Iraqi nationalist poet active in the 1940s; the [[Abbasid]] poet [[Abu Nuwas]] and the Abbasid painter [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|al-Wasiti]]. He held six exhibitions for sculpture and five exhibitions for paintings in Rome, Baghdad and [[Beirut]]. He was the winner of first prize for [[Arab]] artists in [[Italy]].

The most well-known of his sculptures is the turquoise blue split dome of the [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] (Martyrs' Monument), in Palestine Street, Baghdad,<ref name="London, England 1981, p. 33">''Ur,'' London, England, Iraqi Cultural Centre, 1981, p. 33; Baghdad Writers Group, ''Baghdad and Beyond,'' [Illustrated edition], Middle East Editorial Associates, 1985, p. 43</ref> and constructed between 1981 and 1983.<ref name=chilvers/> ''Shaheed'' consists of a circular platform floating on top of an underground museum, and over which stands a split dome, 40 metres in height, clad in blue tile. He carried through all the design stages, along with a group of Iraqi architects, known as the Baghdad Architecture Group.<ref name="Bloom, J 2009, p. 72"/> The completed monument cost half a million dollars ($US). At its centre is a twisted metal flag pole and a spring of water to symbolise the blood of the fallen.<ref name="Online">Janabi, A., "Leading Iraqi Artist Dies," [Obituary], ''Aljazeera,'' 22 July 2004, [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EE6C5BBD-7828-4F87-8589-C2D44AA8FB62.htm Online:]</ref> Its aim was to commemorate the Iraqi dead as a result of the Iran-Iraq war.<ref>Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 23 and p. 25</ref>

On the subject of the design for ''Shaheed'', Al-Turk made the following comments:

{{blockquote| "I insisted on having a large open space. Big monuments are originally from the East - the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the Obelisk, Minarets.. the earth there is flat, so these monuments can be seen from all directions. In the beginning, I had the idea of having a matyr bursting from the centre. But I did not like it, it was too theatrical. Then, the idea of life versus death began to form. The two pieces moving together towards martyrdom and fertility and the life stream. I moved the pieces until I got the interplay I wanted.<ref>Ismail Fatah Al Turk as cited in:Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 142</ref>}}

While living and working in [[United Arab Emirates]], Fatah contracted [[cancer]]. He returned to [[Baghdad]] where he died 21 July 2004.<ref>el-Tablawy, T., "Ismail Fatah al-Turk, 69, Iraqi Abstract Artist," [Obituary], ''Boston Globe,'' 23 July 2004, [http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2004/07/23/ismail_fatah_al_turk_69_iraqi_abstract_artist/ Online:]</ref>

==Work==
Fatah's most well known work is  ''Shaheed'' (also known as the ''Matyrs Monument'') built as a tribute to those who fell in battle defending Iraq during the Second Qadisiya (Iran-Iraq war).<ref>Baghdad Writers Group, ''Baghdad and Beyond,'' [Illustrated edition], Middle East Editorial Associates, 1985, p. 43</ref> The ''Art in America'' magazine rated Shaheed as the most beautiful design in the Middle East.<ref name="Online"/> However, he also produced paintings in oil such as ''Ashtar'', a mixed media work on paper now in the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Arts.<ref>Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 138</ref>
