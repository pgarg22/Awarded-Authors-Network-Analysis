==Early life==
Howe comes from a literary family. Her grandfather, [[Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe (writer)|Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe]] published over 50 books, winning the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1925.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/m-dewolfe-howe|title=''Barrett Wendell and His Letters'', by M.

Howe's family placed an emphasis on its members' reading and writing: "Thanksgivings and family occasions were always about, 'What are you reading, what are you writing, what are you working on, what poetry are you interested in?'"<ref name=ingecenterinterview>{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Mike|title=Brief biography of Tina Howe|url=http://ingecenter.org/interviews/tinahowe.htm|publisher=The William Inge Center for the Arts|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> When Howe was ill with hepatitis, her father visited her every day in the hospital, reading [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' to her during his lunch break.<ref name=ingecenterinterview /><ref name="villager">[http://www.thevillager.com/villager_73/translationoftheabsurd.html "Theater.

Howe graduated from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[Bronxville, New York]], in 1959. As an undergraduate, she wrote her first play, ''Closing Time'', directed by her classmate, [[Jane Alexander]], who also acted in it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/03/27/at-the-heights-of-absurdity/5ac90a26-4807-4807-9acb-a27bede4e54b/|title=AT THE HEIGHTS OF ABSURDITY|last1=Richards|first1=David|date=1996-03-27|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-12|last2=Richards|first2=David|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

After graduation, she and Alexander traveled to Europe; Alexander to act and study mathematics at the University of Edinburgh and Howe to study philosophy at the Sorbonne and write. When Howe saw Eugène Ionesco’s ''Le Cantatrice Chauve'' at the Théâtre de la Huchette, "It changed my life,” she said. “It was like a bolt of lightning going through my head.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/theater/09howe.html|title=Friend-and-Family Network of Inspirations for Tina Howe's 'Chasing Manet'|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=2009-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Following her return from Europe, Howe did graduate work at [[Columbia University Teacher’s College]] and [[Chicago State University|Chicago Teachers College]].<ref name="drama">Jackson R.

==Career==

===Themes and style===
Literary critic and novelist [[Christopher Bigsby|C. W. E. Bigsby]] wrote that "art is plainly a central point of reference" for Howe, noting those themes in ''Painting Churches'' and ''Coastal Disturbances'', and added that "food and consumption" are also important themes in her work. In his book ''Contemporary American Playwrights'', Bigsby wrote that she has a "commitment to experimentation" and quotes Howe as saying said that she is "firmly entrenched in the Absurdist tradition."<ref name=big>Bigsby, C.W.E., "Tina Howe", ''Contemporary American Playwrights'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0521668077}}, pp. 47, 50, 57</ref> [[Frank Rich]], in his ''[[New York Times]]'' review of ''Painting Churches'' commented that the play "is in the dreamiest impressionistic spirit."<ref>Rich, Frank. "Theater: Bostonian Life In 'Painting  Churches' ", ''New York Times'', February 9, 1983, p.C16</ref> The ''Variety'' reviewer of ''Painting Churches'' also noted that the play is a "group portrait painted in a soft, impressionistic style."<ref>Stasio, Marilyn. [https://www.variety.com/2012/legit/reviews/painting-churches-1117947196/ "Review. 'Painting Churches' "] ''Variety'', March 6, 2012</ref>

The ''CurtainUp'' reviewer of ''Coastal Disturbances'' wrote of Howe's work:  "Like all of Howe's work, the play's charm stems from its quirky characters. In this case ''joie de vie,'' despair, love, lust, anger and fear come and go like the waves hitting the shore in foamy bursts or gentle ripples."<ref name="elyse">Sommer, Elyse. [http://www.curtainup.com/coastaldisturbances.html "A CurtainUp  Berkshires Review. ''Coastal Disturbances''"] curtainup.com, July 14, 2006</ref> Writing in the ''Sarah Lawrence Magazine'', Celia McGerr Regan described Howe's authorial voice: "Howe developed a voice that has been variously described as farcical and absurd, impressionistic and airy, graceful and perceptive, lyric and literate, vivid and language-driven, whimsical and demented. Odd things happen in the face of the recognizable: Trees grow up inside and through a New York State farmhouse (''One Shoe Off'')..."<ref name="sarah">Regan, Celia McGerr. [https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/magazine/voice/featured/throwing.html "Throwing Kisses, Throwing Pies"] sarahlawrence.edu, accessed August 26, 2015</ref>

[[Ben Brantley]] in reviewing ''Birth and After Birth'' for ''The New York Times'', observed "The suggestion is of a natural world that thwarts and ultimately devours the ambitions and pretensions of the civilized. This is a theme that Ms. Howe would develop in later works, sometimes artfully (''Coastal Disturbances''), sometimes clumsily (''One Shoe Off''), but always in a style that was distinctively her own."<ref>Brantley, Ben. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/theater/reviews/04birt.html?pagewanted= "The Art of Bringing Up Baby, With All Its Thrill and Terror"] ''The New York Times'',  October 4, 2006</ref>

Howe noted about her time in Paris: "The most profound thing that happened to me that year... was seeing ''The Bald Soprano'' by Ionesco. That exploded me all over the place." Ionesco, Beckett and Pirandello are still her heroes.<ref name="times1">Brenson, Michael. [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/theater/art-given-a-role-in-tina-howe-s-play.html?pagewanted= "Art Given A Role In Tina Howe's Play"] ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1983</ref>

===Full length plays===
Howe’s first full-length play to receive a professional production was ''The Nest'', which premiered in the summer of 1969 at the Act IV Theater in Provincetown, Massachusetts. It was directed by Larry Arrick and the cast included [[Sally Kirkland]] and [[Richard Jordan]] among others. From Provincetown, the show was transferred Off-Broadway to New York's Mercury Theater, opening on April 9, 1970.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American theatre reader: essays and conversations from American theatre magazine|last=Vogel|first=Paula|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|isbn=9781559363464|location=New York|oclc = 789409728|language=English}}</ref>

Howe later recalled: "My first play, 'The Nest,' was about courtship and how women compete with each other to land a husband. That play closed [off-Broadway] in one night."<ref>Lefkowitz, David. [http://www.playbill.com/features/article/tina-howe-taking-pride-and-visiting-museum-101032# Tina Howe Taking Pride and Visiting 'Museum'"] playbill.com, October 14, 1997</ref> The play follows the trials of three young women competing for husbands at a dinner party, and during the course of the play, one of the women takes off her clothes and dives into a huge wedding cake, and is licked clean by one of the male guests. ''The Nest'', [[Clive Barnes]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote in his review, “must be on any reasonable short list of the worst plays I have ever seen.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/10/archives/theater-tina-howes-the-nest-opens-at-mercury.html|title=Theater|last=Barnes|first=Clive|date=1970-04-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Her play ''Museum,'' with a cast of 55 characters, premiered at the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre on April 29, 1976,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwFZ0_LnwHgC|title=Museum: A Play|last=Howe|first=Tina|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Samuel French, Inc.|isbn=9780573612893|language=en}}</ref> and was then presented Off-Broadway by [[Joseph Papp]] at the [[The Public Theater|Public Theater]], opening in February 1978, in a production directed by [[Max Stafford-Clark]]. A cast of 18 actors played a total of 44 characters. The play takes place at a group art show of three contemporary artists, titled ''The Broken Silence.''  The Public Theater production featured [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Kathryn Grody]] and [[Larry Bryggman]].<ref name=museum>Howe, Tina. "Script", ''Museum: A Play'', Samuel French, Inc., 1979, {{ISBN|0573612897}}, pp. 3-7</ref><ref>[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=2829 "'Museum' Listing, 1978"] lortel.org, accessed September 7, 2015</ref> A ''CurtainUp'' reviewer noted that Howe "explained in her author's note for the play's premiere at the Shakespeare Festival, her large cast of characters was created to provide directors and producers with endless staging possibilities."<ref>Sommers, Elyse. [http://www.curtainup.com/coastaldisturbances.html "CurtainUp Review. 'Coastal Disturbances', 2006"] curtainup.com, July 14, 2006</ref> In her note in the script (published by Samuel French), Howe wrote: "It is my hope that any group wanting to present ''Museum'' use the large cast size as a challenge and not as a restriction. The play was written to serve the versatility of actors."<ref name=museum/>

The play was revived Off-Broadway by the Keen Company in 2002, directed by Carl Forsman. In his ''Village Voice'' review, Michael Feingold wrote, “This is the most enchantingly tesserated play ever written….If Mozart had been a TV producer, this is what a 'Candid Camera' segment on art might have looked like.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/rampant-exhibitionism-7142285|title=Rampant Exhibitionism|last=Feingold|first=Michael|date=2002-06-11|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref>

''[[The Art of Dining]]'' is set in an exclusive restaurant (and home) moving from the kitchen of the chef/owner, to the dining room, where her husband is the maitre d', to the individual tables of the characters, observing their action and interplay while waiting for and eating their meals. The play was first presented Off-Broadway by Joseph Papp at the [[Public Theater]] in December 1979, in a production directed by [[A. J. Antoon]] with a cast featuring [[Kathy Bates]], [[Ron Rifkin]] and [[Dianne Wiest]], who went on to win the 1980 [[Clarence Derwent Awards|Clarence Derwent Award]] and [[Obie Award]].<ref name=dining>[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=2661 ''The Art of Dining''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115094650/http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=2661 |date=2011-11-15 }} lortel.org, accessed August 26, 2015</ref>

''Painting Churches'' won several Outer Critics Circle Awards, including Best Off-Broadway Play, Best Actress (Marian Seldes) and the John Gassner Playwriting Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outercritics.org/award-results/awards-for-1983-1984/|title=AWARDS FOR 1983-1984|website=outercritics.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref> The play was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/tina-howe|title=Finalist: ''Painting Churches'', by Tina Howe |website=www.pulitzer.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref>

The play has been produced throughout the U.S. and internationally. In 1986, it was filmed for PBS's ''[[American Playhouse]]'', directed by Jack O’Brien. That cast included [[Sada Thompson]], Donald Moffat and [[Roxanne Hart]]. It was revived off-Broadway by the Keen Company in March 2012, directed by Carl Forsman, starring [[Kathleen Chalfant]], John Cunningham, and Kate Turnbull.

In November 1986, Howe's next play, ''[[Coastal Disturbances]]'' premiered at Second Stage, under the direction of Carole Rothman. Set on a New England beach, the set held six tons of sand. [[Annette Bening]] and [[Tim Daly]] led the cast. The play was transferred to the [[Circle in the Square Theatre|Circle-in-the-Square]] Theater on Broadway in March, 1987. It was nominated for a Tony award for Best Play along with Carole Rothman for Best Direction and Annette Bening for Best Actress. Frank Rich of ''The New York Times'' hailed it as "Hilarious, erotic and intoxicating"; John Simon in ''New York'' magazine wrote, "Exhilarating and wonderful".

This was followed by ''Approaching Zanzibar'', which shows the Blossom family traveling across the United States to visit Olivia, a sick relative. The play premiered at the Second Stage Theatre on April 8, 1989, directed by Carole Rothman, and starred [[Jane Alexander]] as Charlotte Blossom, [[Harris Yulin]] as her husband, [[Angela Goethals]] as her daughter and [[Bethel Leslie]] as her dying aunt.<ref>Howe, Tina. [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0573691282 "Script"] ''Approaching Zanzibar'', Samuel French, Inc., 1989, {{ISBN|0573691282}}, p. 5</ref> The play was produced at the Southwark Playhouse, London in August 1997. The reviewer for ''The Independent'' wrote: "...a zany, expertly mimed sequence throws the tensions of cooped-up family car travel into rollicking relief when, in fantasy, the parents and children swap roles. But, like so much off-Broadway fare, the play insists on coating the pill of pain in the sickly sugar of false reassurance."<ref name=south>Taylor, Paul.

''One Shoe Off'' opened Off-Broadway in April 1993 in a Second Stage Theatre production at the Public Theater.  The ''Variety'' reviewer described the play as "the dining-room play that dissolves in an emotive crossfire of accusation, revelation and reconciliation", "offbeat, sometimes ferociously funny" with an "over-the-top tone".<ref name=shoe>Gerard, Jeremy.
