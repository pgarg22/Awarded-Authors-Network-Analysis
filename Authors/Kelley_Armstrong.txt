'''Kelley Armstrong''' (born 14 December 1968)<ref name="School">[http://www.kelleyarmstrong.com/PDFs/School-Project-FAQ.pdf Bio for school projects] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101226181807/http://www.kelleyarmstrong.com/PDFs/School-Project-FAQ.pdf archive])</ref> is a Canadian writer, primarily of [[fantasy]] novels since 2001.

She has published thirty-one fantasy novels {{As of|2017|8|alt=to date}}, thirteen in her ''[[Women of the Otherworld|Women]]'' series, five in her [[Cainsville series]], six in her Rockton series, three in her [[Darkest Powers series]], three in her Darkness Rising trilogy and three in the Age of Legends series, and three stand-alone teen thrillers. She has also published three middle-grade fantasy novels in the Blackwell Pages trilogy, with co-author [[Melissa Marr]]. As well, she is the author of three [[crime novels]], the Nadia Stafford trilogy.<ref name="kelleyarmstrong.com">http://www.kelleyarmstrong.com/books/</ref> She has also written several [[Serial (literature)|serial]] novellas and [[short story|short stories]] for the Otherworld series, some of which are available free from her website. Starting in 2014, a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television series based on the ''Women of the Otherworld,'' called [[Bitten (TV series)|Bitten]], aired for 3 seasons on [[CTV Sci-Fi Channel|Space]], and SyFy.

== Biography ==
Kelley Armstrong was born on 14 December 1968, the oldest of four siblings in a "typical middle-class family" in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario.<ref name="School"/>

After graduating with a degree in [[psychology]] from [[The University of Western Ontario]], Armstrong then switched to studying [[computer programming]] at [[Fanshawe College]] so she would have time to write.

<blockquote>"I'm a former computer programmer, but I have escaped my corporate cubicle and hope never to return"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.literaryrambles.com/2011/08/kelley-armstrong-interview-and-book.html|title = Kelley Armstrong Interview and Book Giveaway}}</ref></blockquote>

Her first novel ''[[Bitten (Armstrong novel)|Bitten]]'' was sold in 1999, and it was released in 2001. Following her first success she has written a total of 13 novels and a number of novellas in the world of the ''[[Women of the Otherworld]]'' series, and her first [[Crime fiction|crime novel]], ''Exit Strategy'', was released July 2007. Armstrong has been a full-time writer and parent since 2002.<ref name="School"/>

Her novel ''[[No Humans Involved (novel)|No Humans Involved]]'' (the seventh book of the ''Women of the Otherworld'' series) was a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] in the hardback fiction category on 20 May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE1DE1431F933A15756C0A9619C8B63|title=BEST SELLERS: May 20, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 May 2007}}</ref>
Also, her YA novel ''[[The Awakening (Armstrong novel)|The Awakening]]'' was a No. 1 [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] in the Children's Chapter books category on 17 May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E1DF163EF934A25756C0A96F9C8B63|title=CHILDREN'S BEST SELLERS: CHAPTER BOOKS: Sunday, May 17th 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 May 2009}}</ref>

== Description of work ==
Armstrong's ''Women of the Otherworld'' series is part of a recently popular [[contemporary fantasy]] subgenre of the [[fantasy]] [[genre]] that superimposes supernatural characters upon a backdrop of contemporary North American life, with strong romantic elements.  Within that subgenre, she is notable for including many types of supernatural characters, including [[witch]]es, [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]], [[werewolves]], [[necromancer]]s, ghosts, [[shaman]]s, [[demon]]s and [[vampire]]s, rather than limiting herself primarily to a single type of supernatural creature.  Most of her works have a [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] genre plot, with leading characters investigating some novel situation or unsolved question.

In the ''Otherworld'' novels, most supernatural powers are either hereditary, or arise from the act of an existing supernatural of the same type.  The ''Otherworld'', while it has overarching conflicts and plotlines that span multiple novels, is not an epic battle between good and evil.  The novels are largely [[Episode|episodic]] with the continuing plotlines primarily involving the developing lives of the main characters.

Her contemporary fantasy writings share genre similarities with writers [[Charlaine Harris]], [[Laurell K Hamilton]] and [[Kim Harrison]].
