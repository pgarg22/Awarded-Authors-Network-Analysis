== Early life ==
Born as Maryse Boucolon at [[Pointe-à-Pitre|Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe]], she was the youngest of eight children. In an interview entitled "I Have Made Peace With My Island" Maryse Condé recounts aspects of her early life.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=VèVè A.|author2=Cecile Daheny|date=1989|title="I Have Made Peace With My Island": An Interview with Maryse Condé|journal=[[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]]|issue=38|pages=87–133|doi=10.2307/2931145|issn=0161-2492|jstor=2931145}}</ref> Condé describes her parents as among the first black instructors in Guadeloupe. Condé's mother, Jeanne Quidal directed her own school for girls. Condé's father, Auguste Boucolon previously an educator, founded the small bank "Le Caisse Coopérative des prêts" which was later renamed as "La Banque Antillaise."<ref name=":4" />

Condé's father, Auguste Boucolon had two sons from his first marriage, Serge and Albert.<ref name=":4" /> Condé's three sisters are named Ena, Jeanne and Gillette.<ref name=":4" /> Her four brothers are named Auguste, Jean, René, and Guy.<ref name=":4" /> Condé's birth 11 years after Guy, made her the youngest of the eight children.<ref name=":4" /> Condé was born while her mother was 43, and her father was 63.<ref name=":4" /> Condé's describes herself as "the spoiled child", which she attributes to her parents older age, and the age-gap between her and her siblings.<ref name=":4" />

Condé began writing at an early age. Before she was 12 years old she had written a one-act, one-person play.<ref name=":4" /> The play was written as a gift for her mother Jeanne Quidal's birthday.<ref name=":4" />

After having graduated from high school, she attended [[Lycée Fénelon Sainte-Marie|Lycée Fénelon]] from 1953 to 1955.<ref name=":4" /> Condé was expelled after two years of attendance.<ref name=":4" /> Condé instead furthered her studies at the [[Université de Paris III]] ([[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne Nouvelle]]) in Paris.<ref name=":4" /> During her attendance, she along with other West Indians, established the [[Luís Carlos Prestes|Luis-Carlos Prestes]] club.<ref name=":4" />

==Life==
In 1959, Condé attended a rehearsal of ''Les Nègres/The Blacks'' by [[Jean Genet]], where she would meet the [[Guinea]]n actor Mamadou Condé.<ref name=":4" /> In August 1959 she married Mamadou Condé.<ref name=":4" /> They eventually had four children together. By November 1959 the couple's relationship became strained, and Condé moved to the [[Ivory Coast]], where she would teach for a year.<ref name=":4" />

During Condé's returns for the holidays she became politically conscious through a group of [[Marxism|Marxist]] friends.<ref name=":4" /> Condé's Marxist friends would influence her to move to [[Ghana]].<ref name=":4" />

Between the years 1960 and 1972 she taught in [[Guinea]], [[Ghana]] (from where she was deported in the 1960s because of politics), and [[Senegal]].<ref name=":0" />

In 1973 she returned to Paris, and taught Francophone literature at [[Paris Diderot University|Paris VII (Jussieu)]], [[Paris Nanterre University|X (Nanterre)]], and [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle|Ill (Sorbonne Nouvelle)]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1975, she completed her M.A. and Ph.D. at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris in comparative literature, examining black stereotypes in Caribbean literature.<ref name="bomb">Rebecca Wolff, Interview: [http://bombmagazine.org/article/2248/ "Maryse Condé"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101132353/http://bombmagazine.org/article/2248 |date=November 1, 2016 }}, ''Bomb Magazine,'' Vol. 68, Summer 1999. Retrieved April 27, 2016.</ref><ref name=":0" />

In 1981, she and Condé divorced, having long been separated. The following year she married Richard Philcox, the English-language translator of most of her novels.

She did not publish her first novel, ''Hérémakhonon'' until she was nearly 40 because "[she] didn't have confidence in [herself] and did not dare present [her] writing to the outside world."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/books/maryse-conde-alternative-lobel-literature.html|title=Maryse Condé Wins an Alternative to the Literature Nobel in a Scandal-Plagued Year|last=Quinn|first=Annalisa|date=2018-10-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> However, Condé would not reach her current prominence as a contemporary Caribbean writer until the publication of her third novel, ''Ségou'' (1984).<ref name=":0" />

Following the success of ''Ségou'', in 1985 Condé was awarded a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to teach in the US. She became a professor of French and Francophone literature at [[Columbia University]] in New York City in 1995.<ref name="bomb"/>

Condé has taught at various universities, including the [[University of California, Berkeley]]; [[UCLA]], the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], the [[University of Virginia]], and the [[University of Nanterre]]. She retired from teaching in 2005.<ref name=":0" />

==Literary significance==

Condé's novels explore racial, gender and cultural issues in a variety of historical eras and locales, including the [[Salem witch trial]]s in ''[[I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem]]'' (1986); the 19th-century [[Bambara Empire]] of [[Mali]] in ''Ségou'' (1984&ndash;1985); and the 20th-century building of the Panama Canal and its influence on increasing the West Indian middle class in ''[[Tree of Life (novel)|Tree of Life]]'' (1987). Her novels trace the relationships between African peoples and the diaspora, especially the Caribbean.<ref name="bomb" />

Her first novel, ''Hérémakhonon'', was published in 1976.<ref name=":0" />  It was so controversial that it was pulled from the shelves after six months because of its criticism over the success of [[African socialism]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/02/06/giving-voice-to-guadeloupe/|title=Giving Voice to Guadeloupe|last=Condé|first=Maryse|date=2019-02-06|website=The New York Review of Books|language=en|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> While the story closely parallels Condé's own life during her first stay in Guinea, and is written as a first-person narrative, she stresses that it is not an autobiography.<ref name=":3">Lionnet, F. (1989). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt207g5zp.12?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents "Happiness Deferred: Maryse Condé's ''Heremakhonon'' and the Failure of Enunciation"]. In ''Autobiographical Voices: Race, Gender, Self-Portraiture'' (pp. 167–190). Ithaca; London: Cornell University Press.</ref> The book is the story, as she described it, of an "'anti-moi', an ambiguous persona whose search for identity and origins is characterized by a rebellious form of sexual libertinage".<ref name=":3" />

She has kept considerable distance from most Caribbean literary movements, such as [[Negritude]] and [[Créolité|Creolité]], and has often focused on topics with strong feminist and political concerns. A radical activist in her work as well as in her personal life, Condé has admitted: "I could not write anything... unless it has a certain political significance. I have nothing else to offer that remains important."<ref name="bomb"/>

Condé's later writings have become increasingly autobiographical, such as ''Tales From the Heart: True Stories From My Childhood'' (1999) and ''Victoire'' (2006), a fictional biography of her maternal grandmother in which she explores themes of motherhood, femininity, race relations, and the family dynamic in the postcolonial Caribbean. ''Who Slashed Celanire's Throat'' (2000) shows traces of Condé's paternal great-grandmother.

However, her 1995 novel ''Windward Heights'' is a reworking of [[Emily Brontë]]’s ''[[Wuthering Heights]],'' which she had first read at the age of 14. Condé had long wanted to create a work around it, as an act of "homage." Her novel is set in Guadeloupe, and race and culture are featured as issues that divide people.<ref name="bomb"/> Reflecting on how she drew from her Caribbean background in writing this book, she said: 
<blockquote>"To be part of so many worlds—part of the African world because of the African slaves, part of the European world because of the European education—is a kind of double entendre. You can use that in your own way and give sentences another meaning. I was so pleased when I was doing that work, because it was a game, a kind of perverse but joyful game."<ref name="bomb"/></blockquote>
