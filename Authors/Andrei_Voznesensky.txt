'''Andrei Andreyevich Voznesensky''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Андре́евич Вознесе́нский}}, May 12, 1933 &ndash; June 1, 2010) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n poet and writer who had been referred to by [[Robert Lowell]] as "one of the greatest living poets in any language." He was one of the "Children of the '60s," a new wave of iconic Russian intellectuals led by the [[Khrushchev Thaw]].<ref name="Venturesome poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 77"/>

Voznesensky was considered "one of the most daring writers of the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]]" but his style often led to regular criticism from his contemporaries and he was once threatened with [[Deportation|expulsion]] by [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref name="Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies aged 77">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10208455.stm|title=Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies aged 77|date=1 June 2010|access-date=1 June 2010|publisher=BBC| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100604170649/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10208455.stm| archive-date= 4 June 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> He performed poetry readings in front of sold-out stadiums around the world,<ref name="Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies aged 77"/> and was much admired for his skilled delivery.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> Some of his poetry was translated into English by [[W. H. Auden]]. Voznesensky's long-serving mentor and muse was [[Boris Pasternak]],<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] and the author of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.

Before his death, he was both critically and popularly proclaimed "a living classic",<ref name="Poet of post-Stalin thaw Voznesensky dies at 77"/> and "an icon of Soviet intellectuals".<ref name="Famous Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 78"/>

==Personal life==
Voznesensky was born in [[Moscow]]. His father was a professor of engineering, while his mother influenced him early on by reading poetry in his presence.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> His father worked during [[World War&nbsp;II]].<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> In his early life, Voznesensky was fascinated with [[painting]] and [[architecture]], in 1957 graduating from the [[Moscow Architectural Institute]] with a degree in engineering.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> His enthusiasm for [[poetry]], though, proved to be stronger. While still a teenager, he sent his poems to [[Boris Pasternak]]; the friendship between the two had a strong influence on the young poet, and he later described this relationship in ''"I Am Fourteen"'' – "From that day on, my life took on a magical meaning and a sense of destiny; his new poetry, telephone conversations, Sunday chats at his house from 2 to 4, walks—years of happiness and childish adoration".<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> Pasternak, who died in 1960, paid him the ultimate tribute – "Your entrance into literature was swift and turbulent. I am glad I've lived to see it".<ref name="Poet of post-Stalin thaw Voznesensky dies at 77"/>

In later years Voznesensky became reclusive in nature.<ref name="Poet of post-Stalin thaw Voznesensky dies at 77"/> He suffered a stroke several years before his death.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77">{{cite news|author=Anderson, Raymond H.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/books/02voznesensky.html?partner=rss&emc=rss|title=Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77|date=1 June 2010|access-date=1 June 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100609203400/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/books/02voznesensky.html?partner=rss&emc=rss| archive-date= 9 June 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> He is believed to have endured another stroke in early 2010.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/>

==Career==
Voznesensky's style was considered different from his contemporaries in the Soviet Union.<ref name="Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies aged 77"/>

His first poems were published in 1958,<ref name="Poet of post-Stalin thaw Voznesensky dies at 77"/> and these immediately reflected his unique style. His lyrics are characterized by his tendency "to measure" the contemporary person by modern categories and images, by the eccentricity of [[metaphor]]s, by the complex rhythmical system and sound effects. [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] have been cited among the poets who influenced him most.

The [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]-inspired "I Am Goya" was an early Voznesensky effort, and went on to achieve considerable recognition for its impressions of the fear and horror attached to war, as demonstrated by its Russian metaphors and recurring "g" sounds.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> Another early poem, "Fire in the Architecture Institute", was inspired by a 1957 night fire at the Institute of Architecture in Moscow.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> Voznesensky later said: "I believe in symbols. I understood that architecture was burned out in me. I became a poet".<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/>

Voznesensky was one of several young Russian intellectuals whom [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited to a reception hosted by the ruling Communist Party in December 1962.<ref name="Poet of post-Stalin thaw Voznesensky dies at 77"/> Khrushchev scathingly remarked on Voznesensky at the ceremony: "Just look at this new Pasternak! You want to get a [foreign] passport tomorrow? You want it? And then go away, go to the dogs! Go, go there".<ref name="Poet of post-Stalin thaw Voznesensky dies at 77"/> In 1963, his fame blossomed and he became "as popular as [[The Beatles]]" after Khrushchev publicly and falsely branded him a pervert.<ref name="Famous Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 78">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-06/01/c_13328118.htm|title=Famous Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 78|date=1 June 2010|access-date=1 June 2010|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]}}</ref>

In the 1960s, during the so-called [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], Voznesensky frequently travelled abroad: to France, Germany, Italy, the United States and other countries. The popularity of Voznesensky, [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] and [[Bella Akhmadulina]] was marked by their performances in front of the adoring crowds numbering in the thousands at [[stadium]]s, in concert halls and [[university|universities]]. In doing so, he served as "a sort of unofficial Kremlin cultural envoy", according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> His poetry reading skills were profound.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> He competed with [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Paul Scofield]] at one show in [[London]].<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> He criticized the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> While in the United States, he met [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Arthur Miller]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref name="Venturesome poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 77"/>
[[File:Andrei Voznesensky.jpg|thumb|Voznesensky with [[Allen Ginsberg]] in 1978 ]]
Voznesensky's friendship with many contemporary writers, artists and other intellectuals is reflected in his poetry and essays. He is known to wider audiences for the superhit ''Million of Scarlet Roses'' that he penned for [[Alla Pugacheva]] in 1984 and for the hugely successful [[rock opera]] ''[[Juno and Avos (opera)|Juno and Avos]]'' (1979), based on the life and death of [[Nikolai Rezanov]].

His creations have been turned into works of theatre.<ref name="Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky dies aged 77"/> One collection of his poems, "Antimiry" ("Anti-worlds") served as the basis for a famous performance at the [[Taganka Theatre]] in 1965. "Save your Faces" was performed at the same venue.<ref name="Venturesome poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 77"/> "Juno and Avos" was performed at the Lenin's Komsomol Theater (now [[Lenkom Theatre|Lenkom]]).<ref name="Venturesome poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 77"/> Others on foreign territory.<ref name="Venturesome poet Andrei Voznesensky dies at 77"/>

==Legacy==

English critic [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]] described his feelings after hearing a Voznesensky recitation of "I Am Goya": {{Quote|Mr. Voznesensky's recitation of this poem was electrifying, but it may be that the element of performance bulked necessarily larger than the poem's emotional impact. Russian poetry has always inspired recitation and a rapt response from the reciter's audience, but Mr. Voznesensky, and his contemporary [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], are perhaps the first Russian poets to exploit this in the actual process of composition—to write poems specifically for performing, as pop songs are written for electronic transmission by singers and band.<ref name="Andrei Voznesensky, Poet, Dies at 77"/> }}

==Modern Nature==
''(translated from the Russian by Alec  Vagapov)''

Red cows <br>
on the asphalt road have settled. <br>
Lazing on the asphalt pan they lie. <br>
We drive them round <br>
for cows are sacred! <br>
They are loyal to the highway, <br>
we wonder why. <br>
"Old herdsman, we want our question answered: <br>
Why have the cows gone mad?" "God forbid! <br>
The point is that flies do not like asphalt."  <br>
Those modern cows! They are wise indeed!  <br>
They got it, the sly ones! Cattle of genius!   <br>
Unlike the poor, unfortunate flies.   <br>
"The flies know that asphalt <br>
is carcinogenic."  <br>
Those modern flies! They are really wise!

Voznesensky died on the 1 June 2010.

==Popular Influence==

German singer and actress, [[Nina Hagen]], has paid tribute to Voznesensky with her song, "Antiworlds," a track on her NUNSEXMONKROCK album.  The song closely refers to the Voznesensky's poem, "Antimiry."
