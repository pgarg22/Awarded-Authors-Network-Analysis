'''Hedwig Irene Gorski''' (born July 18, 1949) is an [[Americans|American]] [[performance poet]] and an [[avant-garde]] artist who labels her aesthetic as "American [[futurism]]". The term "performance poetry", a precursor to [[Poetry slam|slam poetry]], is attributed to her. It originated in press releases for experimental spoken word and conceptual theater Gorski created during 1979.<ref>Carmona, Christopher (2012). Keeping The Beat: The Practice Of A Beat Movement.

The innovative poetry, prose, drama, and audio works are published and produced in a variety of media using standard and experimental forms.

==Biography==
A first-generation American citizen, born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Gorski's parents and sister emigrated to the United States from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia, Poland]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) following [[World War II]], where two aunts and a grandmother were [[List of events named massacres|murdered]]<ref name="pw.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pw.org/directory/writers/hedwig_gorski|title=Hedwig Gorski|website=Pw.org|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> by Ukrainian [[Partisan (military)|partisans]].<ref>''The Reconstruction of Nations''. Timothy Snyder. Yale UP. {{ISBN|0-300-10586-X}}</ref>

Her father joined the [[Polish Underground]] when aged fourteen, and later the United States Army, arriving with his family in the U.S. in 1949 on the ''General Sturgis'', which docked in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].<ref name="pw.org"/> Her father did electrical work in [[Napoleonville]] before moving to [[New Jersey]]. After receiving a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in painting from the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University]] in Canada, she moved with her first husband to [[Austin, Texas]] in 1977.<ref>Afterword. ''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street.'' College Station, Texas: Slough Press, 2007; {{ISBN|1-4276-0475-4}}</ref> She is married to her second husband, composer [[D'Jalma Garnier]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/djalmag|title=D'Jalma M. Garnier III|website=Facebook.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
Her public career began in New Orleans during 1973, illustrating for the infamous ''[[NOLA Express]]'' [[underground newspaper]] and hawking the new issues on the corner.<ref>Fife, Darlene. Portraits from Memory: New Orleans in the Sixties. New Orleans: Surregional Press, 2000.</ref> The archives of ''NOLA Express'' are now housed in the [[University of Connecticut]]. Gorski and [[Charles Bukowski]] are two of the most notable contributors to the ''NOLA Express''. There, she befriended [[Delta blues]] musician [[Babe Stovall]] and often kept him company while he performed for tourists in [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]] receiving tips into his open guitar case. A video of them at [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] was made but lost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/Issues/073/clinton2.shtml|title=Reconstruction 7.3 (2007)|date=June 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614210356/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/Issues/073/clinton2.shtml|access-date=March 7, 2021|archive-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>

Soon after moving to Austin, she divorced and began her poetry and theater careers in earnest by falling into the "[a]tmospheric landscape of the town that summoned and intoxicated so many beloved&nbsp;... artists of the time toward intense self-actualization."<ref>Back Cover. ''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street.'' College Station, Texas: Slough Press, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4276-0475-4}}</ref> She completed, produced, and directed a [[one-act play]] script with the title ''Booby, Mama!'' that is an inventive form she named "neo-verse drama". The art [[memoir]] of the production states that the verse play was based on a [[conceptual art]] cut-up form of writing made famous by [[William Burroughs]]. The memoir titled ''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street'' details the events in 1978 that are described as the birth of performance poetry as an American regional avant-garde joining the activity of the body to the [[psychic]] power of utterance and intent.

<blockquote>The conceptual process&nbsp;... seems impossible to pull off. There was no money, and it used 'found' text and 'street' actors&nbsp;... filled with existential angst living on the fringes of society.</blockquote>

She never claimed close ties to the [[feminist movement]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berfrois.com/2011/09/teenager-in-nova-scotia/|title='Teenager in Nova Scotia' by Hedwig Gorski|website=Berfrois.com|date=September 14, 2011|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> but feminists reportedly consider her work to contain powerful statements about the disparity caused by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[gender]] in the United States. The images in her poetry are womanly and challenge what is [[politically correct]] according to the feminist dictum of the time, and they reflect a protest against the complacency and inaction of artists and non-conformists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=jotspot&passive=1209600&continue=https://sites.google.com/site/sites/system/errors/WebspaceNotFound?path%3D/boobymamaverse/&followup=https://sites.google.com/site/sites/system/errors/WebspaceNotFound?path%3D/boobymamaverse/|title=Google Sites|website=Accounts.google.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> She had close ties with [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]], whose book ''Borderlands/La Frontera'' is considered a major work in Chicana feminist theory, [[Ricardo Sánchez (poet)|Ricardo Sánchez]], and [[raúlrsalinas]], often performing with them at Resistencia [[Bookstore]] and elsewhere.<ref>Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, San Francisco:  Aunt Lute Press, 1987</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf796nb2g4/|title=Guide to the Ricardo Sánchez Papers, 1941-1995|website=Oac.cdlib.org|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> During the Annual Polish American Historical Association (PAHA) conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 2008, Gorski read from "Mexico Solo", a long [[prose poem]] that she used to introduce how [[Polish Americans]] are more closely related to all 'hyphenated' [[minority group|minority]] cultures than to the majority American [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] culture.<ref>Polish American History Association.

On the conference panel, [[Polish American]] poets Stephen Lewandowski and Joseph Lisowski discussed how blatant discrimination and negative [[stereotyping]] circulated by Polish [[jokes]] plagued their childhoods. She calls these persecuted groups "invisible minorities" in the United States because they are often of European heritage.<ref name="Hedwig Gorski official website">{{Cite web|url=https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=jotspot&passive=1209600&continue=https://sites.google.com/site/sites/system/errors/WebspaceNotFound?path%3D/hedwiggorskisite/&followup=https://sites.google.com/site/sites/system/errors/WebspaceNotFound?path%3D/hedwiggorskisite/|title=Google Sites|website=Accounts.google.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> Gorski's writing and career aligns with the struggles of all disadvantaged groups suffering from the hidden class warfare inside [[American society]], and for this she has been called the "American [[Mayakovsky]]" from whom her motto "poetry is a hammer" is adapted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/Issues/073/clinton2.shtml |title=Clinton, Alan.

===Performance poet===
When [[Bob Holman]] first heard an audio cassette of Gorski with East of Eden Band, he told New York poet Michael Vecchio that it was the best band he had heard. Vecchio is one of those featured in the Poets Audio Anthology Project, Vol. II, along with [[Isabella Russell-Ides]] and many other performing poets Gorski collected and produced. [[Jazz]] writers and radio programmers were intrigued with poetry and music [[collaboration]], but few practitioners dedicated their careers to doing only [[oral poetry]] and music, as did Gorski.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/eastofedenband/|title=eastofedenband|website=Sites.google.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> Gorski has called herself a "performance poet" in [[press release]]s and [[interviews]] when describing what she did with East of Eden.<ref name="Lesley Wheeler 2008. p. 172">Lesley Wheeler. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present.'' Cornell University Press, 2008. p. 172; {{ISBN|978-0-8014-7442-2}}</ref> She first coined the term "[[performance poetry]]" to name her style of writing poetry for [[Speech|oral]] presentation, instead of for print publication, in a 1981 press release.<ref name="Hedwig Gorski official website"/> The term was widely adopted to name the new [[genre]] by later practitioners in the mid-1980s, which is distinct within and parallel to the following practices: [[spoken word]], slam, [[poetry readings]], performed poetry, and [[performance art]].<ref name="Lesley Wheeler 2008. p. 172"/>

===Populist writer===
Gorski sees poets in American society as a disenfranchised minority group with a history of prosecution by the American government for obscenity when exercising the freedom of speech. "Experimental and avant-garde artists and poets were demonized during the early 1990s by the efforts of a conservative agenda to eliminate funding for the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) during the late 1980s and to remove art studies from primary education."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/|title=MIT Press Journals|website=MIT Press Journals|access-date=March 7, 2021|doi=10.1162/016228703322031749|s2cid=57570574}}</ref>

She produced and funded projects to distribute works of performance-oriented literature outside the "mainstream". She also promoted and nurtured literature opposed to the [[The Establishment|establishment]]. She was a founding writer for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' in 1980 initiating and naming the ''Litera'' column that discussed readings, books, and other matters of importance related to non-mainstream, [[Alternative media|alternative]], and [[small press]] literature, especially poetry.<ref>The word "litera" is the Polish word for ''letter'' of the alphabet.</ref><ref>Publisher Nick Barbaro reply to Letter to the Editor in the ''Austin Chronicle'' (1985).</ref>

===Scholar===
After her career in performance poetry during the 1980s, Gorski entered [[graduate school]] in the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] and was awarded a doctorate, Ph.D. in [[Creative Writing]], in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pw.org/directory/writers/hedwig_gorski|title=Hedwig Gorski|website=Pw.org|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> In 2003–04, Gorski lectured on minority [[American literature]] at the [[University of Wrocław]] in Poland as a [[Fulbright Fellow]] and spent five months traveling to various locations, including Ukraine. While backstage at [[Bob Dylan]]'s concert in [[Prague]], she met [[Václav Havel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=jotspot&passive=1209600&continue=https://sites.google.com/site/sites/system/errors/WebspaceNotFound?path%3D/hedwiggorskifulbright/&followup=https://sites.google.com/site/sites/system/errors/WebspaceNotFound?path%3D/hedwiggorskifulbright/|title=Google Sites|website=Accounts.google.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> She made an appearance at the Cafe Krzysztofory in [[Kraków]] in 2004 for the [[United States Embassy]] and the French Institute in [[Kraków]] before returning to the United States.

==Accomplishments==
She coined the term "[[Performance Poetry]]" in the early 1980s after initiating and writing the "Litera" column for the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' in an effort to distinguish her performed poetry from performance art.<ref>''The Austin Chronicle'', Litera, 1981</ref> She was also one of the founding writers on the ''Austin Chronicle'', which helped to promote the vibrant "music capital of the world" that Austin, the capital of Texas, had become. Along with the growth of the music scene, a multi-ethnic theater, literature, and art community began to coalesce during the 1970s. This is the environment from which Gorski's work grew from its mysterious underground, what she calls a "pedestrian [[avant-garde]]".<ref>(Afterword. Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street, College Station: Slough Press, 2007; p. 82).</ref>

Gorski's live broadcast performances on [[KUT-FM]] were recorded and distributed to radio stations internationally. They became part of the 1980s Indie audio cassette/radio station network offering alternatives to commercial music. Her literature-based broadcast audio increased the popularity of performance poetry, the genre she named to describe her own work: literature-based poetry written for performance only and not for print publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catherinemeyersartist.blogspot.com/2013/04/hedwig-gorski-performance-poet-nova.html|website=Catherinemeyersartist.blogspot.com|title=Hedwig Gorski - Performance Poet - Nova Scotia Teenager|date=April 7, 2013|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref>

East of Eden, formed of professional [[jazz]] musicians, was successful because the music and poetry were melded together exclusively for performance. Gorski's spoken vocals have been described as bringing her "eerie"<ref>John Herndon's review in the "Austin-American Statesman" about poem "There's Always Something That Can Make You Happy".</ref> voicing as close to singing as possible without actually singing.<ref>Playwright Jon Westerfield described Gorski's vocals in this way. He named an Angel Theater suite ''Early Breakfast with Hedwig Gorski'' in honor of the poet.</ref> The compositions written for each poem by [[D'Jalma Garnier]] ranged from [[jazz]] to [[country and western]] to [[rock and roll]]<ref>A comment made by Howie Richey, a [[KUT-FM]] radio producer who hosted Live Set's "Kerouac Coffee House" to bring together poets and musicians ad hoc.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/howie.richey|title=Howie Richey|website=Facebook.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref>

==Style==
Unlike the [[Beat Generation|Beats]], Gorski wrote her stylized [[narrative]] and moody [[lyrical poetry]] only for performance with the music composed by [[D'Jalma Garnier]] specifically for each poem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhome.php|title=Log into Facebook|website=Facebook.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> The poetry was meant for [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] distribution only, especially for the radio (as opposed to print). Her [[Extremism|radical]] [[art school]] background influenced her fondness for performance [[Written language|text]] and the concept behind the manner of distribution. Though she received a [[academic degree|degree]] in painting from the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] (NSCAD) in Canada, she did not like the [[elitism]] of the [[Art gallery|gallery]] circuit. She transferred her love of images into a [[poetics]] that also incorporated the anti-capitalist, socialist un-doings found in performance art and conceptual art.<ref>(Afterword. Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street, College Station: Slough Press, 2007)</ref> Gorski, along with [[Vito Acconci]], is considered one of the most notable graduates of NSCAD. She was directly influenced by [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s "[[Howl]]". They had a friendly enmity after he jeered one of her early readings at [[Naropa University]] during the [[Jack Kerouac]] Disembodied Poetics Conference in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/markchristal/2209751051/|title=Kerouac Conference, 1982|date=January 21, 2008|access-date=March 7, 2021|website=Flickr.com}}</ref>

One of her early idols was [[Bob Dylan]] because she admired the "[[Surrealism|surreal]] images and obscured meanings in a language that rolled off the tongue." The passion and flow in the vocals matched those she heard on reel-to-reel tapes by [[Dylan Thomas]], the Welsh poet who initially inspired her. Bob Dylan came to Gorski's final reading/performance in Austin at the Mexic-Arte Museum's Acoustic Festival in late 1992 after his concert at the Austin Opry House.<ref>''Austin Chronicle'' ''Litera'', Nov. 1992, qtd. in Southern Artistry Bio</ref>

==Publications and recordings==
The first publication of her performance poems is titled ''Snatches of the Visible Unreal'' from Backyard Press, which is also the title of her first audio cassette recording. Another chapbook titled ''Polish Gypsy with Ghost'' contains a vinyl recording. The second audio cassette release is titled ''East of Eden Band'', for which Gorski used the name Hedwig G-G. Her poems received music lyric awards, rather than literature awards, though she never sang. In a career that eschewed elitism, she used her own success to help produce and promote the recording of other non-academic vocal poets including [[raúlrsalinas]], [[Roxy Gordon]], and Joy Cole. Several other print collections of poetry were produced in limited additions, including ''Early breakfast with Hedwig Gorski'' and ''The East of Eden Band Songbook''. A remastered CD, containing a selection of radio recordings by Gorski and East of Eden from live broadcasts was released in 2009, called ''Send in the Clown''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.cdbaby.com/|title=CD Baby Music Store|website=Store.cdbaby.com|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref>
