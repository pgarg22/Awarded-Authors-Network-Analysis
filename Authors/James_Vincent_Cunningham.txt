'''James Vincent Cunningham''' (August 23, 1911 – March 30, 1985) was an [[United States|America]]n poet, literary critic and teacher.

==Background==

Cunningham is described as a neo-classicist or anti-modernist. His poetry was distinguished by its clarity, brevity and traditional formality of rhyme and rhythm at a time when many American poets were breaking away from traditional fixed meters.

Cunningham's finely crafted epigrams in the style of [[Latin poets]] were much praised and frequently anthologized. But he also wrote spare, mature poems about love and estrangement, most notably the 15-poem sequence entitled ''To What Strangers, What Welcome'' (1964).

Cunningham was also a fine translator with a lifelong interest therein.<ref>Steele, Timothy 'Introduction & Commentary- Poetry of J  V Cunningham' Faber Finds, London 2008</ref>

==Life==

Cunningham was born in Cumberland, Maryland in 1911, the son of [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic]] parents.<ref>[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/j-v-cunningham Biography-poets.org]</ref> His father, James Joseph Cunningham, was a steam-shovel operator for a railroad who moved the family to Billings, Montana, and later to Denver, Colorado where Cunningham spent his youth. His mother was Anna Finan Cunningham. Cunningham graduated from [[Regis Jesuit High School|Regis High School]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/9994|title=AMERICA'S BEST FORGOTTEN POET|date=1998-02-16|work=Weekly Standard|access-date=2018-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906110643/http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/9994|archive-date=2016-09-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> in Denver 1927 at age fifteen, showing great skills in Latin and Greek. In high school, he first corresponded with [[Yvor Winters]] who was then a graduate student at [[Stanford University]] and who later became an influential poet and critic.

The death of Cunningham's father in an accident and the family's resulting financial hardship prevented Cunningham from continuing immediately to college. He worked for a while as a "runner" for a brokerage house on the [[Regional stock exchange#Historical|Denver Stock Exchange]], where he personally witnessed two suicides in the days immediately following the October 29, 1929 stock market crash.<ref>''The Poems of J. V. Cunningham'', ed. by Timothy Steele, p. xv.</ref>

With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], he rode the rails from odd job to odd job, throughout the Western United States, including stints as a local newspaper reporter and a writer for trade publications such as ''Dry Goods Economist''. In 1931, Cunningham again struck up a correspondence with Winters who offered him the opportunity to stay in a shed on Winters' property and to attend classes at [[Stanford University]] where Winters was teaching. Cunningham earned an A.B. in classics in 1934 and a Ph.D. in English in 1945—both from Stanford.

During [[World War II]], Cunningham taught mathematics to Air Force pilots. He later earned his living primarily by teaching English and writing at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Hawaii]], [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Washington University]]. He took a position at [[Brandeis University]] in 1953, soon after the school was founded, and taught there until he retired in 1980.  As a teacher and critic, Cunningham often concentrated on Shakespeare and the English Renaissance, authoring works such as ''Woe or Wonder: The Emotional Effect of Shakespearean Tragedy''.

Cunningham was married three times including to the poet [[Barbara Gibbs Golffing|Barbara Gibbs]] in 1937 (divorced 1945), with whom he had a daughter, Cunningham's only child. He died of heart failure in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]], in 1985.

He was the model for the book [[Stoner (novel)|''Stoner'']] by John Williams.<ref>{{cite web|last=Myers|first=D.G.|title=Defeats and Victories Not Recorded in the Annals of History|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/09/14/john-williams-stoner/|work=Commentary Magazine|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>

==Poetry==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2017}}
Cunningham's output was as spare as his style (ofttimes called the Plain Style) and his Christian heritage remained a part of his outlook adding a distinctive thread in his poetry.<ref>Fiske Francis, 'Cold Grace:Faith & Stoicism in the poetry of J V Cunningham' Renascence, vol 59 issue 3 2007, Maquette University, Missouri</ref> Cunningham published only a few hundred<ref>Gullans, Charles  ''Bibliography of the Published Works of J V Cunningham, 1931-1988'', revised and enlarged, Robert L Barth, Florence, Ky 1988</ref> carefully wrought poems over his relatively long career. Many were just a few lines long; "with  tight, little ironic lines",{{Attribution needed|date=March 2017}} Cunningham was one of three or four masters of the [[epigram]] form in the [[English language]].<ref>Bottum J 'America's Best Forgotten Poet' The Weekly Standard' Feb 16 1998</ref> Many of his epigrams included social and moral observations and were incisive, witty, and judicatory. He employed an [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic]] pulse with firm, lucid, deft, and light [[pentameter]] lines.<ref>Pinsky, Robert - Review of 'The Poetry of J V Cunningham' Chicago Review vol 35 no 1 Autumn 1985</ref>

Cunningham's epigrams (including his translations of the Latin poet [[Martial]]) and short poems were often witty and sometimes ribald (see, e.g., "It Was in Vegas, Celibate and Able"). "I like the trivial, vulgar and exalted," he once said. [[Richard Wilbur]] labeled him ''our best epigrammatic poet.'' Cunningham's epigrams have been described as both brilliant and quotable.<ref>Hemling, Steven - 'Dictionary of Literary Biography ' vol 5 American Poets since WWII 1980</ref>

Cunningham was one of a small number of modern writers to treat the epigram in its full, classical sense: a short, direct poem dealing with subjects from the whole range of personal experience, not necessarily satirical.
Cunningham's longer poems "tend toward the epigrammatical, little quotable bits that express thoughts with exceptional neatness."<ref>Bottum J 'The Poems of J V Cunningham' Weekly Standard 1998</ref> His plain-spoken lyrics about love, sex, loss, and the American West were especially haunting and original{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} (e.g., "Maples in the slant sun/The gay color of decay/Was it unforgivable,/My darling, that you loved me?").
  
Critics often yoked him to his early influence, [[Yvor Winters]], but his verse actually bears only a formalistic similarity to Winters's work. Cunningham "inclined toward logical statement and syllogistic argument, saying so much in so little space often in single iambic pentameter couplet".<ref>Steele, Timothy 'Introduction &  Commentary -Poetry of J  v Cunningham, Faber Finds, London 2008 {{ISBN|9780571241934}}</ref>"Poetry," wrote Cunningham, "is what looks like poetry, what sounds like poetry. It is metrical composition."<ref>Cunningham, J V, 'Poetry Structure and Tradition' Alan Swallow, Denver Dec 31 1939</ref>

The poet [[Thom Gunn]], in reviewing ''The Exclusions of a Rhyme'' in the 1960s, commented that Cunningham "must be one of the most accomplished poets alive, and one of the few of whom it can be said that he will still be worth reading in fifty years' time." Though his style and reserve were very much at odds with fashions of the period in which he wrote, they are all the more striking for that fact.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Cunningham was awarded [[Guggenheim fellowships]] in 1959-60 and 1966–67 and received a [[Fellowship of the Academy of American Poets]] in 1976. He won grants from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1965 and the National Endowment for the Arts in 1966.  Some of his poems have been set to music by the English composer [[Robin Holloway]].
