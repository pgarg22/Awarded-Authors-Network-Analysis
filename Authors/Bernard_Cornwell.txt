'''Bernard Cornwell''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|OBE}} (born 23 February 1944) is an English author of [[historical novel]]s and a history of the [[Waterloo Campaign]]. He is best known for his novels about [[Napoleonic Wars]] rifleman [[Sharpe (novel series)|Richard Sharpe]].  He has also written the Saxon / Last Kingdom stories about King Alfred and the [[The Saxon Stories|making of England]].

He has written historical novels primarily based on English history, in five series, and one series of contemporary thriller novels. A feature of his historical novels is an end note on how they match or differ from history, and what one might see at the modern sites of the battles described. He wrote a nonfiction book on the battle of Waterloo, in addition to the fictional story of the famous battle in the Sharpe series. Two of the historical novel series have been adapted for television: the [[Sharpe (TV series)|''Sharpe'' television series]] by ITV and ''[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)|The Last Kingdom]]'' by BBC. He lives in the US with his wife, alternating between [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]].<ref name=grdn/>

==Biography==
Cornwell was born in London in 1944. His father was Canadian airman William Oughtred<ref name=grdn>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Maggie|title=Bernard Cornwell: BBC made The Last Kingdom due to its 'interesting echoes of today'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/17/bernard-cornwell-bbc-last-kingdom-interesting-echoes-today|access-date=19 October 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 October 2015}}</ref> and his mother was Englishwoman Dorothy Cornwell, a member of the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]]. He was adopted and brought up in [[Thundersley, Essex]] by the Wiggins family; they were members of the [[Peculiar People]], a strict sect of pacifists who banned frivolity of all kinds, and even medicine up to 1930. Reacting to being raised by [[Christian Fundamentalist]]s, he grew up rejecting all religions and became an atheist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8765565/A-Page-in-the-Life-Bernard-Cornwell.html |title=A Page in the Life: Bernard Cornwell|author=Toby Harnden |date=15 September 2011 |newspaper=The Telegraph | access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

After his adoptive father died, he changed his last name by deed poll from Wiggins to Cornwell, his birth mother's maiden name. Prior to that, he used Bernard Cornwell as a pen name.<ref name=Harnden>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8765565/A-Page-in-the-Life-Bernard-Cornwell.html |title=A Page in the Life: Bernard Cornwell |author=Harnden, Toby |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=15 September 2011 |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref> He met his father for the first time when he was 58, after telling a journalist on a book tour, "what I wanted to see in [[Vancouver]] was my real father."<ref name=grdn/> There he met his half-siblings, with whom he shares many traits, and learned his genealogy.<ref name=Harnden />

He is a descendant of [[Uhtred the Bold]] whom he based the [[The Last Kingdom|Last Kingdom]] book series on.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Cornwell was sent to [[Monkton Combe School]] in [[Somerset]]. He read history at [[University College London]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/17/bernard-cornwell-bbc-last-kingdom-interesting-echoes-today|title=Bernard Cornwell: BBC made The Last Kingdom due to its 'interesting echoes of today'|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref> between 1963 and 1966<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/profile/bernard-cornwell-interview|title=Bernard Cornwell: Interview|magazine=The Bookseller|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref> and worked as a teacher after graduating. He attempted to enlist in the British armed services at least three times, but was rejected on the grounds of [[myopia]].

Following his work as a teacher, Cornwell joined the [[BBC]]'s [[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]] and was later promoted to head of current affairs at BBC Northern Ireland. He then joined [[Thames Television]] as editor of ''[[Thames News]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/bn/board/message?board.id=BernardCornwell&view=by_date_ascending&message.id=63 |title=Cornwell Biography |publisher=Bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com |access-date=2011-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225220846/http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/bn/board/message?board.id=BernardCornwell&view=by_date_ascending&message.id=63 |archive-date=25 February 2008 }}</ref> His first marriage ended in divorce in 1970s.<ref name=Harnden /> He met his second wife, Judy, in 1978 in Edinburgh while he worked for BBC Northern Ireland; she was a travel agent from the US and the mother of three children from a previous marriage. He relocated to the United States in 1979 after marrying her. He was unable to get a [[United States Permanent Resident Card]] (green card), so he started writing novels, as this did not require a work permit.<ref name=grdn/> He later became a United States citizen.<ref name=Harnden /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://radio.nationalreview.com/betweenthecovers/post/?q=MWVjYzVlMWI4ODIyYmNmNzUwN2EyYzYxNDUxYzU5ZmQ= |title=Interview with Bernard Cornwell |publisher=Radio.nationalreview.com |date=2009-01-21 |access-date=2011-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825125938/http://radio.nationalreview.com/betweenthecovers/post/?q=MWVjYzVlMWI4ODIyYmNmNzUwN2EyYzYxNDUxYzU5ZmQ%3D |archive-date=25 August 2011}}</ref>

==Career==
As a child, Cornwell loved the novels of [[C. S. Forester]] chronicling the adventures of fictional British naval officer [[Horatio Hornblower]] during the Napoleonic Wars. He was surprised to find that there were no such novels following [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Lord Wellington]]'s campaign on land, so he wrote that series himself—further motivated by the need to support himself through writing. He created his chief protagonist as a rifleman involved in most of the major battles of the [[Peninsular War]], taking the character's name from rugby player [[Richard Sharp (rugby union)|Richard Sharp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yesterday.uktv.co.uk/history/article/about-sharpe/ |title=About Sharpe |publisher=UK tv |work=Yesterday |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southessex.co.uk/bernard/bcintro.htm |title=A word from Bernard Cornwell |publisher=Southessex.co.uk |date=2002-09-29 |access-date=2011-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324022722/http://www.southessex.co.uk/bernard/bcintro.htm |archive-date=24 March 2012}}</ref>

Cornwell wanted to start the series with the [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Siege of Badajoz]] but decided instead to start with a couple of "warm-up" novels. These were ''[[Sharpe's Eagle (novel)|Sharpe's Eagle]]'' and ''[[Sharpe's Gold (novel)|Sharpe's Gold]]'', both published in 1981.<ref name="sharpesEagle">{{cite book |title= Sharpe's Eagle |last=Cornwell |first=Bernard |year=1994 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-780509-9 |pages=vi–vii}}</ref> He went on to tell the story of Badajoz in ''[[Sharpe's Company]]'' published in 1982. He had a seven-book deal with his publisher. 

Cornwell and wife Judy co-wrote a series of novels published under the pseudonym "Susannah Kells": ''A Crowning Mercy'' published in 1983, ''Fallen Angels'' in 1984, and ''Coat of Arms'' (aka ''The Aristocrats'') in 1986. Cornwell's strict Protestant upbringing forms the background of ''A Crowning Mercy'', which takes place during the [[English Civil War]]. He also published ''Redcoat'' in 1987, an [[American Revolutionary War]] novel set in [[Philadelphia]] during its 1777 occupation by the British.

Cornwell was approached by a production company interested in making television adaptations of the first eight books of his Sharpe series. They asked him to write a background novel to give them a starting point to the series, and they also requested that the story feature a large role for Spanish characters in order to secure co-funding from Spain. The result was ''[[Sharpe's Rifles (novel)|Sharpe's Rifles]]'', published in 1987 and set when the English retreated at [[A Coruña]] until Wellesley arrived in Spain. It also resulted in a series of [[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe television films]] starring [[Sean Bean]].<ref name="sharpesRifles">{{cite book |title= Sharpe's Rifles |last=Cornwell |first=Bernard |year=1994 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-779651-9 |pages=7–9}}</ref>

This was followed by a series of modern thrillers with sailing as a background and common themes: ''Wildtrack'' published in 1988, ''Sea Lord'' (or ''Killer's Wake'') in 1989, ''Crackdown'' in 1990, ''Stormchild'' in 1991, and the political thriller ''[[Scoundrel (suspense novel)|Scoundrel]]'' in 1992.

Cornwell wrote two books a year for a long time, slowing to one book per year in his sixties.<ref name=Harnden /> He views historical fiction as presenting a big story in the historical events and a little story in the fictional plot. [[Patrick O'Brian]] wrote the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]] of historical adventures set in the Napoleonic era, and he said that there was "too much plot, not enough lifestyle" in both Cornwell's novels and those of C. S. Forester. Cornwell took that as a compliment and an accurate appraisal of the difference between their styles, while appreciating the favorable comparison to Forester.<ref name=Harnden />

With the success of the Sharpe series, Cornwell began to write about other time periods and historical events of English and American history, both in series and in single novels. ''[[Agincourt (book)|Agincourt]]'' was released in the UK in October 2008. The protagonist is an archer who participates in the [[Battle of Agincourt]], a devastating defeat suffered by the French during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 2004, he released ''[[The Last Kingdom]]'', beginning the Saxon Stories centered on protagonist Uhtred of Bebbanburg and telling how the nation of England began under Alfred the Great. The twelfth novel in the series was published in 2019 as ''Sword of Kings''. He realized that few in England knew how England began, unlike Americans who have a clear date for their nation's beginning—so this became his big story. His own ancestral roots gave him the little story in the protagonist Uhtred.<ref name=Harnden /><ref name=Emerson>{{cite web |url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2014/01/31/bernard-cornwell-talks-the-pagan-lord-the-challenges-of-historical-fiction-and-future-plans/ |title=Bernard Cornwell Talks The Pagan Lord, The Challenges of Historical Fiction, And Future Plans |date=31 January 2014 |work=Emertainment Monthly |author=Lafferty, Hannah |publisher=Emerson College |location=Boston |access-date=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622142945/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2014/01/31/bernard-cornwell-talks-the-pagan-lord-the-challenges-of-historical-fiction-and-future-plans/ |archive-date=22 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bernard-cornwell/warriors-of-the-storm/ |title=Warriors of the Storm |magazine=Kirkus Reviews |date=22 October 2015 |access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref>

''[[The Fort (novel)|The Fort]]'' is another of Cornwell's standalone novels, published in 2010. It tells of the [[Penobscot Expedition]] of 1779 during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He has been successful overall in his writing career, selling 30 million books by 2015 throughout the various series and individual novels, and he continues to write new novels.<ref name=grdn />

==Honours==

In June 2006, Cornwell was made an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]]'s 80th Birthday Honours List.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58014 |date=17 June 2006 |page=24 |supp=y}}</ref>

==Novel series==

===Sharpe stories===
{{main|Richard Sharpe (fictional character)}}
Cornwell's first series of historical novels features the adventures of Richard Sharpe, an English soldier during the Napoleonic Wars, in particular the [[Peninsular Wars]] once [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] was sent to lead the campaign against Napoleon's forces on the Iberian Peninsula. The first 11 books of the Sharpe series began with ''Sharpe's Rifles'' and ended with ''Sharpe's Waterloo'', published in the US as ''[[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]''. These detail Sharpe's adventures in various [[Peninsular War]] campaigns over the course of seven years. Subsequently, Cornwell wrote ''Sharpe's Tiger'', ''Sharpe's Triumph'', ''Sharpe's Fortress'', ''Sharpe's Trafalgar'', and ''Sharpe's Prey'', depicting Sharpe's earlier adventures under Wellington's command in India, including his hard-won promotion to the officer corps, his return to Britain, and his arrival in the 95th Rifles; he also wrote the sequel ''Sharpe's Devil'', set six years after the end of the wars. ''[[Sharpe's Battle]]'' takes place during the [[Battle of Fuentes de Onoro]]. Since 2003, he has written further "missing adventures" set during the Peninsular War era, based on major battles of that long campaign, for a total of 24 novels in this series.

Cornwell mentions in notes at the end of the Sharpe series that he was initially dubious about the casting of Sean Bean for the television adaptations, but that the doubts did not last and he was subsequently so delighted that he dedicated ''Sharpe's Battle'' to him. He has admitted that he subtly changed the writing of the character to align with Bean's portrayal as now he "could not imagine Sharpe as anyone else". One of Cornwell's initial misgivings about Bean was that he did not physically resemble the black-haired Sharpe whom he described in the early books, but he thought that Bean understood and acted the part perfectly, and he subsequently refrained from mentioning Sharpe's hair color.<ref>{{cite web| title=Richard Sharpe bio| work=The South Essex| url=http://www.southessex.co.uk/bios/richardsharpe.htm| access-date=2008-02-22| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916042225/http://www.southessex.co.uk/bios/richardsharpe.htm| archive-date=16 September 2006}}</ref>

===Warlord Chronicles===
{{main|The Warlord Chronicles}}
A trilogy depicting Cornwell's historical re-creation of [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The series posits that post-Roman Britain was a difficult time for the native Britons, being threatened by invasion from the Anglo-Saxons in the East and raids from the Irish in the West. At the same time, they suffered internal power struggles between their petty kingdoms and friction between the old Druidic religion and newly arrived Christianity. The author has often said that these are his own favourite stories, "I have to confess that of all the books I have written these three are my favourites."<ref>{{cite web| title=Cornwell's comment on The Arthur Books| last=Cornwell| first=Bernard| work=Author's Official site| url=http://www.bernardcornwell.net/the-arthur-books-information/| access-date=2020-05-14| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026180515/http://www.bernardcornwell.net/the-arthur-books-information/| archive-date=26 October 2019}}</ref>

===Grail Quest novels===
{{main|The Grail Quest}}
This series deals with a mid-14th century search for the [[Holy Grail]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]].  English archer Thomas of Hookton becomes drawn into the quest by the actions of a [[mercenary soldier]] called "The Harlequin" who murders Thomas' family in his obsessive search for the Grail. Cornwell was planning at one point to write more books about Thomas of Hookton and said that, shortly after finishing ''Heretic'', he had "started another Thomas of Hookton book, then stopped it—mainly because I felt that his story ended in ''Heretic'' and I was just trying to get too much from him. Which doesn't mean I won't pick the idea up again sometime in the future."<ref>{{cite web| title=Cornwell's comment on Heretic| last=Cornwell| first=Bernard| work=Author's Official site| url=http://bernardcornwell.net/index.cfm?page=11| access-date=2007-10-02| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185824/http://bernardcornwell.net/index.cfm?page=11| archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> He returned to the character in ''[[1356 (novel)|1356]]'' published in 2012.

===Saxon Stories/The Last Kingdom===
{{main|The Saxon Stories}}
Cornwell's latest series focuses on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]], England during the 9th-century reign of [[Alfred the Great]], his fierce opposition to the Danes and his determination to unite England as one country.  The series idea took shape in his mind after meeting his real father in Canada in his fifties, learning his own ancestry back to that era, to Uhtred of Bebbanburg who became Uhtred, the protagonist of the series.<ref name=Emerson /> Cornwell realised that most English people are unaware of how England came to be, rather than say, Dane-land, in that era of multiple peoples on the island of Great Britain.<ref name=grdn /> The first novel was published in 2004. The series continues after the death of Alfred, as his heirs consolidate the nation. The 13th book is titled ''War Lord'', and it is the final novel in the series.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/bernard.cornwell/photos/a.10150941136705356/10156626030140356/?type=1&theater</ref>

''The Last Kingdom'' and ''The Pale Horseman'' were the basis for the first series of the television series, ''[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)|The Last Kingdom]]'', while ''The Lords of the North'' and ''Sword Song'' were the basis for the second series. A third series, based on ''The Burning Land'' and ''Death of Kings'', was released in November 2018, and a fourth series was released in April 2020.  A fifth series was confirmed on 7 July 2020.<ref>https://deadline.com/2020/07/the-last-kingdom-renewed-season-five-netflix-1202979430/</ref>

===Starbuck Chronicles===
{{main|The Starbuck Chronicles}}
Four novels set during the [[American Civil War]] follow the adventures of Boston-born Nathaniel Starbuck during his service in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]]. The series is notable for an appearance by Richard Sharpe's son as a supporting character.

===Thriller series===
Cornwell's thriller series are modern mysteries, all with sailing themes.  He is a traditional sailor and enjoys sailing his Cornish Crabber christened ''Royalist''. According to Cornwell's website, there may be no additions to the series: "I enjoyed writing the thrillers, but suspect I am happier writing historical novels. I'm always delighted when people want more of the sailing books, but I'm not planning on writing any more, at least not now – but who knows? Perhaps when I retire".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&seriesid=3 |title=The Author's Official site – Sharpe Books dot com |publisher=Bernard Cornwell |access-date=2011-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902023157/http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&seriesid=3 |archive-date=2 September 2011}}</ref>

==Nonfiction==
In addition to his many novels, including a fictional account (''[[Sharpe's Waterloo (novel)|Sharpe's Waterloo]]'') of the [[battle of Waterloo]], Cornwell published a nonfiction book, ''[[Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles]]'', released in September 2014, in time for the 200th anniversary of that battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/bernard-cornwell/battle-of-waterloo.htm |title=Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles |author=Bernard Cornwell |publisher=Fantastic Fiction |access-date=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709030237/http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/bernard-cornwell/battle-of-waterloo.htm |archive-date=9 July 2014}}</ref>
