==Early life==
Beagle was born in [[Manhattan]] on April 20, 1939, the son of Rebecca Soyer and Simon Beagle.<ref name=biog>[http://www.peterbeagle.com/personal/ (untitled)].<!--some people are too clever-->''(unofficially) Peter S Beagle: Biography''. Peterbeagle.com.</ref> Three of his uncles were noted painters: [[Moses Soyer|Moses]], [[Raphael Soyer|Raphael]], and [[Isaac Soyer]].

Beagle has said that ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', a classic of children's literature by [[Kenneth Grahame]], originally attracted him to the genre of fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cristopher Hennessey-DeRose|date=2006-06-19|title=Peter S. Beagle goes back to his fine and private place to continue the saga of The Last Unicorn|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue456/interview.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325060959/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue456/interview.html|archive-date=March 25, 2009|access-date=2014-03-25|publisher=Science Fiction Weekly}}</ref>

==Career==
Beagle was raised in [[Bronx, New York]], and graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1955. He garnered early recognition from [[The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards]], winning a scholarship to [[University of Pittsburgh]] for a poem he submitted as a high school senior. He went on to graduate from the university with a degree in creative writing. Following a year overseas, Beagle held the graduate [[Stegner Fellowship]] in creative writing at [[Stanford University]], where he overlapped with [[Ken Kesey]], [[Gurney Norman]], and [[Larry McMurtry]].

Beagle wrote his first novel, ''[[A Fine and Private Place]]'', when he was only 19 years old, following it with a memoir, ''I See by My Outfit'', in 1965. Today he is best known as the author of ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' and ''[[A Fine and Private Place]]'', as well as his later fantasies following ''[[The Folk of the Air]]''.

In the 1970s, Beagle turned to screenwriting. After writing an introduction for an American print edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he co-wrote the screenplay for the 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]]-animated version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. Two decades later he wrote the teleplay for "[[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sarek]]", episode 71 of the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.

Beagle's work as a screenwriter interrupted his early career direction as a novelist, magazine nonfiction author, and short-story writer. But in the mid-'90s he returned to prose fiction of all lengths, and has produced new works at a steady pace since. With [[David Carlson]] as composer he adapted his story "Come, Lady Death" into the libretto for an opera, ''The Midnight Angel'', which premiered at the [[Opera Theater of St. Louis]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/arts/review-opera-death-visits-a-dissonant-family-in-a-new-work-by-david-carlson.html|title=Review/Opera; Death Visits a Dissonant Family In a New Work by David Carlson|date=14 June 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2005, Beagle published a coda to ''The Last Unicorn'', a [[Novella|novelette]] entitled ''[[Two Hearts (story)|Two Hearts]]'', and began work on a full-novel sequel. ''Two Hearts'' won the most prestigious annual awards, the [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette]] in 2006 and the parallel [[Nebula Award]] in 2007. It was also nominated as a short fiction finalist for the [[World Fantasy Award]]. Beagle also received a special [[Inkpot Award]] in 2006 for Outstanding Achievement in Science Fiction and Fantasy, and in 2007 the inaugural [[WSFA Small Press Award]] for "El Regalo", published in ''The Line Between'' ([[Tachyon Publications]]).<ref name=SFawards-beagle/>

[[File:Beagle ucberkeley.jpg|thumb|right|Beagle in 2006]]
[[IDW Publishing]] released a six-issue [[comic book]] adaptation of ''The Last Unicorn'' beginning in April 2010. The collected hardcover edition was released in January 2011, premiering at #2 on the [[New York Times]] Hardcover Graphic Novel bestseller list. 

Beagle's 2009 collection of short fiction, ''We Never Talk About My Brother'', was nominated for a World Fantasy Award.<ref name=SFawards-beagle/>

In 2013, he collaborated with [[Phildel]] (a [[UK]] musician) on a new track "Dark Water Down", mixing poetry and music. They then appeared together at a gig at [[Cafe Du Nord]] in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phildel featuring "Dark Water Down" poetry and music by Peter S. Beagle and Phildel and TBA |url=http://www.eventsfy.com/event/phildel-featuring-dark-water-down-poetry-and-music-by-peter-s-beagle-and-phildel-and-tba/san-francisco/Cafe-du-Nord/2013-11-10 |publisher=www.eventsfy.com | access-date=2013-12-07}}</ref>

===Dispute with Granada media===
Peter S. Beagle's book ''The Last Unicorn'' was made into an [[The Last Unicorn (film)|animated film of the same name]] in 1982, based on a screenplay written by Beagle himself. In 1979, Beagle had a contract with [[ITC Entertainment]], which entitled Beagle to 5% of the net profits in the animated property, and 5% of the gross revenues from any film-related merchandising. Since 1999 this film has been controlled by a British company, Granada Media International (a subsidiary of [[ITV plc]]). From 2003 through 2011, Beagle was involved in a financial dispute with Granada over nonpayment of contractually due profit and merchandising shares. On July 29, 2011, Beagle announced at his [[Otakon]] appearance that he and ITV had reached an agreement that was beneficial to all parties, and should please fans of ''The Last Unicorn''. On October 14, 2011, at his [[New York Comic Con]] appearance, he announced the first results of the deal.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

===Dispute with Connor Cochran===
Beagle sued his former manager [[Connor Freff Cochran|Connor Cochran]] in 2015 for $52 million. Beagle was represented by Kathleen Hunt. In July 2019, in a seventeen page decision, Alameda County Superior Court judge Michael M. Markman found Cochran liable for financial elder abuse, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty, awarding Beagle $325,000, as well as an additional $7500 for defamation, and an undetermined amount in attorney's fees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://file770.com/state-judge-awards-peter-s-beagle-332k-in-damages/|title=State Judge Awards Peter S. Beagle $332K in Damages|date=25 June 2019}}</ref>  

Cochran declared bankruptcy sixteen hours before the trial was due to begin. Beagle was unable to collect the money Cochran owed, and the rights to Beagle's work were left in legal limbo. In February 2021, after a six-year battle in bankruptcy and California state courts helmed by Kathleen Hunt, and aided by James Null who coordinated the services of Loeb & Loeb's Capital Markets and Corporate practice, Beagle was able to regain rights to his intellectual property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-last-unicorn-returns-home-renowned-fantasy-author--screenwriter-peter-s-beagle-prevails-after-multi-year-legal-battles-against-elder-abuse-and-to-regain-control-of-his-literary-legacy-301254107.html|title="The Last Unicorn" Returns Home: Renowned Fantasy Author & Screenwriter Peter S.
