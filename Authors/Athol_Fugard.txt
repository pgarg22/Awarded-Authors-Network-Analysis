==Personal history==
Fugard was born as Harold Athol Lanigan Fugard, in [[Middelburg, Eastern Cape]], South Africa, on 11 June 1932. His mother, Marrie (Potgieter), an [[Afrikaner]], operated first a general store and then a lodging house; his father, Harold Fugard, was a disabled former [[jazz pianist]] of Irish, English and French Huguenot descent.<ref name=McLuckie/><ref name=Biography>{{cite web|first=Iain |last=Fisher|url=http://www.iainfisher.com/fugard/athol-fugard.html|title=Athol Fugard: Biography|work=Athol Fugard: Statements|publisher=iainfisher.com|access-date=1 October 2008}}</ref><ref>Fisher gives Fugard's full birth name as "Harold Athol Lanigan Fugard", spelling Fugard's middle name as ''Lanigan'', following Dennis Walder, ''Athol Fugard'', Writers and Their Work (Tavistock: Northcote House in association with the [[British Council]], 2003)<!--page ref.?-->.

==Career==

===Early period===
In 1958, Fugard organised "a multiracial theatre for which he wrote, directed, and acted", writing and producing several plays for it, including ''No-Good Friday'' (1958) and ''Nongogo'' (1959), in which he and his colleague black South African actor [[Zakes Mokae]] performed.<ref name=McLuckie/> In 1978, Richard Eder of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized ''Nongogo'' as "awkward and thin. It is unable to communicate very much about its characters, or make them much more than the servants of a noticeably ticking plot." Eder argued, "Queenie is the most real of the characters. Her sense of herself and where she wants to go makes her believable and the crumbling of her dour defenses at a touch of hope makes her affecting. By contrast, Johnny is unreal. His warmth and hopefulness at the start crumble too suddenly and too completely".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Eder|first=Richard|date=1978-12-04|title='Nongogo,' a Drama|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/04/archives/nongogo-a-drama-early-fugard-work.html|access-date=2020-05-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

After returning to Port Elizabeth in the early 1960s, Athol and Sheila Fugard started The Circle Players,<ref name=McLuckie/> which derives its name from the production of ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]].<ref name=Krugerchap5>{{cite book|first=Loren|last= Kruger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Qizpti1Z4C|chapter=Chapter 5: The Dis-illusion of Apartheid: Brecht in South Africa|title=Post-Imperial Brecht Politics and Performance, East and South|series=Cambridge Studies in Modern Theatre|publisher=Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Qizpti1Z4C&pg=PA215&cad=0_0#PPA215,M1 215–80]|isbn=978-0-521-81708-0|year=2004}} ([[Google Books]].)</ref>

In 1961, in Johannesburg, Fugard and Mokae starred as the brothers Morris and Zachariah in the single-performance world première of Fugard's play ''[[Blood Knot|The Blood Knot]]'' (revised and retitled ''Blood Knot'' in 1987), directed by [[Barney Simon]].<ref name=Gussow>{{cite news|first=Mel|last= Gussow|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9C05E5D91439F937A1575AC0A963948260|title=Stage: 'The Blood Knot' by Fugard|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 September 1985|access-date=5 October 2008|author-link = Mel Gussow}}</ref> In 1989, Lloyd Richards of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' declared ''The Blood Knot'' to be Fugard's first "major play".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Richards|first=Lloyd|date=1989|title=Athol Fugard, The Art of Theater No. 8|journal=The Paris Review.

===Refusal to stage for "Whites Only" audiences===
In 1962, Fugard found the question of whether he could "work in a theatre which excludes 'Non-Whites'--or includes them only on the basis of special segregated performance-- increasingly pressing". It was made more so by the decision of [[Equity (British trade union)|British Equity]] to prevent any British entertainer visiting South Africa unless the audiences were multi-racial. In a decision that caused him to reflect on the power of art to effect change, Fugard decided that the "answer must be No".<blockquote>That old argument used to be so comforting; so plausible: 'One person in that segregated, white audience, might be moved to think, and then to change, by what he saw'. 
I'm beginning to wonder whether it really works that way. The supposition seems to be that there is a didactic--a teaching through feeling element in art. What I do know is that art can give meaning, can render meaningful areas of experience, and most certainly also enhances. But teach? Contradict? State the opposite to what you believe and then lead you to accept it?
In other words, can art change a man or woman? No. That is what life does. Art is no substitute for life.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fugard |first1=Athol |title=Notebooks 1960–1977 |date=1984 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn=0394537556 |page=59}}</ref></blockquote>
Of the few venues in the country where a play can be presented to mixed audiences some, Fugard noted, were little better than barns. But he concluded that under these circumstances "every conceivable dignity--audience, producer, act, 'professional' etc.--" was "operative" in the white theatre except one, "human dignity".<ref>Fugard (1984), p. 60</ref>

Fugard publicly supported the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] (1959–94) in the international boycott of South African theatres due to their segregated audiences. The results were additional restrictions and surveillance, leading him to have his plays published and produced outside South Africa.<ref name=McDonald/>

[[Lucille Lortel]] produced ''The Blood Knot'' at the Cricket Theatre, [[Off Broadway]], in New York City in 1964, "launch[ing]" Fugard's "American career."<ref name=LortelArchiveBiog>{{cite web|url=http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=people&keyword=name&first=Athol&last=Fugard&middle=|title=Athol Fugard: Biography|publisher=[[Lortel Archives|The Internet Off-Broadway Database]]|access-date=2 October 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315033734/http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=people&keyword=name&first=Athol&last=Fugard&middle=|archive-date=15 March 2009}}</ref>

===The Serpent Players===
In the 1960s, Fugard formed the Serpent Players, whose name derives from its first venue, the former snake pit (hence the name) at the Port Elizabeth Museum,<ref name=McDonald/> "a group of black actors worker-players who earned their living as teachers, clerks, and industrial workers, and cannot thus be considered amateurs in the manner of leisured whites", developing and performing plays "under surveillance by the Security Police", according to Loren Kruger's ''The Dis-illusion of Apartheid'', published in 2004.<ref name=Kruger217f>{{cite book|first=Loren|last= Kruger|chapter=Chapter 5: The Dis-illusion of Apartheid: Brecht in South Africa|title=Post-Imperial Brecht Politics and Performance, East and South|series=Cambridge Studies in Modern Theatre|publisher=Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Qizpti1Z4C&pg=PA215&cad=0_0#PPA217,M1 217–18]|isbn=978-0-521-81708-0|year=2004}} ([[Google Books]] limited preview.)</ref> The group largely consisted of black men, including [[Winston Ntshona]], [[John Kani]], [[Welcome Duru]], Fats Bookholane and Mike Ngxolo as well as Nomhle Nkonyeni and Mabel Magada. They all got together, albeit at different intervals, and decided to do something about their lives using the stage. In 1961 they met Athol Fugard, a white man who grew up in Port Elizabeth and who recently returned from Johannesburg, and asked him if he could work with them "as he had the know-how theatrically—the tricks, how to use the stage, movements, everything"; they worked with Athol Fugard since then, "and that is how the Serpent Players got together."<ref name=Ufahamu>"'Art is Life and Life is Art'. An interview with John Kani and Winston Ntshona of the Serpent Players from South Africa", in ''Ufahamu: A Journal of African Studies'' [Internet], 6(2), 1976, pp. 5–26. Available from: [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9qb6w2wz eScholarship], University of California. Retrieved 26 July 2017.</ref> At the time, the group performed anything they could lay their hands on in South Africa as they had no access to any libraries. These included [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[William Shakespeare]] and many other prominent playwrights of the time. In an interview in California, Ntshona and Kani were asked why they were doing the play ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'', considered a highly political and telling story of the South African political landscape at the time. Ntshona answered: "We are just a group of artists who love theatre. And we have every right to open the doors to anyone who wants to take a look at our play and our work...We believe that art is life and conversely, life is art. And no sensible man can divorce one from the other. That's it. Other attributes are merely labels."<ref name=Ufahamu /> They mainly performed at the St Stephen's Hall – renamed the Douglas Ngange Mbopa Memorial Hall in 2013 – adjacent to St Stephen's Church, and other spaces in and around New Brighton, the oldest Black township in Port Elizabeth.

According to Loren Kruger, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the [[University of Chicago]], 
<blockquote>the Serpent Players used [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]'s elucidation of [[Gestus|gestic acting]], dis-illusion, and social critique, as well as their own experience of the satiric comic routines of urban African [[vaudeville]], to explore the theatrical force of [[Epic Theatre|Brecht's techniques]], as well as the immediate political relevance of a play about land distribution. Their work on the ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle|Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' and, a year later, on ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''<ref name=McDonald/> led directly to the creation, in 1966, of what is still [2004] South Africa's most distinctive ''Lehrstück'' [learning play]:''The Coat''. Based on an incident at one of the many political trials involving the Serpent Players, ''The Coat'' dramatized the choices facing a woman whose husband, convicted of anti-apartheid political activity, left her only a coat and instructions to use it.<ref name=Kruger217f/></blockquote>

Clive Barnes of ''The New York Times'' panned ''People Are Living There'' (1969) in 1971, arguing: "There are splinters of realities here, and pregnancies of feeling, hut [<nowiki/>sic] nothing of significance emerges. In Mr. Fugard's earlier plays he seemed to be dealing with life at a proper level of humanity. Here—if real people are living there—they remain oddly quiet about it...The first act rambles disconsolately, like a lonely type writer looking for a subject and the second act produces with pride a birthday party of [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplinesque]] bathos but less than Chaplinesque invention and spirit..[The characters] harangue one another in an awkward dislocation between a formal speech and an interior monologue."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Clive|date=1971-11-19|title=Theater: People Are Living There'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/19/archives/theater-people-are-living-there-athol-fugards-drama-opens-at-forum.html|access-date=2020-05-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Mark Blankenship of ''Variety'' negatively reviewed a 2005 revival of the same work, writing that it "lacks the emotional intensity and theatrical imagination that mark such Fugard favorites" as ''[["Master Harold"...and the Boys]]''. Blankenship also stated, however, that the performance he attended featuring "only haphazard sketches of plot and character" was perhaps the result of Fugard allowing director Suzanne Shepard to revise the play without showing him the changes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=People Are Living There|url=https://variety.com/2005/legit/reviews/people-are-living-there-1200525087/|last=Blankenship|first=Mark|date=2005-06-17|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref>

The Serpent Players conceptualised and co-authored many plays that it performed for a variety of audiences in many theatres around the world. The following are some of its notable and most popular plays:

* Its first production was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[La Mandragola]]'', directed by Fugard as ''[[The Cure]]'' and set in the township. Other productions include [[Georg Buchner]]'s ''[[Woyzeck]]'', Brecht's ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' and Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]''. When the group had turned to improvisation, they came up with classic works such as ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'' and ''[[The Island (play)|The Island]]'', emerging as inner experiences of the actors who are also the co-authors of the plays.
* In ''The Coat'', Kruger observes, "The participants were engaged not only in representing social relationships on stage but also on enacting and revising their own dealings with each other and with institutions of apartheid oppression from the law courts downward", and "this engagement testified to the real power of Brecht's apparently utopian plan to abolish the separation of player and audience and to make of each player a 'statesman' or social actor...Work on ''The Coat'' led indirectly to the Serpent Players' most famous and most Brechtian productions: ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Island (play)|The Island]]'' (1973)."<ref name=Kruger217f/>
Fugard developed these two plays for the Serpent Players in workshops, working with [[John Kani]] and [[Winston Ntshona]],<ref name=Kruger217f/> publishing them in 1974 with his own play ''Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act'' (1972). The authorities considered the title of ''The Island'', which alludes to [[Robben Island]], the prison where [[Nelson Mandela]] was being held, too controversial, so Fugard and the Serpent Players used the alternative title ''The Hodoshe Span'' (''Hodoshe'' meaning "carrion fly" in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]).
* These plays "espoused a Brechtian attention to the demonstration of [[Gestus|gest]] and social situations and encouraged audiences to analyze rather than merely applaud the action"; for example, ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'', which infused a Brechtian critique and [[vaudeville|vaudevillian irony]]-–especially in Kani's virtuoso improvisation-–even provoked an African audience's critical interruption and interrogation of the action.<ref name=Kruger217f/> 
* While dramatising frustrations in the lives of his audience members, the plays simultaneously drew them into the action and attempted to have them analyse the situations of the characters in Brechtian fashion, according to Kruger.<ref name=Kruger217f/>
* ''Blood Knot'' was filmed by the BBC in 1967, with Fugard's collaboration, starring the Jamaican actor [[Charles Hyatt]] as Zachariah and Fugard himself as Morris, as in the original 1961 première in Johannesburg.<ref name=FugardNotebooks>{{cite book|first=Athol|last= Fugard|title=''Notebooks 1960–1977''|publisher=Craighall: A.
