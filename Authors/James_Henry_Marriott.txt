'''James Henry Marriott''' (1799 – 25 August 1886) was  a [[New Zealand]] [[theater manager|theatre manager]], [[actor]], entertainer, [[playwright]], [[songwriter]], [[engraving|engraver]], [[optician]] and [[bookselling|bookseller]]. He was born in [[London]], England, and arrived in New Zealand three years after the [[Wellington]] area was first settled. In Wellington he was involved with [[theatrical production]] at the Ship Hotel, Olympic Theatre, Britannia Saloon and Royal Lyceum. He made himself useful in the early days of the settlement by [[engraving]] [[headstone|tombstones]], engraving illustrations for newspapers, and grinding [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] for [[optical telescope|telescopes]]. He ran a bookshop and sold [[sheet music]], and contributed to the organised social and civic life of Wellington. In New Zealand he was the first regular producer of plays, a playwright (his play ''Marcilina'' premiered in 1848), and the first optics professional in that country to make a telescope. He was the father of [[Alice Marriott (actress)|Alice Marriott]] and the great-grandfather of [[Marriott Edgar]] and [[Edgar Wallace]].

==Background==
Marriott's parents were Leeds optician William Marriott<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clifton |first1=Gloria |last2=Turner |first2=Prof. Gerard L'Estrange |date=1995 |title=Directory of British Scientific Instrument Makers 1550–1851 |publisher=Zwemmer in association with the National Maritime Museum |isbn=9780302006344 }}</ref> and Alice McGuinness. His wife was Sarah Bateman (died Wellington, 1885), whom he married on 19 May 1822 in [[Hackney, London]].<ref name="Orchiston telescope" /> The second of their three daughters was actress [[Alice Marriott (actress)|Alice Marriott]], born on 17 December 1824 in [[London]], and they had two sons also. He was the great-grandfather of [[Marriott Edgar]] and [[Edgar Wallace]].<ref name="DNZB Marriott">{{DNZB|title=James Henry Marriott|first= Peter|last= Downes|id=1m15|accessdate= 1 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Marriott Edgar |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001179/19510517/010/0003 |via=British Newspaper Archive |newspaper=The Stage |date=17 May 1951 |page=3 col 1 |access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref>

In July 1842, Marriott left his family and sailed through gales and wrecks with a drunken captain on the 497-ton [[barque]] ''Thomas Sparks''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://winsomegriffin.com/Newsham/JohnHursthouse.html |title=John and Helen Hursthouse |website=Winsome Griffin |access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://collection.pukeariki.com/objects/35219 |title=Hursthouse, John.

On 25 August 1886, he died in Wellington after a few days' illness.<ref name="Orchiston telescope" /><ref name="DNZB Marriott"/>

==Career in London==
In London, Marriott had "learned from his father the skills of optician and [[mathematical instrument]] maker", and possibly also his engraving skills, but initially became a [[journalist|reporter]] for ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper. At the same time he was producing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays, and was involved in acting, painting and music.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/>

==Career in New Zealand==
===Theatrical production===

Having arrived in New Zealand in January 1843, it took him only four months to organise his first series of [[theatrical production]]s which opened at the Ship Hotel, Wellington, on 11 May 1843. There had been no previous attempt at regular performances of plays in New Zealand. Encouraged and assisted by Marriott, the [[publican]] erected the temporary Royal Victoria Theatre behind the Ship, and it opened on 12 September 1843. Marriott managed that theatre, which was closed after two months.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/> He was co-designer of the Olympic Theatre in Wellington. He decorated it, and was responsible for the [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] and the [[whale oil]] gas for lighting purposes.<ref name="Orchiston telescope" /> With his associate Rowland Davis he opened the Britannia Saloon theatre in Willis Street, Wellington, in September 1845, as well as the Aurora Tavern which later became the Royal Lyceum Theatre. Rather than management, Marriott's involvement was mainly concerned with directing, producing, scene-painting, and general performance, i.e. music, dancing, singing and acting.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/><ref name="Scholefield 1939" >{{cite news |last=Scholefield |first=Dr G.

===Writing===
On 11 July 1848 at the Britannia Saloon, Marriott's company premiered his play, ''Marcilina''. According to the ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]'', this is believed to have been the first performance of a play written by a New Zealander.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/>

During the prelude to the re-election of [[Isaac Featherston]] as Wellington [[Superintendent (New Zealand)|Superintendent]], Marriott wrote in Featherston's support ''The Constitutional Budget'' of 1858, made up of poems and political songs.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/>

===Optical instruments and engraving===
At [[Bolton Street Cemetery]] there are examples of his engraved [[Headstone|tombstone]]s. He also engraved illustrations of events in the town, because engravings could at that time be reproduced in newspapers and magazines.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/> For example, he engraved illustrations of public dinners and of the laying of the cornerstone of Wellington's Provincial Hall.<ref name="Scholefield 1939" />

It was his brother William Marriott II who inherited their father's business,<ref name="Orchiston telescope" /> but James had nevertheless learned the skills. Working as an optician would have provided him with regular income, but he was also an instrument maker.<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/> He was the first person to make telescopes in New Zealand, having made at least one marine telescope by 1844, possibly in response to the Great Comet [[List of near-parabolic comets|C/1844 Y1]] of December 1844 and January 1845. He did not make many of them. He did, however, give a lecture on the subject at the Wellington Athenaeum and Mechanics' Institute in August 1852. Between 1849 and 1875 he advertised his [[glasses|spectacles]], telescopes, [[sextant]]s, [[compass]]es and [[engraving]] in ''[[The Wellington Independent]].''<ref name="Orchiston telescope" >{{cite web|url=http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2015JAHHvol18/2015JAHH...18..261O.pdf |title=James Henry Marriott, New Zealand's first professional telescope-maker |last=Orchiston |first=Wayne |date=January 2015 |website=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage|publisher=narit.or.th |access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>

===Business, civic and social contribution===
Marriott reckoned that he "did a bit of everything, from [[chisel]]ling tombstones to putting in ladies' teeth." On [[Lambton Quay]], Marriott had a bookshop and [[stationery]] business, which also sold music,<ref>{{cite book |last=Maslen |first=Keith |date=2001 |title=Bulletin |chapter=Music Selling in Nineteenth-Century New Zealand 1 |url=https://www.bsanz.org/download/bulletin-/bulletin_vol._25_nos._3-4_(2001)/B_2001_Vol25_No3-4_03.pdf |publisher=Biographical Society of Australia and New Zealand |volume=25/3-4 |page=29 }}</ref> between around 1853 and 1885. He worked for the [[Tradesman|Tradesmen's]] Club and the [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]].<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/> In 1843, along with his associate Rowland Davis,<ref name="Scholefield 1939" /> he was one of the founders of Wellington's [[Odd Fellows|Oddfellows]] Order. His [[Civic virtue|civic]] duties included "[[Serjeant-at-arms|sergeant at arms]], inspector of [[Unit of measurement|weights and measures]], registrar of [[Livestock branding|cattle brands]] and registrar of dogs."<ref name="DNZB Marriott"/> "At most public dinners [Marriott] was employed in arranging the entertainment and decorating the hall."<ref name="Scholefield 1939" />
