Thomas married Tom Koumalats and spent several years travelling while he served in the [[United States Army]].<ref name=maupin/>  The couple then returned to Amarillo and had two sons.<ref name=foust/><ref name=maupin/>  Both husband and wife became teachers, and for the next fifteen years Thomas taught family living at Amarillo High School.<ref name=foust/><ref name=elliot>{{citation|last=Elliot-Upton|first=Deborah|title=Putting it in writing: Local author has always been inspired to write|newspaper=Amarillo Globe-News|date=April 5, 2009|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/040509/fea_13029188.shtml|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref><ref name=yates>{{citation|last=Yates|first=Philip|title=Romance writer wins third award|date=July 31, 2006|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/073106/new_romance.shtml|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>

In 1984, worried that teacher salaries would be insufficient to save for her children's college education, Thomas began writing.<ref name=foust/>  Her first published work was an article for the ''[[Oklahoma Daily]]'' about the Llano Cemetery in Amarillo.  She also sold many short stories for children, most averaging about 244 words.<ref name=hale>{{citation|last=Hale|first=Karen M.|title=An Interview of Author Jodi Thomas: Historical Romance and Mainstream|date=August 2005|newspaper=The Wellington Leader|location=Wellington, TX|url=http://www.jodithomas.com/wellingtonleader2005.html|accessdate=January 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713111800/http://www.jodithomas.com/wellingtonleader2005.html|archive-date=July 13, 2011|url-status=dead}} hosted at Jodi Thomas official website</ref>  By 1988, Thomas had begun writing in earnest after work.<ref name=burks/>  When she sold her first book, publishers suggested that her surname, Koumalats, was too ethnic.  As a compromise, she took her husband's first name as her pen name.<ref name=elliot/>

Thomas's first novel, ''Beneath the Texas Sky'', met with critical success. It won a ''Romantic Times'' Reviewer's Choice Award for Best Western Romance and was designated a National Press Women Novel of the Year.<ref name=tripp>{{citation|title=Sex, romance in Texas|newspaper=Amarillo Globe-News|date=March 4, 2001|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/030401/boo_sexromance.shtml|accessdate=January 21, 2010|last=Tripp|first=Mary Kate}}</ref>  By 1991, Thomas was able to quit teaching to become a full-time writer.<ref name=foust/>  She has won three [[Romance Writers of America]] RITA Awards,&ndash;the highest award given to romance novelists&ndash; in 1992, 1995, and 2006.

==Books==
Thomas began writing [[historical romance]]s in the early 1980s because she was dissatisfied with the ones she had read.  In many cases, the romances she picked up contained historical errors or relationships that she thought were implausible.<ref name=maupin/>  Her own novels draw on family stories of living in Texas,<ref name=elliot/> as well as months of research for each.<ref name=foust/> The majority of her novels are set in Texas, and many contain the word "Texas" or "Texan" in the title.<ref name=maupin/>

Although most of her novels are historical or contemporary romances, with ''Widows of Wichita County'' Thomas branched into mainstream women's fiction.<ref name=elliot/><ref name="amarillo.com"/>
