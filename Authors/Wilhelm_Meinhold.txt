==Life==

Meinhold was born in [[Lütow]] on the island of [[Usedom]], where his father Georg Wilhelm Meinhold (1767–1728) was a [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church|Lutheran]] priest.

Growing up in the atmosphere of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], he enrolled as a student at  the [[University of Greifswald]] in  [[Swedish Pomerania]] in the fall of 1813.<ref name=Bridgwater213/> After his theological education, he was priest in [[Koserow]] on Usedom from 1821 until 1827.<ref>Goetz (2007), p. 81.</ref> For the next 17 years, he was priest in [[Krummin]], also on Usedom, before he relocated to [[Farther Pomerania]].

He retired early on account of his insubordinate behavior and died in 1851 in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]].<ref name=Dubilski>Dubilski (2003), p. 109.</ref>
