'''George Granville Barker''' (26 February 1913 &ndash; 27 October 1991) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]], identified with the [[New Apocalyptics]] movement, which reacted against 1930s realism with mythical and surrealistic themes. His long liaison with [[Elizabeth Smart (Canadian author)|Elizabeth Smart]] was the subject of her cult-novel ''[[By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept]]''.

==Life and work==
Barker was born in [[Loughton]], near [[Epping Forest]] in [[Essex]], England, to English father George Barker (1879–1965), a temporary police constable and former batman in the [[Coldstream Guards]] (during [[World War I]], when he returned to the regiment, he earned a field commission to the rank of Major) who later worked as a butler at [[Gray's Inn]],<ref>The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker, Robert Fraser, Jonathan Cape, 2001</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/02/biography.highereducation|title = Review: The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker by Robert Fraser|website = [[TheGuardian.com]]|date = 2 March 2002}}</ref> and Irish mother Marion Frances (1881–1953), née Taaffe, from [[Mornington, County Meath]], near [[Drogheda]], Ireland; they moved to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] when Barker was six months old.<ref>George Barker, Martha Fodaski, Twayne Publishers, 1969, p. 13</ref><ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-49571|isbn = 978-0-19-861412-8|doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/49571|title = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year = 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/the-cold-heart-of-passions-thief-26239284.html|title=The cold heart of passion's thief}}</ref><ref>Encyclopaedia of British Writers, From 1800 to the Present, second edition, 20th Century and Beyond, ed.

Elizabeth Podnieks, University of Delaware Press, 2012, p. 252</ref>

Barker was educated at an [[London County Council|L.C.C.]] school and at [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]]. Having left school at an early age, he pursued several odd jobs, before settling on a career in writing. Early volumes of note by Barker include ''Thirty Preliminary Poems'' (1933), ''Poems'' (1935) and ''Calamiterror'' (1937), which was inspired by the [[Spanish Civil War]],<ref>D. Daiches ed., ''[[The Penguin Companion to Literature|The Penguin Companion to Literature Vol 1]]'' (1971) p. 34</ref> and contains an attack
on the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Nationalists]].<ref>
[[Stanley Weintraub]], ''The Last great cause. The intellectuals and the Spanish civil war.'' London : W. H. Allen, 1968.  (pp. 79-80)</ref>

In his early twenties, Barker had already been published by [[T. S. Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]], who also helped him to gain appointment as Professor of English Literature in 1939 at [[Tohoku University]] ([[Sendai, Miyagi]], [[Japan]]). He left there in 1940 due to the hostilities, but wrote ''Pacific Sonnets'' during his tenure.

He then travelled to the [[United States]], where he began his longtime liaison with writer [[Elizabeth Smart (author)|Elizabeth Smart]], by whom he had four of his fifteen children.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/elizabeth-smart-and-george-barker-love-affair-literary-classic/ https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-chameleon-poet-a-life-of-george-barker-by-robert-fraser-9276416.html</ref> Barker also had three children by his first wife, Jessica.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Sansom |title=Master of the red Martini |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,,660088,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]]   |date=March 2, 2002 |access-date=2008-07-08 |quote=Jessica has just given birth to his twins, Elizabeth Smart is busy giving birth to her second child by him, and he is spending most of his time drinking in London. }}</ref> He returned to England in 1943. From the late 1960s until his death, he lived in [[Itteringham]], [[Norfolk]], with his wife [[Elspeth Barker]], the novelist. In 1969, he published the poem ''At Thurgarton Church'', the village of [[Thurgarton (Norfolk)|Thurgarton]] being a few miles from Itteringham.

Barker's 1950 novel, ''The Dead Seagull'', described his affair with Smart, whose 1945 novel ''[[By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept]]'' was also about the affair.<ref>I Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 38</ref> His ''Collected Poems'' ({{ISBN|0-571-13972-8}}) were edited by [[Robert Fraser (writer)|Robert Fraser]] and published in 1987 by Faber and Faber. Barker was partly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] movement,<ref>I Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 38</ref> which reacted against 1930s realism with surrealistic and mythical themes. However, his characteristically independent idiosyncrasies set him off as an individual in his own right.<ref>C. H. Sisson, ''English Poetry 1900-1950'' (1981) p. 243</ref>

A notoriously uneven writer, Barker's masterpiece was considered by [[C. H. Sisson]] to be ''The True Confession of George Barker''.<ref>C. H. Sisson, ''English Poetry 1900-1950'' (1981) p. 248</ref>

In describing the difficulties in writing his biography, Barker was quoted as saying, "I've stirred the facts around too much&nbsp;... It simply can't be done." However, Robert Fraser produced a biography, ''The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker'', in 2001.<ref>''The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker'' (Jonathan Cape Ltd, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7123-0540-2}}).</ref>
