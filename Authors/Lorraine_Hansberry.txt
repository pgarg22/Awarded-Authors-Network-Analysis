'''Lorraine Vivian Hansberry''' (May 19, 1930&nbsp;– January 12, 1965) was a playwright and writer.<ref>Lipari, Lisbeth. "Queering the borders: Lorraine Hansberry's 1957 Letters to The Ladder" [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p112109_index.html Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Marriott Hotel, San Diego, CA, May 27, 2003]. Online. 2008-06-28.</ref> She was the first [[African-American]] female author to have a play performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Her best known work, the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', highlights the lives of [[Black American]]s living under [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in [[History of African Americans in Chicago|Chicago]]. The title of the play was taken from the poem "[[Harlem (poem)|Harlem]]" by [[Langston Hughes]]: "What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?" At the age of 29, she won the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle Award]] — making her the first African-American dramatist, the fifth woman, and the youngest playwright to do so.<ref>Cheney, Anne. "Lorraine Hansberry" (Boston: Twayne, 1984). Regenstein Bookstacks, PS3515.A595Z8C51.</ref> Hansberry's family had struggled against segregation, challenging a [[Covenant (law)#History|restrictive covenant]] in the 1940 US Supreme Court case ''[[Hansberry v. Lee]]''.

After she moved to New York City, Hansberry worked at the Pan-Africanist newspaper [[Freedom (American newspaper)|''Freedom'']], where she dealt with other  intellectuals such as [[Paul Robeson]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. Much of her work during this time concerned the African struggles for liberation and their impact on the world. Hansberry's writings also discussed her [[lesbianism]] and the oppression of [[homosexuality]].<ref name="Anderson">{{cite news |last = Anderson |first = Melissa |title = Lorraine Hansberry's Letters Reveal the Playwright's Private Struggle |url = https://www.villagevoice.com/2014/02/26/lorraine-hansberrys-letters-reveal-the-playwrights-private-struggle/ |newspaper = [[The Village Voice]]}}</ref><ref name="Belletto">{{cite book|vauthors =Belletto S|title =American Literature in Transition, 1950–1960|isbn = 978-1108307819 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2017|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc9CDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA176}}</ref> She died of [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 34.<ref name="Markel">{{cite book|vauthors =Markel H|title =Literatim: Essays at the Intersections of Medicine and Culture|isbn = 978-0190070014|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2019|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtnBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA194}}</ref> Hansberry inspired the song by [[Nina Simone]] entitled "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]", which was also the title of Hansberry's [[To Be Young, Gifted and Black (play)|autobiographical play]].

==Early life and family==
Lorraine Hansberry was the youngest of four children born to [[Carl Augustus Hansberry]], a successful real-estate broker and Nannie Louise (born Perry), a driving school teacher and ward committeewoman.

In 1938, her father bought a house in the [[Washington Park Subdivision]] of the [[South Side of Chicago]], incurring the wrath of their white neighbors.<ref name=Carter40 /> The latter's legal efforts to force the Hansberry family out culminated in the [[SCOTUS|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Hansberry v. Lee]]'', {{ussc|311|32|1940}}. The restrictive covenant was ruled contestable, though not inherently invalid;<ref>[[s: Hansberry v. Lee/Opinion of the Court|''Hansberry v. Lee'', 311 U.S. 32]]</ref> these covenants were eventually ruled unconstitutional in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', {{ussc|334|1|1948}}.

Carl Hansberry was also a supporter of the [[Urban League]] and [[NAACP]] in Chicago. Both Hansberrys were active in the Chicago Republican Party.<ref name=Anderson263>Anderson, "Freedom Family" (2008), p. 263.</ref> Carl died in 1946 when Lorraine was fifteen years old; "American racism helped kill him," she later said.<ref>Anderson, "Freedom Family" (2008), pp. 268–269.</ref>

The Hansberrys were routinely visited by prominent black people, including sociology professor [[W. E. B. DuBois]], poet [[Langston Hughes]], singer, actor and political activist [[Paul Robeson]], musician [[Duke Ellington]] and Olympic gold medalist [[Jesse Owens]].

Carl Hansberry's brother, [[William Leo Hansberry]], founded the African Civilization section of the History Department at [[Howard University]].<ref>Wilkins, "Beyond Bandung" (2006), p. 194: "It was common for the Hansberry household to host a range of African-American luminaries such as Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Duke Ellington, Walter White, Joe E. Louis, Jesse Owens, and others.

Hansberry's uncle, William Leo Hansberry, was a distinguished professor of African history at Howard University and had made a name for himself as a specialist in African antiquity. Thus, Hansberry became deeply familiar with pan-African ideas and the international contours of black liberation at an early age (8)."</ref> Lorraine was taught: "Above all, there were two things which were never to be betrayed: the family and the race."<ref name=Anderson263 />

Lorraine Hansberry has many notable relatives including director and playwright [[Shauneille Perry]], whose eldest child is named after her. Her grandniece is the actress Taye Hansberry. Her cousin is the flutist, percussionist, and composer Aldridge Hansberry.

Hansberry was the godmother to [[Nina Simone]]'s daughter [[Lisa Simone|Lisa]].<ref>Cohodas, Nadine (2010), ''Princess Noire: The Tumultuous Reign of Nina Simone'', Pantheon; [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRoy0ZDBRwAC&lpg=PT174&pg=PT173#v=onepage&q&f=false online].</ref>

==Education==

Hansberry graduated from [[Prospect Heights School District 23|Betsy Ross Elementary]] in 1944 and from [[Englewood Technical Prep Academy|Englewood High School]] in 1948.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41" /><ref name=Wilkins195>Wilkins, "Beyond Bandung" (2006), p. 195.</ref> She attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where she immediately became politically active with the [[Communist Party USA]] and integrated a dormitory. Hansberry's classmate [[Bob Teague]] remembered her as "the only girl I knew who could whip together a fresh picket sign with her own hands, at a moment's notice, for any cause or occasion".<ref name=Anderson263 />

She worked on [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s presidential campaign in 1948, despite her mother's disapproval.<ref name=Anderson263 /> She spent the summer of 1949 in [[Mexico]], studying painting at the [[University of Guadalajara]].<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41" />

==Move to New York City==

In 1950, Hansberry decided to leave Madison and pursue her career as a writer in New York City, where she attended [[The New School]]. She moved to [[Harlem]] in 1951<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41">Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 41.</ref> and became involved in activist struggles such as the fight against evictions.<ref>Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 47. "While working at [[Freedom (American newspaper)|''Freedom'']], Hansberry also demonstrated her dedication to the cause by marching on picket lines, by speaking on street corners in Harlem, and by helping to move the furniture of evicted black tenants back into their apartments."</ref>

===''Freedom'' newspaper and activism===

In 1951, Hansberry joined the staff of the black newspaper ''[[Freedom (American newspaper)|Freedom]]'', edited by [[Louis E. Burnham]] and published by [[Paul Robeson]]. At ''Freedom'', she worked with [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], whose office was in the same building, and other Black Pan-Africanists.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41"/> At the newspaper, she worked as "subscription clerk, receptionist, typist, and editorial assistant"<ref>{{cite book | last = Higashida | first = Cheryl | title = Black internationalist feminism : women writers of the Black left, 1945-1995 | page=49 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | year = 2011 | jstor = 10.5406/j.ctt2tt9dg.5 | isbn = 978-0252093548 }}</ref> besides writing news articles and editorials.<ref name=Wilkins196 />

Additionally, she wrote scripts at ''Freedom''.  To celebrate the newspaper's first birthday, Hansberry wrote the script for a rally at Rockland Palace, a then-famous Harlem hall,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rockland Palace Dance Hall, Harlem NY 1920 |url=https://www.harlemworldmagazine.com/the-rockland-palace-dance-hall-harlem-ny-1920/ |website=Harlem World |date=27 October 2014 |publisher=Harlem World Magazine |access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref> on "the history of the Negro newspaper in America and its fighting role in the struggle for a people's freedom, from 1827 to the birth of FREEDOM." Performers in this pageant included [[Paul Robeson]], his longtime accompanist [[Lawrence Benjamin Brown|Lawrence Brown]], the multi-discipline artist [[Asadata Dafora]], and numerous others.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murphy, Jr. |first1=George B. |title=In the Freedom Family |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/44j0ztf0 |access-date=16 November 2020 |work=Freedom |volume=1 |issue=12 |page=3 |publisher=Freedom Associates |date=December 1951|hdl=2333.1/44j0ztf0 }}</ref>  The following year, she collaborated with the already produced playwright [[Alice Childress]], who also wrote for ''Freedom'', on a pageant for its Negro History Festival, with [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Douglas Turner Ward]] and [[John O. Killens]].  This is her earliest remaining theatrical work.<ref name=Anderson265>Anderson, "Freedom Family" (2008), p. 265.</ref>

Like Paul Robeson and many black civil rights activists, Hansberry understood the struggle against white supremacy to be interlinked with the program of the Communist Party.  One of her first reports covered the [[Sojourners for Truth and Justice]] convened in Washington, D.C., by [[Mary Church Terrell]].<ref>Anderson, "Freedom Family" (2008), p. 260. "No sooner had she joined Freedom, which had been founded by Paul Robeson as part of his tightening embrace of the Communist Party line in the increasingly frigid Cold War than she was serving as a participant-correspondent: she accompanied the 'Sojourners for Truth and Justice,' a group of 132 black women from 15 states which was convened in September 1951, in Washington by the long-time activist Mary Church Terrell 'to demand that the Federal Government protect the lives and liberties' of black Americans. Hansberry's full-page report detailed the graphic and, inevitably, frustrating encounter between officials of the Justice Department and women like Amy Mallard, the widow of a World War II veteran who had been shot to death for attempting to vote in Georgia."</ref> She traveled to Georgia to cover the case of [[Willie McGee (convict)|Willie McGee]], and was inspired to write the poem "Lynchsong" about his case.<ref>Anderson, "Freedom Family" (2008), pp. 260–261.</ref>

Hansberry worked on not only the US civil rights movement, but also global struggles against colonialism and imperialism.<ref name="Markel"/><ref name=Wilkins195 /> Hansberry wrote in support of the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] in [[Kenya]], criticizing the mainstream press for its biased coverage.<ref name=Wilkins196>Wilkins, "Beyond Bandung" (2006), pp. 196–197. "In an article titled 'Kenya's Kikuyu: A Peaceful People Wage Heroic Struggle against the British,' Hansberry presented an opposite view and applauded the Kikuyu for 'helping to set fire to British Imperialism in Kenya.' Put off by the 'frantic dispatches about the "terrorists" and "witchcraft societies" in the colony' that preceded the December 1952 publication of her article, Hansberry criticized anti&nbsp;– Mau Mau coverage that only 'distort[ed] the fight for freedom by the five million Masai, Wahamba, Kavirondo, and Kikuyu people who [made] up the African people of Kenya.'"</ref>

Hansberry often explained these global struggles in terms of female participants. She was particularly interested in the situation of Egypt,<ref name="Markel"/> "the traditional Islamic 'cradle of civilization,' where women had led one of the most important fights anywhere for the equality of their sex."<ref>Hansberry, "The Egyptian People Fight for Freedom", quoted in Higashida, ''Black Internationalist Feminism'' (2011), p. 57.</ref>

In 1952, Hansberry attended a peace conference in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, in place of Paul Robeson, who had been denied travel rights by the State Department.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41"/><ref name=Maxwell2012 />

===Marriage and personal life===

On June 20, 1953,<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41"/> Hansberry married [[Robert B. Nemiroff|Robert Nemiroff]], a Jewish publisher, songwriter and political activist.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Herald |first1=Compton |title=Pasadena hosts Lorraine Hansberry classic, 'A Raisin in the Sun' |url=https://comptonherald.org/pasadena-hosts-lorraine-hansberry-classic-raisin-sun/ |access-date=26 January 2019 |work=Compton Herald |date=19 February 2018}}</ref> Hansberry and Nemiroff moved to [[Greenwich Village]], the setting of her second Broadway play, ''[[The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window]]''. On the night before their wedding in 1953, Nemiroff and Hansberry protested against the execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stockwell |first1=Norman |title=Into the Light |url=https://progressive.org/magazine/into-the-light/ |access-date= January 26, 2019 |work=Progressive.org |date= August 1, 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref> 
The success of the hit pop song "[[Cindy, Oh Cindy]]", co-authored by Nemiroff, enabled Hansberry to start writing full-time.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 41"/> Although the couple separated in 1957 and divorced in 1962, their professional relationship lasted until Hansberry's death.<ref name="Blau">{{cite news |last=Blau |first=Eleanor |title=Robert Nemiroff, 61, Champion of Lorraine Hansberry's Works |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/19/obituaries/robert-nemiroff-61-champion-of-lorraine-hansberry-s-works.html |access-date=March 31, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 19, 1991 }}</ref><ref name="Mumford">{{cite web |last1=Mumford |first1=Kevin |title=Opening the Restricted Box: Lorraine Hansberry's Lesbian Writing |url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lorraine-hansberry/lesbian-writing |website=OutHistory.org |access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="Mumford, &quot;Not Straight, Not White&quot;">{{cite book |last1=Mumford |first1=Kevin J. |title=Not Straight, Not White: Black Gay Men from the March on Washington to the AIDS Crisis |date=2016 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill |isbn=978-1-4696-2684-0 |oclc=1001715112 |pages=14–22}}</ref>

Hansberry was a [[closeted]] lesbian.<ref name="Anderson"/><ref name="Belletto"/><ref name="Markel"/> Before her marriage, she had written in her personal notebooks about her attraction to women.<ref name="Anderson"/><ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2016|p=14}}.</ref> In 1957, around the time she separated from Nemiroff, Hansberry contacted the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], the San Francisco-based lesbian rights organization, contributing two letters to their magazine, ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'', both of which were published under her initials, first "L.H.N."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=L.H.N. |title=Readers Respond |journal=The Ladder |date=May 1957 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=26–28 |url=https://documents.alexanderstreet.com/d/1003347887 |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> and then "L.N."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=L.N. |title=Readers Respond |journal=The Ladder |date=August 1957 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=26–30 |url=https://documents.alexanderstreet.com/d/1003347890 |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2016|pages=17–18, 203}}.</ref> Pointing to these letters as evidence, some gay and lesbian writers credited Hansberry as having been involved in the [[homophile]] movement or as having been an activist for [[gay rights]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hansberry, Lorraine |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/hansberry_l.html |encyclopedia=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |publisher=glbtq, Inc. |access-date=March 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314101440/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/hansberry_l.html |archive-date=March 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>Kai Wright, "[http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2009/03/lorraine_hansberrys_gay_politics.html Lorraine Hansberry's Gay Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123163117/http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2009/03/lorraine_hansberrys_gay_politics.html |date=November 23, 2015 }}, ''The Root'', March 11, 2009.</ref>  According to Kevin J. Mumford, however, beyond reading homophile magazines and corresponding with their creators, "no evidence has surfaced" to support claims that Hansberry was directly involved in the movement for gay and lesbian civil equality.<ref name="Mumford 19-20">{{harvnb|Mumford|2016|pp=19–20}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Riemer |first1=Matthew |last2=Brown |first2=Leighton |title=We Are Everywhere: Protest, Power, and Pride in the History of Queer Liberation |date=2019 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=9780399581823 |page=84}}</ref>

Mumford stated that Hansberry's lesbianism caused her to feel isolated while ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' catapulted her to fame; still, while "her impulse to cover evidence of her lesbian desires sprang from other anxieties of respectability and conventions of marriage, Hansberry was well on her way to coming out."<ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2016|p=17}}.</ref> Near the end of her life, she declared herself "committed [to] this homosexuality thing" and vowing to "create my life—not just accept it".<ref name="Mumford"/> Before her death, she built a circle of gay and lesbian friends, took several lovers, vacationed in [[Provincetown]] (where she enjoyed, in her words, "a gathering of the clan"),<ref name="Mumford p. 20">{{harvnb|Mumford|2016|p=20}}.</ref> and subscribed to several homophile magazines.<ref name="Mumford p. 20" />

In 1964, Hansberry and Nemiroff divorced but continued to work together.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 43">Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 43.</ref>  Upon his ex-wife's death, Robert Nemiroff donated all of Hansberry's personal and professional effects to the [[New York Public Library]]. In doing so, he blocked access to all materials related to Hansberry's lesbianism, meaning that no scholars or biographers had access for more than 50 years.<ref name="Mumford 19-20"/> In 2013, Nemiroff's daughter released the restricted materials to Kevin J. Mumford, who explored Hansberry's self-identification in subsequent work.<ref name="Mumford 19-20" /><ref name="Mumford"/>

==Success as playwright==

Written and completed in 1957, ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on March 11, 1959, becoming the first play by an African American woman to be produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The 29-year-old author became the youngest American playwright and only the fifth woman to receive the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]] for Best Play.<ref name=Carter42>Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 42.</ref> She was also nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Play]], among the four [[Tony Awards]] that the play was nominated for in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/awards |title=Awards Search |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2020 |website=Internet Broadway Database|access-date=August 31, 2020}}</ref> Over the next two years, ''Raisin'' was translated into 35 languages and was being performed all over the world.<ref>Anderson, "Freedom Family" (2008), p. 267.</ref>

In April 1959, as a sign of her sudden fame just one month after ''A Raisin in the Sun'' premiered on Broadway, photographer [[David Attie]] did an extensive photo-shoot of Hansberry for ''Vogue'' magazine, in the apartment at 337 Bleecker Street where she had written ''Raisin'', which produced many of the best-known images of her today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/women-writers-who-shaped-20th-century-american-literature-180975872/|title=David Attie's Lorraine Hansberry Photo Shoot|access-date=24 September 2020}}</ref> In her award-winning Hansberry biography ''Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry'', [[Imani Perry]] writes that in his "gorgeous" images, "Attie captured her intellectual confidence, armour, and remarkable beauty."<ref>Perry, Imani, Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry, 2018, Beacon: p102.</ref>

Hansberry wrote two screenplays of ''Raisin'', both of which were rejected as controversial by [[Columbia Pictures]]. Commissioned by [[NBC]] in 1960 to create a television program about slavery, Hansberry wrote ''The Drinking Gourd''. This script was called "superb" but also rejected.<ref name=Carter42 />

In 1960, during [[Delta Sigma Theta]]'s 26th national convention in [[Chicago]], Hansberry was made an honorary member.

In 1961, Hansberry was set to replace [[Vinnette Carroll]] as the director of the musical ''Kicks and Co'', after its try-out at Chicago's McCormick Place. Written by [[Oscar Brown|Oscar Brown, Jr.]], it featured an interracial cast including Lonnie Sattin, [[Nichelle Nichols]], Vi Velasco, [[Al Freeman, Jr.]], Zabeth Wilde, and [[Burgess Meredith]] in the title role of Mr. Kicks. A satire involving [[miscegenation]], the $400,000 production was co-produced by her husband Robert Nemiroff; despite a warm reception in Chicago, the show never made it to Broadway.<ref name="Jet-12JOct1961">{{cite journal |last = Still |first = Larry|editor1-first=John H|editor1-last=Johnson |date = October 12, 1961 |title = Oscar Brown musical gets warm reception in windy city |journal = Jet |volume = 20 |issue = 25 |pages = 58–61 |quote = After the first showing, co-producers Burt Charles D'Lugoff and Robert Nemiroff announced that original director Vinnette Carroll would be replaced by Nemiroff's wife, prize-winning playwright Lorraine (''A Raisin in the Sun'') Hansberry in her first major directing spot. }}</ref>

In 1963, Hansberry [[Baldwin–Kennedy meeting|participated in a meeting]] with Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], set up by [[James Baldwin]].<ref name=Carter42 /> Also in 1963, Hansberry was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She underwent two operations, on June 24 and August 2. Neither of the surgeries was successful in removing the cancer.<ref name=Carter42 />

Hansberry agreed to speak to the winners of a creative writing conference on May 1, 1964: "Though it is a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly so, doubly dynamic — to be young, gifted and black."<ref name="books.google.com">Lorraine Hansberry speech, "The Nation Needs Your Gifts", given to Readers Digest/United Negro College Fund creative writing contest winners, NYC, May 1, 1964.

==Beliefs==
According to historian Fanon Che Wilkins, "Hansberry believed that gaining civil rights in the United States and obtaining independence in colonial Africa were two sides of the same coin that presented similar challenges for Africans on both sides of the Atlantic."<ref>Wilkins, "Beyond Bandung" (2006), p. 199.</ref> In response to the independence of [[Ghana]], led by [[Kwame Nkrumah]], Hansberry wrote: "The promise of the future of Ghana is that of all the colored peoples of the world; it is the promise of freedom."<ref>Higashida, ''Black Internationalist Feminism'' (2011), p. 57.</ref>

Regarding tactics, Hansberry said blacks "must concern themselves with every single means of struggle: legal, illegal, passive, active, violent and non-violent... They must harass, debate, petition, give money to court struggles, sit-in, lie-down, strike, boycott, sing hymns, pray on steps—and shoot from their windows when the racists come cruising through their communities."<ref name=Carter49 />

James Baldwin described Hansberry's 1963 meeting with Robert F. Kennedy, in which Hansberry asked for a "moral commitment" on civil rights from Kennedy. According to Baldwin, Hansberry stated: "I am not worried about black men--who have done splendidly, it seems to me, all things considered...But I am very worried...about the state of the civilization which produced that photograph of the white cop standing on that Negro woman’s neck in Birmingham.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=James|date=1979|title=Lorraine Hansberry at the Summit.|url=https://voices.revealdigital.org/?a=d&d=IBJBJF1979-04&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1|journal=Freedomways|volume=19|pages=271–272|via=Independent Voices}}</ref>

In a Town Hall debate on June 15, 1964, Hansberry criticized [[Liberalism in America#Liberals and civil rights|white liberals]] who could not accept [[civil disobedience]], expressing a need to "encourage the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical." At the same time, she said, "some of the first people who have died so far in this struggle have been white men."<ref>Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 46.</ref>

Hansberry was a critic of [[existentialism]], which she considered too distant from the world's economic and geopolitical realities.<ref>Higashida, ''Black Internationalist Feminism'' (2011), p. 60. "For Hansberry, existentialism encoded, politicized, and dramatized racial and sexual identities (because [[Jean Genet]] and [[Norman Mailer]] represented blacks, gays, and prostitutes who exposed the falsities upon which modern life was scaffolded) but it denied the historical material conditions which gave rise to both oppression and social change. [...] Hansberry's review of Wright, then, was only an early salvo in an argument with the work of Genet and Mailer as well as that of Albert Camus, Samuel Beckett, and Edward Albee over human existence, responsibility, and freedom. While these writers and thinkers presented diverse, even incommensurable world views, Hansberry understood them to be linked by an intellectually, politically, and morally bankrupt nihilism and solipsism."</ref> Along these lines, she wrote a critical review of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[The Outsider (Wright novel)|The Outsider]]'' and went on to style her final play ''[[Les Blancs]]'' as a foil to [[Jean Genet]]'s absurdist ''[[The Blacks (play)|Les Nègres]]''.<ref>Higashida, ''Black Internationalist Feminism'' (2011), pp. 59–62.</ref> However, Hansberry admired [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]]''.<ref>Higashida, ''Black Internationalist Feminism'' (2011), pp. 64–65. "Yet even in her unwavering criticism of existentialism, Hansberry did not dismiss it: she was strongly influenced by the existentialist feminism of Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, which she called a 'great book' that might 'very well be the most important work of this century.'"</ref>

In 1959, Hansberry commented that women who are "twice oppressed" may become "twice militant". She held out some hope for male allies of women, writing in an unpublished essay: "If by some miracle women should not ever utter a single protest against their condition there would still exist among men those who could not endure in peace until her liberation had been achieved."<ref>Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 45.</ref>

Hansberry was appalled by the nuclear bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] which took place while she was in high school and expressed a desire for a future in which: "Nobody fights. We get rid of all the little bombs—and the big bombs." She believed in the right of people to defend themselves with force against their oppressors.<ref name=Carter49>Carter, "Commitment amid Complexity" (1980), p. 49.</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] began surveillance of Hansberry when she prepared to go to the Montevideo peace conference. The Washington, D.C., office searched her passport files "in an effort to obtain all available background material on the subject, any derogatory information contained therein, and a photograph and complete description," while officers in Milwaukee and Chicago examined her life history. Later, an FBI reviewer of ''Raisin in the Sun'' highlighted its Pan-Africanist themes as "dangerous".<ref name=Maxwell2012>Maxwell, William J.

==Posthumous works==
Hansberry's ex-husband, Robert Nemiroff, became the executor for several unfinished manuscripts.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 43"/> He added minor changes to complete the play ''[[Les Blancs]]'', which [[Julius Lester]] termed her best work, and he adapted many of her writings into the play ''[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black (play)|To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]'', which was the longest-running [[Off Broadway]] play of the 1968–69 season.<ref>''Les Blancs: The Collected Last Plays of Lorraine Hansberry'', Introduction.</ref> It appeared in book form the following year under the title ''To Be Young, Gifted and Black: Lorraine Hansberry in Her Own Words''. She left behind an unfinished novel and several other plays, including ''The Drinking Gourd'' and ''What Use Are Flowers?'', with a range of content, from slavery to a post-apocalyptic future.<ref name="Carter 1980, p. 43"/>

When Nemiroff donated Hansberry's personal and professional effects to the [[New York Public Library]], he "separated out the lesbian-themed correspondence, diaries, unpublished manuscripts, and full runs of the homophile magazines and restricted them from access to researchers." In 2013, more than twenty years after Nemiroff's death, the new executor released the restricted material to scholar Kevin J. Mumford.<ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2016|p=19}}.</ref>

In 1973, a musical based on ''A Raisin in the Sun'', entitled ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]],'' opened on Broadway, with music by Judd Woldin, lyrics by Robert Brittan, and a book by Nemiroff and Charlotte Zaltzberg. The show ran for more than two years and won two [[Tony Awards]], including [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]].

In 1969, Nina Simone first released a song about Hansberry called "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]." The title of the song refers to the title of Hansberry's autobiography, which Hansberry first coined when speaking to the winners of a creative writing conference on May 1, 1964: "Though it is a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly so, doubly dynamic — to be young, gifted and black."<ref name="books.google.com"/> Simone wrote the song with the poet [[Weldon Irvine]] and told him that she wanted lyrics that would "make black children all over the world feel good about themselves forever." When Irvine read the lyrics after it was finished, he thought, "I didn't write this. God wrote it through me." A studio recording by Simone was released as a single and the first live recording on October 26, 1969, was captured on ''[[Black Gold (Nina Simone album)|Black Gold]]'' (1970).<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/apr/23/artsfeatures.stage Alfred Hickling, "Sweet Lorraine"], ''The Guardian'', April 23, 2001.</ref> The single reached the top 10 of the [[R&B]] charts.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.boscarol.com/ninasimone/pages/php/show_song.php?id=tobeyounggifted |title = The Nina Simone Database, "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" (1969). |access-date = November 29, 2014 }}</ref> In the introduction of the live version, Simone explains the difficulty of losing a close friend and talented artist.

Founded in 2004 and officially launched in 2006, The Hansberry Project of Seattle, Washington was created as an African American theatre lab, led by African American artists and designed to provide the community with consistent access to the African American artistic voice. A Contemporary Theatre (ACT) was their first incubator and in 2012 they became an independent organization. The Hansberry Project is rooted in the convictions that black artists should be at the center of the artistic process, that the community deserves excellence in its art, and that theatre's fundamental function is to put people in a relationship with one another. Their goal is to create a space where the entire community can be enriched by the voices of professional black artists, reflecting autonomous concerns, investigations, dreams, and artistic expression.

In 2010, Hansberry was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/lorraine-hansberry |title=Lorraine Hansberry |date=2010 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>
