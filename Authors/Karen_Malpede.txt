She graduated from New Trier Township High School in Winnetka, IL.

== Career ==

=== Playwright ===
Because of her dual background, Malpede has said, she never quite fit in with any one group, and that has had a freeing effect on her as a dramatist.

Malpede's first play, ''A Lament for Three Women'', was published in ''A Century of Plays by American Women,'' edited by Rachel France. (Richards Rosen Press, 1979).<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=France|first=Rachel|title=A Century of Plays by American Women|publisher=Richards Rosen Press|year=1979|isbn=9780823904723|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref name="rothbart">{{cite web |last1=Rothbart |first1=Brad |date=May 25, 2016 |website=American Theatre |title=Karen Malpede Imagines a Better World in 'The Beekeeper's Daughter' |url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2016/05/25/karen-malpede-imagines-a-better-world-in-the-beekeepers-daughter/}}</ref> and she has been writing and producing plays ever since.<ref name="park">{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=Kyoung H.|date=August 26, 2013|title=Talking to Karen Malpede: A Cultural Democracy in the Performing Arts Interview|url=https://brooklyncommune.org/2013/08/26/talking-to-karen-malpede-a-cultural-democracy-in-the-performing-arts-interview/|website=The Brooklyn Commune}}</ref>

She was a cofounder of the Women’s Salon for Literature, a monthly event featuring the leading writers of the feminist movement, and where her second play ''Rebecca'' received its first public reading, and has had 22 plays produced as of 2020.

''[http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/prophecy Prophecy],'' produced in 2008 in London and 2010 in New York, starring [[Kathleen Chalfant]], is a memory play about an enduring but tumultuous marriage, marked by significant infidelities, and of the acting teacher whose life was impacted by the murder of an antiwar lover, by his commanding officer, in Vietnam and now by a talented Iraq-war veteran student who takes his own life (written and produced at a time when  little attention was being paid to veteran suicides.)

''[http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/another-life Another Life]'' is a surreal yet factual critique of the [[Torture and the United States|U.S. government torture program]], starring a mogul named Handel, who prefigures and bears striking resemblance to Donald J. Trump. Premiered on September 11, 2011, to commemorate the decade since the attacks of September 2001, the play had four subsequent productions. Each production was accompanied by a Festival of Conscience, in which major writers on torture and lawyers for Guantanamo detainees, held conversations with the audiences. &nbsp;

Her next play ''[http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/extreme-whether Extreme Whether]'', depicts the struggle of scientists to tell the truth about [[climate change]] in the face of opposition from the fossil fuel industry. The play, which premiered at [[Theater for the New City]] in New York in 2014, was also presented as a staged reading in French and English as part of ArtCop21, in Paris, 2015, during the negotiation of the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]], and restaged in 2018 at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa Experimental Theater Club]] in New York City Prominent climate scientists, James Hansen and Jennifer Francis and environmental activists spoke with the audience after the production.

Her most recently produced play ''[http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/other-than-we Other Than We],'' is a utopic-dystopic cli-fi fantasy. Produced at LaMama in November 2019, it was live streamed by the [https://www.earth.columbia.edu/ Columbia Earth Institute] in the summer of 2020, and is published by Laertes Books.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Malpede|first=Karen|title=Other Than We|publisher=Laertes Books|year=2020|isbn=978-1-942281-19-1|location=North Carolina}}</ref>

Malpede's one-man play, ''[http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/i-will-bear-witness I Will Bear Witness]'', is co-adapted with George Bartenieff from the diaries of [[Victor Klemperer]], a German Jew who documented the persecution of Jews in Dresden between 1933 and 1945. The production, which she directed, won [[Obie Award]]s for acting for Bartenieff and set design.&nbsp;

In May, 2021, Theater Three Collaborative will present the world premiere of Malpede's play ''[https://farmartscollective.org/event/blue-valiant-by-karen-malpede/ Blue Valiant],'' outdoors at [https://farmartscollective.org/ Farm Arts Collective], among the first American theaters to come out of pandemic lockdown with a live performance. ''Blue Valiant'' was written for and stars Kathleen Chalfant and George Bartenieff, with Millie Ortiz and Arthur Rosen playing the horse on piano. The play is about grief and renewal.

=== Artistic Director ===
In 1977, Malpede co-founded New Cycle Theater, with Burl Hash, a free, loft theater in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which later became affiliated with the early [[St. Ann's Warehouse|Arts at St. Ann’s]]. Her plays, “The End of War,” “Making Peace: A Fantasy,” “A Monster Has Stolen the Sun,” “Sappho & Aphrodite,” were produced in the loft theater and at St. Ann’s.

In 1995, she co-founded the Theater Three Collaborative with her husband, [[George Bartenieff]], and the late Lee Nagrin, both actors. The purpose was to enable them "to produce plays that could not be produced elsewhere" because of their social justice themes and poetic character-driven, sometimes, surreal, and epic styles. Theatre Three Collaborative has

Their premiere production in New York in 1995, and at the Dionysia Festival for Contemporary Drama in Veroli, Italy, was ''T [http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/beekeepers-daughter he Beekeeper’s Daughter],'' a play inspired both by the life of poet [[Robert Graves]] and by the plight of a victim of a Bosnian rape camp.

=== Books, stories, articles, and reviews ===
Her first book, ''People’s Theater in Amerika'',<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Malpede|first=Karen|title=People's Theater in Amerika|publisher=Drama Book Specialists|year=1973|isbn=0910482330}}</ref> a history of radical theater in the United States from 1929 to 1972, was a seminal study and brought her into contact with people who become mentors and early supporters of her plays, [[Joseph Chaikin]], founder of the [[The Open Theater|Open Theater]], and [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]], co-founders of [[The Living Theatre]], and lifelong friends.

Her second book, ''Three Works by the Open Theater,''<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Malpede|first=Karen|title=Three Works by the Open Theater|publisher=Drama Book Specialists|year=1973|isbn=9780910482547}}</ref> a collaboration with Chakin, published in 1974, was a seminal study of the influential, experimental theater company.

== Activism ==
Malpede is a lifelong peace and social justice activist. Among the historic marches and protests of which she has been a part: The 1967 [[March on the Pentagon]], The 1970 New Haven Rally Protesting the Trial of Bobby Seale and Erica Huggins, The 1979, Washington Lawn Eleven, for which she was arrested, tried and found guilty, alongside writer [[Grace Paley]], photographer [[Karl Bissinger]] and eight others. The Women’s Peace Encampment at Seneca Falls and Women’s Pentagon Action, and the summer 2020 Black Lives Matter marches on Dekalb Ave., Brooklyn, during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

In 2004, to protest the Iraq war, she co-created an outdoor public ritual to coincide with the Republican National Convention re-nominating George W. Bush. Called “Iraq: Naming the Dead” the event took place each night of the convention, outdoors, in the graveyard of the historic [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery|St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery]], involving Arab-American, black, white and brown readers of the names of the Iraqi and American dead (a 15-to-1 ratio).

Several months later, she presented the rewritten and expanded indoor documentary-ritual theater performance piece “I [http://theaterthreecollaborative.org/iraq-speaking-of-war raq:Speaking of War]” at the CUNY Graduate Center Prozansky Auditorium, on the eve of a massive anti-war march in New York; the piece was later presented at the Culture Project.

In the summer of 2018, she joined with playwrights [[Naomi Wallace]] and [[Kia Corthron]] to co-produce at the [[Signature Theatre Company|Signature Theater]] on 42nd St., [http://www.markuspotter.com/imagine-yemen-signature-theatre Imagine: Yemen], an evening of eight short plays about the war in Yemen.

She is currently at work on an international collaboration with Persona Theater, Athens, for the YouTube staging of her short play ''Troy Too'' about Covid-19, the Climate Crisis and Racism; the script will be published in the forthcoming ''Staging 21st Century Tragedies''.
