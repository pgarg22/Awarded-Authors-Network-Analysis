Her poetry is studied by [[GCSE]] and [[A Level]] students throughout the United Kingdom. A considerable number of her poems are used in the GCSE [[AQA Anthology]]. She has given poetry readings and lectures in Europe and the United States; her work has been translated into ten languages.<ref name="Carcanet Press – Gillian Clarke"/> Some of her English poems were translated into Chinese by Peter Jingcheng Xu and published in the journal ''Foreign Literature and Art'' (Issue 6, December 2016).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://site.douban.com/286008/ |title=威尔士民族诗人吉莲·克拉克的小站 |website=site.douban.com |access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref>
