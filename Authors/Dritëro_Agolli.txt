==Biography==
Agolli was born to a [[Bektashi]] peasant family in Menkulas in the [[Devoll District]] near PMS{{what?|date=May 2021}} and finished high school in [[Gjirokastër]] in 1952. He later studied at the Faculty of Arts of the [[University of Leningrad]] and took up journalism upon his return to Albania, working for the daily newspaper [[Zëri i Popullit]] ({{lang-en|The People’s Voice}}) for 15 years. Agolli was also a deputy in the [[Albanian Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.letersia.fajtori.com/Letersi/Moderne/Dritero_Agolli/index.php|title=ANG - Dritero Agolli|website=www.letersia.fajtori.com}}</ref> 

===Beginnings as a poet===
Agolli first was a poet. His early verse collections were ''I went out on the street'' ({{lang-sq|Në rrugë dolla}}, [[Tirana]] 1958), My steps on the pavement ({{lang-sq|Hapat e mija në asfalt}}, Tirana 1961), and Mountain paths and sidewalks ({{lang-sq|Shtigje malesh dhe trotuare}}, Tirana 1965).{{fact|date=April 2021}}

===Prose attempts===
As a prose writer, Agolli first wrote the novel Commissar Memo ({{lang-sq|Komisari Memo}}, Tirana 1970), translated in English as ''The bronze bust'', Tirana 1975. Agolli's second novel, The man with the cannon ({{lang-sq|Njeriu me top}}, Tirana 1975) translated into English in 1983, takes up the partisan theme from a different angle.{{fact|date=April 2021}}

After these two novels of partisan heroism, Agolli produced his satirical [[Splendour and fall of comrade Zylo]] ({{lang-sq|Shkëlqimi dhe rënja e shokut Zylo}}, Tirana 1973). Comrade Zylo is a well-meaning but incompetent [[apparatchik]], a director of an obscure government cultural affairs department. His pathetic vanity, his quixotic fervour, his grotesque public behaviour, his splendour and fall, are all recorded in ironic detail by his hard-working and more astute subordinate and friend Demkë who serves as a neutral observer. Comrade Zylo is a universal figure, to be found in any society or age, and critics have been quick to draw parallels ranging from [[Daniel Defoe]] and [[Nikolay Gogol]]’s [[Revizor]] to [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Milan Kundera]]'s [[The Joke (novel)|Zert]]. Splendour and fall of comrade Zylo first appeared in 1972 in the Tirana satirical journal [[Hosteni]] ({{lang-en|The goad}}) and was published the following year in monograph form.{{fact|date=April 2021}}

From the 1960s until the Communist regime collapsed in the early 1990s, the League accused Albanian writers it deemed guilty of neglecting their responsibility as Communists to reflect the propaganda style of [[Socialist Realism]] in their writings and thereby advance the goals of the Communist Party; some writers were arrested, and either imprisoned for many years or shot, and others were hounded by the state secret police and suffered attacks.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uy8rDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Albanian+League+of+Writers+and+Artists%22&pg=PA95|title=Ismail Kadare: The Writer and the Dictatorship 1957-1990|first=Peter|last=Morgan|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351562003|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fm1xDgAAQBAJ&dq=%22Albanian+League+of+Writers+and+Artists%22&pg=PA214|title=Ideological Messaging and the Role of Political Literature|first=Çak?rta?|last=Önder|date=20 March 2017|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=9781522523925|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Kasem Trebeshina]] was imprisoned, [[Pjetër Arbnori]] (also called ''Albanian Mandela'') was re-convicted in prison for his literary anti-communist work and imprisoned from ages 26 to 54, [[Bilal Xhaferri]] was expelled, exiled in communist [[gulag]]s, and forced to flee to the U.S., [[Vilson Blloshmi]] was shot, and many others who were persecuted in many ways. Some survived, such as the poet [[Xhevahir Spahiu]] and the writer [[Ismail Kadare]], who ultimately defected to France to escape the regime and its ''[[Sigurimi]]'' secret police, and thereafter won the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]], the [[Herder Prize]], the [[Man Booker International Prize]], the [[Prince of Asturias Award]], the [[Jerusalem Prize]], the [[Park Kyong-ni Prize]], and the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kadare.htm |title=Ismail Kadare |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113052232/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kadare.htm |archivedate=13 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
