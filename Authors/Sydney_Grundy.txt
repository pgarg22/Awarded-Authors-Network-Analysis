'''Sydney Grundy''' (23 March 1848 – 4 July 1914) was an English dramatist.  Most of his works were adaptations of European plays, and many became successful enough to tour throughout the English-speaking world.  He is, however, perhaps best remembered today as the [[librettist]] of several [[comic opera]]s, notably ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]''.

==Life and career==
Grundy was born in [[Manchester]], England, the son of Alderman Charles Sydney Grundy. He was educated at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]], Manchester, and studied law at the [[Middle Temple]].  He was called to the bar in 1869 and practised law until 1876.<ref>{{cite Men-at-the-Bar|name=Grundy, Sydney|page=192}}</ref>

===Early career===
His early one-act farce, ''A Little Change'', was produced at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1872 by [[Madge Kendal|the Kendals]].  This was followed by ''All at Sea'' in 1873, also starring the Kendals.<ref name="Adams">{{cite book| author = William Davenport Adams| title = A Dictionary of the Drama| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tjwOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA22| year = 1904| publisher = Burt Franklin }}</ref> In 1876, Grundy published ''The Days of His Vanity''.<ref>{{cite book| author = Sydney Grundy| title = The days of his vanity| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GtoBAAAAQAAJ| year = 1876}}</ref> He wrote ''Mammon'' for W.

Grundy became well known as an adapter of French and German plays, cleaning them up for British audiences and revisiting the source material to craft his final product.  As the protagonist in his 1900 play, ''A Debt of Honour'', explains: "It all takes place in Paris: nobody pretends that such things happen here."  Among his earlier successes at adapting European works were ''The Snowball'' at the Strand Theatre (1879), based on ''Oscar, ou le mari qui trompe sa femme'' by [[Eugène Scribe]] and Duvergne; ''In Honour Bound'' (1880), based on Scribe's ''Une Chaine''; ''Dust'' at the [[Royalty Theatre]] (1881); ''The Glass of Fashion'' (1883); and ''A Wife's Sacrifice'' (1886).<ref name=Adams/> ''The Bells of Haslemere'', written with H. Pettitt, was a success at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in 1887.<ref name="Ency">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Grundy, Sydney |volume=12 |page=640}}</ref> He also created a farce in three acts, ''The Arabian Nights'' (1887), an adaptation of von Moser's ''Haroun al Raschid'';<ref>[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31446838/ Cover page of '&#39;The Arabian nights'&#39;]. Ebook.lib.hku.hk. Retrieved on 24 May 2012.</ref> ''Pompadour'', written with W. G. Wilts; and ''Mamma'' (1888), an adaptation of ''Les surprises du Divorce''.<ref name=NYT/>

Grundy's original [[libretto|libretti]] included the one-act "musical absurdity" ''Popsy Wopsy'' (1880), the full-length ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'' (1882) and ''Pocahontas'' (1884), both with [[Edward Solomon]]. These Solomon and Grundy comic operas toured extensively in both Britain and the US. His ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' (1892), with [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]], dramatised the legend of Dorothy Vernon's elopement from [[Haddon Hall]] with John Manners.

===Later years===
In 1889–90 Grundy produced three original comedies, ''A White Lie'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], ''A Wife's Sacrifice'' and ''A Fool's Paradise'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], which had been produced two years earlier as ''The Mouse-Trap''.

Later successful adaptations included ''A Pair of Spectacles'' at the [[Garrick Theatre]] (1889, starring [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]]), from ''Les Petits Oiseaux'' of Labiche and Delacour.  In 1890, [[Lilly Langtry]] presented Grundy's ''Esther Sandraz'' at the [[St. James's Theatre]].
