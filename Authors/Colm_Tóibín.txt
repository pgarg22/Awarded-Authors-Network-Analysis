Tóibín is currently Irene and Sidney B. Silverman Professor of the Humanities at [[Columbia University]] in [[Manhattan]] and succeeded [[Martin Amis]] as professor of creative writing at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref name="Colm'sPENwins"/> He was appointed [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Liverpool]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|first=Danuta|last=Kean|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/02/colm-toibin-appointed-chancellor-liverpool-university-author-brooklyn-higher-education|title=Colm Tóibín appointed chancellor of Liverpool University|work=The Guardian|date=2 February 2017|access-date=2 February 2017|location=London}}</ref>

Tóibín was called "a champion of minorities" by [[Arts Council (Ireland)|Arts Council]] director Mary Cloake as Tóibín collected the 2011 Irish PEN Award.<ref>{{cite news|first=Rosita|last=Boland|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0212/1224289634748.html|title=Tóibín on song as he picks up Irish Pen award|work=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=12 February 2011|access-date=12 February 2011}}</ref> That same year [[John Naughton]], of ''[[The Observer]]'', included Tóibín in his list of Britain's three hundred "public figures leading our cultural discourse" — despite Tóibín being Irish.{{refn|group=note|name=Alpha}}

==Early years and lifestyle==
Tóibín was born in 1955 in [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]], in the southeast of Ireland. Tóibín's parents were Bríd and Michael Tóibín.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/9108553/World-of-Colm-Toibin-writer.html|title=The World of Colm Tóibín | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Jessica|last=Salter|date=27 February 2012}} ''The Telegraph'', 27 February 2012.</ref> He is the second youngest of five children. His grandfather, Patrick Tobin, was a member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], as was his grand-uncle Michael Tobin. Patrick Tobin took part in the [[Easter Rising|1916 Rebellion]] in Enniscorthy and was subsequently interned in [[Frongoch]] in Wales. Tóibín's father was a teacher who was involved in the [[Fianna Fáil]] party in Enniscorthy; he died when Colm was 12 years old.

Tóibín grew up in a home where there was, he said, "a great deal of silence".<ref>{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Tóibín|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/colm-toibin-how-i-killed-my-mother|title=Colm Tóibín: writers and their families|work=The Guardian|date=17 February 2012|access-date=17 February 2012|location=London}}</ref> Unable to read until the age of nine, he also developed a stammer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/colm-toibin-by-the-book.html|title=Colm Toibin: By the Book|work=The New York Times|date=1 October 2015|access-date=1 October 2015|location=New York}}</ref> He received his secondary education at [[St Peter's College, Wexford]], where he was a [[Boarding school|boarder]] between 1970 and 1972. He later spoke of finding some of the priests attractive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/austen-was-a-woeful-speller-2400466.html|title=Austen was a woeful speller . . . | work=Irish Independent | date=30 October 2010}} ''Irish Independent''. 30 October 2010. 'Although not abused by priests in the Wexford school he attended, he positively fancied some of them. "Aged 15 or 16," he tells interviewer Susanna Rustin, "I found some of the priests sexually attractive, they had a way about them . . . a sexual allure which is a difficult thing to talk about because it's usually meant to be the opposite way round"'.</ref>

In July 1972, aged 17, he had a summer job as a barman in the Grand Hotel in [[Tramore]], [[County Waterford]], working from six in the evening to two in the morning. He spent his days on the beach, reading ''The Essential Hemingway'', the copy of which he still professes to have, its "pages stained with seawater". The book developed in him a fascination with Spain, led to a wish to visit that country, and gave him "an idea of prose as something glamorous, smart and shaped, and the idea of character in fiction as something oddly mysterious, worthy of sympathy and admiration, but also elusive. And more than anything, the sheer pleasure of the sentences and their rhythms, and the amount of emotion living in what was not said, what was between the words and the sentences."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/17/best-holiday-reads|title=The best holiday reads: Colm Tóibín|work=The Guardian|date=17 June 2011|access-date=17 June 2011|location=London}}</ref>

He went to [[University College Dublin]], graduating in 1975. Immediately after graduation, he left for [[Barcelona]]. Tóibín's first novel, 1990's ''[[The South (novel)|The South]]'', was partly inspired by his time in Barcelona, as was, more directly, his non-fiction ''[[Homage to Barcelona]]'' (1990). Having returned to Ireland in 1978, he began to study for a master's degree. However, he did not submit his thesis and left for a career in journalism.

The early 1980s were an especially bright period in Irish journalism, and the heyday of the monthly news magazine ''[[Magill Magazine|Magill]]''. Tóibín became the magazine's editor in 1982, and remained in the position until 1985. He left due to a dispute with [[Vincent Browne]], ''Magill''{{'}}s managing director. In 1997, when ''[[The New Yorker]]'' asked Tóibín to write about [[Seamus Heaney]] becoming [[President of Ireland]], Tóibín noted that Heaney's popularity could survive the "kiss of death" of an endorsement by [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]]. ''The New Yorker'' telephoned Conor Cruise O'Brien to confirm that this was so, but Cruise O'Brien disagreed and the statement could not be corroborated.<ref>{{cite news|first=R.

==Writing==
Tóibín's 1990 novel ''[[The South (novel)|The South]]'' was followed by ''[[The Heather Blazing]]'' (1992), ''[[The Story of the Night]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Blackwater Lightship]]'' (1999). His fifth novel, ''[[The Master (novel)|The Master]]'' (2004), is a fictional account of portions in the life of author [[Henry James]]. Tóibín is the author of other non-fiction books: ''[[Bad Blood: A Walk Along the Irish Border]]'' (1994), (reprinted from the 1987 original edition) and ''[[The Sign of the Cross (book)|The Sign of the Cross: Travels in Catholic Europe]]'' (1994).

Tóibín has written two short story collections. His first, ''[[Mothers and Sons (book)|Mothers and Sons]]'', which as the name suggests explores the relationship between mothers and their sons, was published in 2006, and was reviewed favourably (including by [[Pico Iyer]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''). His second, broader collection, ''[[The Empty Family]]'', was published in 2010<ref name="The Empty Family Stories">{{cite web|url=http://www.colmtoibin.com/content/empty-family-stories|title=The Empty Family Stories|access-date=21 March 2011}}</ref> and was shortlisted for the 2011 [[Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award]].<ref>Cullen, Conor.

Tóibín's play, ''Beauty in a Broken Place'', was staged in Dublin in August 2004. He has continued to work as a journalist, both in Ireland and abroad, writing for the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' among other publications. He has also achieved a reputation as a literary critic: he has edited a book on [[Paul Durcan]], ''The Kilfenora Teaboy'' (1997), and ''The Penguin Book of Irish Fiction'' (1999); and has written ''The Modern Library: The 200 Best Novels in English since 1950'' (1999), with [[Carmen Callil]].  He has also written a collection of essays, ''[[Love in a Dark Time|Love in a Dark Time: Gay Lives from Wilde to Almodóvar]]'' (2002), and a study on [[Lady Gregory]], ''Lady Gregory's Toothbrush'' (2002).

Tóibín sent a photograph of [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] to [[Don DeLillo]], who described it as "the face of Borges against a dark background—Borges fierce, blind, his nostrils gaping, his skin stretched taut, his mouth amazingly vivid; his mouth looks painted; he's like a shaman painted for visions, and the whole face has a kind of steely rapture". DeLillo often seeks inspiration from it.<ref>{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Begley|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1887/the-art-of-fiction-no-135-don-delillo|title=Don DeLillo, The Art of Fiction No. 135|work=The Paris Review}}</ref>

In 2011, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' published his poem "Cush Gap, 2007".<ref name="Colm Toibin the poet">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/toibin-tries-his-hand-at-poetry-2678604.html|title=Toibin tries his hand at poetry . . . | work=Irish Independent | date=18 June 2011}} ''Irish Independent''.

In 2015, ahead of the Marriage Equality referendum, Tóibín delivered a talk titled "The Embrace of Love: Being Gay in Ireland Now" in [[Trinity Hall, Dublin|Trinity Hall]], featuring [[Roger Casement]]'s diaries, the work of [[Oscar Wilde]], [[John Broderick (writer)|John Broderick]] and [[Kate O'Brien (novelist)|Kate O'Brien]], and [[David Norris (politician)|Senator David Norris]]'s 1980s High Court battles.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kirsty|last=Blake Knox|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum/gay-people-have-a-right-to-ritualise-and-copperfasten-their-love-tibn-31224190.html|title='Gay people have a right to ritualise and copper-fasten their love' - Tóibín|work=Irish Independent|date=15 May 2015}}</ref> In the same year, he released ''[[On Elizabeth Bishop]]'', a critical study which made ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Best Books of 2015 list twice.<ref>{{cite web|title=On Elizabeth Bishop Colm Tóibín|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10425.html|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=28 December 2015}}</ref>

Tóibín is a member of [[Aosdána]] and has been visiting professor at [[Stanford University]], [[The University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Princeton University]]. He has also lectured at several other universities, including [[Middlebury College]], [[Boston College]], [[New York University]], [[Loyola University Maryland]], and [[The College of the Holy Cross]]. In 2017 he lectured in Athens, Georgia as the [[University of Georgia]] Chair for Global Understanding.<ref>Butschek,H. (2017). Author of 'Brooklyn' coming for 3 days of events in Athens.

Tóibín has said his writing comes out of silence. He does not favour story and does not view himself as storyteller. He has said, "Ending a novel is almost like putting a child to sleep – it can't be done abruptly."<ref name=portrait_of_the_artist>{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Barnett|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/19/colm-toibin-novelist-portrait-artist|title=Colm Tóibín, novelist – portrait of the artist|work=The Guardian|date=19 February 2013|access-date=19 February 2013|location=London}}</ref>

When working on a first draft he covers only the right-hand side of the page; later he carries out some rewriting on the left-hand side of the page. He keeps a word processor in another room on which to transfer writing at a later time.<ref>{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Tóibín|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/13/writers.rooms.colm.toibin#|title=Writers' rooms: Colm Tóibín|work=The Guardian|date=13 July 2007|access-date=22 September 2021|location=London}}</ref>

==Themes==
Tóibín's work explores several main lines: the depiction of Irish society, living abroad, the process of creativity, and the preservation of a personal identity, focusing especially on homosexual identities, but also on identity when confronted with loss. The "Wexford" novels, ''[[The Heather Blazing]]'' and ''[[The Blackwater Lightship]]'', use [[Enniscorthy]], the town of Tóibín's birth, as narrative material, together with the history of Ireland and the death of his father. An autobiographical account and reflection on this episode can be found in the non-fiction book, ''[[The Sign of the Cross (book)|The Sign of the Cross]]''. In 2009, he published ''[[Brooklyn (novel)|Brooklyn]]'', a tale of a woman emigrating to [[Brooklyn]] from Enniscorthy; characters from that novel also appear in Nora Webster, in which the young character of Donal seems to have been part-based on Colm's own childhood.

Two other novels, ''[[The Story of the Night]]'' and ''[[The Master (novel)|The Master]]'', revolve around characters who have to deal with a homosexual identity and take place outside Ireland for the most part, with a character having to cope with living abroad. His first novel, ''[[The South (novel)|The South]]'', seems to have ingredients of both lines of work. It can be read together with ''The Heather Blazing'' as a [[diptych]] of [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] heritages in [[County Wexford]], or it can be grouped with the "living abroad" novels. A third topic that links ''The South'' and ''The Heather Blazing'' is that of creation, of painting in the first case and of the careful wording of a judge's verdict in the second. This third thematic line culminated in ''The Master'', a study on identity, preceded by a non-fiction book on the same subject, ''[[Love in a Dark Time]]''. The book of short stories "Mothers and Sons" deals with family themes, both in Ireland and [[Catalonia]], and homosexuality.

Tóibín has written about gay sex in several novels, though ''Brooklyn'' contains a heterosexual sex scene in which the heroine loses her virginity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/sex-disappearing-from-novels|title=Let's not talk about sex – why passion is waning in British books|work=The Guardian|date=16 October 2010|access-date=16 October 2010|location=London|first=Susanna|last=Rustin}}</ref> In his 2012 essay collection ''New Ways to Kill Your Mother: Writers and Their Families'' he studies the biographies of [[James Baldwin]], [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], and [[W. B. Yeats]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tessa|last=Hadley|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/22/new-ways-kill-mother-colm-toibin-review|title=New Ways to Kill Your Mother by Colm Tóibín – review|work=The Guardian|date=22 February 2012|access-date=27 March 2012|location=London}}</ref>

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=note|refs=
{{refn|group=note|name=Alpha|This loose list quickly became somewhat discredited on account of numerous flagrant inaccuracies and anomalous inclusions (it even included [[Alan Rusbridger]], the then editor-in-chief of ''The Observer''{{'}}s [[The Guardian|sister title]]), and a correction was printed the following Sunday, noting that several of those included "would not claim to be British" (most notably [[Seamus Heaney]] and Tóibín), correcting misspelled, and even incorrect, names - e.g. "Andrew (not Anthony)", "David (not Derek)" -, while one inclusion was discovered in the course of that week to have been dead since 1995.<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Naughton|author-link=John Naughton|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/may/08/top-300-british-intellectuals|title=Britain's top 300 intellectuals|work=[[The Observer]]|date=8 May 2011}}</ref>}}
