==Life and career==
Philip Pullman was born in [[Norwich]], England, the son of Audrey Evelyn Pullman (née Merrifield) and [[Royal Air Force]] pilot [[Alfred Pullman|Alfred Outram Pullman]]. The family travelled with his father's job, including to [[Southern Rhodesia]], though most of his formative years were spent in [[Llanbedr]] in [[Ardudwy]], [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/0/21672648|title=Philip Pullman: How Wales inspired his life and work|date=18 March 2013|access-date=20 March 2013|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

When Pullman was seven, his father, an RAF pilot, was killed in a plane crash in 1954 in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], being posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC). In an exchange with a journalist in 2008, Pullman said that, as a boy, he saw his father as "a hero, steeped in glamour, killed in action defending his country", and who had been "training pilots". Pullman was then presented with a report from ''[[The London Gazette]]'' of 1954 "which carried the official RAF news of the day [and] said that the medal was given for 'gallant and distinguished service' during the [[Mau Mau uprising]]. 'The main task of the [[North American T-6 Texan|Harvards]] [the aircraft flown by his father's unit] had been bombing and machine-gunning Mau Mau and their hideouts in densely wooded and difficult country.' This included 'diving steeply into the gorges of [various] rivers, often in conditions of low cloud and driving rain.' Testing conditions, yes, but not much opposition from the enemy, the journalist in the exchange continued. Very few of the Mau Mau had guns that could land a blow on an aircraft."

Responding to that new information, Pullman wrote: "My father probably doesn't come out of this with very much credit, judged by the standards of modern liberal progressive thought", and he accepted the revelation as "a serious challenge to his childhood memory."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moreton |first1=Cole |title=The death and absence of his father has informed so much of the fiction written by this highly acclaimed author over the years, but he has never known – or wanted to know – the truth about what really happened.

His mother remarried the following year and, following a move to North Wales, Pullman discovered comic books, including ''[[Superman]]'' and ''[[Batman]]'', a medium which he continues to enjoy.

In his early years, Pullman attended [[Taverham Hall School]] and [[The Eaton House Group of Schools|Eaton House]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-i-wore-a-trilby-to-school-63720.html|title=Passed/Failed: 'I wore a trilby to school'|last=Sale|first=Jonathan|date=11 March 2004|work=The Independent|access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref> and, from 1957, he was educated at [[Ysgol Ardudwy]] in [[Harlech]], [[Gwynedd]], spending time in [[Norfolk]] with his grandfather, a clergyman. Around that time, Pullman discovered [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which would become a major influence for ''His Dark Materials''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/0/21672648|title=BBC Arts & Culture – Philip Pullman: How Wales inspired his life and work|work=BBC Arts & Culture}}</ref>

From 1965, Pullman attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]], receiving a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Third-class honours|Third-class]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cherwell.org/content/8873 |title=University of Oxford, Cherwell newspaper Interviews: Philip Pullman |access-date=2 August 2009 |date=2 September 2009 |publisher=Cherwell |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613052154/http://www.cherwell.org/content/8873 |archive-date=13 June 2009 }}</ref> In an interview with the ''Oxford Student'', he noted that he "did not really enjoy the English course", and that "I thought I was doing quite well until I came out with my third class degree and then I realised that I wasn't – it was the year they stopped giving fourth class degrees otherwise I'd have got one of those".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordstudent.com/tt2006wk7/Features/growing_pains |title=Growing Pains – Features – The Oxford Student – Official Student Newspaper |access-date=29 March 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216122358/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/tt2006wk7/Features/growing_pains |archive-date=16 December 2008 }}</ref> He discovered [[William Blake]]'s illustrations around 1970, which would also influence him greatly.

Pullman married Judith Speller in 1970, they went on to have two sons together.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-11-30|title=Profile: Phillip Pullman|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/30/film.books|access-date=2021-11-10|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> At the time of his marriage he began teaching children aged 9 to 13 at Bishop Kirk Middle School in [[Summertown, Oxford|Summertown, North Oxford]], as well as writing school plays. 

His first published work was ''[[The Haunted Storm]]'', which was joint-winner of the New English Library's Young Writer's Award in 1972, but which he refuses to discuss.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/12/allure-of-the-first-novel “The allure of the first novel” ''The Guardian'' Retrieved 5 November 2019</ref> ''Galatea'', an adult fantasy-fiction novel, followed in 1978, but it was his school plays which inspired his first children's book, ''Count Karlstein'', in 1982. He stopped teaching shortly after the publication of his second children's book, ''The Ruby in the Smoke'' (1986), which has a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] setting.

Between 1988 and 1996, Pullman taught part-time at [[Westminster College, Oxford]], continuing to write children's stories. He began ''His Dark Materials'' in about 1993. The first book, ''Northern Lights'', was published in 1995 (entitled ''The Golden Compass'' in the U.S., 1996). Pullman won both the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]]<ref name=medal1995/> and the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a similar award that authors may not win twice.<ref name=relaunch>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/12/guardianchildrensfictionprize2001.guardianchildrensfictionprize "Guardian children's fiction prize relaunched: Entry details and list of past winners"].

In 2005, Pullman won the annual [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] from the Swedish Arts Council, recognising his career contribution to "children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense". According to the presentation, "Pullman radically injects new life into fantasy by introducing a variety of alternative worlds and by allowing good and evil to become ambiguous." In every genre, "he combines storytelling and psychological insight of the highest order."<ref name=alma2005>

==''His Dark Materials''==
{{Main|His Dark Materials}}

''His Dark Materials'' is a trilogy consisting of ''[[Northern Lights (Pullman novel)|Northern Lights]]'' (titled ''The Golden Compass'' in North America), ''[[The Subtle Knife]]'' and ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]''. ''Northern Lights'' won the Carnegie Medal for children's fiction in the UK in 1995. ''The Amber Spyglass'' was awarded both 2001 [[Whitbread Book Awards|Whitbread Prize]] for best children's book and the Whitbread Book of the Year prize in January 2002, the first children's book to receive that award. The series won popular acclaim in late 2003, taking third place in the [[BBC]]'s [[Big Read]] poll. Pullman has written two companion pieces to the trilogy, ''[[Lyra's Oxford]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the North]]''. He refers to a third, which will expand his character [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], as the "green book".

Another trilogy, ''The Book of Dust'', includes characters and events from the ''His Dark Materials''. Pullman has said that the new series is neither sequel, nor prequel, but an "equel".<ref name="Gdn26May17">{{cite news |last1=Kean |first1=Danuta |title=Philip Pullman offers first look at His Dark Materials follow-up The Book of Dust |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/26/philip-pullman-offers-first-look-at-his-dark-materials-follow-up-the-book-of-dust |work=The Guardian |date=26 May 2017|access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref> The first book, ''[[La Belle Sauvage]]'', was published in October 2017 and the second book, ''[[The Secret Commonwealth]]'', in October 2019.

Pullman has narrated unabridged audiobooks of the three novels in the ''His Dark Materials'' trilogy; the other parts are read by actors, including [[Jo Wyatt]], [[Steven Webb]], Peter England, [[Stephen Thorne]] and [[Douglas Blackwell]].

In a discussion on fantasy as escapism, Pullman admitted he never reads fantasy as "it's not satisfying". He then went on to argue that he sees ''His Dark Materials'' as "stark realism", not fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pullman|first=Philip|title=The Great Escape|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-great-escape|access-date=21 January 2014}}</ref>

==Public campaigns==
Pullman has been a vocal campaigner on a number of book-related and political issues.

===Age and gender labelling of books===
In 2008, Pullman led a campaign against the introduction of age bands on the covers of children's books, saying: "It's based on a one-dimensional view of growth, which regards growing older as moving along a line like a monkey climbing a stick: now you're seven, so you read these books; and now you're nine so you read these."<ref name="Oxford Mail 10 June 2008">{{cite news |last=Merrill |first=Jamie |title= Author sets up book cover protest |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/2332328.Author_sets_up_book_cover_protest_/|access-date=2 December 2014|newspaper= Oxford Mail |location= Oxford |date=10 June 2008}}</ref> More than 1,200 authors, booksellers, illustrators, librarians and teachers joined the campaign; Pullman's own publisher, [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], agreed to his request not to put the age bands on his book covers. Joel Rickett, deputy editor of ''[[The Bookseller]]'', said: "The steps taken by Mr Pullman and other authors have taken the industry by surprise and I think these proposals are now in the balance."<ref name="Oxford Mail 10 June 2008"/>

In 2014, Pullman supported the [[Let Books Be Books]] campaign to stop children's books being labelled as "for girls" or "for boys", saying: "I'm against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in. No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves."<ref name="The Guardian 16 March 2014">{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |title= Campaign to end gender-specific children's books gathers support |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/campaign-gender-children-publishing-waterstones-malorie-blackman |access-date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 March 2013}}</ref>

===Civil liberties===
Pullman has a strong commitment to traditional British civil liberties and is noted for his criticism of growing state authority and government encroachment into everyday life. In February 2009, he was the keynote speaker at the Convention on Modern Liberty in London<ref>[http://www.modernliberty.net/2009/philip-pullmans-keynote The Convention on Modern Liberty]. Modernliberty.net (28 February 2009).

BBC News (16 July 2009). Retrieved 2 January 2012.</ref>

===Public jury===
In July 2011, Pullman was one of the lead campaigners signing a declaration that called for a 1,000-strong "public jury", selected at random, to draw up a "public interest first" test to ensure that power was taken away from "remote interest groups". The declaration was also signed by 56 academics, writers, trade unionists and politicians from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].<ref name="The Guardian 31 July 2011">{{cite news |last= Watt |first= Nicholas |title= Public jury campaign launched to take power away from UK's 'feral' elite |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/31/public-jury-campaign-feral-elite|access-date=2 December 2014 |newspaper= The Guardian |location=London |date=31 July 2011}}</ref>

===Library closures===
In October 2011, Pullman backed a campaign to stop 600 library closures in England, calling it a "war against stupidity". [[London Borough of Brent]] claimed that it was closing half of its libraries to fulfil its "exciting plans" to improve its library service. Pullman said: "All the time, you see, the council had been longing to improve the library service, and the only thing standing in the way was – the libraries."<ref name="The Guardian 24 October 2011">{{cite news |last= Flood |first= Alison |title= Philip Pullman declares war against 'stupidity' of library closures |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/24/philip-pullman-library-closures|access-date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian|location=London |date=24 October 2011}}</ref>
Speaking at a conference organised by The Library Campaign and [[Public library advocacy#UK advocacy organizations|Voices for the Library]], he added: <blockquote>The book is second only to the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.<ref name="The Guardian 24 October 2011"/></blockquote>

===Ebook library loans===
In advance of becoming president of the [[Society of Authors]] in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for [[E-book|ebook]] library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: <blockquote>New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, for all kinds of reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.<ref name="The Guardian 12 June 2013">{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |title= Philip Pullman: 'Authors must be paid fairly for ebook library loans' |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/12/philip-pullman-ebook-loan-campaign |access-date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 June 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

===William Blake's cottage and memorial stone===
As a long-time enthusiast of [[William Blake]], and president of the Blake Society, Pullman led a campaign in 2014 to buy the Sussex cottage where the poet lived between 1800 and 1803, saying: <blockquote>Surely it isn't beyond the resources of a nation that can spend enormous amounts of money on acts of folly and unnecessary warfare, a nation that likes to boast about its literary heritage, to find the money to pay for a proper memorial and a centre for the study of this great poet and artist. Not least because this is the place where he wrote the words now often sung as an alternative (and better) national anthem, the poem known as [[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]: "And did those feet in ancient time". Blake's feet walked in [[Felpham]]. Let's not let this opportunity pass by.<ref name="Guardian 28 November 2014">{{cite news |last= Flood |first= Alison |title= Time is running out for campaign to buy William Blake's home |url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/28/time-running-out-on-william-blake-society-campaign-to-buy-cottage|access-date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=28 November 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

As president of the Blake Society, on 11 August 2018, Pullman inaugurated Blake's new memorial gravestone on the site of his grave in [[Bunhill Fields]], following a long campaign by the society.<ref>{{cite web | last=Tapper | first=James | title=How amateur sleuths finally tracked down the burial place of William Blake | website=The Guardian | date=2018-08-11 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/11/how-amateur-sleuths-finally-tracked-down-burial-place-william-blake | access-date=2020-06-27}}</ref>

===Fees for guest authors at book festivals===
In January 2016, Pullman resigned as patron of the Oxford Literary Festival after five years, saying that its continued refusal to pay authors fees for appearing as guest speakers at the event placed him in an "awkward position" because it conflicted with his presidency of the [[Society of Authors]], which campaigns for authors to be paid for appearing at book festivals. He made the announcement on Twitter, saying that he had made lengthy attempts to persuade the Festival to pay authors, "but they won't. Time to go". Reporting Pullman's decision, UK daily newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' noted: "The Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society found in 2014 that the average earnings of a professional full-time author is just £11,000."<ref name="Independent 14 January 2016">{{cite news |last= Clark |first= Nick |title= Philip Pullman quits as Oxford Literary Festival refuses to pay its guest authors|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/philip-pullman-quits-as-oxford-literary-festival-refuses-to-pay-its-guest-authors-a6813066.html|date= 14 January 2016|newspaper= [[The Independent]] |location=London|access-date=15 January 2016 }}</ref>

===Boycott of Brexit 50p coin===
In January 2020, Pullman called for literate people to boycott the newly minted [[Brexit]] [[Fifty pence (British coin)|50p coin]] due to the omission of the [[Oxford comma]] in its slogan "Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations".  The viewpoint was supported by some, while [[lexicographer]] [[Susie Dent]] indicated it was optional and Baroness [[Joan Bakewell|Bakewell]] said she had been "taught that it was wrong to use the comma in such circumstances".<ref name="Oxford-C-BBC">{{cite news|author=Staff|date=27 January 2020|title=Sir Philip Pullman calls for 50p boycott over Oxford comma|access-date=27 January 2020|website=BBC|url-status=live|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51269012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127185508/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51269012|archive-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>

== Perspective on religion ==
Although Pullman has stated he is "a [[Church of England]] [[Atheism|atheist]], and a [[Book of Common Prayer|1662 Book of Common Prayer]] atheist, because that's the tradition I was brought up in",<ref name="atheist01" /> he has also said he is technically an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].<ref name="agnostic01" /> He has singled out elements of Christianity for criticism: "if there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against."<ref name="agnostic01">{{cite web |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/upfront/2007/sympathyforthedevil.aspx |title=Sympathy for the Devil by Adam R.

On 15 September 2010, Pullman, along with 54 other public figures (including [[Stephen Fry]], Professor [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Terry Pratchett]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Ken Follett]]), signed an open letter published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] being given "the honour of a state visit" to the UK; the letter argued that the Pope had led and condoned global abuses of human rights, leading a state which has "resisted signing many major human rights treaties and has formed its own treaties ("concordats") with many states which negatively affect the human rights of citizens of those states".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=''The Guardian'': Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=16 September 2010 |location=London |date=15 September 2010}}</ref>

''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' journalist Laura Miller described Pullman as one of England's most outspoken [[atheist]]s.<ref name=atheist01>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226fa_fact|title=Far From Narnia|access-date=31 October 2007|author=Miller, Laura|format=Life and Letters article|magazine=The New Yorker|quote=he is one of England's most outspoken atheists. ...

When he finally acknowledges that “the religions are special cases of the general human tendency to exalt one doctrine above all others,” it comes across less as a reconsideration of his views than as a grudging concession. There are no reports of Pullman’s plans to write a sequel to His Dark Materials in which the attempt to build an earthly Republic of Heaven ends in firing squads and gulags.}}</ref>

Alan Jacobs (of [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]) said that in ''His Dark Materials'' Pullman replaced the [[theist]] world-view of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' with a [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauist]] one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mhadigital.org/index.php?post_id=274993|title=Mars Hill Audio – Audition – Program 10|access-date=13 November 2007}}</ref> The books in the series have been criticised for their attitude to religion, especially Catholicism, by the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1342 |title="The Golden Compass" Sparks Protest |publisher=Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919000756/http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1342 |archive-date=19 September 2011 }}</ref> and [[Focus on the Family]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000005672.cfm |title=Golden Compass Reveals a World Where There is No God |author=Jennifer Mesko |publisher=Focus on the Family citizenlink.com |access-date=7 December 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011211304/http://citizenlink.org/content/A000005672.cfm |archive-date=11 October 2007 }}</ref>

Writing in the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' in 1999, Leonie Caldecott cited Pullman's work as an example of fiction "far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry [Potter]" on the grounds that <blockquote>"[by] co-opting Catholic terminology and playing with Judaeo-Christian theological concepts, Pullman is effectively removing, among a mass audience of a highly impressionable age, some of the building blocks for future evangelisation".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/29th-october-1999/7/the-stuff-of-nightmares|title=The stuff of nightmares|date=29 October 1999|access-date=15 January 2014|author=Caldecott, Leonie|newspaper=Catholic Herald}}</ref> </blockquote>Pullman was flattered and asked his publisher to include quotes from Caldecott's article in his next book.<ref name="Vanity Fair" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surefish.co.uk/culture/features/pullman_interview.htm|title=A dark agenda?|date=November 2002|access-date=15 January 2014|publisher=surefish.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511153018/http://www.surefish.co.uk/culture/features/pullman_interview.htm|archive-date=11 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2002, the ''Catholic Herald'' published an article by Sarah Johnson that compared Pullman to a "playground bully" whose work "attacks a religious minority".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/1st-february-2002/10/closing-childrens-minds|title=Closing children's minds|date=1 February 2002|access-date=15 January 2014|author=Johnson, Sarah|newspaper=Catholic Herald|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116104508/http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/1st-february-2002/10/closing-childrens-minds|archive-date=16 January 2014}}</ref> The following year, after [[Benedict Allen]]'s reference to the criticism during the BBC TV series ''[[The Big Read]]'', the ''Catholic Herald'' republished both articles and Caldecott claimed her "bonfire" comment was a joke and accused Pullman and his supporters of quoting her out of context.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/26th-december-2003/3/challenge-to-bbc-over-book-allegation|title=Challenge to BBC over book allegation|date=26 December 2003|access-date=15 January 2014|author=Farrell, Christina|newspaper=Catholic Herald|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218074222/http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/26th-december-2003/3/challenge-to-bbc-over-book-allegation|archive-date=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/26th-december-2003/5/the-big-read-and-the-big-lie|title=The Big Read and the big lie|date=26 December 2003|access-date=15 January 2014|author=Caldecott, Leonie|newspaper=Catholic Herald}}</ref> In a longer article for ''[[Touchstone (magazine)|Touchstone]]'' magazine earlier in 2003, Caldecott had also described Pullman's work as "axe-grinding" and "a kind of Luciferian enterprise".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-08-042-f|title=Paradise Denied – Philip Pullman & the Uses & Abuses of Enchantment|date=October 2003|access-date=15 January 2014|author=Caldecott, Leonie|work=Touchstone Magazine}}</ref>

Columnist [[Peter Hitchens]], in a 2002 article for ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', accused Pullman of "killing god" and described him as "the most dangerous author in Britain" because he said in an interview: "I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief."

In a 2017 interview with ''The Times Magazine'', Pullman said: "The place religion has in our lives is a permanent one." He concluded that there was "no point in condemning [religion]", and mused that it is part of the human mind to ask philosophical questions such as the purpose of life. He reiterated that it was useless to "become censorious about [religion], to say there is no God'. He also mentioned that his novel, ''The Book of Dust'', is based on the "extreme danger of putting power into the hands of those who believe in some absolute creed, whether that is Christianity or Islam or Marxism".<ref>Wilson, Fiona (8 July 2017).
