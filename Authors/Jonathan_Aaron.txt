==Reviews==
<blockquote>“Dreaming is after all a kind of thinking,” Jonathan Aaron writes in this new volume, his third in almost 25 years, and it’s hard to imagine a more succinct statement of his poetic method. Aaron has always used the peculiar instability of poems to his advantage: he builds tension from a poem’s ability to slip on no more than a phrase from the real to the symbolic, from the hypothetical to the unalterable.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://bostonreview.net/BR32.1/microreviews.php| title=Poetry Microreviews| date=January–February 2007| journal=Boston Review }}</ref></blockquote>
