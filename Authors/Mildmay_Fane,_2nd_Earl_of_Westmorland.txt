'''Mildmay Fane, 2nd Earl of Westmorland''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|KB}} (24 January 1602 – 12 February 1666), styled '''Lord le Despenser''' between 1624 and 1628,<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Mosley|editor1-first=Charles|title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, Vol. III|date=2003|publisher=Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd|location=Wilmington, Delaware|page=4134|edition=107th}}</ref> was an [[England|English]] nobleman, politician, and writer.<ref>Gerald W. Morton, ''A Biography of Mildmay Fane, Second Earl of Westmorland 1601&ndash;66: The Unknown Cavalier'', Lewiston/Queenston/Lampeter, Edwin Mellen, 1991.</ref>

==Life==
One of seven sons of [[Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland|Francis Fane]] by his wife  [[Mary Mildmay]], granddaughter of Sir [[Walter Mildmay]], Mildmay Fane was born in Kent and educated at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] (matriculated 1618).<ref>{{acad|id=FN618M|name=Fane, Mildmay}}</ref>  He became [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] in 1620 and for [[Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent]] in 1625.  He succeeded his father as Earl of Westmorland and Lord le Despenser on 23 March 1629

A friend of [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], he supported the Royalist party at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] (King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had stood as godfather to Fane's eldest son in 1635). Following a brief period of imprisonment by Parliament, however, he retired to his estate at [[Apethorpe Palace]] in [[Northamptonshire]].

==Writing==
[[File:Mildmay Fane in oils.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait in oils of Mildmay Fane, wearing the sash of the [[Order of the Bath]].]]
One hundred and thirty seven poems by Fane appeared in his self-published collection ''Otia Sacra'' in 1648—the first time a peer of England published his own verse. It was only at the end of the twentieth century that a larger body of Fane's verse was identified: some 500 poems by Fane, composed between 1621 and 1665, were published in 2001.<ref>Tom Cain, ed., ''The Poems of Mildmay Fane, Second Earl of Westmorland: from the Fulbeck, Harvard, and Westmorland Manuscripts'', Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2001.</ref> The poems survived in manuscript collections preserved at [[Fulbeck Hall]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]], and the Westmorland papers preserved at the Northamptonshire Record Office.

Fane also wrote [[masque]]s and stage plays; six of these "politicized entertainments" were performed at Apethorpe during the decade of the 1640s by Fane's children and servants. For his 1641 masque ''Candia Restaurata'', Fane designed sets and stage effects and composed some of the music used in the production. ''Virtue's Triumph'' features personifications of Ambition and Impudence, Lies and Deceits; Nobility and Learning are married and the parents of Truth. The protagonist of ''De Pugna Animi'' is Lord Mens (Mind), who is assisted by figures like Sir Ratio Prudens in resisting a revolt of the five senses.<ref>Dale B. J. Randall, ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&ndash;1660''. Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995; pp. 286-8.</ref> Fane wrote his play ''The Change'' during his imprisonment in the [[Tower of London]] early in the Civil War. One of his plays, titled ''Ladrones'', was known in manuscript in the 19th century and reportedly featured Sir [[Francis Drake]], [[Thomas Cavendish]], and [[Ferdinand Magellan]] as characters; but the MS. has been lost.<ref>Cain, p. 27.</ref> Fane's total extant literary output includes over 900 poems in English and Latin, and eight plays or entertainments.

==Family==
[[File:Portrait of Mary Vere, Lady Townshend (c.1611-1669); from 1638, Countess of Westmorland.jpg|thumb|left|Mary de Vere, Countess of Westmorland]]
Fane married twice: firstly, in 1620, to Grace Thornhurst, daughter of Sir William Thornhurst of Kent, with whom he had a son and five daughters; and secondly to Mary, daughter of [[Horace Lord Vere of Tillsbury]], who bore him a son and four daughters, one of whom was [[Lady Mary Fane]] who married firstly Francis Palmes of Ashwell, Rutland, granddaughter of Sir [[Guy Palmes]], and was widowed with no children.  She married secondly John Cecil, 4th Earl of Exeter (1628–1678), a widower, on 24 January 1670. Mildmay's first son [[Charles Fane, 3rd Earl of Westmorland|Charles]], and his second son [[Vere Fane, 4th Earl of Westmorland|Vere]], both succeeded to their father's title in turn (since Charles Fane, 3rd Earl left no descendants).

Mildmay Fane's younger brother Sir [[Francis Fane (Royalist)|Francis Fane]] married Elizabeth West, daughter of William West of Firbeck Hall, Yorkshire, and widow of John, Lord Darcy of the North. Sir Francis Fane achieved some distinction as a writer, publishing poetry as well as three dramatic plays. He was made Knight of the Bath at the Coronation of Charles I, and served as governor of Doncaster Castle during the English civil war. [[Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath#His Wife|Rachael Fane]] (1613–1680), one of Mildmay Fane's seven sisters and a resident of [[Apethorpe Palace]], also wrote entertainments and a masque that were performed by the household. Her works survive in manuscript.<ref>Caroline Bowden, "The Notebooks of Rachael Fane: Education or Authorship?," in: ''Early Modern Women's Manuscript Writing,'' edited by Victoria E. Burke and Jonathan Gibson; London, Ashgate, 2004; pp. 157-80.</ref> Another younger brother was the Royalist and MP [[George Fane|Colonel the Hon. George Fane]].
