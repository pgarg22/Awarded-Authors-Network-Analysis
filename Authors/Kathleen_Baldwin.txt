==Biography==
Award-winning author<ref>http://www.kathleenbaldwin.com</ref> Kathleen Baldwin was born and raised in [[Arizona]], and moved 14 times before high school.  The constant moving allowed her to meet many different people from many different backgrounds and areas.<ref name="sova">{{cite web  | last = Sova  | first = Cathy  | title = New Faces 160: Kathleen Baldwin  | publisher = The Romance Reader  | year = 2003  | url = http://www.theromancereader.com/nf-baldwin.html  | access-date = 2007-04-10  | url-status = dead  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711173856/http://www.theromancereader.com/nf-baldwin.html  | archive-date = July 11, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}</ref> She gained a love of reading from her mother, who often read her poems and classic stories before bedtime.  Her grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and great-aunts frequently related stories as well, so that a young Baldwin believed that women in general were supposed to tell stories.  A voracious reader, Baldwin read at a level beyond her years, and was often excused from English classes to read on her own or to write down her own

stories.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|title=Bio |publisher=Kathleen Baldwin Official Website |url=http://www.kathleenbaldwin.com/bio.html |access-date=2007-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708061348/http://www.kathleenbaldwin.com/bio.html |archive-date=July 8, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Art and Design, Baldwin worked as a [[freelance]] artist for several years, designing models for toys while raising her children.  During her early years of writing, Baldwin was able to have some of her nonfiction and poetry published, but continually received rejection notices for her fiction submissions.  She quit her freelance work to concentrate on her writing and joined the [[Romance Writers of America]].  Finally, after 63 rejection notices, Baldwin found a receptive editor at Kensington Books who purchased her novel, ''Lady Fiasco'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wishbonegraphics.com/adminnm/templates/pp-author.asp?articleid=652&zoneid=12 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-04-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114122440/http://www.wishbonegraphics.com/adminnm/templates/pp-author.asp?articleid=652&zoneid=12 |archive-date=November 14, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> a "Regency Romantic Comedy".<ref name="sova"/> The editor requested several more novels, and Baldwin was given a deadline of less than a year to complete two more novels and a novella.<ref name="boykin"/>

Baldwin is married. She and her husband, Brett, have four children, three boys and a girl.<ref name="bio"/>  She and her family live in [[Texas]]. From 2011– 2012 Kathleen served as President-Elect and President of [[Dallas]] Area Romance Authors.<ref name="boykin">{{cite web| last =Boykin| first =Cindy| title =Kathleen Baldwin| publisher =Plano Profile| date =July 2005| url =http://www.wishbonegraphics.com/adminnm/templates/pp-author.asp?articleid=652&zoneid=12| access-date =2007-04-10| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20061114122440/http://www.wishbonegraphics.com/adminnm/templates/pp-author.asp?articleid=652&zoneid=12| archive-date =November 14, 2006| df =mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Dallas Area romance Authors Newsletters (members only) http://www.rwa.org/p/do/sd/sid=2129&type=0</ref>
