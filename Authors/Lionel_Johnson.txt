'''Lionel Pigot Johnson''' (15 March 1867 – 4 October 1902) was an English poet, essayist, and critic.

==Life==
Johnson was born in [[Broadstairs]], [[Kent]], England in 1867 and educated at [[Winchester College]].  While at Winchester, Johnson became friends with [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell]].  The two started a lengthy religious discussion that Russell later published as ''Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson'' (1919).

Johnson graduated from [[New College, Oxford]], in 1890 and converted to Catholicism in June 1891.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lionel Pigot Johnson}}</ref> At that time, Johnson introduced [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] to his friend [[Oscar Wilde]]. He later repudiated Wilde in "The Destroyer of a Soul" (1892), deeply regretting that he initiated a love affair between the two men that devolved into a public scandal.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Fisher|title=Oscar and Bosie|publisher=Sutton Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0-7509-2459-4|pages=42–3}}</ref>

In 1893, Johnson published what some consider his greatest work, "Dark Angel". During his lifetime, he published: ''The Art of Thomas Hardy'' (1894), ''Poems'' (1895), and ''Ireland and Other Poems'' (1897). Johnson was a member of the [[Rhymers' Club]], and cousin to [[Olivia Shakespear]] (who dedicated her novel ''The False Laurel'' to him). 

Johnson died of a "[[cerebral haemorrhage]]" [Inquest, October 8, 1902]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asch|first=Robert|url=http://www.saintaustinpress.com/lionel-johnson-poetry-and-prose-robert-asch|title=Lionel Johnson: Poetry and Prose|publisher=Saint Austin Press|year=2021|isbn=978-1919673004|location=Kington|pages=488}}</ref> in 1902, after collapsing in the ''Green Dragon'' on [[Fleet Street]] in London<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Matthew Sweet (writer)|first=Matthew|last=Sweet|title=Inventing the Victorians|location=London|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=2001|isbn=978-0-571-20663-6|page=205}}</ref> The story of Johnson's being struck and killed by a [[hansom cab]] is a myth.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asch|first=Robert|url=http://www.saintaustinpress.com/lionel-johnson-poetry-and-prose-robert-asch|title=Lionel Johnson: Poetry and Prose|publisher=Saint Austin Press|year=2021|isbn=978-1919673004|location=Kington|pages=61-64, 488-496}}</ref>
