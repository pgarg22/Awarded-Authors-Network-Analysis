'''Christopher Royston George Ellis''' (born 10 February 1941), known as '''Royston Ellis''', is an English novelist, travel writer and erstwhile beat poet.

==Biography==
Born in [[Pinner]], Ellis was educated at the Harrow County School for Boys in Middlesex until he left aged 16, determined to be a writer. Two years later, his first book, ''Jiving to Gyp'', a sequence of poems, was published.  He performed his poetry on stage and TV to backing by [[Cliff Richard]]'s original group, [[the Shadows]], as well as [[Jimmy Page]],<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVi6rMo2Ppo</ref>{{cn|date=May 2019}} and featured in a 1960 TV documentary, ''Living for Kicks'', presented by [[Daniel Farson]], which brought him to national attention and controversy through his remarks on teenage lifestyle, and as a spokesman of his generation.<ref name=bragg>{{cite book|last=Bragg|first=Billy|date=2017|title=Roots, Radicals and Rockers: How Skiffle Changed the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5EBHDgAAQBAJ&q=bragg+rockers|location=London|publisher=Faber & Faber|pages=382–384|isbn=978-0-571-32775-1 |author-link=Billy Bragg }}</ref>

He wrote two books in 1959 and 1961 about touring with Cliff Richard and The Shadows, republished in 2014 by Tomahawk Press as a rock and roll memoir.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=Cliff Richard, the biography|date=1993}}</ref>   In June 1960, he travelled to Liverpool, England to perform a poetry reading at [[Liverpool University]]. As he usually read his poetry with backing from jazz musicians, Ellis searched among the locals for suitable musicians to accompany him and met the young group comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Stuart Sutcliffe]].<ref name="aaa">{{cite book|last=Lewisohn|first=Mark|title=The Beatles: Tune In, All These Years|date=2013}}</ref>  Ellis bonded with Lennon in particular, both sharing an enthusiasm for the American [[Beat poet]]s, and spent the week at 3 Gambier Terrace with Lennon, Sutcliffe, et al.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sutcliffe|first=Stuart|title=Stuart Sutcliffe: The Beatles Shadow|date=2002}}</ref> Lennon saw Ellis as "the converging point of rock 'n' roll and literature".<ref name="bbb">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=The Gospel According to the Beatles|date=2006}}</ref>  Ellis said of the meeting, "I was quite a star for them at that time because I had come up from London and that was a world they didn't really know about".  According to Lennon in the ''[[International Times]]'': "The first dope, from a Benzedrine inhaler, was given to the Beatles (John, George, Paul and Stuart) by an English cover version of [[Allen Ginsberg]] — one Royston Ellis, known as 'beat poet' ... So, give the saint his due."  Ellis also claimed that he suggested the re-spelling of Beetles to [[Beatles]].<ref name="aaa" /><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Ugly Things, Fall/Winter 2013 (King of the British Beatniks)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=David|title=The First Time We Met The Blues|date=2009}}</ref>

In 1961 his book survey of pop music at the dawn of the "[[Swinging Sixties]]", ''The Big Beat Scene'' was published.  It was reprinted with additional comments in 2010 by Music Mentor Press.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kureishi|first=Hanif|title=The Faber Book of Pop|date=1995|author2=John Savage }}</ref>  Ellis's novel, ''Myself For Fame'' (1964), about a fictional pop star, has a chapter set in Liverpool that seems to recount his experiences with The "Beetles" in 1960.<ref name="aaa" />  Ellis is one of the people the song "[[Paperback Writer]]" was based on, quoting a comment he had made years earlier while in Liverpool, and was also present at a liaison between Lennon and "[[Polythene Pam]]" in Guernsey in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=A Hard Day's Write, the story behind every Beatles' song|date=1994}}</ref>  In 1980, John Lennon said:<blockquote>That was me, remembering a little event with a woman in Jersey, and a man who was England's answer to Allen Ginsberg .. I met him when we were on tour and he took me back to his apartment and I had a girl and he had one he wanted me to meet. He said she dressed up in polythene, which she did. She didn't wear jack boots and kilts, I just sort of elaborated. Perverted sex in a polythene bag. Just looking for something to write about."<ref name="bbb" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying|date=2000|publisher=St Martin's Griffin|isbn=0312254644|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/allwearesayingla00lenn}}</ref></blockquote>

At 20, Ellis retired from the teenage beatnik and rock and roll scene and left England permanently for a life of travel that took him to [[East Berlin]] and Moscow, where he read his poetry on stage with the Russian poet [[Yevgeni Yevtushenko]]. Then, via [[Guernsey]] where he became a registered ferry boat engineer, he sailed to the [[Canary Islands]], and acted as an Arab with Cliff Richard in the movie ''[[Wonderful Life (1964 film)|Wonderful Life]]''. He stayed in [[Las Palmas]] for three years, becoming the editor of the islands' English language newspaper, ''The Canary Islands Sun'', and wrote three novels.<ref name="ccc">{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Nick|title=Groovy Old Men|date=2008}}</ref>

He hiked around West Africa, then landed up in the [[British Virgin Islands]] before settling, in 1966, in [[Dominica]] where he wrote the best-selling ''[[Bondmaster]]'' series of historical novels as Richard Tresillian; as well as becoming President of the Dominica Cricket Association, a member of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and of the [[Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control]], and a Life Fellow of the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen Smith|first=Warren|journal=In the Heart of Showbiz|date=2011|volume=3}}</ref>

In 1979, after his hillside log cabin in Dominica was blown down by Hurricane David, he moved to [[Sri Lanka]] where he lives in a colonial cottage overlooking the Indian Ocean.<ref name="bbb" />

A selection of his oeuvre was being published by Kicks Book for Kindle as ebooks during 2014.   For his literary achievements Royston Ellis was awarded the title Duke Gypino y Tintinabulation de Redonda by the purported [[Kingdom of Redonda|king of Redonda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen Smith|first=Warren|title=Celebrities in Hell|date=2002}}</ref>
