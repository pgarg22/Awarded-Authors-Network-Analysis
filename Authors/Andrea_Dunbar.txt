'''Andrea Dunbar''' (22 May 1961 – 20 December 1990) was an English playwright. She wrote ''The Arbor'' (1980) and ''Rita, Sue and Bob Too'' (1982), an autobiographical drama about the sexual adventures of teenage girls living in a run-down part of [[Bradford]], West Yorkshire. She wrote most of the adaptation for the film ''[[Rita, Sue and Bob Too]]'' (1987).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48348751 |title=The teenage Bradford 'genius' who told it like it was |work=BBC News |date=28 May 2019 |access-date=28 May 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
Dunbar began her first play ''The Arbor'' in 1977 at the age of 15,<ref name="guardian-hickling">{{Cite web |first1=Alfred |last1=Hickling |title=Back to Bradford: Andrea Dunbar remembered on film |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/12/theatre |work=The Guardian |date=12 April 2010 |access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> writing it as a classroom assignment for [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSE]] English.

Dunbar was quickly commissioned to write a follow-up play, ''Rita, Sue and Bob Too'', first performed in 1982. This explores similar themes to ''The Arbor'' through the lives of two teenage girls who are having affairs with the same married man. Dunbar's third and final play, ''Shirley'' (1986), places greater emphasis on a central character.<ref>Susan Carlson, ''Process and Product: Contemporary British Theatre and its Communities of Women'', Theatre Research International (1988), 13: pp 249–263.</ref> It depicts a girl's "tumultuous relationship" with her mother. As she explained, she meant to write "about Shirley and John but, you know, I wrote the mother in and she bloody took over the whole play."<ref>Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present Day'' (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 315.</ref>

The film version of ''[[Rita, Sue and Bob Too]]'' (1987) was adapted for the cinema by Dunbar, directed by [[Alan Clarke]] and filmed on the Buttershaw estate. Dunbar disowned the film when more writers were brought in to give it a happier ending.<ref name="guardian-hickling"/> However, it created considerable controversy on the estate because of its negative portrayal of the area.<ref name="guardian-hickling"/> Dunbar was threatened by several residents, but nevertheless continued to live there.<ref name="guardian-hickling"/>

In 2010 a commemorative [[blue plaque]] on Dunbar's former home on Brafferton Arbor was unveiled in the presence of her relatives.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Marc |last=Meneaud |title=Film and plaque are tributes to playwright Andrea |work=[[Telegraph & Argus]] |date=17 October 2010 |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8457880.film-and-plaque-are-tributes-to-playwright-andrea/ |access-date=29 May 2021}}</ref>
