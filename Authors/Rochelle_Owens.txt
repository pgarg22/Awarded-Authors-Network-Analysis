Cody |editor2=Evert Sprinchorn}}</ref>

==Theatre==
She was highly involved in the early [[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-Broadway theatre]] movement. As a poet, she contributed greatly to the [[St. Mark's Poetry Project|St. Marks Poetry Project]] and was a founding participant in Mickey Ruskin and Bill Mackey's Cafe Deux Megots on 7th Street in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. Owens was also involved in the [[ethnopoetics]] movement. Her work has influenced experimental playwrights and poets in subsequent generations.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Owens' plays premiered in [[New York City]] at the [[Judson Poets Theatre]], [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]], [[Theater for the New City]], and the [[American Place Theatre]]. She was a founding member of the New York Theater Strategy and the Women's Theater Council. Her play ''Futz'' was first published in 1961 and is foundational to the off-off-Broadway canon. It raised some controversy, and was banned in [[Toronto]] and called a "lust and bestiality play" by a newspaper in [[Edinburgh]]. ''Futz'' was made into a film in 1969. The cast includes [[Sally Kirkland]] and [[Frederic Forrest]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064354/] Futz! IMDB page</ref><ref>Friedman, Amy. "Rochelle Owens: Off Beat, Off-Off Broadway".

Cody |editor2=Evert Sprinchorn}}</ref>

==Poetry==
Owens at the age of 19 had her poetry published in [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones']] (as Amiri Baraka was known then) and [[Hettie Jones|Hettie Jones’]] magazine ''Yugen''. Owens’ poems appear in the volume Jones edited in 1962 titled "Four Young Lady Poets".  Owens may not refer to herself as a "[[Beat Generation|Beat poet]]", but she was there and influential among the Beat poets and that movement in New York. She read her poems at The Poetry Project at St. Marks Church In-the-Bowery in New York City, on the same bill that included [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Gregory Corso]]. Allen Ginsberg introduced her poetry to LeRoi Jones.<ref>Friedman, Amy. "Rochelle Owens: Off Beat, Off-Off Broadway". ''Beat Drama: Playwrights and Performances of the 'Howl’ Generation''.
