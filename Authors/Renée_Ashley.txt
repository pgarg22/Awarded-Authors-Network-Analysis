==Critical reception==
''[[The Los Angeles Review]]'' wrote of ''The View from the Body'' (2016): "Context is everything for meaning; there is no definition free of it. We are all in a context inextricably bound up in the definition of who we are. For better or worse, that imposes limits, especially the physical ones, with death being the ultimate defining context. However, the struggle against limits remains heroic and is better than the alternatives of apathy, acquiescence, even the embrace of oppression. The struggle against limits is what creates us and makes our beloved underdogs. We are how we respond to mortality. Renee Ashley’s collection is an intellectually brilliant banner in that battle."<ref>Staff. ''[http://losangelesreview.org/book-review-view-body-renee-ashley/ The View from the Body]'' reviewed by ''The Los Angeles Review''. Retrieved April 13, 2019.</ref>

''[[The Literary Review]]'' wrote of ''The View from the Body'' (2016): "The phantoms of Sexton, Plath, Rich, and others all inform ''The View from the Body'', but Ashley is operating in undiscovered country, pushing and probing what the line and sentence can do when called into question. Renée Ashley’s finely tuned sensibilities allow her to experiment with language and form without sacrificing meaning and beauty."<ref>Staff.

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed Ashley's seventh book of poetry, ''Because I Am the Shore I Want to Be the Sea'' (2013), a series of [[prose poem]]s on the subjects of "sex, courtship, fear, fatigue, loyalty, companion animals, and human regret" as "squared-off, almost blindingly vivid" and "committed to individual feeling, lyric, texture, emotional rawness, and authenticity."<ref>Staff.

But the rivers breathe flint and spark
And each night we believe in everything—
