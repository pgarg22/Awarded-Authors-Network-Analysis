She was a judge for the 2015 [[Griffin Poetry Prize]].

==Life==
Howe was born in Buffalo, New York. When her father Mark De Wolfe Howe left to join the fighting in World War II, Howe and her mother, the Irish playwright [[Mary Manning (writer)|Mary Manning]], moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] where she grew up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/fanny-howe |title=Fanny Howe |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |access-date=2011-06-27}}</ref> Her father eventually became a colonel and served in Sicily and North Africa and then after the war he went to Potsdam to give legal advice in the reorganization of Europe.<ref name="lithub.com">{{cite web|url=http://lithub.com/fanny-howe-on-race-family-and-the-line-between-fiction-and-poetry/|title=Fanny Howe on Race, Family, and the Line Between Fiction and Poetry - Literary  Hub|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref> After the war, her father continued his work as a lawyer and became a professor at [[Harvard Law School]].

Howe's mother was an actress at the [[Abbey Theatre]] of Dublin for some time.<ref name="lithub.com"/> Her sister is [[Susan Howe]], who also became a poet. She attended Stanford University for three years, and in 1961—the year she left Stanford—she married Frederick Delafield, whom she divorced two years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3401600343/howe-fanny-quincy.html |title=Fanny (Quincy) Howe |publisher=encyclopedia.com |access-date=2012-06-14}}</ref> Her aunt was [[Helen Howe]], a monologuist and novelist.

As a [[Civil Rights]] [[activist]], she met and married the activist Carl Senna in the 1970s, who is of African-Mexican descent and is also a poet and writer. They are the parents of the novelist [[Danzy Senna]], who writes about growing up biracial in the 1970s and 80s in her novel ''[[Caucasia (novel)|Caucasia]]''. Howe and Senna also had two other children, Lucien Quincy Senna, and Maceo Senna.

She has taught at [[Tufts University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Kenyon College]], [[Columbia University]], [[Yale University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Georgetown University]].<ref name=Academy>{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/881 |title=Fanny Howe |publisher=The Academy of American Poets |access-date=2011-06-27 }}</ref> She is [[Emeritus|professor emerita]] of Writing and Literature at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Currently she lives in Boston.

==Career==
Today, Howe is one of the most widely read of American [[Experimental literature|experimental poets]],{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} although her writing career began during the 1960s with a series of [[paperback original]] novels she published under the [[pseudonym]] Della Field.<ref name="lithub.com"/>

Howe has continued to publish novels throughout her career, including ''Lives of the Spirit/Glasstown: Where Something Got Broken'' (2005). She has also continued to publish in the essay form. Some of her essays have been collected, including ''The Wedding Dress: Meditations on Word and Life'' (2003)

Poet [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]]:
<blockquote>Fanny Howe employs a sometimes fierce, always passionate,
spareness in her lifelong parsing of the exchange between matter and spirit. Her work displays as well a political urgency, that is to say, a profound concern for social justice and for the soundness and fate of the [[polis]],  the "city on a hill".  Writes [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], ''The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty.'' Here's the luminous and incontrovertible proof.<ref name=Academy /></blockquote>

Joshua Glenn:
<blockquote>Fanny Howe isn't part of the local literary canon. But her seven novels about [[Miscegenation|interracial]] [[love]] and [[utopian]] dreaming offer a rich social history of Boston in the 1960s and '70s.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/03/07/bewildered_in_boston/ |title=Bewildered in Boston |work=The Boston Globe |author= Joshua Glenn |date=March 7, 2004}}Subscription required.</ref></blockquote>

Howe's prose poems, "Everything's a Fake" and "Doubt", were selected by [[David Lehman]] for the anthology ''Great American Prose Poems: from Poe to the Present'' (2003).<ref name=Lehman>{{cite book |title=Great American Prose Poems: from Poe to the Present |editor1-last=Lehman |editor1-first=David |year=2003 |chapter=Fanny Howe |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-2989-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzunYckU4woC&pg=PA135 }}</ref> Her poem "Catholic" was selected by [[Lyn Hejinian]] for the 2004 volume of ''[[The Best American Poetry]]''.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58J6YcsJuloC&pg=PA110 |chapter=Catholic |title=The Best American Poetry 2004| editor1-last=Hejinian |editor1-first=Lyn |editor1-link=Lyn Hejinian |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Lehman | publisher= Simon and Schuster| year= 2004|isbn= 978-0-7432-5757-2 }}</ref> [[File:Fanny Howe - August 23, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|{{center| Fanny Howe adding emphasis to her poetry at a West Tisbury Public Library gathering on Martha's Vineyard - 23 August 2012. }}]]
