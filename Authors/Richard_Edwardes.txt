'''Richard Edwardes''' (also '''Edwards''', 25 March 1525 – 31 October 1566) was an English [[poet]], [[playwright]], and composer; he was made a Gentleman of the [[Chapel Royal]], and was master of the singing boys. He was known for his comedies and interludes. He was also rumoured to be an illegitimate son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref name=":1">{{cite book|title=The Mistresses of Henry VIII |first=Kelly| last=Hart |edition=First |date=1 June 2009 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mistressesofhenr0000hart/page/23 23] |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-4835-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/mistressesofhenr0000hart|url-access=registration }}</ref>

==Life==
Richard Edwardes was born in 1525 in [[Somerset]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 17|last = Bullen|first = Arthur Henry|publisher = Smith, Elder & Co.|year = 1900|url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Edwards,_Richard_%28DNB00%29|chapter = Edwards, Richard}}</ref> Some of Edwardes' descendants have claimed that his mother was a mistress of Henry VIII and that Richard was Henry's son, although there has been no evidence to prove this theory. Descendants observe that it was unusual for someone from such a poor family to get an Oxford education, however author [[Kelly Hart]] observes that there are many possible explanations for this.<ref name=":1" />

Edwardes began his studies at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] in May 1540 and joined [[Christ Church, Oxford]] as it opened in 1546. He joined [[Lincoln's Inn]] but did not take up law as a career.<ref name=":0" /> He joined the [[Chapel Royal]] by 1557 and was appointed [[Master of the Children]] in 1561. He married Helene Griffith in 1563.<ref name=":1" /> After he died in 1566, he was succeeded by [[William Hunnis]].<ref name="Grove">{{Cite Grove |last=Smith |first=Michael |title=Richard Edwards}}</ref>

==Works==

===Plays===
In 1566, Edwardes' ''[[Palamon and Arcite (Edwardes)|Palamon and Arcite]]'' was performed before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] at [[Oxford]] when the stage fell — three people died and five were injured as a result. Despite the tragic accident, the show continued to play that night.

''The excellent Comedie of two the moste faithfullest Freendes,'' ''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pithias]]'' (written in 1564, published in 1571), a comedy, is his only extant play.<ref name=":0" />

===Poems===
Ten of Edwardes' poems appear in the first edition of the ''Paradise of Dainty Devices,'' though publisher Henry Disle says the poems are "written for the most part by M. [Master] Edwards."  Edwardes possibly compiled the manuscript on which the ''Paradise of Dainty Devices'' is based.

===Music===
Edwardes was less well known as a composer, but several of his compositions survive, including three pieces in the [[Mulliner Book]]: "O the syllye man," ascribed to him by the book, and two anonymous pieces usually attributed to him, "In goinge to my naked bedde" and "When grypinge griefes." Other pieces include a song from ''Damon and Pithias,'' "Awake, ye woeful wights," and a setting of the Lord's Prayer in [[Richard Day (printer)|Richard Day]]'s Psalter of 1563.<ref name="Grove"/>
