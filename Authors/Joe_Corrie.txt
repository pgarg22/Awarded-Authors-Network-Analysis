He was born in [[Slamannan]], [[Stirlingshire]] in 1894. His family moved to [[Cardenden]] in the [[Fife]] coalfield when Corrie was still an infant and he started work at the pits in 1908. He died in [[Edinburgh]] in 1968.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |last=Corrie |first=Joe |year=1985 |title=Plays, Poems and Theatre Writings |publisher=7:84 Publications |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-948177-00-4}}</ref>

Shortly after the First World War, Corrie started writing. His articles, sketches, short stories and poems were published in prominent [[:Category:Socialist newspapers published in the United Kingdom|socialist newspapers]] and journals, including ''Forward'' and ''The Miner.''

Corrie's volumes of poetry include ''The Image O' God and Other Poems ''(1927), ''Rebel Poems'' (1932) and ''Scottish Pride and Other Poems ''(1955). [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote "Not since Burns has the voice of Scotland spoken with such authentic lyric note".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/joe-corrie/biography/|title=Biography – Joe Corrie|website=Arts.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref>

He turned to writing plays during the [[UK General Strike of 1926|General Strike]] in 1926. His one-act plays and sketches were performed by the Bowhill Players, an amateur company of miners who performed to raise money for local [[Soup kitchen|soup kitchens]]. The company operated professionally as the Fife Miner Players in 1928-31 under the management of comedian and theatrical agent, Hugh Ogilvie. Corrie's first play, ''Hogmanay'' was published by the Fife Miners' Reform Union. His full-length play, ''In Time O'Strife'', depicting the General Strike's effect on the Fife mining community, toured Fife mining villages and musical halls all over Scotland. Described by critic [[Alan Riach]] as showing examplary 'defiance of the spirit'.<ref name=":0" />

Corrie wrote a number of plays for groups who took part in the [[Scottish Community Drama Association]]'s annual competitive festivals. Winning plays included ''Martha'' (1935), ''And So To War'' (1936) and ''Hewers of Coal'' (1937).

Corrie's commitment to naturalism invited strong criticism from the Scottish theatrical establishment in his day and caused him to feel disconnected from other Scottish writers.<ref name=":1" /> His work was staged professionally by [[Scottish National Players]] and the [[Citizens' Theatre]], Glasgow. Posthumously, agitprop theatre group, [[7:84]] republished ''In Time O' Strife ''alongside'' ''a collection of writing and poems after their 1982 revival, which Alan Riach said was met with 'new acclaim'.<ref name=":0" />

The Corrie Centre community provision in Cardenden was named after Corrie in 1985.

Corrie also wrote songs and many of his poems have been set to music. ''Maid of Kenmore'' was recorded by [[Robert Wilson (tenor)|Robert Wilson]]. [[Calum Kennedy]] recorded ''Kirsteen''.
