A number of his other stories and novels were adapted for films and TV series.

He also wrote ''Presidential Lottery: The Reckless Gamble in Our Electoral System'', in which he condemned the United States' [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College system]]. It was published in 1969, and republished in 2014 and 2016.<ref>{{cite book|url=   http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/114093/presidential-lottery-by-james-a-michener/9780812986822/|title= Presidential Lottery|date=1969|author=Michener, James|publisher =   Penguin Random House|access-date=March 1, 2017 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Michener wrote that he did not know who his biological parents were, or exactly when or where he was born.<ref name=nytimesobit/> He was raised a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu">{{cite web|url=https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/michener__james_albert |website=Pennsylvania Center for the Book|title=James Michener Biography|publisher= Penn State University Libraries}}</ref>

Michener graduated from [[Central Bucks High School West|Doylestown High School]] in 1925. He attended [[Swarthmore College]], in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]], where he played basketball and was a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity. After graduating [[summa cum laude]] in 1929, with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in English and History, he traveled and studied in [[Scotland]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] in the medieval town of [[St. Andrews]], [[Fife]], on the coast of the [[North Sea]] for two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.miami.edu/specialcollections/collections/findingaids/m0134_find.html |title=Biographical Sketch, James A. Michener Papers |website=University of Miami Library |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729050100/http://www.library.miami.edu/specialcollections/collections/findingaids/m0134_find.html |archive-date=July 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Michener talks about "hoboing" (riding freight trains for free) during the Great Depression, as mentioned in the 1998 Great Depression documentary on the History Channel.

Michener took a job as a high school English teacher at [[The Hill School]] in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]]. From 1933 to 1936, he taught English at [[George School]] in [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania]]. He attended Colorado State Teachers College in [[Greeley, Colorado]], (in 1970 renamed the [[University of Northern Colorado]]), where he earned a [[Master of Arts]] degree in Education.<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu"/> After graduation, he taught at the university and at College High School (the University Lab School) for several years.  The [[University of Northern Colorado#Michener Library|library]] at the [[University of Northern Colorado]] was named after him in October 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unco.edu/news/releases.aspx?id=4484|title=UNC Celebrating Michener Library's First 40 Years|first=Kalen|last=May|date=October 30, 2012|website=University of Colorado}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Michener Library |url=http://libguides.unco.edu/c.php?g=94768&p=2497317|title=Michener}}</ref>

In 1935, Michener married Patti Koon. He accepted a Guest Lecturer position at Harvard, from 1939 to 1940, but left to join [[Macmillan Publishers]] as their [[social studies]] education editor.<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu"/>

Although as a Quaker, he could have qualified as a conscientious objector and not been drafted into the military, Michener enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]] (1941–1945).<ref name="nytimesobit" /><ref>{{cite web|title= James A. Michener Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://achievement.org/achiever/james-a-michener/#interview}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://epdf.pub/michener-a-writers-journey.html | title=Michener: A Writer's Journey - PDF Free Download}}</ref> He traveled throughout the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on various assignments which he gained because his base commanders mistakenly thought his father was Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Michener, James A. |title=Return to Paradise|url=https://archive.org/details/returntoparadise0000mich |url-access=registration |publisher=Random House|date= 1951}}</ref>  His experiences during these travels inspired the stories published in his breakout work ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]''.<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu"/>

In [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], Michener was chairman of the [[Bucks County]] committee to elect Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] as the 35th President. In 1962, he unsuccessfully ran as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Pennsylvania]], a decision he later considered a misstep. "My mistake was to run in 1962 as a Democratic candidate for Congress. [My wife] kept saying, 'Don't do it, don't do it.' I lost and went back to writing books."<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu"/>

In 1968, Michener served as the [[campaign manager]] for the third-term run of the twice-elected [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Joseph S. Clark]] of Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pennsylvania Politics Today and Yesterday: The Tolerable Accommodation |first= Paul B. |last=Beers |page=198 |publisher=Penn State University Press |date=March 31, 1976 |isbn=978-0271002385}}</ref> Michener later served as Secretary for the 1967–1968 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention.<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu"/> Also that year, Michener was a member of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], serving as a Pennsylvania Democrat. He wrote about that experience in a political science text ''Presidential Lottery: The Reckless Gamble in Our Electoral System'', which was published the following year. In it, he suggested alternate systems, including using a direct popular vote by majority for the office of [[President of the United States]] and other more creative solutions.

===Writing career===
[[File:Michenertypewriter.JPG|thumb|200 px|Michener's typewriter at the [[James A. Michener Art Museum]] in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]]]
Michener began his writing career during [[World War II]], when as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy he was assigned to the South Pacific as a naval historian. He later turned his notes and impressions into ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' (1947), his first book, published when he was age 40. It won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction in 1948, and [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] adapted it as the hit Broadway musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', which premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City]] in 1949.<ref name="suite"/>  The musical was also adapted as eponymous feature films in [[South Pacific (1958 film)|1958]] and [[South Pacific (2001 film)|2001]].

In the late 1950s, Michener began working as a roving editor for the ''[[Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature]]''. He gave up that work in 1970.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Michener tried [[television]] writing but was unsuccessful. American television producer Bob Mann wanted Michener to co-create a weekly [[anthology series]] from ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' and serve as narrator. Rodgers and Hammerstein, however, had bought all dramatic rights to the novel and did not relinquish their ownership.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hayes, John Michael|title=James A. Michener: A Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/jamesamichenerbi00haye|url-access=registration|publisher= Bobbs-Merrill|date= 1984|page=[https://archive.org/details/jamesamichenerbi00haye/page/158 158]|isbn=9780672527821}}</ref>  Michener did lend his name to a different television series, ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]'', in 1959, starring [[Gardner McKay]] as Captain Adam Troy in the sailing ship ''Tiki III''.<ref>Hayes, p. 159.</ref>

Michener was a popular writer during his lifetime; his novels sold an estimated 75&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/james-michener/ |title=James Michener Biography |website=Bookrags.com |access-date=May 3, 2009}}</ref> His novel ''[[Hawaii (novel)|Hawaii]]'' (1959), well-timed on its publication when [[Hawaii]] became the 50th state, was based on extensive research. He used this approach for nearly all of his subsequent novels, which were based on detailed historical, cultural, and even geological research. ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'' (1974), which documented several generations of families in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of the [[Western United States|American West]], was adapted as a popular 12-part television [[miniseries]] of the same name and aired on the [[National Broadcasting Company]] ([[NBC]] television network) from October 1978 through February 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34269/centennial-the-complete-series/  |title= Centennial: The Complete Miniseries|website= DVDTalk.com

In 1996, State House Press published ''James A. Michener: A Bibliography'', compiled by David A. Groseclose. Its more than 2,500 entries from 1923 to 1995 include magazine articles, forewords, and other works.<ref>{{cite book|title=   James A. Michener, A Bibliography|isbn = 1880510235|last1 = Groseclose|first1 = David A.|year = 1996}}</ref>

Michener's prodigious output made for lengthy novels, several of which run more than 1,000 pages. The author states in ''[[My Lost Mexico]]'' (1992) that at times he would spend 12 to 15 hours per day at his typewriter for weeks on end, and that he used so much paper, his filing system had trouble keeping up.{{page needed|date=February 2013}}

===Marriages===
Michener was married three times. In 1935, he married Patti Koon. In 1948, they divorced, and the same year Michener married his second wife, Vange Nord.<ref name="nytimesobit"/>

Michener met his third wife, [[Mari Yoriko Sabusawa]], at a luncheon in [[Chicago]]. An American, she and her Japanese parents were interned in western camps that the U.S. government set up during the early years of  World War II to hold ethnic Japanese from West Coast / Pacific communities. Michener divorced Nord in 1955 and married Sabusawa the same year. Sabusawa died in 1994.<ref name="nytimesobit"/>

Michener's novel ''[[Sayonara (novel)|Sayonara]]'' (1954) is quasi-autobiographical.<ref name="secureapps.libraries.psu.edu"/> Set during the early 1950s, it tells the story of Major Lloyd Gruver, a [[United States Air Force]] ace jet pilot in the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), now stationed in [[Japan]], who falls in love with Hana-Ogi, a Japanese woman. The novel follows their cross-cultural romance and illuminates the racism of the post-World War II time period. In 1957 it was adapted into the highly successful movie ''[[Sayonara (film)|Sayonara]]'' which starred [[Marlon Brando]], [[James Garner]], [[Miiko Taka]], and [[Red Buttons]]; Buttons won the 1958 Academy Award ("Oscar") for best supporting actor for his performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1958|title=The 30th Academy Awards (1958) Nominees and Winners|access-date=August 27, 2013|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)}}</ref>

===Philanthropist===
Michener became a major philanthropist, donating more than $100&nbsp;million to educational, cultural, and writing institutions, including his ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Swarthmore College]], the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]], and the James A. Michener Art Museum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michenerartmuseum.org/|title= James A. Michener Art Museum|website=michenerartmuseum.org}}</ref> and more than $37&nbsp;million to [[University of Texas at Austin]]. By 1992, his gifts made him UT Austin's largest single donor to that time. Over the years, Mari Michener played a major role in helping direct his donations.<ref name="nytimesobit"/>

In 1989, Michener donated the royalty earnings from the Canadian edition of his novel ''[[Journey (novel)|Journey]]'' (1989), published in Canada by [[McClelland & Stewart]], to create the [[Journey Prize]], an annual Canadian literary prize worth $10,000 (CDN) that is awarded for the year's best short story published by an emerging Canadian writer.

In the Micheners' final years, he and his wife lived in [[Austin, Texas]], and they endowed the [[Michener Center for Writers]] at the University of Texas at Austin. The Center provides three-year Michener Fellowships in fiction, poetry, playwriting and screenwriting to a small number of students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/academic/mcw/program/ |title=The Michener Center for Writers and its Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Texas at Austin |website=utexas.edu |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/academic/mcw/program/fellowship-support/ |title=The Michener Fellowship at the University of Texas at Austin |website=utexas.edu |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref>

Suffering from terminal kidney disease, in October 1997, Michener ended the daily [[dialysis]] treatment that had kept him alive for four years.
