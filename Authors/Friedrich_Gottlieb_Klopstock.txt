'''Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock''' ({{IPA-de|ˈklɔpʃtɔk|lang}}; 2 July 1724 – 14 March 1803)<!--full dates in infobox, per MOS--> was a German [[German literature|poet]]. His best known work is the epic poem [[Der Messias (Klopstock)|''Der Messias'']] ("The Messiah"). One of his major contributions to [[German literature]] was to open it up to exploration outside of [[France|French]] models.<ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Klopstock, Friedrich Gottlieb}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Klopstock was born at [[Quedlinburg]], the eldest son of a lawyer. Both in his birthplace and on the estate of [[Friedeburg, Saxony-Anhalt|Friedeburg]] on the [[Saale]], which his father later rented, he spent a happy childhood. Having been given more attention to his physical than to his mental development, he grew up strong and healthy and was considered an excellent horseman. In his thirteenth year, he returned to Quedlinburg and attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] there, and in 1739 went on to the famous classical school named [[Schulpforta]]. Here he soon became adept in Greek and Latin versification, and wrote some meritorious idylls and odes in German. His original intention of making [[Henry the Fowler]] the hero of an epic was abandoned in favor of a religious epic, under the influence of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' with which he became acquainted through [[Johann Jakob Bodmer|Bodmer]]'s translation.<ref name=EB1911/>

While still at school, he had already drafted the plan of ''Der Messias'' on which most of his fame rests. On 21 September 1745 he delivered, on quitting school, a remarkable "departing oration" on [[epic poetry]]—''Abschiedsrede über die epische Poesie, kultur- und literargeschichtlich erläutert''—and next proceeded to [[University of Jena|Jena]] as a student of [[theology]], where he drew up in prose the first three cantos of the ''Messias''. Finding life at that university not to his liking, he transferred in the spring of 1746 to [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], where he joined a circle of young men of letters who contributed to the ''[[Bremer Beiträge]]''. In this periodical the first three cantos of ''Der Messias'' were published anonymously in [[hexameter]] verse in 1748.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Denmark and Germany===
[[Image:Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock 1.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock circa 1779 by [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]]]]

A new era in German literature had commenced, and the identity of the author soon became known. In Leipzig he also wrote a number of odes, the best known of which is ''An meine Freunde'' (1747), afterwards recast as ''Wingolf'' (1767). He left the university in 1748 and became a private tutor in the family of a relative at [[Langensalza]], where unrequited love for a cousin (the "Fanny" of his odes) disturbed his peace of mind. For that reason he gladly accepted in 1750 an invitation from Bodmer, the translator of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', to visit him in [[Zürich]], where Klopstock was initially treated with every kindness and respect and rapidly recovered his spirits. Bodmer, however, was disappointed to find in the young poet of the ''Messias'' a man of strong worldly interests, and a coolness sprang up between the two men.<ref name=EB1911/>

At this juncture Klopstock received from [[Frederick V of Denmark]], on the recommendation of his minister [[Johann Hartwig Ernst, Count von Bernstorff|Count von Bernstorff]] (1712–1772), an invitation to settle in [[Copenhagen]] with an annuity of 400 [[thaler]]s, in the hope that he would complete ''Der Messias'' there. The offer was accepted.<ref name=EB1911/>

On his way to the Danish capital, Klopstock met in [[Hamburg]] the woman who later in 1754 became his wife, {{Interlanguage link|Margareta (Meta) Möller|de|Margareta Klopstock}}, the "Cidli" of his odes. She was the daughter of a Hamburg merchant and an enthusiastic admirer of his poetry. His happiness was short, as she died in 1758, leaving him broken-hearted. His grief at her loss finds pathetic expression in the fifteenth canto of the ''Messias''.<ref name=EB1911/>

The poet subsequently published his wife's writings, ''Hinterlassene Werke von Margareta Klopstock'' (1759), which give evidence of a tender, sensitive and deeply religious spirit.<ref name=EB1911/> See also ''Memoirs of Frederick and Margaret Klopstock'' (English translation by [[Elizabeth Smith (translator)|Elizabeth Smith]], London, 1808) and her correspondence with [[Samuel Richardson]], published 1818.<ref name=ac>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Klopstock, Friedrich Gottlieb}}</ref>

===Depression and ''Messias''===
Klopstock now relapsed into [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]; new ideas failed him, and his poetry became more introspective. He continued to live and work in Copenhagen, however, and next, following [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]], turned his attention to northern mythology, which in his view should replace classical subjects in a new school of German poetry. In 1770, when [[Christian VII of Denmark|King Christian VII]] dismissed Count Bernstorff from office, he retired with the latter to [[Hamburg]] but retained his pension, together with the rank of councillor of legation.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1773 were published the last five cantos of the ''Messias''. In the following year he published a scheme for the regeneration of German letters, ''Die Gelehrtenrepublik'' (1774). In 1775 he traveled south, and making the acquaintance of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] on the way, spent a year at the court of the [[Margrave]] of [[Baden]] at [[Karlsruhe]]. Thence, in 1776, with the title of ''Hofrath'' and a pension from the Margrave, which he retained along with that from the king of Denmark, he returned to Hamburg where he spent the remainder of his life.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Last years===
His latter years he passed, as had always been his inclination, in retirement, only occasionally relieved by socializing with his most intimate friends, occupied in [[philology|philological]] studies and taking scant interest in the new developments in German literature. However, he was enthusiastic about the  [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]]. The [[French Republic]] sent him a diploma of honorary citizenship; but, horrified at the terrible scenes the Revolution had enacted in the name of liberty, he returned it.<ref name=EB1911/>

At the age of 67 he undertook a second marriage, to Johanna Elisabeth von Winthem, a widow and a niece of his late wife, who for many years had been one of his most intimate friends. He died in Hamburg on 14 March 1803, mourned throughout Germany, and was buried with great ceremony next to his first wife in the churchyard of the village of [[Ottensen]].<ref name=EB1911/>

===''Der Messias''===
[[File:Klopstock Portret.png|thumb|Painting of Klopstock by {{ill|Maria Elisabeth Vogel|de}}]]

The ''Messias'' follows from the aspirations to become an epic poet, which Klopstock nurtured in his early years. The leitmotif of the work is the [[salvation|Redemption]], which is given an epic treatment. He resorted to [[Christianity|Christian]] mythology in trying to circumscribe the subject-matter within the [[dogma]]s of the Church.<ref name=EB1911/>

Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' was one of the models Klopstock had in mind in giving form to his poem. The poem took twenty-five years to complete. The work aroused intense public enthusiasm at its commencement. It has been translated into seventeen languages, and led to numerous imitations.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Odes and dramas===
In his odes Klopstock had more scope for his distinctive talent.<ref name=EB1911/> Some have Nordic mythological inspiration, while others emphasize religious themes.

Among the most celebrated and translated are ''An Fanny''; ''Der Zürchersee''; ''Die tote Klarissa''; ''An Cidli''; ''Die beiden Musen''; ''Der Rheinwein''; ''Die frühen Gräber'', ''Mein Vaterland''. His religious odes mostly take the form of [[hymns]], of which the most beautiful is ''Die Frühlingsfeier''..<ref name=EB1911/>

In some of his dramas, notably ''Hermanns Schlacht'' (1769) and ''Hermann und die Fürsten'' (1784), Klopstock celebrated the deeds of the ancient German hero [[Arminius]], and in others, ''Der Tod Adams'' (1757) and ''Salomo'' (1764), he took his materials from the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=EB1911/> These also represent an important part of his body of work. Composer [[Sigrid Henriette Wienecke]] used Klopstock's writings as the text for her musical drama Fader Vor. He immortalized his 1750s visit at the Swiss [[Au peninsula]] in his ''Ode an den Zürichsee'' (“Ode to [[Lake Zurich]]”).

It has been said that Klopstock's hymn "Die Auferstehung" at the funeral of [[Hans von Bülow]] in 1894 gave [[Gustav Mahler]] the inspiration for the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second Symphony]]. Mahler incorporated the hymn with extra verses he wrote himself to bring a personal resolution to this  work.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Klopstock published odes and hymns, including [[Der am Kreuz ist meine Liebe]], which is in shortened and revised form part of the 2013 Catholic hymnal ''[[Gotteslob]]''.

===Prose===
In addition to ''Die Gelehrtenrepublik'', he was also the author of ''Fragmente über Sprache und Dichtkunst'' (1779) and ''Grammatische Gespräche'' (1794), works in which he made important contributions to philology and to the history of German poetry.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Correspondence===
As was common in the period, Klopstock kept up an abundant correspondence with his contemporaries, friends, and colleagues, and this has been published in diverse collections. Some of them are listed below:
  
*K. Schmidt, ''Klopstock und seine Freunde'' (1810);<ref name=EB1911/> this is the basis for ''Klopstock and his friends. A series of familiar letters, written between the years 1750 and 1803'', translated and introduced by [[Elizabeth Benger]] (London, 1814)
*{{ill|Christian August Heinrich Clodius|de}}, ''Klopstocks Nachlass'' (1821)<ref name=EB1911/>
*[[Johann Martin Lappenberg|J. M. Lappenberg]], ''Briefe von und an Klopstock'' (1867).<ref name=EB1911/>

===Editions===
Klopstock's ''Werke'' first appeared in seven [[quarto]] volumes (1798–1809). At the same time a more complete edition in twelve [[octavo]] volumes was published (1798–1817), to which six additional volumes were added in 1830. Other nineteenth-century editions were published in 1844–1845, 1854–1855, 1879 (ed. by R. Boxberger), 1884 (ed. by R. Hamel) and 1893 (a selection edited by F. Muncker). A critical edition of the ''Odes'' was published by [[Franz Muncker|F. Muncker]] and J. Pawel in 1889; a commentary on these by [[Johann Heinrich Joseph Düntzer|H. Düntzer]] (1860; 2nd ed., 1878).<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Klopstock, Gottlieb Friedrich|inline=1}}</ref>

==Goethe's description==
Goethe in his [[Dichtung und Wahrheit|autobiography]] recorded his personal impression of Klopstock: "He was of small stature, but well built. His manners were grave and decorous, but free from pedantry. His address was intelligent and pleasing. On the whole, one might have taken him for a diplomatist. He carried himself with the self-conscious dignity of a person who has a great moral mission to fulfil. He conversed with facility on various subjects, but rather avoided speaking of poetry and literary matters."<ref name=ac/>

==Legacy==
Klopstock's enrichment of poetic vocabulary and attention to prosody did great service to the poets who immediately followed him.<ref>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Klopstock, Friedrich Gottlieb|year=1905}}</ref> In freeing German poetry from its exclusive interest in [[Alexandrine]] verse, he became the founder of a new era in [[German literature]], so that [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] were artistically indebted to him.<ref>{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Klopstock, Friedrich Gottlieb}}</ref> An 800 year old oak tree where Klopstock spent time in Denmark was named after him.<ref>{{cite web |title=Danish Tree Register |url=http://dendron.dk/dtr/english/detaljer.asp?Individual_ID=90 |website=dendron.dk}}</ref>
