==Life and work==
===Early life===
[[File:Bulgakov House Moscow (3).jpg|thumb|Bulgakov House in Moscow. Bulgakov's novel Master and Margarita was written here.]]
Mikhail Bulgakov was born on {{OldStyleDate|15 May|1891|3 May}} in [[Kyiv]], [[Kiev Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], into a Russian family. He was one of the seven children (the oldest of three brothers) of {{ill|Afanasiy Bulgakov|ru|Булгаков, Афанасий Иванович}}{{snd}} a [[Table of Ranks|state councilor]], a professor at the [[Kiev Theological Academy]], as well as a prominent Russian [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] essayist, thinker and translator of religious texts. His mother was Varvara Mikhailovna Bulgakova (''nee'' Pokrovskaya), a former teacher. Both of his grandfathers were clergymen in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=Milne>Lesley Milne.

Afanasiy Bulgakov was born in [[Bryansk Oblast]], Russia, where his father was a priest, and he moved to Kyiv to study in the academy.<ref>Ермишин О.

In 1901, Bulgakov joined the First Kyiv Gymnasium, where he developed an interest in [[Russian literature|Russian]] and [[European literature]] (his favourite authors at the time being [[Nikolay Gogol|Gogol]], [[Aleksander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoyevsky]], [[Saltykov-Shchedrin]], and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]), theatre and opera. The teachers of the Gymnasium exerted a great influence on the formation of his literary taste. After the death of his father in 1907, Mikhail's mother, a well-educated and extraordinarily diligent person, assumed responsibility for his education. After graduation from the Gymnasium in 1909,<ref name="timeline">{{cite web| url =http://www.m-a-bulgakov.ru/hronika.html| title =Bulgakov timeline /Краткая хроника жизни и творчества М.А.Булгакова| publisher =www.m-a-bulgakov.ru| access-date =10 October 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20111009010439/http://www.m-a-bulgakov.ru/hronika.html| archive-date =9 October 2011}}</ref> Bulgakov entered the Medical Faculty of [[Kyiv University]], which he finished with special commendation.

In 1913, Bulgakov married Tatiana Lappa. At the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he volunteered with the [[Red Cross]] as a medical doctor and was sent directly to the front, where he was badly injured at least twice. Bulgakov's suffering from these wounds had deleterious long-term effects. To suppress chronic pain, especially in the abdomen, he injected himself with [[morphine]]. Over the next year his addiction grew stronger. In 1918, he abandoned morphine and never used it again. ''Morphine,'' a book released in 1926, is his account of that trying period.

In 1916, Bulgakov graduated from the Medical Department of [[Kyiv University]] and after serving as a surgeon at [[Chernovtsy]] hospital, was appointed provincial physician to [[Smolensk]] province. His life in those days is reflected in his ''[[A Country Doctor's Notebook]].''<ref name="congress"/> In September 1917, Bulgakov was moved to the hospital in [[Vyazma]], near Smolensk. In February 1918, he returned to Kyiv, Ukraine, where he opened a private practice at his home at Andreyevsky Descent, 13. Here he lived through the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and witnessed ten coups. Successive governments drafted the young doctor into their service while two of his brothers were serving in the [[White Army]] against the Bolsheviks.

In February 1919, he was mobilised as an army physician by the [[Ukrainian People's Army]] and assigned to the Northern Caucasus. There, he became seriously ill with [[typhus]] and barely survived.<ref name="congress"/><ref>Vilensky, Yu, G., Bulgakov's doctor (1991) T. I. Borisova (ed.) Kyiv. Zdorovie. pp. 99–103. {{ISBN|5-311-00639-0}}</ref> In the Caucasus, he started working as a journalist, but when he and others were invited to return as doctors by the French and German governments, Bulgakov was refused permission to leave Russia because of the typhus. That was when he last saw his family; after the Civil War and the rise of the Soviets most of his relatives emigrated to Paris.

===Career===
After his illness, Bulgakov abandoned his medical practice to pursue writing. In his autobiography, he recalled how he began: "Once in 1919 when I was traveling at night by train I wrote a short story. In the town where the train stopped, I took the story to the publisher of the newspaper who published the story".<ref name="congress"/> His first book was an [[almanac]] of [[feuilleton]]s called ''Future Perspectives'', written and published the same year. In December 1919, Bulgakov moved to [[Vladikavkaz]]. He wrote and saw his first two plays, ''Self Defence'' and ''The Turbin Brothers'', being produced for the city theater stage with great success.<ref name="timeline"/><ref name="congress"/>

[[File:Bulgakov1910s.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Bulgakov in the 1910s]]

After travelling through the Caucasus, Bulgakov headed for Moscow, intending "to remain here forever". It was difficult to find work in the capital, but he was appointed secretary to the literary section of Glavpolitprosvet (Central Committee of the Republic for Political Education).<ref name="congress"/> In September 1921, Bulgakov and his wife settled near [[Patriarshy Ponds|Patriarch's Ponds]], on [[Bulgakov House (Moscow)|Bolshaya Sadovaya street, 10]] (now close to [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya metro station]]). To make a living, he started working as a correspondent and [[feuilletons]] writer for the newspapers ''Gudok'', ''Krasnaia Panorama'' and ''Nakanune'', based in Berlin.<ref name="congress"/> For the almanac ''Nedra'', he wrote  ''Diaboliad'', ''[[The Fatal Eggs]]'' (1924), and ''[[Heart of a Dog]]'' (1925), works that combined bitter satire and elements of science fiction and were concerned with the fate of a scientist and the misuse of his discovery. The most significant features of Bulgakov's satire, such as a skillful blending of fantastic and realistic elements, grotesque situations, and a concern with important ethical issues, had already taken shape; these features were developed further in his most famous novel.<ref name="homeenglish"/>

Between 1922 and 1926, Bulgakov wrote several plays (including ''Zoyka's Apartment''), none of which were allowed production at the time.<ref name="timeline"/> ''The Run'', treating the horrors of a fratricidal war, was personally banned by [[Joseph Stalin]] after the Glavrepertkom (Department of Repertoire) decided that it "glorified emigration and [[White movement|White]] generals".<ref name="congress"/> In 1924, Bulgakov divorced his first wife and the next year married Lyubov Belozerskaya.

When one of Moscow's theatre directors severely criticised Bulgakov, Stalin personally protected him, saying that a writer of Bulgakov's quality was above "party words" like "left" and "right".<ref>[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], p. 110. swedish edition of ''Stalin: The Red Tsar and His Court''.</ref> Stalin found work for the playwright at a small Moscow theatre, and next the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] (MAT). Bulgakov's first major work was the novel ''Belaya gvardiya'' ([[The White Guard]]), serialized in 1925 but never published in book form

On 5 October 1926, ''[[The Days of the Turbins]]'', the play which continued the theme of ''The White Guard'' (the fate of Russian intellectuals and officers of the Tsarist Army caught up in revolution and Civil war)<ref name="homeenglish"/> was premiered at the MAT.<ref name="timeline"/> Stalin liked it very much and reportedly saw it at least 15 times.<ref name="StalinTheDaysoftheTurbins_chayka_org"/><ref name="stalin-s-secret-love-affair-with-the-white-guard_standard_co_uk"/>

His plays ''[[Ivan Vasilievich (play)|Ivan Vasilievich]]'' (Иван Васильевич), ''Don Quixote'' (Дон Кихот) and ''Last Days'' (Последние дни [Poslednie Dni], also called ''Pushkin'') were banned. The premier of another, [[The Cabal of Hypocrites|''Moliėre'' (also known as ''The Cabal of Hypocrites'')]], about the [[Molière|French dramatist]] in which Bulgakov plunged "into fairy Paris of the XVII century", received bad reviews in ''[[Pravda]]'' and the play was withdrawn from the theater repertoire.<ref name="congress"/> In 1928, ''Zoyka's Apartment'' and ''The Purple Island'' were staged in Moscow; both comedies were accepted by the public with great enthusiasm, but critics again gave them bad reviews.<ref name="congress"/> By March 1929, Bulgakov's career was ruined when  Government censorship stopped the publication of any of his work and his plays.<ref name="timeline"/>

In despair, Bulgakov first wrote a personal letter to Joseph Stalin (July 1929), then on 28 March 1930, a letter to the Soviet government.<ref name="letter">{{cite web | url  =http://lib.ru/BULGAKOW/b_letter.txt| script-title=ru:Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков. Письмо правительству СССР| publisher  = lib.ru/Новый мир, 1987, N8.| access-date    = 10 October 2011|language=ru}}</ref> He requested permission to emigrate if the Soviet Union could not find use for him as a writer.<ref name="congress"/> In his autobiography, Bulgakov claimed to have written to Stalin out of desperation and mental anguish, never intending to post the letter. He received a phone call directly from the Soviet leader, who asked the writer whether he really desired to leave the Soviet Union. Bulgakov replied that a Russian writer cannot live outside of his homeland. Stalin gave him permission to continue working at the Art Theater; on 10 May 1930,<ref name="timeline"/> he re-joined the theater, as stage director's assistant. Later he adapted [[Gogol]]'s ''[[Dead Souls]]'' for stage.<ref name="homeenglish"/>

In 1932, Bulgakov married for the third time, to Yelena Shilovskaya, who would prove to be inspiration for the character Margarita in his most famous novel, which he started working on in 1928.<ref name="congress"/>  During the last decade of his life, Bulgakov continued to work on ''The Master and Margarita'', wrote plays, critical works, stories, and made several translations and dramatisations of novels. Many of them were not published, others were "torn to pieces" by critics. Much of his work (ridiculing the Soviet system) stayed in his desk drawer for several decades. The refusal of the authorities to let him work in the theatre and his desire to see his family who were living abroad, whom he had not seen for many years, led him to seek drastic measures{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}. Despite his new work, the projects he worked on at the theatre were often prohibited, and he was stressed and unhappy.

===Last years===
In the late 1930s, he joined the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] as a [[librettist]] and consultant. He left after perceiving that none of his works would be produced there. Stalin's favor protected Bulgakov from arrests and execution, but he could not get his writing published. His novels and dramas were subsequently banned and, for the second time, Bulgakov's career as playwright was ruined. When his last play ''Batum'' (1939), a complimentary portrayal of Stalin's early revolutionary days,<ref name="az_lib_batum">{{cite web |url=http://lib.ru/BULGAKOW/batum.txt | title = Батум. Комментарии | publisher= lib.ru| access-date = 10 October 2011}}</ref> was banned before rehearsals, Bulgakov requested permission to leave the country but was refused.

[[File:Bulgakov Grave April 2015.jpg|thumb|Gravestone of Mikhail Bulgakov and Yelena Bulgakova]]

In poor health, Bulgakov devoted his last years to what he called his "sunset" novel. The years 1937 to 1939 were stressful for Bulgakov, veering from glimpses of optimism, believing the publication of his masterpiece could still be possible, to bouts of depression, when he felt as if there were no hope. On 15 June 1938, when the manuscript was nearly finished, Bulgakov wrote in a letter to his wife:
<blockquote>"In front of me 327 pages of the manuscript (about 22 chapters). The most important remains – editing, and it's going to be hard, I will have to pay close attention to details. Maybe even re-write some things... 'What's its future?' you ask? I don't know. Possibly, you will store the manuscript in one of the drawers, next to my 'killed' plays, and occasionally it will be in your thoughts. Then again, you don't know the future. My own judgement of the book is already made and I think it truly deserves being hidden away in the darkness of some chest..."<ref name="homeenglish"/></blockquote>

In 1939, Mikhail Bulgakov organized a private reading of ''The Master and Margarita'' to his close circle of friends. Yelena Bulgakova remembered 30 years later, "When he finally finished reading that night, he said: 'Well, tomorrow I am taking the novel to the publisher!' and everyone was silent", "...Everyone sat paralyzed. Everything scared them. P. (P. A. Markov, in charge of the literature division of MAT) later at the door fearfully tried to explain to me that trying to publish the novel would cause terrible things", she wrote in her diary (14 May 1939).<ref name="homeenglish"/>

In the last month of his life, friends and relatives were constantly on duty at his bedside. On 10 March 1940, Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov died from [[nephrosclerosis]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zilberstein|first1=Gleb|last2=Maor|first2=Uriel|last3=Baskin|first3=Emmanuil|last4=D'Amato|first4=Alfonsina|last5=Righetti|first5=Pier Giorgio|title=Unearthing Bulgakov's trace proteome from the Master i Margarita manuscript|journal=Journal of Proteomics|volume=152|pages=102–108|doi=10.1016/j.jprot.2016.10.019|pmid=27989937|year=2016}}</ref> (an inherited kidney disorder). His father had died of the same disease, and from his youth Bulgakov had guessed his future mortal diagnosis. On 11 March, a [[civil funeral]] was held in the building of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]]. Before the funeral, the Moscow sculptor [[Sergey Merkurov]] removed the [[death mask]] from his face. He was buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.

[[File:Bulgakov Katayev Olesha.jpg|thumb|Bulgakov with Soviet writers [[Yury Olesha]] and [[Valentin Katayev]]]]
During his life, Bulgakov was best known for the plays he contributed to [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko|Nemirovich-Danchenko]]'s Moscow Art Theatre. Stalin was known to be fond of the play ''[[Days of the Turbins]]'' (Дни Турбиных, 1926), which was based on Bulgakov's novel ''[[The White Guard]]''. His dramatization of [[Molière]]'s life in ''[[The Cabal of Hypocrites]]'' (Кабала святош, 1936) is still performed by the Moscow Art Theatre. Even after his plays were banned from the theatres, Bulgakov wrote a comedy about [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s visit into 1930s [[Moscow]]. His play ''Batum'' (Батум, 1939) about the early years of Stalin was prohibited by the premier himself. Bulgakov later reflected his experience of being a Soviet playwright in ''[[Theatrical Novel]]'' (Театральный роман, 1936, unfinished). 

Bulgakov began writing novels with ''[[The White Guard]]'' (Белая гвардия) (1923, partly published in 1925, first full edition 1927–1929, Paris) – a novel about a life of a [[White Army]] officer's family in [[Ukrainian Civil War (1917–1921)|civil war]] [[Kyiv]]. In the mid-1920s, he came to admire the works of [[H. G. Wells]] and wrote several stories and novellas with elements of [[science fiction]], notably ''[[The Fatal Eggs]]'' (Роковые яйца) (1924) and ''[[Heart of a Dog]]'' (Собачье сердце) (1925). He intended to compile his stories of the mid-twenties (published mostly in medical journals) that were based on his work as a country doctor in 1916–1918 into a collection titled ''[[A Young Doctor's Notebook|Notes of a Young Doctor]]'' (Записки юного врача), but the book came out only in 1963.<ref name="lit-arts-med-db">{{cite web|url=http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&annid=207|title=Literature Annotations: Bulgakov, Mikhail – A Country Doctor's Notebook|last=Coulehan|first=Jack|date=9 November 1999|work=Literature Arts and Medicine Database|publisher=[[New York University]]|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref>

''[[The Fatal Eggs]]'' tells of the events of a Professor Persikov, who, in experimentation with eggs, discovers a red ray that accelerates growth in living organisms. At the time, an illness passes through the chickens of Moscow, killing most of them, and to remedy the situation, the Soviet government puts the ray into use at a farm. Due to a mix-up in egg shipments, the Professor ends up with chicken eggs, while the government-run farm receives the shipment of ostrich, snake and crocodile eggs ordered by the Professor. The mistake is not discovered until the eggs produce giant monstrosities that wreak havoc in the suburbs of Moscow and kill most of the workers on the farm. The propaganda machine turns on Persikov, distorting his nature in the same way his "innocent" tampering created the monsters. This tale of a bungling government earned Bulgakov his label of counter-revolutionary.

''[[Heart of a Dog]]'' features a professor who implants human testicles and a [[pituitary gland]] into a dog named Sharik (means "Little Balloon" or "Little Ball" – a popular Russian nickname for a male dog). The dog becomes more and more human as time passes, resulting in all manner of chaos. The tale can be read as a critical satire of liberal nihilism and the communist mentality. It contains a few bold hints to the communist leadership; e.g. the name of the drunkard donor of the human organ implants is Chugunkin ("chugun" is cast iron) which can be seen as a parody on the name of Stalin ("stal'" is steel). It was adapted as a comic [[opera]] called ''The Murder of Comrade Sharik'' by [[William Bergsma]] in 1973. In 1988, an award-winning film version ''[[Heart of a Dog (1988 film)|Sobachye Serdtse]]'' was produced by [[Lenfilm]], starring [[Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev]], Roman Kartsev and [[Vladimir Tolokonnikov]].

== ''The Master and Margarita'' ==
{{main|The Master and Margarita}}
[[File:1991 CPA PC 221.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet postal stamp: prepaid postcard of 1991]]

The novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' is a critique of Soviet society and its literary establishment. The work is appreciated for its philosophical undertones and for its high artistic level, thanks to its picturesque descriptions (especially of old Jerusalem), lyrical fragments and style. It is a [[frame narrative]] involving two characteristically related time periods, or plot lines: a retelling in Bulgakov's interpretation of the [[New Testament]] and a description of contemporary Moscow.

The novel begins with [[Satan]] visiting Moscow in the 1930s, joining a conversation between a critic and a poet debating the most effective method of denying the existence of [[Jesus Christ]]. It develops into an all-embracing indictment of the corruption of communism and Soviet Russia. A story within the story portrays the interrogation of Jesus Christ by [[Pontius Pilate]] and the [[Crucifixion]].

It became the best known novel by Bulgakov. He began writing it in 1928, but the novel was finally published by his widow only in 1966, twenty-six years after his death. The book contributed a number of sayings to the Russian language, for example, "Manuscripts don't burn" and "second-grade freshness". A destroyed manuscript of the Master is an important element of the plot. Bulgakov had to rewrite the novel from memory after he burned the draft manuscript in 1930, as he could not see a future as a writer in the Soviet Union at a time of widespread political repression.

==Legacy==
===Exhibitions and museums===
*Several displays at the [[One Street Museum]] are dedicated to Bulgakov's family. Among the items presented in the museum are original photos of Mikhail Bulgakov, books and his personal belongings, and a window frame from the house where he lived. The museum also keeps scientific works of Prof. Afanasiy Bulgakov, Mikhail's father.

====Mikhail Bulgakov Museum, Kyiv====
The [[Mikhail Bulgakov Museum]] (Bulgakov House) in [[Kyiv]] has been converted to a literary museum with some rooms devoted to the writer, as well as some to his works.<ref>Inna Konchakovskaia (1902–85) a daughter of the owner (who had become a hero of Bulgakov's novel) and niece of composer [[Witold Maliszewski]] preserved the house during hard soviet times.

====The Bulgakov Museums in Moscow====
In Moscow, two museums honour the memory of Mikhail Bulgakov and ''The Master and Margarita''. Both are situated in Bulgakov's old apartment building on Bolshaya Sadovaya street nr. 10, in which parts of ''The Master and Margarita'' are set. Since the 1980s, the building has become a gathering spot for Bulgakov's fans, as well as Moscow-based [[Satanist]] groups, and had various kinds of [[graffiti]] scrawled on the walls. The numerous paintings, quips, and drawings were completely whitewashed in 2003. Previously the best drawings were kept as the walls were repainted, so that several layers of different colored paints could be seen around the best drawings.<ref>Stephen, Chris (5 February 2005). "Devil-worshippers target famous writer's Moscow flat". The Irish Times. Page 9.</ref>

There is a rivalry between the two museums, mainly maintained by the later established official Museum M.A. Bulgakov, which invariably presents itself as "the first and only Memorial Museum of Mikhail Bulgakov in Moscow".<ref>{{cite news |title=About the museum | url=http://www.bulgakovmuseum.ru/en/about |author=Galtseva, Elina |publisher=Museum M.A. Bulgakov }}</ref>

The film was officially selected for the [[1971 Cannes Film Festival]].
*''[[The Master and Margaret (1972 film)|The Master and Margaret]]'' (1972) — a joint Yugoslav-Italian drama directed by [[Aleksandar Petrović (film director)|Aleksandar Petrović]], the first adaptation of the novel of the same name, along with ''Pilate and Others''.

*''[[Pilate and Others]]'' (1972) — a German TV drama directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]], it was also a loose adaptation of ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' novel. The film focused on the biblical part of the story, and the action was moved to the modern-day [[Frankfurt]].
*''[[Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future]]'' (1973) — an adaptation of Bulgakov's science fiction/comedy play ''[[Ivan Vasilievich (play)|Ivan Vasilievich]]'' about an unexpected visit of [[Ivan the Terrible]] to the modern-day Moscow.

With 60.7 million viewers on the year of release it became the 17th most popular film ever produced in the USSR.<ref>[https://www.kinopoisk.ru/top/lists/184/ Soviet box office leaders] at [[KinoPoisk]]</ref>
*''[[Cuore di cane|Dog's Heart]]'' (1976) — a joint Italian-German science fiction/comedy film directed by [[Alberto Lattuada]]. It was the first adaptation of the ''[[Heart of a Dog]]'' satirical novel about an old scientist who tries to grow a man out of a dog.
*''[[The Days of the Turbins (1976 film)|The Days of the Turbins]]'' (1976) — a three-part Soviet TV drama directed by [[Vladimir Basov]]. It was an adaptation of the [[The Days of the Turbins|play of the same name]] which, at the same time, was Bulgakov's stage adaptation of ''The White Guard'' novel.
*''[[Heart of a Dog (1988 film)|Heart of a Dog]]'' (1988) — a Soviet black-and-white TV film directed by [[Vladimir Bortko]], the second adaptation of the novel of the same name.

*''[[The Master and Margarita (1988 TV series)|The Master and Margarita]]'' (1989) — a Polish TV drama in four parts directed by [[Maciej Wojtyszko]]. It was noted by critics as a very faithful adaptation of the original novel.
*''After the Revolution'' (1990) – a feature-length film created by András Szirtes, a Hungarian filmmaker, using a simple video camera, from 1987 to 1989. It is a very loose adaptation, but for all that, it is explicitly based on Bulgakov's novel, in a thoroughly experimental way. What you see in this film is documentary-like scenes shot in Moscow and Budapest, and New York, and these scenes are linked to the novel by some explicit links, and by these, the film goes beyond the level of being but a visual documentary which would only have reminded the viewer of The Master and Margarita.
*''[[The Master and Margarita (1994 film)|The Master and Margarita]]'' (1994) — Russian film directed by [[Yuri Kara]] in 1994 and released to public only in 2011.

*''[[The Master and Margarita (miniseries)|The Master and Margarita]]'' (2005) — Russian TV mini-series directed by Vladimir Bortko and his second adaptation of Bulgakov's writings. Screened for [[Russia-1]], it was seen by 40 million viewers on its initial release, becoming the most popular Russian TV series.<ref>[http://mignews.com/news/interview/cis/180206_192635_56773.html Vladimir Bortko about The Master and Margarita] interview to the MIGNnews.com website (in Russian)</ref>
*''[[Morphine (film)|Morphine]]'' (2008) — Russian film directed by [[Aleksei Balabanov]] loosely based on Bulgakov's autobiographical short stories ''Morphine'' and ''[[A Country Doctor's Notebook]]''. The screenplay was written by Balabanov's friend and regular collaborator [[Sergei Bodrov, Jr.]] before his tragic death in 2002.
*''[[The White Guard (TV series)|The White Guard]]'' (2012) — Russian TV mini-series produced by [[Russia-1]]. The film was shot in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Kyiv]] and released to mostly negative reviews. In 2014 the [[Ministry of Culture (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Ministry of Culture]] banned the distribution of the film, claiming that it shows "contempt for the Ukrainian language, people and state".<ref>[https://themoscowtimes.com/news/ukraine-bans-russian-films-for-distorting-historical-facts-37767 Ukraine Bans Russian Films for Distorting Historical Facts] by [[Moscow Times]], 29 July 2014.</ref>
*''[[A Young Doctor's Notebook (TV series)|A Young Doctor's Notebook]]'' (2012—2013) — British mini-series produced by [[BBC]], with [[Jon Hamm]] and [[Daniel Radcliffe]] playing main parts.

==Medical eponym==
After graduating from the Medical School in 1909, he spent the early days of his career as a venereologist, rather than pursuing his goal of being a pediatrician, as [[syphilis]] was highly prevalent during those times. It was during those early years that he described the symptoms and characteristics of syphilis affecting the bones. He described the abnormal and concomitant change of the outline of the crests of the shin-bones with a pathological worm-eaten like appearance and creation of abnormal osteophytes in the bones of those suffering from later stages of syphilis. This became known as "Bulgakov's Sign" and is commonly used in the former Soviet states, but is known as the "Bandy Legs Sign" in the west.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Surgical Diagnosis|author=Johnson, A.B.|date=1911|volume=1|publisher=D.
