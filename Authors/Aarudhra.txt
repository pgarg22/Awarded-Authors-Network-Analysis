===Tvamevaham===
''Tvamevaaham'' written in 1948 was based on the contemporary violence and lawlessness during the Razakar movement in [[Hyderabad State|the princely state of Hyderabad]].<ref name="thehindu.com1"/> The Razakar attrocoties were sponsored by the [[Nizam]] against his own people who wanted to overthrow him in favor of democracy and join the Indian Union.  In this kaavyam, death spoke to a human being and says, "you and I are the same (Tvamevaaham)".<ref name="hinduonnet.com"/><ref name="thehindu.com2"/><ref name="thehindu.com3"/><ref>Aarudra, 'Vennela-vesavi', Navodaya Publishers, Vijayawada, 1977</ref>

===The Samagra andhra Sahityam===
Aarudhra first published the SAS in 12 parts between 1965 and 1968.  It spans the Telugu literature from the 9th century [[Common Era|CE]] to modern times. He chronicled the history of Telugu Literature in 12 volumes:
# Early and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya Era]] (From 8 – 9c CE to end of 12c CE)
# [[Kakatiya dynasty]] (1200–1290 CE)
# Padmanayaka Era (1337–1399 CE)
# Reddiraju Era (1400–1450 CE)
# Early Rayala ([[Vijayanagara]]) (1450–1500 CE)
# Later Rayala (Vijayanagara) (1500–1550 CE)
# [[Nawab]]s (1550–1600 CE)
# Nayaka Kings (1600–1670 CE)
# Later Nayaka Kings (1670–1750 CE)
# [[East India Company]] (1750–1850 CE)
# [[Zamindar]]i (1850–1900 CE)
# Modern (1900 CE onwards)

===How is Sita related to Rama?===
''Ramudiki Sita Yemautundi?'' or ''How is Sita related to Rama?'', put before the public the riddle of [[Mandodari]], [[Sita]] and [[Hanuman]] and their origins in a lucid and scholarly way.<ref name="thehindu.com2"/><ref name="thehindu.com3"/> It was a bold attempt at cracking the [[Valmiki]]-[[Ramayana]] code and in the process de-mystified the story of Rama to the middle-class, literate, modern day Telugu reader.
<ref name="auto1">Aarudra, 'Ramudiki Seetemautundi? 'Vishalandra Publishing House, Hyderabad, 1978.</ref><ref name="thehindu.com1"/>

The book explores the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] sources of the story of [[Rama]].<ref name="thehindu.com1"/> It also surveys the Khotan Siam ([[Thai people|Thai]]), [[Laos]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the story of Rama. Here is a sampling from the  'Dasaratha Jataka ', a Buddhist Tale:
<blockquote>Buddha narrates the 'Dasaratha Jataka' tale to a householder who was grieving the death of his son....Long long ago.. Dasaratha was the king of Varanasi.<ref name="auto2"/> He had sixteen thousand wives.The Queen had two sons and a daughter.The eldest son was called Ramapundit and the younger one was called Laxmanpundit.The daughter was called Sitadevi. The Queen dies after sometime. Dasaratha marries again, and comes to like her the most. She begets a son named Bharata...When Ramapundit returns from the forest, he marries Sita and rules for 16000 years...Bodhisatta concludes the story stating that Dasaratha was none other than Shuddhodana (Father of Buddha) in an earlier reincarnation. Similarly, Sita was none other than Rahulmata(Mother of Rahul or Wife of Buddha) and Ramapundit was none other than Buddha himself.</blockquote><ref name="thehindu.com1"/>

Aarudra's questions like "How is Sita related to Rama?" or "Were they just Husband and wife?" may sound naive or sacrilegious but a serious study of [[Genealogy|genealogies]], as revealed from different sources, logically leads to them. To deny the existence of such stories, per Arudra, would amounted to intellectual dishonesty.
