'''Kim Harrison''' (born 1966) is a pen name of American author '''Dawn Cook'''. Kim is best known as the author of the New York Times #1 best selling Hollows series, but she has written more than urban fantasy and has published over two dozen books spanning the gamut from young adult, accelerated-science thriller, anthology, and a unique, full-color world book, and has scripted two original graphic novels set in the Hollows universe. She has also published traditional fantasy under the name Dawn Cook.

The [[Hollows (series)|Rachel Morgan]] [[urban fantasy]] series is set in an [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] in which a worldwide [[pandemic]] caused by [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified tomatoes]] led to the death of a large portion of the world's human population. Under the name of Dawn Cook, she writes the Decoy Princess and Truth series, published in the first few years of the 21st century.

Harrison has received praise from fellow authors, and has reached the #1 spot on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=The Peri Reed Chronicles Books By Kim Harrison |work=simonandschuster.com |access-date=June 18, 2016 |url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/series/The-Peri-Reed-Chronicles}}</ref>

On May 16, 2019, Harrison announced on social media that a new novel, ''American Demon'', will be forthcoming in the summer of 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harrison announce new book |url=https://www.facebook.com/KimHarrisonsHollows/photos/a.105137494939/10157416363979940/?type=3&theater |website=Facebook |access-date=16 May 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kim Harrison was born and raised in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. A self-proclaimed "former tomboy,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kimharrison.net/KimsBio.html  |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709200813/http://kimharrison.net/KimsBio.html  |url-status = dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012  |title=Kim's Bio |work=Kim Harrison's website |date=June 10, 2007  |access-date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> she grew up the only girl in a family of boys.  Despite her love of writing, she took an unorthodox approach to it, and claims to have avoided English courses beyond the basic requirements in high school and college.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/04a/kh197.htm |title=A Conversation With Kim Harrison |first=Alisa |last=McCune |work=SF Site |date=March 2005 |access-date=May 31, 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
Harrison began her career with writing traditional [[science fiction]], but began writing [[contemporary fantasy]] after deciding to focus more on character development. She spent the better part of a decade struggling as an aspiring author before meeting her current agent at a writing convention. He then introduced her to Diana Gill, who became Harrison's editor. Together, they produced ''Dead Witch Walking'', and her first book was published in paperback by HarperTorch in 2004. Since then, she has written twelve more books, two graphic novels, and extensive world book in the [[Hollows (series)|''Hollows'' series]], also called the Rachel Morgan series, (most with titles punning off [[Clint Eastwood]] movies) and contributed to multiple anthologies, with prequels to the ''Hollows'' books, and one with a young adult story.

After the success of her first novel, Harrison was able to resign from her day job, devoting herself to writing full-time. Her favorite author is [[Ray Bradbury]]. She references music as one of her strongest writing influences, providing song lists for several of her characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kimharrison.net/TTO.htm |title=The Music  |work=Kim Harrison's website |date=May 31, 2009 |access-date=May 31, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In her spare time, she communicates with fans via her self-maintained website and blog.

Harrison is a member of the International Thriller Writers.<ref>http://thrillerwriters.org/members/</ref>

The first two Truth books were originally one book, which was split into two separate books for publishing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasy-news.com/2008/07/19/dawn-cook-interview-english/ |title=Dawn Cook Interview (english) |access-date=August 4, 2008 |author=Dark Star |date=July 19, 2008 |publisher=fantasy-news.com }}</ref> That the two are the same, and that Cook was Harrison, was disclosed in a May 2009 ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' magazine article.<ref name=locus>{{cite journal |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2009/05/kim-harrison-secret-identity.html |title=Kim Harrison: Secret Identity |journal=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=May 2009 |access-date=May 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529172358/http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2009/05/kim-harrison-secret-identity.html |archive-date=2009-05-29 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

<blockquote>"I'm glad it's out in the open, because it is hard to maintain these two separate identities, and remind your friends or family when you go out, 'I'm Kim today, so don't call me Dawn.' The division has served its purpose. I'm still going to be Kim, but now if somebody calls me Dawn I won't have to say 'Shut your mouth!'"<ref name=locus /></blockquote>
