'''Gwyneth Lewis''' (born 1959) is a Welsh poet, who was the inaugural [[National Poet of Wales]] in 2005. She wrote the text that appears over the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].

==Biography==
Gwyneth Lewis was born into a [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking family in [[Cardiff]]. Her father started teaching her English when her mother went into hospital to give birth to her sister.<ref>[http://books.guardian.co.uk/poetry/features/0,,1950793,00.html The poet Gwyneth Lewis on how she learned English in secret with her father |By genre |Guardian Unlimited Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Lewis attended [[Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen]], a bilingual school near [[Pontypridd]], and then studied at [[Girton College, Cambridge]], [[University of Cambridge]], where she was a member of Cymdeithas Y Mabinogi. She was awarded a double first in English literature and the Laurie Hart Prize for outstanding intellectual work. Lewis then studied creative writing at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], before receiving a D. Phil in English from [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], for a thesis on 18th-century literary forgery featuring the work of [[Iolo Morganwg]].<ref name="swan.ac.uk">[http://www.swan.ac.uk/english/crew/welshwriters/glewis.htm CREW Welsh Writers Online: Gwyneth Lewis<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930232055/http://www.swan.ac.uk/english/crew/welshwriters/glewis.htm |date=30 September 2007}}</ref>

Lewis was made a [[Harkness Fellow]] and worked as a freelance journalist in New York for three years. She then returned to Cardiff as a documentary producer and director at [[BBC Wales]].<ref name="swan.ac.uk"/> She left the BBC in 2001 after receiving a £75,000 grant from the [[NESTA|National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts]] to carry out research and sail to ports linked historically with the inhabitants of her native Cardiff.

Lewis later wrote the words which appear over the [[Wales Millennium Centre]], which opened in November 2004. The same words form the title of [[Karl Jenkins]]'s cantata ''[[In These Stones Horizons Sing]]'', which is partly set to lyrics by Gwyneth Lewis. In 2005 she was elected Honorary Fellow of [[Cardiff University]]. The same year she was made the first [[National Poet of Wales]].<ref>[http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=humbul16020 Intute: Arts and Humanities – Full record details for Gwyneth Lewis : Wales' first national poet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/4594091.stm BBC NEWS |Wales |Mid Wales |'Poet for ever' urges laureate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Lewis was a judge for the 2011 [[Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine]]. On 6 August 2012, Gwyneth Lewis won Y Goron (the Crown) at the [[National Eisteddfod]] at [[Llandow]] for a collection of poems on the set title of ''Ynys'' (Island).

===Music===
Lewis entered the world of music in partnership with [[Richard Chew]]. ''Redflight/ Barcud'' was her first [[libretto]], commissioned and presented by [[Welsh National Opera]] with pupils from Ysgol Capel y Cynfab, Cynghordy and Ysgol Cil-y-cwm. ''The Most Beautiful Man from the Sea'' is an [[oratorio]] for 600 voices, with music by Chew and [[Orlando Gough]]. It was given its world première at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] by the Chorus of Welsh National Opera and 500 amateur singers.

===Personal life===
Married to Leighton, a former [[Boatswain|bosun]] with the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]], Lewis has had a well documented battle in the past with [[clinical depression]] and [[alcoholism]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4654102.stm BBC NEWS |Health |Celebrity health – Gwyneth Lewis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="harpercollins.com">[http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060823245/Two_in_a_Boat/index.aspx Two in a Boat: The True Story of a Marital Rite of Passage by Gwyneth Lewis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her personal battles inspired her first book, ''Sunbathing in the Rain: A Cheerful Book on Depression'' and also a collection of poems, ''Keeping Mum – Voices from Therapy''.

Having agreed to change their lifestyles for their own good, Lewis and her husband bought the small yacht ''Jameeleh'', taught themselves to sail, and set out to cross the Ocean to Africa. The journey inspired her 2005 book ''Two in a Boat – The True Story of a Marital Rite of Passage''.<ref name="harpercollins.com"/>
