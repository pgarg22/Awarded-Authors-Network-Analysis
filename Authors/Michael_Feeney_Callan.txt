He wrote the template Irish police drama series, ''The Burke Enigma'', starring [[Donal McCann]], and ''Love Is'', starring [[Gabriel Byrne]], and went on to write and direct a number of television programmes, among them ''The Beach Boys Today'', a film that marked the band's 30th anniversary. He has published several novels and has written biographies of [[Sean Connery]], [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Richard Harris]]. His biography of [[Robert Redford]] (''Robert Redford: The Biography''; Knopf, 2011) was chosen by the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' as one of its recommended Best Books of 2011. In 2013, he published his second volume of poetry, ''An Argument for Sin''.

==Books==
{{Lacking ISBN|section|date=November 2014}}
Callan won the Hennessy Literary Award for his short story, ''Baccy'', and was anthologised in ''Best Irish Short Stories'' (Elek, London, 1978).<ref>{{cite web |title=New Irish Writing – Hennessy Literary Awards: Winners through the decades |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/hennessy-niw/new-irish-writing-hennessy-literary-awards-winners-through-the-decades-1.2076877 |website=IrishTimes.com |publisher=IrishTimes.com |access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref> Thereafter he diversified widely, publishing fiction and non-fiction.<ref name="Michael Feeney Callan's books in print">[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=michael+feeney+callan Michael Feeney Callan's books in print], http://www.amazon.com; accessed 16 December 2014.</ref>

Callan wrote a series of British television adaptation novels of differing genres, including ''Capital City'' ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]), ''Target: The Bronze Heist'' ([[Target (UK TV series)|Target]]), ''Sweet Sixteen'' and ''Jockey School'' (all [[BBC]]), and the novel ''Lovers and Dancers'', set in Ireland during the famine. ''Lovers and Dancers'' was inspired by [[Anthony Trollope]]'s early writing and was reissued by Random House in the mid-1990s. In 2002, Callan published ''Did You Miss Me?'', a novel exploring difficult female themes which was issued in a revised version in 2014.<ref name="Independent.ie Did You Miss Me?

Callan has written biographies of [[Sean Connery]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and longtime friend [[Richard Harris]]. The Connery book was referred to as "a necessity for Connery and Bond fans" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and is the sole reference work on Connery quoted in [[Albert "Cubby" Broccoli]]'s autobiography. A new edition, revised and updated to cover Connery's formal retirement, was published by Nouveau Monde Editions, Paris, in March 2012.<ref name="Michael Feeney Callan's books in print"/>

For fifteen years from the mid-nineties, Callan travelled throughout the United States interviewing more than 300 sources for ''Robert Redford: The Biography'' (Knopf, 2011). The book was written with the co-operation of Redford, who traveled to Ireland to work with Callan and provided access to his diaries, scripts and personal records. In the course of its preparation, Callan spent extensive time with many of Redford's key collaborators. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' selected ''Robert Redford: The Biography'' as one of its 10 Best Movie Books of 2011. ''Robert Redford: The Biography'' was published in mass market paperback by [[Vintage Books]] in 2012.<ref name="Vintage 2012 Robert Redford: The Biography">{{cite web |last1=Feeney Callan |first1=Michael |title=Robert Redford: The Biography |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23035/robert-redford-by-michael-feeney-callan/ |website=Penguin Random House |publisher=Vintage |access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref>

==Writing for radio and television==
Callan began writing for radio at the outset of his career. He adapted ''The Dead Secret'' by [[Wilkie Collins]] and ''Scales of Justice'' by Dame [[Ngaio Marsh]] for RTÉ Radio, and wrote the original plays ''The Train'' and ''Tripp''. He contributed more than 20 plays to the Dan Treston-produced series Treasure House, dramatising the lives of scientists and artists from [[Johannes Kepler]] to [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[H.G. Wells]].<ref name="IE UCDA P261">{{cite web |title=RTÉ Radio Drama and Variety Scripts |url=https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/item4title,234450,en.html#accordion2 |website=UCD.ie/archives |publisher=UCD.ie/archives |access-date=1 July 2011}}</ref>

Callan's first screenplay was the crime series ''The Burke Enigma'', a six-hour film production for [[RTÉ]], which starred [[Ray McAnally]] and [[Donal McCann]], and went forward as RTÉ's drama entry for the 1979 [[Prix Italia]].<ref name="imdb">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1000527 Callan profile], IMDb.com; accessed 25 November 2014.</ref> According to Callan, this work was "influenced by the [[film noir]] I loved as a kid, and by [[Robert Altman]]'s (filming) style."<ref>{{cite web |title=Irish Film & TV Index |url=https://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=61916 |website=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |access-date=13 August 2013}}</ref> Subsequently, Callan joined [[BBC television drama]] in London, where he story-edited the detective series ''[[Shoestring (TV series)|Shoestring]]''. Simultaneously, at [[ITV Network|ITV]], he wrote for the action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. In the 1980s, Callan collaborated with [[Frederick Forsyth]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service]]-aired adaptations of Forsyth's stories ''Privilege'' and ''A Careful Man'' (Mobil Showcase).<ref name="imdb"/>

Collaborating with [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], Callan was commissioned in 1987 by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] to write ''The Negotiator'', based on a treatment by Forsyth. The series was announced but never filmed and Forsyth later redeveloped the outline into a novel. He was commissioned to write a two part episode for the BBC of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (entitled "[[The Children of January]]"). This was in final revision when the series was suspended under Jonathan Nathan-Turner's tenure as producer in 1985.<ref name="imdb"/>

On his website, Callan responded to an enquiry on this subject thus:<blockquote>I wrote a two-parter called ''The Children of January''. It was to be a season closer, not a series termination. But the BBC decided in mid-season that the show had run its course and, in the middle eighties, I think they were right. But I loved my episode, which was delivered late in 1985. I created a race of runaway proto-humans called the Z'ros, sort of 'human bees', of which I still have the fondest nightmares. ''The Children of January'', incidentally, refers to renegade outcasts of a dawning "parallel universe" civilisation that was abandoned.</blockquote>

In 2011, Callan wrote and produced Channel 4's ''Sounds from the Cities''. The series was presented by actor Mathew Horne, and featured live performances from Imelda May, K.T. Tunstall, Jon Fratelli, Joy Formidable and Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals.<ref name="imdb"/>

==About ''Doctor Who: The Children of January''<ref name=":0">http://www.galactical.co.uk</ref><ref name=":1">''Callan's other production ideas''</ref>==
The story features the Doctor and Peri in the TARDIS, land on a desert planet that's conquered by the unmerciful Z’ros. Peri complains that the planet they are on is no fun for her, so the Doctor tries to essentially take her to another planet, but the Z’ros army catches them and the leader of the Z’ros commands them to kill the travelers. The leader of ‘The Children of January’-the outcasts, convinces the Z’ros leader to release the travelers and spare their lives. The Doctor tells Peri to remain in the time machine to keep an eye on the TARDIS, while the Doctor walks with the outcast leader, and the leader explains what happened on the planet they are standing on now. ‘The Children of January’ were a poor race whilst there planet was drying up and nobody could save it. The Z’ros realized that the poor alien villagers were useless to live, and a space ship fleet of them killed almost every one. The Doctor heads back to the where his ship landed, all the sudden, a Z’ros laser cannon was attacking the TARDIS. The Doctor tells the Z’ros commander to stop and negotiate the war problem. The Z’ros commander, however, enforces the Doctor to surrender, then he tricks them and gets to his ship. Peri recovers, and the Doctor and Peri plan on exploding the Z’ros ship, and leave the Z’ros stranded on the planet. The Z’ros guards tell the leader and everyone to quickly escape the ship. The Doctor tells the Z’ros leader to now make peace with the outcasts in order help the planet thrive. The Doctor and Peri then go about travels again.<ref name=":1" />(<note>''-Also a fan theory considered.)''<br />

'''Failed Adaptations'''

Originally, [[Big Finish Productions]] planned on adapting “The Children of January”, but these plans were ultimately dropped due to Callan's other commitments.<ref name=":2" />

==Film and directing==
Callan made a significant contribution to the regeneration of the film industry in Ireland during the 1980s. Joining Morgan O'Sullivan's pioneering production set-up, Tara Productions, Callan collaborated in a strategy to acquire the defunct National Film Studios (as [[Ardmore Studios]] was then named), alter film investment law and attract Hollywood-based co-production into Ireland. Ardmore Studios was bought in partnership with the NEA and MTM Hollywood in November 1986.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Redford by Michael Feeney Callan |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/2011/05/03/robert-redford-by-michael-feeney-callan/ |website=KnopfDoubleDay.com |publisher=Knopf Double Day |access-date=3 May 2011}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Callan started directing. His directorial debut was with the six-part series ''My Riviera'', in which [[Roger Moore]], [[James Coburn]], [[Sylvia Kristel]], [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Joan Collins]] reviewed personal favourite places along the [[Côte d'Azur]], an area Callan has frequented since the 1980s. The series was screened on ITV and throughout the world. In 1993 Callan wrote, produced and directed ''The Beach Boys Today'', a co-production with RTÉ, documenting the final touring days of the [[Carl Wilson]]-led [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]. He then made the documentary ''Back to Enchantment'', about animators [[Gary Goldman]] and [[Don Bluth]] ([[An American Tail]], [[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]), which tied in with the release of Warner Bros' [[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]].<ref name="imdb"/>

In 1994 Callan wrote, co-produced and co-directed [[Perry Como]]'s final concert for PBS. Como, then in his 80th year, was unwell during the filming, but expressed himself exhilarated by the experience and later said that he had always wished to end his career in Ireland. After a decade working on the Redford project, in 2005 Callan resumed directing with the film ''[[Luke Kelly]]: The Performer'', which topped DVD charts in Ireland for eight weeks, achieving platinum sales status. According to Callan, the project was "a wonderful fusion, part biography, part musical. It covered so much of the ground I love, the poetic stuff that inspires me."<ref name="imdb"/>

In November 2010 Callan co-founded an interactive television-based resource for new artists and musicians, BOBCOM. As part of its creative incentive scheme, in July 2011 Callan wrote and directed the two-day ''Magical History Tour'' event in Liverpool, culminating with a 7-hour live session from the [[Cavern Club]] streamed on YouTube. The event included a re-creation of [[The Beatles]]' 1967 magic bus tour and a re-creation of the day in July 1957 when [[John Lennon]] met [[Paul McCartney]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BOBCOM: The magical History Tour |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wakXirfr9tU |website=YouTube.com |publisher=YouTube BOBCOM |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=BOBCOM: The magical History Tour |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwKb8I_uz_0 |website=YouTube.com |publisher=YouTube.com |access-date=21 July 2011}}</ref>

Also in 2011, he produced and directed the start-up episodes of The 2UBE Live from LIPA (the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts), a student production that was streamed on [[YouTube]].<ref name= "YouTube">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc9BqGhyfG0 BOBCOM presents The 2ube Ep. 1], youtube.com; accessed 26 November 2014.</ref>

==Painting==
Callan's art, in watercolour, oils and bronze sculpture, has been exhibited by the Blue Leaf Gallery in Dublin. ''[[Irish Times]]'' art critic Aidan Dunne described his work as "a love affair with French painting", reflecting Callan's interest in [[L'École de Nice]]. Callan started painting in [[Chateauneuf de Grasse]] in the South of France in the eighties and titled his first exhibition, staged at Dublin's Blue Leaf Marino gallery in May 2002, ''A Workshop in France''.<ref>[http://www.blueleafgallery.com Blue Leaf Gallery official website]; accessed 20 November 2014.</ref>
