'''Eleanor Alice Hibbert''' ([[Maiden and married names|née]] '''Burford'''; 1 September 1906 – 18 January 1993) was an English author who combined imagination with facts to bring history alive through novels of fiction and [[Romance novel#Historical romance|romance]]. She was a prolific writer who published several books a year in different literary genres, each [[genre]] under a different [[pen name]]: [[Eleanor Hibbert#Jean Plaidy|Jean Plaidy]] for fictionalized history of European royalty; [[Eleanor Hibbert#Victoria Holt|Victoria Holt]] for [[Gothic fiction#New Gothic romances|gothic romances]], and [[Eleanor Hibbert#Philippa Carr|Philippa Carr]] for a multi-generational [[family saga]]. A literary split personality, she also wrote light romances, crime novels, murder mysteries and thrillers under the various [[pseudonyms]] [[Eleanor Hibbert#Eleanor Burford|Eleanor Burford]], [[Eleanor Hibbert#Elbur Ford|Elbur Ford]], [[Eleanor Hibbert#Kathleen Kellow|Kathleen Kellow]], [[Eleanor Hibbert#Anna Percival|Anna Percival]], and [[Eleanor Hibbert#Ellalice Tate|Ellalice Tate]].

Hibbert's ''Philippa Carr'' novels were based partly in [[Cornwall]] and partly in Australia.

Hibbert was influenced in her writing by the [[Brontë]]s (especially the novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]''), [[George Eliot]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Victor Hugo]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]].<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

===Early work===
During the 1930s, Hibbert wrote nine long novels (each about 150,000 words in length), all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life.<ref name="hibbert_smh_1974-02-24">{{cite news | title= 'Little old lady' whose books sell millions | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19740224&id=aPhjAAAAIBAJ&pg=890,8983648 |author= L. V. Kepert |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald | date= 24 February 1974 |access-date= 28 August 2014}}</ref> However, none of these were accepted for publication. At the same time, she wrote short stories for newspapers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]]''. Some also appeared in ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'', ''[[Woman's Realm]]'' and ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The turning point came when fiction editor of the ''Daily Mail'' told her, "You're barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction."

Hibbert read 50 romance novels as research and then published her first fiction book, ''Daughter of Anna'', in 1941.<ref name="hibbert_hah_2012-11-30">{{cite web | title= The Many Facets of Victoria Holt | url= http://www.heroesandheartbreakers.com/blogs/2012/11/the-many-facets-of-victoria-holt | author= Janga | publisher= Heroes and Heartbreakers, Macmillan | date= 30 November 2012 |access-date= 26 August 2014}}</ref> It was a period novel set in Australia of the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was a moderate success and Hibbert received £30 as advance for it. The book was published under her maiden name, ''Eleanor Burford'', which was also used for her contemporary novels. Following the success of the book, Hibbert was contracted by [[Barrie & Jenkins|Herbert Jenkins]] publishers to write one book a year. By 1961 Hibbert had published 31 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for [[Mills & Boon]].

===Pseudonyms===
[[File:Plaidy Beach, Looe - geograph.org.uk - 208195.jpg|thumb|left|Plaidy Beach near [[Looe]], [[Cornwall]]]]
In 1945, she chose the pseudonym ''Jean Plaidy'' for her new novel ''Together They Ride'' at the request of her agent.<ref name="DID"/> The name was inspired by [[Plaidy, Cornwall|Plaidy Beach]] near the Hibberts' home in [[Looe]], [[Cornwall]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="hibbert_baltimore"/> Her agent suggested the first name, saying "''Jean'' doesn't take much room at the back of the book".<ref name="DID"/> The book was published by Gerald G. Swan, a London publisher.<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/> The next book written under the ''Jean Plaidy'' pseudonym was ''Beyond the Blue Mountains'' in 1948. The publisher Robert Hale accepted the 500-page manuscript after it had been rejected by several others. The firm wrote to Hibbert's literary agency, [[List of UK literary agencies|A.M. Heath]], "Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?".<ref name="hibbert_ind"/> In 1949, Hibbert hit her stride with the first ''Jean Plaidy'' novel that fictionalized stories of royalty: ''The King's Pleasure'', featuring [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref name="hibbert_sh_2007-11">{{cite web | title= The Queen of Historical Fiction | url= http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/subpages/plaidy.html |author= Susan Higginbotham |publisher=  Solander, the magazine of the Historical Novel Society | date= November 2007 |access-date= 28 August 2014}}</ref> A total of 91 ''Jean Plaidy'' novels were published. Hibbert's last ''Jean Plaidy'' book, ''The Rose Without a Thorn'', was published posthumously.<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

Hibbert also wrote four non-fiction books under the pseudonym ''Jean Plaidy''. The first, ''A Triptych of Poisoners'' (1958), was a collection of short biographies of poisoners: [[Cesare Borgia]], [[Madame de Brinvilliers|Marie d'Aubray]] and [[Edward William Pritchard]]. The other three were a trilogy on the [[Spanish Inquisition]]: ''The Rise'' (1959), ''The Growth'' (1960) and ''The End'' (1961).

From 1950 to 1953, Hibbert wrote four novels as ''Elbur Ford'', a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. These novels were based on real-life murderers of the nineteenth century:  [[Edward William Pritchard]] (''Flesh and the Devil'', 1950); [[Pimlico Mystery|Adelaide Bartlett]] (''Poison in Pimlico'', 1950); [[Euphrasie Mercier]]<ref name="hibbert_nyt_1886-04-25">{{cite news | title= The story of Euphrasie Mercier's career: Murdering her mistress, assuming her character, and concealing the crime for nearly four years. | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/04/25/103104308.pdf | newspaper = New York Times | date= 11 April 1886 | access-date= 26 August 2014 }}</ref> (''The Bed Disturbed'', 1952) and [[Constance Kent]] (''Such Bitter Business'', 1953 – published in the U.S. in 1954 under the title ''Evil in the House'').

Between 1952 and 1960, Hibbert used the [[pseudonym]] ''Kathleen Kellow'' to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961, she wrote five novels as ''Ellalice Tate'', a pseudonym inspired by her mother's name, Alice Tate.<ref name="hibbert_ap">{{cite news | title= Eleanor Hibbert; Wrote As Victoria Holt, Jean Plaidy | url= http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930121&slug=1681063|work= The Seattle Times|date= 21 January 1993|access-date=18 April 2014 }}</ref>

In 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, [[Patricia Schartle Myrer]], she wrote her first Gothic romance, ''[[Mistress of Mellyn]]'', under the name ''Victoria Holt''.

''[[Mistress of Mellyn]]'' was a clever weaving of elements from earlier Gothic novels such as ''[[Jane Eyre|Jane Eyre (1847)]]'', ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White (1859)]]'', and ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca (1938)]]''.

In 1960, Hibbert wrote a novel under the name ''Anna Percival'', a pseudonym inspired by her husband's middle name, Percival. Hibbert never used that pen name again.

She created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with [[World War II]].<ref name="hibbert_ind"/>

Hibbert continued to use the pseudonym ''Jean Plaidy'' for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.<ref name="hibbert_eb">{{cite encyclopedia | title= Eleanor Alice Hibbert | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/264785/Eleanor-Alice-Hibbert |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=18 April 2014 }}</ref>

===Research===
Hibbert based her research on the writings of British historians such as [[John Speed]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[Alexander Fraser Tytler]] and [[Agnes Strickland]].<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

Each of Hibbert's ''Jean Plaidy'' books featured a bibliography at the end, listing the historical works consulted during the process of writing the book.<ref name="hibbert_">{{cite book | title= Sequels: An Annotated Guide to Novels in Series | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tBUlCAwAtNwC&q=Jean+Plaidy&pg=PA546 |author= Janet Husband, Jonathan F. Husband |publisher= American Library Association | date=2009 |access-date= 31 August 2014|isbn = 9780838909676}}</ref>
 
The [[Kensington Central Library]] gave Hibbert special concessions to aid her research. She was allowed to go down to the vault where the out-of-circulation books were stored, and borrow them a trolley-load at a time.<ref name="hibbert_smh_1972-02-04"/> She was even allowed to take the books home and keep them as long as she wanted.<ref name="hibbert_rt_1981"/>

When her eyesight started failing towards the end of her life, she borrowed [[audiobook]]s from the [[Westminster City Council]] public libraries.<ref name="hibbert_ind"/>

===Writing discipline===
Hibbert was a prolific writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseudonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr.<ref name="hibbert_nyt_1983-01-30">{{cite news | title= The Price Perplex | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/books/paperback-talk-the-price-perplex.html | author= Judith Appelbaum |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 30 January 1983 |access-date=18 April 2014 | author-link= Judith Appelbaum }}</ref><ref name="hibbert_latimes">{{cite news | title= Eleanor Hibbert; Prolific Romance Novelist | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-22/news/mn-1606_1_eleanor-hibbert|work= LA Times|date= 22 January 1993 |access-date=18 April 2014 }}</ref> ''Jean Plaidy'' proved very popular in the United Kingdom, selling large quantities in paperback while ''Victoria Holt'' was a bestseller in the United States.

Hibbert attributed her large output to her regular working habits. She described herself as a compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the [[typewriter]] on her desk, usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime.<ref name="hibbert_hah_2012-11-30"/> Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, in addition to the time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at [[Kensington Central Library]]. In the evening, she played [[chess]] if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.<ref name="DID"/>

Even while on her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert maintained her discipline. She wrote in the mornings, played [[chess]] in the afternoons, and joined in the shipboard entertainments in the evenings. She preferred to work on her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship because they did not require as much research or fact-checking at a library.<ref name="hibbert_smh-1970-03-01"/>

=== Literary agents and publishers ===
Eleanor Hibbert enjoyed healthy, lifelong relationships with her literary agents and publishers, a rare feat in the publishing world.<ref name="hibbert_ind"/> She was represented in the United Kingdom by A.M. Heath Literary Agency and by [[McIntosh & Otis]] in the United States. Her long-time American agent was [[Patricia Schartle Myrer]] followed by Julie Fallowfield.

London publisher [[Barrie & Jenkins|Herbert Jenkins]] published 20 light romantic novels from 1941 to 1955 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name ''Eleanor Burford''. The contract, initially for one book a year at an advance of £30 a title, was later revised to two books a year when the books proved successful.<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

[[Mills and Boon]], a London publisher that specialised in low-priced, paperback, romantic novels brought out 10 romance novels from 1956 to 1962 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name ''Eleanor Burford''.

Gerald G Swan published the first ''Jean Plaidy'' book in 1945 but every one after that was published by Robert Hale. Starting with ''Beyond the Blue Mountains (1948)'' and extending over the entire course of her lifetime, Robert Hale published a total of 90 Jean Plaidy books in hardcover with dust jackets illustrated by specialist artist Philip Gough.<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

MacRae Smith Co. of Philadelphia published ''Jean Plaidy'' titles in the United States. Foreign language editions of ''Jean Plaidy'' books began appearing in 1956: in French by [[Éditions Robert Laffont]], [[Paris]]; in Spanish by Guillermo Kraft Limitada, [[Buenos Aires]]; and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by Uitgeverij A.J. Luitingh, [[Amsterdam]].

In 1951, Canadian paperback publishers [[Harlequin Enterprises|Harlequin]] reprinted ''Jean Plaidy'''s ''Beyond the Blue Mountains'' in paperback to achieve their greatest commercial success to that date: of the 30,000 copies sold, only 48 were returned.<ref name="hibbert_wirten">Hemmungs Wirten (1998), p. 63.</ref>

Robert Hale published eight ''Kathleen Kellow'' crime and mystery novels between 1952 and 1960 in hardcover with dust jackets by Philip Gough. Robert Hale also published the sole book written under the ''Anna Percival'' pseudonym, ''The Brides of Lanlory''.<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

From 1950 to 1953, four ''Elbur Ford'' crime novels were published by London publisher [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]] in the United Kingdom and New York publisher [[Thomas Werner Laurie|Werner Laurie]] in the United States.

From 1956 to 1961, [[Hodder & Stoughton]] published all five historical novels written under the pseudonym ''Ellalice Tate''.<ref name="hibbert_dalby"/>

From 1960 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 32 ''Victoria Holt'' novels for the publishing giants [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]] in the United Kingdom and [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in the United States. Many of them were bestsellers and were translated into 20 languages to reach a worldwide audience.

From 1972 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 19 ''Philippa Carr'' novels that were published by [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]] in the United Kingdom and [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]] in the United States. A few of them were later translated into foreign languages such as [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], [[Finnish (language)|Finnish]], [[Russian (language)|Russian]] and [[Polish (language)|Polish]].

By the time of her death in 1993, Hibbert had sold 75 million books translated in 20 languages under the name ''Victoria Holt'', 14 million under the name ''Jean Plaidy'' and 3 million under the name ''Philippa Carr''.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="hibbert_goodreads">{{cite web | title= Eleanor Alice Burford | url= https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32.Philippa_Carr |publisher= GoodReads |access-date=18 April 2014 }}</ref>

After her death, Mark Hamilton of the A.M. Heath Literary Agency took over as executor for her literary estate, estimated to be worth about £8,790,807 at probate.<ref name="hibbert_oup"/><ref name="hibbert_hamilton">{{cite book | title= Front Matter of the novel 'The Rose Without a Thorn' | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JX9iipKI-3EC&pg=PT328 |author=Jean Plaidy|publisher=Three Rivers Press | date=17 February 2010|isbn = 9780307497611|access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

===Reception and legacy===

==== 20th century ====
''Jean Plaidy'' historical novels were welcomed by readers who found them to be an easy way to gain insight into a sweeping panorama of European history.

It was common for school girls in England to read these in history lessons, whilst hiding them behind their proper text books.

In the last decade of the 20th century, historical fiction went out of fashion. ''Jean Plaidy'' titles went out of print.

==== 21st century ====
In October 2001, Rachel Kahan, associate editor at [[Crown Publishing Group]], and ''Jean Plaidy'' fan since childhood, discovered that ''Jean Plaidy'' books had gone out of print in the United States.
{{Quote box|width=17.5em|bgcolor=#FFFDBF|quote="I felt awful – like when you learn that an old friend who you haven't seen for many years has suddenly died. But in this case, I was not just a fan mourning the loss of all those great novels, I was actually in a position to do something about it."<br/> —Rachel Kahan, on discovering in 2003 that ''Jean Plaidy'' books had gone out of print in the United States.<ref name="hibbert_sh_2007-11"/>}}

Kahan bought the reprint rights to ten ''Jean Plaidy'' novels. In April 2003, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]] chose to publish two books under the [[Three Rivers Press]] imprint, both featuring [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. ''The Lady in the Tower'' and ''The Rose Without a Thorn'' tell the story of two of his six wives, [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Catherine Howard]], both of whom were [[decapitation|beheaded]]. The books were published in paperback with new titles, modern covers and a readers' guide at the back. The first printing of 30,000 copies of each book sold out in 3 months. Based on this success, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]]'s United Kingdom unit, Arrow Books, bought the entire ''Jean Plaidy'' [[backlist]].<ref name="hibbert_kahan_2005-11-30">{{cite news|title=Historical Fiction |url=http://www.irenegoodman.com/2005_11_01_archive.html |author=Rachel Kahan |publisher=Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |work=Irene Goodman Literary Agency website |date=30 November 2005 |access-date=6 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520082337/http://www.irenegoodman.com/2005_11_01_archive.html |archive-date=20 May 2006 }}</ref>

===Reprints===

==== Three Rivers Press editions ====
In the Spring of 2003 [[Three Rivers Press]], an imprint of U.S.A. publisher [[Crown Publishing Group]], started republishing Jean Plaidy's stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Donahue |first=Dick |title=Love & history --- a perfect match |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |volume=248 |date=12 November 2001 |issue=46 |pages=24–30 |quote=Eight years after her death, Eleanor Hibbert (1906–1993)--aka Jean Plaidy, Victoria Halt and Philippa Carr – continues to ride a wave of historical romance popularity. Last month, Three Rivers Press inked a deal with Hibbert's agent, Elizabeth Winick of McIntosh and Otis Inc., to reissue 10 Jean Plaidy books in trade paperback. 'They're going to do a guaranteed first printing of 30,000 to 35,000,' says Winick, who in just the past few weeks has also received requests from Eastern Europe to reprint several Plaidy titles. Crown associate editor Rachel Kahan, who acquired the books, adds, 'We have gotten a lot of good feedback about the books from our reps. We're going to publish two a season, and we'll redesign the covers to give them a really elegant look.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Dyer |first=Lucinda |title=To be continued: publishers and authors are finding clever new ways to connect the series dots – and significantly grow the readership|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]]|volume=249 |date=11 November 2002|issue=45|pages=26, 31|quote=As such, she's particularly excited to be republishing two of the 90 or so novels of Jean Plaidy in spring 2003: ''Lady in the Tower'' and ''A Rose Without a Thorn''. 'Plaidy is really the godmother of the genre,' says Kahan. Ross reports that part of the impetus for bringing back the Plaidy titles came from the online historical fiction community. }}</ref> Three Rivers Press published some of the books with new titles which are listed here:

=== Reception and legacy ===

==== 20th century ====
''Victoria Holt'' books proved popular with the reading public and many of them made it to bestseller lists. Hibbert won loyalty from large numbers of women readers who passed along their copies to the next generation of women in their family. Hibbert described her heroines as "women of integrity and strong character" who were "struggling for liberation, fighting for their own survival."
{{Quote box|width=17.5em|bgcolor=#FFFDBF|quote="A Victoria Holt book is the sort of story to bring despair to literary critics, and rage to supporters of Women's Lib though it would give a great deal of pleasurable entertainment to vast numbers of ordinary women all over the world."<br/> – a critic<ref name="hibbert_smh_1980-02-26"/>}}

Her 1960 novel ''[[Mistress of Mellyn]]'' single-handedly revived the Gothic romance genre.<ref name="hibbert_nyt_1977-08-14"/> Many women started writing their own gothic romances. Even male authors like [[Tom E. Huff]] and [[Julian Fellowes]] succumbed to the trend and wrote romances under female pseudonyms.<ref name="hibbert_pm_1978-05-01">{{cite magazine | title= Behind Jennifer Wilde's Racy Paperbacks Lurks a Texas Mystery Man, Tom E.

''Victoria Holt'' novels became best-sellers. In 1970, when gothic mania was at its peak, ''The Secret Woman'' became one of the top 10 best-selling books in the United States.<ref name="hibbert_pw_2009-07-27">{{cite web | title= Publishers Weekly Bestselling Novels in the United States | url= http://www.listology.com/lbhick/list/publishers-weekly-bestselling-novels-united-states |author= lbhick  |publisher= Listology | date= 27 July 2009 |

By the early 1970s gothic novels outsold all other genres in paperback fiction, including [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]], [[science fiction]] and [[Western fiction|Westerns]]. This coincided with consolidation within the publishing industry where paperbacks and hardcover publishers were brought together under the same corporate parent for the first time. More sophisticated marketing efforts led to placement in grocery and drugstore checkout aisles, where they found their target audience: educated, middle-class women with a reading habit.<ref name="hibbert_wp_1974-08-04">{{cite news | title= Jane Eyre Type 'Gothic' Novels Flood Bookshelves | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19740804&id=t0g0AAAAIBAJ&pg=5583,1631798 |author= Isabelle Holland |publisher= Sarasota Herald-Tribune | work = LA Times / Washington Post | date= 4 August 1974 |access-date= 2 September 2014}}</ref>

Hibbert's romance novels were clean; at the most the main characters exchanged smouldering looks of longing. However, by 1969 the [[sexual revolution]] had made explicit description more acceptable. In April 1972, the romance novel [[The Flame and the Flower]] took advantage of this change in trend and revolutionized the [[historical romance]] genre by detailing physical intimacy between the protagonists. Another such novel, [[Rosemary Rogers|Sweet Savage Love]], that followed in 1974 cemented the trend. A new genre was thus born, dubbed the 'sweet savage romance' or the 'bodice ripper' because of the heaving, partly exposed bosom often pictured on the cover.<ref name="hibbert_radway_1984">{{cite book | title= Reading the Romance | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KbsiAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT33|author= Janice Radway |publisher= The University of North Carolina Press | date= 1984 |access-date= 6 September 2014|isbn = 9780807898857}}</ref><ref name="hibbert_kne_1977-02-01">{{cite news | title= Rosemary Rogers Rides Success of 'Sweet Savage Love' | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&dat=19770201&id=3eorAAAAIBAJ&pg=1283,2879478 |author=Stephen Montiel | agency = Associated Press |publisher= Kentucky New Era | date= 1 February 1977 }}</ref>

Interest in Hibbert's clean romances declined. In 1976, a critic complained that Victoria Holt's heroines "must be a little bit dumb or they won't get themselves into such improbable messes in the first place."<ref name="hibbert_upi_1976-08-24">{{cite news | title= Victoria Holt's Heroines Must Be A Little Dumb (Book Review: The Pride of the Peacock) | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19760824&id=WRgsAAAAIBAJ&pg=1467,4443136 |author= Joan Hanauer | work = United Press International |publisher= Times Daily | date= 24 August 1976 | quote = "But then Victoria Holt's heroines always feel themselves set apart, and so they are – more fiery, more adventuresome and sometimes more downright stupid than their contemporaries.

By the early 1980s, Gothic romances were no longer as popular as a decade earlier. Readers demanded more sex and adventure in their romance novels. Publishers created paperback imprints like [[Mills & Boon|Silhouette]] and [[Dell Publishing|Candlelight Ecstasy]] simply to satisfy the enormous demand for "bodice rippers" and "hot historicals".<ref name="hibbert_sem_1982-09-10">{{cite news | title= The Boom in the Romance Business | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19820910&id=lKFUAAAAIBAJ&pg=6237,1680706 |author= Sally Emerson|work= New Straits Times| date= 10 September 1982 |access-date= 6 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="hibbert_upi_1981-02-11">{{cite news | title= Romance is Flourishing in Paperbacks

Bowing to the changing times, Hibbert wrote ''The Demon Lover'', a 1982 ''Victoria Holt'' novel, in a style that borrowed several elements from the plot of ''Sweet Savage Love'': forced seduction of a naive girl by a powerful man ending in marriage, set against a background of turmoil in war time. Critics congratulated the move: "Her latest, 'The Demon Lover', is a straight romance with sexual passion, which is currently 'in'. It has no suspense: the thrilling twists and turns of plot that marked her Gothic novels are no more."<ref name="hibbert_ap_1982-12-26">{{cite news | title= Victoria Holt Deserts Gothic For Genre of Sexual Romance (Book Review: The Demon Lover by Victoria Holt) | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&dat=19821226&id=8a5UAAAAIBAJ&pg=5847,9213874 | agency = Associated Press | publisher= Boca Raton News | date= 26 December 1982 |access-date= 6 September 2014}}</ref>

Victoria Holt's heroines left the decorous drawing rooms of Victorian England to find adventure in far more exotic locations: inside an Egyptian pyramid (''The Curse of the Kings'', 1973); among Chinese antiques in [[Hong Kong]] (''The House of a Thousand Lanterns'', 1974);<ref name="hibbert_tn_1974-08-18">{{cite news | title= New Holt Suspense Novel Attracts Women Readers (Book Review: The House of a Thousand Lanterns by Victoria Holt)| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19740818&id=KkYgAAAAIBAJ&pg=3367,3158157 |author= Doris Flora |newspaper= The Tuscaloosa News | date= 18 August 1974 |access-date= 6 September 2014}}</ref> down the opal mines of Australia (''The Pride of the Peacock'', 1976); on a tea plantation in [[Ceylon]] (''The Spring of the Tiger'', 1979);<ref name="hibbert_fls_1979-10-06">{{cite news | title= Victoria Holt Has A Compelling Tale (Book Review: The Spring of the Tiger by Victoria Holt) | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19791006&id=PvxNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2860,829119 |author= Carol Anderson |newspaper= The Free Lance-Star | date= 6 October 1979 |access-date= 6 September 2014}}</ref> among lush, tropical islands off the coast of Australia (''The Road to Paradise Island'', 1985);<ref name="hibbert_ap_1985-10-25">{{cite news | title= Victoria Holt's Latest Book A Study in Mystery, Adventure (Book Review: The Road to Paradise Island) | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19851025&id=vLgfAAAAIBAJ&pg=4781,4234037 |author= Marlene A.

In 1993, Hibbert died. In the closing years of the 20th century, ''Victoria Holt'' titles were made available in large print, audiobook and Braille formats. Translations in several European languages, [[Russian (language)|Russian]], [[Hebrew]], Persian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] also appeared.
