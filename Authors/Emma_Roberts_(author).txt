'''Emma Roberts''' (1794–1840), often referred to as "Miss Emma Roberts", was an English travel writer and poet known for her memoirs about India. In her own time, she was well regarded, and [[William Jerdan]] considered her "a very successful cultivator of the belles lettres".<ref name="JERDAN" />

== Early life ==
Roberts' precise date of birth is no longer known. Her family was said to be from Wales, though she is known to have been born in the village of Methley.<ref name="ASHFIELD" /> Her father is said to have been Captain William Roberts of the Russian service, and later a paymaster in an English regiment.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography</ref>  After her father died, her mother took Emma and her elder sister to Bath. Her mother is said to have some kind of literary pretensions.<ref name="ELWOOD" />

Emma Roberts received some of her education from [[Frances Arabella Rowden]], an engaging teacher with a particular enthusiasm for the theatre. [[Mary Russell Mitford]] describes her as not only a poet, but with "a knack of making poetesses of her pupils"<ref>{{cite book|last1=eds|first1=Lilla Maria Crisafulli & Cecilia Pietropoli|title=The languages of performance in British romanticism|date=2008|publisher=P. Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-3039110971|page=301|edition=Oxford ; Bern ; Berlin ; Frankfurt am Main ; Wien$nLang.|chapter=appendix}}</ref> This links Roberts to several notable writers such as Caroline Ponsonby, later [[Lady Caroline Lamb]]; [[Anna Maria Hall|Anna Maria Fielding]], who published as S. C. Hall; and Rosina Doyle Wheeler, who married [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] and published her many novels as [[Rosina Bulwer Lytton]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|title=Rowden [married name de St Quentin], Frances Arabella (1774–1840?), schoolmistress and poet {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/59581|year=2004}}</ref> At the [[Hans Place]] [[boarding school]], Roberts was a roommate of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon|Letitia Elizabeth (Landon) Maclean]], the poet "L.E.L."<ref name="ATLANTIC" /> of whom she wrote a memoir.

Emma Roberts should not be confused with her near-contemporary [[Jane Roberts (author)|Jane Roberts]], with whom she corresponded.

== Career ==
Roberts's literary career began with the publication of ''Memoirs of the rival houses of York and Lancaster ...'' in 1827.<ref name="HALE" />  She reportedly thoroughly researched her subject, but it was not unreservedly received. Then her mother died and her sister married an officer stationed in [[Bengal]]. When her sister and brother-in-law left for India, Roberts accompanied them.<ref name="HALE" /> Her sister died in 1831 and Roberts moved to [[Calcutta]],<ref name="HALE" /> where she edited a periodical named the ''[[Oriental Observer]]''.<ref name="ASHFIELD" /> However her health reportedly failed and she returned to England by 1833.<ref name="HALE" /> While in India Roberts published a small volume of "descriptive" poetry, and stories or essays about things she had seen in India. These were later collected and published as books. Both the poetry<ref name="ASIATIC" /><ref name="EDINLIT" /> and the travel book<ref name="QUARTERLY" /> were well received. Although many works of this era are notably dated, a current assessment is that  "[h]er compassion for the people of India, her prodigious memory, and her straightforward style make Roberts rather accessible to the twenty-first century reader".<ref name="SPEAKE" />

Back in England Roberts turned to editing for a while. She edited a new edition (the 64th) of [[Maria Rundell]]'s cookery book ''[[A New System of Domestic Cookery]]'', and also a book of poetry by her friend Letitia Landon.<ref name="HALE" /> But by 1839 she decided to return to India, not simply by sailing directly, but by crossing overland from France, through Egypt to Suez, and then by ship to Bombay. She went with only a female friend and took only two months to complete her journey, arriving at the end of October.<ref name="HALE" /> This was a similar journey to that made by [[Anne Elwood]], who thought Roberts's journey too quick.<ref name="ELWOOD" /> Roberts wrote a book about her journey. In India she returned to editing, the ''[[Bombay Gazette]]'' being one title,<ref name="HALE" /> but died suddenly in September 1840 and was buried near the grave of [[Maria Jane Jewsbury]].<ref name="HALE" /><!-- A reasonable redlink because Jewsbury also appears in the Wikipedia Dora Wordsworth article. -->
