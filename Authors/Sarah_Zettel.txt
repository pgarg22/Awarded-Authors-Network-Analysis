==Career==
Zettel's first short story ''Driven by Moonlight'' was written in 1986, and was published in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' in 1991.<ref name="Locus">{{cite web |url=https://www.locusmag.com/1998/Issues/01/Zettel.html |title= Sarah Zettel: Matters of Faith |date=January 1998 |website=Locus Magazine |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://lib.msu.edu/branches/vvl/writers/spring01/021601.jsp |title=Science Fiction Writer Sarah Zettel |date=February 16, 2001 |website=Michigan State University |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref> Her first novel ''Reclamation'' was published in 1996; this was followed by ''Fool's War'' in 1997. Zettel wrote many science-fiction short stories for ''Analog'' and other publications.  [[Stanley Schmidt]], the editor of ''Analog'', sent her work back multiple times to fix problems; in 1998, Zettel said she regarded Schmidt "as a really great teacher, and I think that experience is what led me directly to be able to write ''Reclamation''".<ref name="Locus"/>

{{As of|2021}}, Zettel has written 35 novels in genres that include horror, fantasy, romance, thriller/suspense, and young adult. She said "every genre gives you a different view into the art of storytelling".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2020/04/28/sarah-zettel-creates-strong-female-protagonist-a-mothers-lie/3035819001/ |title=Sarah Zettel creates strong female protagonist for 'A Mother's Lie' |last=Krug |first=Kurt Anthony |date=April 28, 2020 |website=The Detroit News |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref> Of all of her novels, ''A Mother's Lie'' "holds a special place in her heart" because "I wanted a chance to write a suspense book in which the mother gets to be the hero, and the strength of the relationship between mother and daughter gets to be at the center of the story in a positive way".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thebigthrill.org/2020/03/up-close-sarah-zettel/ |title=Up Close: Sarah Zettel |last=Hast |first=Millie Naylor |date=March 31, 2020 |website=The Big Thrill |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref> Zettel writes regency mysteries and romances under the pseudonym Darcie Wilde.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darciewilderomance.com/ |title=About Darcie Wilde |website=Darcia Wilde |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref> Among Zettel's favorite science-fiction authors are [[Ursula LeGuin]]&nbsp;–&#32;who inspired her to become an author&nbsp;–&#32;and [[Octavia Butler]], [[Mary Doria Russell]], and [[Terry Prachett]]. Zettel said her ideas come from current events, her earlier reading material, and memoirs based around science.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sffworld.com/2000/01/interview-with-sarah-zettel/? |title=Interview with Sarah Zettel |last=Rambraut |first=Dag |date=January 1, 2000 |website=SFFWorld. |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref>

Professor and media scholar [[Henry Jenkins]] wrote; "Sarah Zettel's 1997 novel, ''Fool's War'' makes an important contribution to the growing body of feminist literature about artificial intelligence, taking the relationship between bodies and information as one of its core themes".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-and-research/directories/a-z/profile/?id=49 |title=Henry Jenkins |website=University of Southern California |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102193418/https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-and-research/directories/a-z/profile/?id=49 |access-date=April 5, 2021|archive-date=January 2, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/science_fiction/profiles/zettel.html |title=Sarah Zettel |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |date=1998 |website=Media in Translation |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref> John R.

''Fool's War'' was included in [[Book Riot]]'s list titled "10 Chillingly Possible Sci-Fi Books About AIs Taking Over" and says, "This book does a fantastic job of capturing the tipping point that exists right before an AI wakes up and starts taking some sweet revenge for all those years of servitude".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bookriot.com/books-about-artificial-intelligence/ |title=10 Chillingly Possible Sci-Fi Books Abouts AIs Taking Over |last=Gooding-Call |first=Ann |date=June 21, 2009 |website=Book Riot |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref> ''Dust Girl'',  in which the main character is of mixed race and is half-fairy, was included in a ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle's]]'' list titled "12 Awesome YA Novels Featuring POC Protagonists".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/150069-12-young-adult-novels-with-poc-protagonists |title=12 Awesome YA Novels Featuring POC Protagonists |last=Kovach |first=Catherine |date=March 25, 2016 |website=Bustle |access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref>
