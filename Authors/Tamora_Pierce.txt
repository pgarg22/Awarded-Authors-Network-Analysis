'''Tamora Pierce''' (born December 13, 1954) is an American writer of [[fantasy fiction]] for [[teenagers]], known best for stories featuring young heroines. She made a name for herself with her first [[book series]], ''[[The Song of the Lioness]]'' (1983–1988), which followed the main character Alanna through the trials and triumphs of training as a knight.

Pierce won the [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] from the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) of the [[American Library Association]] in 2013, citing her two [[tetralogy|quartets]] ''[[Song of the Lioness]]'' and ''[[Protector of the Small]]'' (1999–2002). The annual award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature".<ref name=edwards/>

==Biography==

Pierce was born in [[South Connellsville, Pennsylvania]] in [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]], on December 13, 1954. Her mother wanted to name her "Tamara" but the nurse who filled out her birth certificate misspelled it as "Tamora".<ref name=Pierce>{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Tamora|title=Tamora Pierce Biography|url=http://tamorapierce.com/bio.html|website=Tamora Pierce: Author of Young Adult Fantasy|publisher=Tamora Pierce |access-date=20 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005205032/http://tamorapierce.com/bio.html |archive-date=5 October 2014}}</ref> When she was five, her sister Kimberly (on whom she based Alanna)<ref>Bonnie Kunzel & Susan Fichtelberg ''Tamora Pierce: A Student Companion'', Hardcover, Greenwood Press, 2007</ref> was born and a year later her second sister, Melanie, was born. From the time she was five until she was eight, she lived in [[Dunbar, Pennsylvania|Dunbar]]. In June 1963 she and her family moved to [[California]]. They first lived in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] on [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] and then moved to the other side of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], in Miramar. They lived in Miramar for half a year, in [[El Granada, California|El Granada]] a full year, and then three years in [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]].

She began reading when she was very young and started writing when she was in the sixth grade. Her interest in fantasy and science fiction began when she was introduced to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and so she started to write the kind of books that she was reading. After her parents divorced, her mother moved her and her sisters back to Fayette County in 1969, where she spent two years at Albert Gallatin Senior High. When her family moved again, she spent her senior year at Uniontown Area Senior High School, acting, singing, and writing for the school paper. She is an alumna of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

While at Penn she wrote the books that became ''The Song of the Lioness'' quartet. The first book of this quartet, ''[[Alanna: The First Adventure]]'' was published by [[Atheneum Books]] in 1983.

Pierce lived with her husband Tim Liebe (Spouse-Creature) in [[New York City]], with their four cats and multiple other pets, until they moved to [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref>Pierce, Tamora. "Acknowledgments." ''Bloodhound: Beka Cooper Book Two''. New York: Random House Children's Books (2009). p 551.</ref>

In 2008, she donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at [[Northern Illinois University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.niu.edu/ulib/content/collections/rbsc/research/sc/scifi.shtml |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) Collection |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720013814/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead |publisher=[[Northern Illinois University]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://archon.lib.niu.edu/?p=collections/controlcard&id=401 |title= Tamora Pierce Papers, 2006-2017 |publisher=[[Northern Illinois University]]}}</ref>

==Writing process==

On her homepage, Pierce states she gets most ideas from things she stumbles upon. Her concept of magic as a tapestry of threads comes from her experiences in crocheting, and in her world, all mages are somehow based on British naturalist [[David Attenborough]] after watching his nature documentaries. [[Fantasy literature|Fantasy novels]] and [[Arthurian legend]] were the base of the worlds she thought up as a girl, and later she added contemporary issues like youth crime and [[cholera]] outbreaks in [[Africa]]. In general, Pierce states: "The best way to prepare to have ideas when you need them is to listen to and encourage your obsessions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamora-pierce.com/faq.htm#Ideas|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Tamora Pierce|website=tamora-pierce.com|access-date=27 April 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420081516/http://www.tamora-pierce.com/faq.htm#Ideas|archive-date=20 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://readergirlz.com/issue200912.html |title=Book Buzz |work=readergirlz |date=December 2009 |access-date=27 April 2018 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730145912/http://www.readergirlz.com/issue200912.html|archive-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>

Pierce draws on elements of people and animals around her for inspiration. The character of Alanna is loosely based on Pierce's sister.<ref name="bio">{{cite web | url = http://www.tamora-pierce.com/bio.html | title = Tamora Pierce Biography | access-date = 2013-08-15 | last = Pierce | first = Tamora | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130613183932/http://www.tamora-pierce.com/bio.html | archive-date = 2013-06-13 }}</ref> Thayet's appearance is based on a friend of Pierce's. Beka's pigeon friends in ''Provost's Dog'' are all based on actual pigeons of Pierce's acquaintance.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Terrier|last = Pierce|first = Tamora|publisher = Random House|year = 2006|isbn = 9781439518830|location = New York}}</ref>

Tamora Pierce first started writing to escape from the drama of her parents' divorce. She wrote [[fan fiction]] based on her favorite stories, imitating them closely.<ref name="bio" /> Pierce says she decided to write her stories about strong female characters because she noticed a lack of them in the books she read when she was young.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/iconography-tamora-pierce-and-all-the-feminist-fantasy-heroines-you-could-want | title = Iconography: Tamora Pierce and All the Feminist Fantasy Heroines You Could Want | access-date = 2019-12-16 | first = Chally | last = Kacelnik | date = 27 December 2010 | work = [[Bitch (magazine)|bitch]] | publisher = bitch media<!--non-capitalization intentional-->}}</ref>
