'''Andrew Dallmeyer''' (10 January 1945 – 21 May 2017) was a Scottish playwright, theatre director and actor. He wrote over 75 plays, including the ''Opium Eater'' and directed more than 50 productions. His plays have won a number of awards, including a Scottish BAFTA, and they have been played on BBC Radio.

Some of Dallmeyer's plays have been considered controversial, for example ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'' which focused on [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s motives and was released on the first anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Some of his other plays celebrate the life and works of historical figures such as [[John Muir]] and [[Salvador Dalí]]. As an actor, Dallmeyer had a recurring role in Scottish cult comedy, [[Rab C. Nesbitt]].

==Early life==
Dallmeyer was born on 10 January 1945 in [[St Boswells]] in Roxburghshire, Scotland. He spent most of his childhood in [[Aberlady]], East Lothian where he was a keen [[Hibernian F.C.]] supporter (later inspiring his interest to write ''Playing a Blinder''). Dallmeyer learnt drama at the [[Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art]], London. His father served in the British Army during the [[Second World War]] and was twice awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref name=HScot />

The radio play won a [[BAFTA]] award equivalent in 1985.<ref name=Opium/> Dallmeyer believes ''The Opium Eater'' is somewhat autobiographical in nature as it is about a writer trying to find inspiration. He went on to state that "I don't think I'm that neurotic. I'm quite steady, really, mentally. You have to be in this job."<ref name=Second/> Martin Cropper reviewed the show in ''The Times'' as one of the best he had seen at a fringe theatre.<ref name=Cropper/> ''The Opium Eater'' won awards and was adapted for radio.<ref name=Cropper>{{cite news|last1=Cropper|first1=Martin|title=Opium Eater|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=lancs&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS252285308&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=1 March 2015|issue=62307|work=The Times|date=28 November 1985|location=London, England|page=15}}</ref>

''The Boys in the Backroom'' was part of a series of plays, produced by Salamander Press, called The [[Traverse Theatre|Traverse]] Plays. The plays were written in celebration of Scottish playwrights and Dallmeyer's play was fifth in the series.<ref name=Traverse/> The play was performed in theatres across America covering 10 cities including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Pittsburgh.<ref name=HScot/> It was reviewed in ''The Times'' as a conspiracy story which "markets its paranoia through outsize performances".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chaillet|first1=Ned|title=... and authentic revelations on the Fringe too.|accessdate=1 March 2015|issue=61324|work=The Times|date=30 August 1982|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=lancs&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS151620382&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|location=London, England|page=9}}</ref> Following a performance in Los Angeles in 1987 it reviewed by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as "sophomoric and forgettable."<ref name="Traverse"/> It has also been performed by students at the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]].<ref name=Second/>

It has been performed in many countries including: Scotland, England, United States, Belgium, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. The play was described as a "scatological, emotional and artistic biography".<ref name=Ned/>

In 1986, Dallmeyer wrote ''The Grand Edinburgh Fire Balloon'' as a piece of commissioned work for the [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]].<ref name=Fowler/> Based on the story of the first man to fly in Britain; [[James Tytler]] was a pioneer with the development of the [[hot air balloon]].<ref name=Hemmings>{{cite news|last1=Hemmings|first1=Sarah|title=Arts (Theatre): Review of 'Grand Edinburgh Fire Balloon' at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0F90B4AD9DA10CDA?p=UKNB|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=The Times|date=13 October 1986}}</ref> Despite the Lyceum being praised for commissioning a new play with regional importance<ref name=Hemmings/><ref name=Peter/> the play itself received some poor feedback.
