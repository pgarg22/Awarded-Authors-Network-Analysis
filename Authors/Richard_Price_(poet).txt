He is a lyricist and vocalist in the band Mirabeau and, later, The Loss Adjustors.

His translations include the [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] poems in ''Eftirs / Afters'' (with translations of other French modernists by Donny O'Rourke, Au Quai, 1996) and the [[Louise Labé]] poems in ''Lute Variations'' (Rack Press, 2005).

In the 1990s he co-edited the poetry magazines ''Gairfish'' (with [[W. N. Herbert]]), ''Verse'' (with Robert Crawford, Henry Hart, David Kinloch, and others) and ''Southfields'' (with Raymond Friel). At this time he also ran the poetry publisher Vennel Press with Leona Medlin, publishing books by W.N. Herbert, Elizabeth James, David Kinloch, Peter McCarey, Medlin and Price themselves, and others. He was one of the group associated with [[Informationist poetry]], coining the phrase. He introduced Informationist ideas in 1991 in the magazine ''Interference'' and, later, in his introduction to the anthology of Informationist poetry ''Contraflow on the Superhighway'', co-edited with Herbert (Gairfish and Southfields, 1994).<ref>Daniel O'Rourke (ed. and intro.)

''Lucky Day'' which reflects on the disability of his daughter, who has [[Angelman syndrome]], was shortlisted for the Forward First Collection Prize, the Jerwood Aldburgh Prize and the  [[Whitbread prize]].
''Rays'' (Carcanet), containing many love poems as well as variations on the sonnets and canzone of [[Louise Labé]] and [[Guido Cavalcanti]] was shortlisted for a Scottish Book Award.

In 2010 he published ''The Island'' (Two Ravens Press) a novel about a father and young daughter who, as an act of revenge, steal a car. It draws on characters who first appeared in his short story collection ''A Boy in Summer'' (Neil Wilson / 11:9, 2002).

In 2011 the musical project for which he was the principal lyricist, Mirabeau, released its first album, Golden Key. Several of the songs are settings of poems from his earlier poetry collections while others are closer to rock and folk genres of songwriting. Mirabeau comprised Price (as lyricist and vocalist) and the singer-songwriter [[Caroline Trettine]] with contributions by various musicians including Ian Kearey (of [[The Blue Aeroplanes]]).

In 2012 his poem "Hedge Sparrows" was chosen to represent Great Britain in the Olympics project the Written World, and recorded for BBC radio by the actor [[Jim Broadbent]].

In the same year his collection ''Small World'' (Carcanet) was published, a collection of poems about fatherhood and daughters and their changing relationship, and, in a final, suspenseful sequence, a catastrophe which brings all the lives in the book into perspective. ''Small World'' won Price's first major award to win the poetry category of the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Book Awards. A poem from the collection, 'An old drawer up beyond the children', was subsequently produced as an animation by Michael Hughes.

In 2013 Price was Poet in Residence at the University of Coimbra, in association with Idanha-a-Nova, Portugal.

In 2013 and 2014 he toured with Iain Bamforth, David Kinloch, Peter McCarey as "The Last Men on Mercury", appearing in Manchester, London, Geneva, Stasbourg and Glasgow and featuring guest poets including Lucy Burnett, Dorothy Lehane, Hannah Lowe, and Peter Manson. In 2014 the Slovakian film-maker Viera Čákanyová made a short film about his work, filming while he was on tour in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.

In 2015 the second (and final) Mirabeau album was released, Age of Exploration. Price would later form The Loss Adjustors with Roberto Sainz de la Maza, who appeared as a guitarist on many Mirabeau tracks, and with Elisa

In 2016 he published ''Is This A Poem?'' (Molecular Press), selected essays on lyric poetry, little magazines, and artist's books.

In 2017 his collection ''Moon for Sale'' (Carcanet) was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Saltire Society's Poetry Book of the Year. That year his collaboration with the artist Ronald King, ''Sedna and the Fulmar'' was also published, by Circle Press. Its focus on an episode in the Inuit spiritual world would be amplified later in his next Carcanet collection ''The Owner of the Sea: Three Inuit Sequences Retold'' (Carcanet, 2021).

In 2018 he collaborated with the artist Julie Johnstone to produce the satirical work, ''Digital'' (essence press). At this time he began to work with Roberto Sainz de la Maza who composed the music, produced and played on the resulting album by The Loss Adjustors, The World Brims (2020). It features Price on vocals with the singer Elisa de Leon. All of the lyrics are written by Price, with many of the tracks based on poems in ''Moon for Sale'' as well as on newer, uncollected work.
