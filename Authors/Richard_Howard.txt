'''Richard Joseph Howard''' (born October 13, 1929; adopted as '''Richard Joseph Orwitz''') is an American poet, [[literary critic]], essayist, teacher, and translator.  He was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, and is a graduate of [[Columbia University]], where he studied under [[Mark Van Doren]],<ref name=co>[http://www.c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/mark_van_doren.html "Mark Van Doren", ''Columbia 250'' – Colombian Ahead of Their Times] [[Columbia University]].</ref> and where he is an emeritus professor.  He lives in New York City.

==Life==
After reading French letters at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1952–53, Howard had a brief early career as a [[lexicographer]].  He soon turned his attention to poetry and poetic criticism, and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry for his 1969 collection ''[[Untitled Subjects]]'', which took for its subject dramatic imagined letters and monologues of 19th century historical figures.  For much of his career, Howard has written poems using a [[quantitative verse]] technique.

A prolific literary critic, Howard's monumental 1969 volume ''[[Alone With America]]'' stretched to 594 pages<ref name=Alone>Howard, Richard. ''Alone With America: Essays on the Art of Poetry in the United States Since 1950''. New York: Atheneum, 1969.</ref> and profiled 41 American poets who had published at least two books each and "have come into a characteristic and&mdash;as I see it&mdash;consequential identity since the time, say, of the Korean War." Howard would later tell an interviewer <blockquote>I wrote the book not for the sense of history, but for myself, knowing that a relation to one's moment was essential to getting beyond the moment. As I quoted [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] in the book's preface, if you cannot believe in the greatness of your own age and inheritance, you will fall into confusion of mind and contrariety of spirit. The book was a rescuing anatomy of such belief, the construction of a ''credendum''—articles of faith, or at least appreciation.<ref name=ParisReview>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/29/the-art-of-poetry-no-86-richard-howard Richard Howard, The Art of Poetry No. 86], ''The Paris Review'', interview by [[J. D. McClatchy]], Spring 2004</ref></blockquote>

He was awarded the [[PEN Translation Prize]] in 1976 for his translation of [[E. M. Cioran]]'s ''[[Précis de décomposition|A Short History of Decay]]'' and the [[National Book Award]]<!-- National Book Awards were called "American" for several years from 1980, but must not be confused with [[American Book Awards]]

for his 1983 translation of [[Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''. Howard was a long-time poetry editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]''. He has received a [[Pulitzer prize]], the [[Academy of Arts and Letters]] Literary Award and a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. In 1985, Howard received the [[PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation]]. A former Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]], he is Professor of Practice in the writing program at Columbia's [[Columbia University School of the Arts|School of the Arts]].  He was previously [[University Professor]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Houston]] and, before that, Ropes Professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]].  He served as [[Poet Laureate]] of the State of New York from 1993 to 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/newyork.html|work=US State Poets Laureate|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 1982, Howard was named a [[knight|Chevalier]] of [[L'Ordre National du Mérite]] by the government of France.

In 2016, he received the [[Philolexian Society]] Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement.

== Personal life ==

Richard Howard was born to poor Jewish parents. His last name at birth is unknown. He was adopted as an infant by Emma Joseph and Harry Orwitz, a middle-class Cleveland couple, who were also Jewish; his mother changed their last names to "Howard" when he was an infant, after she divorced Orwitz.  Howard never met his birth parents, nor his sister, who was adopted by another local family.<ref name=Jewish>[http://www.forward.com/articles/15078/ "Praising Sacred Places: Richard Howard's Jewish Roots"], article by [[Benjamin Ivry]] in ''The Forward''.</ref> Howard is gay, a fact that comes up frequently in his more recent work.<ref>[http://clevelandartsprize.org/awardees/richard_howard.html Official biography at Cleveland Arts Prize website]</ref> He has been [[coming out|out]] to some degree since at least the 1960s, when he remarked to friend [[W. H. Auden]] that he was offended by a fellow poet's use of Jewish and gay epithets, "since [he was] both these things", to which Auden replied, "My dear, I never knew you were Jewish!"<ref name=Jewish />

Howard keeps on his bed in a nook of his New York City apartment a large stuffed gorilla named "Mildred".<ref name=ParisReview />
