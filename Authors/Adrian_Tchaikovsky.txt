==Bibliography==
=== ''Shadows of the Apt'' series===
==== Setting ====
The series is set in a fictional universe populated by different "kinden". Each kinden is a fictional race of humans, named after (and having certain characteristics of) an insect. Kinden are typically divided into two categories: "Apt" and "Inapt". The Apt do not have magical abilities, but are able to understand, use and design mechanical devices. The Inapt have varying amounts of magical abilities, but cannot use mechanical devices, even those as simple as latches. The series focuses on the attempted conquest of the Lowlands by the Wasp-kinden empire.

====Genesis of the Apt====
Tchaikovsky revealed the story behind the Shadows of the Apt in an online essay entitled "Entering the Shadows" at Upcoming4.me.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/story-behind-shadows-of-the-apt-by-adrian-tchaikovsky-entering-the-shadows|title=Story behind Shadows of the Apt by Adrian Tchaikovsky – Entering the Shadows|publisher=Upcoming4.me|access-date=8 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006072125/http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/story-behind-shadows-of-the-apt-by-adrian-tchaikovsky-entering-the-shadows|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Whilst studying at the [[University of Reading]] he ran a [[role-playing game]] called ''Bugworld.'' The game told the story of the insect-people of the Lowlands, under threat from the encroaching Wasp Empire. From this original scenario the entire series of books grew.

Tchaikovsky still uses role-playing games to help construct his stories, but now also uses [[live action role-playing]], which assists in describing the numerous action and battle sequences in his books. Adrian is currently involved with the [[LARP]] game ''Empire''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire;jsessionid=1och1cqczani54j0o1yxm1yzj?0|title=Profound Decisions – Empire|website=www.profounddecisions.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref>

====Principal characters in ''Shadows of the Apt''====

*''Stenwold Maker'': Beetle-kinden [[spymaster]] and statesman. The character is pivotal to the entire series and was created back in the "Bugworld" game. Stenwold Maker runs a network of spies throughout the Lowlands. He is based at Collegium, the city of learning and the series starts with him warning of the growing dangers from the Wasp Empire when no one else is listening. 
*''Tisamon'': Mantis-kinden Weaponmaster, Stenwold's friend. This character is the most savage warrior in the series with a tortured past and present.
*''Tynisa Maker'': Halfbreed daughter of Tisamon with a Spider blood, Stenwold's ward, duellist. 
*''Cheerwell Maker'': (''Che'') Beetle-kinden, niece of Stenwold Maker. Cheerwell Maker starts as a rather bumbling character, who nevertheless is a key player in the series and has a significant progress through the story.
*''Thalric'': Wasp-kinden captain, spymaster, a major in the Rekef, which is the [[secret service]] of the Wasp Empire, Stenwold's opposite number.
*''Totho'': Halfbreed artificer with Beetle and Ant blood and [[unrequited love]]r of Cheerwell Maker. Totho is the inventor of the snapbow which significantly changes the course of the war. This introduces the recurring theme of the [[Arms Race]].
*''Achaeos'': Moth-kinden seer, who starts by being true to his people's traditions and hating all Beetles, their traditional enemies, but his view is changed by Stenwold and Cheerwell Maker.
*''Prince Salme "Salma" Dien'': Dragonfly-kinden student in Collegium, duellist.
*''Seda'': Wasp-kinden, sister of the Wasp emperor
*''General Tynan'': Wasp-kinden, leader of the army sent to conquer Collegium
*''Eujen Leadswell'': Beetle-kinden student in Collegium
*''Straessa the Antspider'': A halfbreed student in Collegium, Eujen's girlfriend

====Magic v technology====

Tchaikovsky has regularly expressed his intention in this [[fantasy]] series not to make [[science]] better than magic,<ref>See [[Magic in fiction]]</ref> or vice versa: "This is another key element, really: the magic/tech divide is a concept that turns up here and there in fantasy, but usually one side is good (mostly magic) and the other (dirty polluting tech) is bad. With the world of the kinden, they’re basically both as bad as the people who use them, whether it’s blood sacrifice in a Mantis-kinden grove or the Wasp Empire’s city-levelling weaponry."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.londoncalling.com/features/interview-with-adrian-tchaikovsky-author-of-shadow-of-the-apt-series|title=Interview with Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Shadow of the Apt series|website=www.londoncalling.com|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref>
