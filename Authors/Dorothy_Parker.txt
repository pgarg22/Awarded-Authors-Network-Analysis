'''Dorothy Parker''' (née '''Rothschild'''; August 22, 1893 – June 7, 1967) was an American poet, writer, critic, and [[satire|satirist]] based in New York; she was best known for her [[wit]], wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.

From a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary works published in magazines, such as ''[[The New Yorker]],'' and as a founding member of the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue [[screenwriting]]. Her successes there, including two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in [[left-wing politics]] resulted in her being placed on the [[Hollywood blacklist]].

Dismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a "wisecracker." Nevertheless, both her literary output and reputation for sharp wit have endured. Some of her works have been set to music; adaptations notably include the operatic song cycle ''[[Hate Songs]]'' by composer [[Marcus Paus]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/skarpe-historiedrommer-1.1459639|title=Fanger teatrets toner på hvert sitt drømmende album|website=www.dagsavisen.no}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fvn.no/article/fvn-P2jPX.html|title=Urfremfører Paus-opera i Kilden|website=www.fvn.no|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

Parker's mother was of Scottish descent. Her father was the son of Sampson Jacob Rothschild (1818–1899) and Mary Greissman (b. 1824), both [[Prussia]]n-born [[Jews]]. Sampson Jacob Rothschild was a merchant who immigrated to the USA around 1846, settling in [[Monroe County, Alabama]]. Jacob Henry Rothschild was one of five known siblings. The others were Simon (1854–1908); Samuel (b. 1857); Hannah (1860–1911), later Mrs. William Henry Theobald; and Martin, born in [[Manhattan]] on December 12, 1865, who perished in the sinking of the [[Titanic]] in 1912.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/martin-rothschild.html|title=Martin Rothschild : Titanic Victim|website=Encyclopedia Titanica}}</ref> Parker wrote in her essay, "My Home Town," that her parents returned to their [[Manhattan]] apartment shortly after Labor Day so that she could be called a true New Yorker.

She sold her first poem to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in 1914 and some months later was hired as an editorial assistant for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', another [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] magazine. She moved to ''Vanity Fair'' as a staff writer after two years at ''Vogue.''<ref>Silverstein 13.</ref>

== Algonquin Round Table years ==
[[File:Algonquin Round Table.gif|thumb|Parker, with Algonquin Round Table members and guests (l–r) Art Samuels (editor of ''Harper's'' and, briefly, ''The New Yorker''), Charles MacArthur, Harpo Marx, and Alexander Woollcott, circa 1919]]

Parker's career took off in 1918 while she was writing theater criticism for ''Vanity Fair,'' filling in for the vacationing [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Silverstein 18.</ref> At the magazine, she met [[Robert Benchley]], who became a close friend, and [[Robert E. Sherwood]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Altman |first=Billy |title=Laughter's Gentle Soul: The Life of Robert Benchley |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |year=1997 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/laughtersgentles00altm/page/146 146] |isbn=0-393-03833-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/laughtersgentles00altm/page/146}}</ref> The trio began lunching at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] on a near-daily basis and became founding members of what became known as the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. The Round Table numbered among its members the newspaper columnists [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] and [[Alexander Woollcott]]. Through their publication of Parker's lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column "The Conning Tower", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit. When the group was informed that famously taciturn former president [[Calvin Coolidge]] had died, Parker remarked, "How could they tell?"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Calvin Coolidge |date=2006 |first=David |last=Greenberg |series=The American Presidents Series |publisher=Times Books |isbn=978-0-8050-6957-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/calvincoolidge00gree/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/calvincoolidge00gree/page/9|access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>

Parker's caustic wit as a critic initially proved popular, but she was eventually dismissed by ''Vanity Fair'' in 1920 after her criticisms too often offended powerful producers. In solidarity, Benchley resigned in protest. (Sherwood is sometimes reported to have done so as well, but in actuality he had been fired in December 1919.)<ref>Goldman, When Dorothy Parker Got Fired from Vanity Fair" Public Domain Review. February 6, 2020. Accessed March 9, 2020.</ref> She soon started working for ''[[Ainslee's Magazine]]'', which had a higher circulation. She also published pieces in ''Vanity Fair,'' which was happier to publish her than employ her, ''[[The Smart Set]]'', and ''[[The American Mercury]]'', but also in the popular ''[[Ladies’ Home Journal]]'', ''[[Saturday Evening Post]],'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.<ref name="gottlieb">{{cite news |last1=Gottlieb |first1=Robert |title=Brilliant, Troubled Dorothy Parker |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/04/07/brilliant-troubled-dorothy-parker/ |access-date=August 23, 2018 |work=New York Review of Books |date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>

When [[Harold Ross]] founded ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1925, Parker and Benchley were part of a board of editors established by Ross to allay the concerns of his investors. Parker's first piece for the magazine was published in its second issue.<ref>Silverstein 32.</ref> Parker became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many highlighting ludicrous aspects of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide.

The next 15 years were Parker's greatest period of productivity and success. In the 1920s alone she published some 300 poems and free verses in ''Vanity Fair,'' ''Vogue,'' "The Conning Tower" and ''The New Yorker'' as well as ''Life'', ''[[McCall's]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]].''<ref>Silverstein 62–3.</ref>  Her poem, "Song in a Minor Key" was published during a candid interview with New York [[Newspaper Enterprise Association|N.E.A.]] writer [[Josephine Van de Grift]].<ref>Van de Grift, Josephine.

[[File:Enough Rope by Dorothy Parker.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the first edition of ''Enough Rope'']]
Parker published her first volume of poetry, ''Enough Rope,'' in 1926. The collection sold 47,000 copies<ref name="canlqr">Silverstein 35.</ref> and garnered impressive reviews. ''[[The Nation]]'' described her verse as "caked with a salty humor, rough with splinters of disillusion, and tarred with a bright black authenticity."<ref>Meade 177.</ref> Although some critics, notably ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer, dismissed her work as "[[flapper]] verse,"<ref>Meade 178.</ref> the volume helped affirm Parker's reputation for sparkling wit.<ref name="canlqr" /> Parker released two more volumes of verse, ''Sunset Gun'' (1928) and ''Death and Taxes'' (1931), along with the short story collections ''Laments for the Living'' (1930) and ''After Such Pleasures'' (1933). ''Not So Deep as a Well'' (1936) collected much of the material previously published in ''Rope,'' ''Gun,'' and ''Death'' and she re-released her fiction with a few new pieces in 1939 under the title ''Here Lies''.

She collaborated with playwright [[Elmer Rice]] to create ''Close Harmony,'' which ran on Broadway in December 1924. The play was well received in out-of-town previews and was favorably reviewed in New York, but it closed after a run of only 24 performances. It become a successful touring production under the title ''The Lady Next Door''.<ref>Meade 138.</ref>

Some of Parker's most popular work was published in ''The New Yorker'' in the form of acerbic book reviews under the byline "Constant Reader". Her response to the whimsy of [[A. A. Milne]]'s ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'' was "Tonstant Weader fwowed up."<ref>{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Dorothy |title=Far From Well, collected in The Portable Dorothy Parker Revised and Enlarged Edition |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1976 |location=New York |page=518 |isbn=0-14-015074-9}}</ref> Her reviews appeared semi-regularly from 1927 to 1933,<ref>Silverstein 38.</ref> were widely read, and were posthumously published in a collection under the name ''Constant Reader'' in 1970.

Her best-known short story, "Big Blonde", published in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine, was awarded the [[O. Henry Award]] as the best short story of 1929.<ref>Herrmann 74.</ref> Her short stories, though often witty, were also spare and incisive, and more bittersweet than comic; her style is often described as sardonic.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/columbiacompanio00blan |title=The Columbia companion to the twentieth-century American short story |date=2000 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |others=Gelfant, Blanche H., 1922– |isbn=978-0-231-11098-3 |location=New York |oclc=51443994}}</ref>

Parker eventually separated from her husband, divorcing in 1928. She had a number of affairs, her lovers including reporter-turned-playwright [[Charles MacArthur]] and the publisher [[Seward Collins]]. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy. Parker is alleged to have said, "how like me, to put all my eggs into one bastard.” <ref>Meade 105.</ref> She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.<ref>Silverstein 29.</ref>

Toward the end of this period, Parker began to become more politically aware and active. What would become a lifelong commitment to activism began in 1927, when she became concerned about the pending executions of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. Parker traveled to [[Boston]] to protest the proceedings. She and fellow Round Tabler [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]] were arrested, and Parker eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of "loitering and sauntering", paying a $5 fine.<ref>Silverstein 44.</ref>

== Hollywood ==
In 1932, Parker met [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]],<ref>Meade 238.</ref> an actor with aspirations to become a screenwriter. They married two years later in [[Raton, New Mexico]]. Campbell's mixed parentage was the reverse of Parker's: he had a German-Jewish mother and a Scottish father. She learned that he was [[bisexual]] and later proclaimed in public that he was "[[queer]] as a billy goat".<ref name="Wallace2012">{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=David |title=Capital of the World: A Portrait of New York City in the Roaring Twenties |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivN7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA184 |date=September 4, 2012 |publisher=Lyons Press |isbn=978-0-7627-6819-6 |pages=184–}}</ref> The pair moved to Hollywood and signed ten-week contracts with [[Paramount Pictures]], with Campbell (who was also expected to act) earning $250 per week and Parker earning $1,000 per week. They would eventually earn $2,000 and in some instances upwards of $5,000 per week as freelancers for various studios.<ref>Silverstein 40.</ref> She and Campbell worked on more than 15 films.<ref>{{IMDb name|0662213|Dorothy Parker}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2021}}</ref>

In 1935, Parker contributed lyrics for the song "[[I Wished on the Moon]]", with music by [[Ralph Rainger]]. The song was introduced in ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1936]]'' by [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The great Hollywood musical pictures |last1=Parish |first1=J.R. |last2=Pitts |first2=M.R. |isbn=978-0-8108-2529-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnFZAAAAMAAJ |date=1992 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]}}</ref>

With Campbell and [[Robert Carson (writer)|Robert Carson]], she wrote the script for the 1937 film ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', for which they were nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Writing—Screenplay. She wrote additional dialogue for ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' in 1941. Together with Frank Cavett, she received a nomination for an Oscar for the screenplay of ''[[Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman]]'' (1947), starring [[Susan Hayward]].

After the United States entered the Second World War, Parker and [[Alexander Woollcott]] collaborated to produce an anthology of her work as part of a series published by [[Viking Press]] for servicemen stationed overseas. With an introduction by [[W. Somerset Maugham]],<ref>Meade 318.</ref> the volume compiled over two dozen of Parker's short stories, along with selected poems from ''Enough Rope'', ''Sunset Gun'', and ''Death and Taxes''. It was published in the United States in 1944 under the title ''The Portable Dorothy Parker''. Hers is one of three ''Portable'' series, including volumes devoted to [[William Shakespeare]] and The Bible, that have remained in continuous print.<ref>{{cite book |last=Publisher's Note |title=The Portable Dorothy Parker Revised and Enlarged Edition |publisher=Penguin |year=1976 |location=New York |isbn=0-14-015074-9}}</ref>

During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker became an increasingly vocal advocate of civil liberties and civil rights, and a frequent critic of authority figures. During the [[Great Depression]], she was among numerous American intellectuals and artists who became involved in related social movements. She reported in 1937 on the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Loyalist cause in Spain]] for the Communist magazine, '[[The New Masses]].'<ref>Meade 285.</ref> At the behest of [[Otto Katz]], a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent [[Willi Münzenberg]], Parker helped to found the [[Hollywood Anti-Nazi League]] in 1936, which the FBI suspected of being a Communist Party front.<ref>Koch, Stephen, ''Double Lives: Stalin, Willi Munzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals,'' New York: Enigma Books (2004), Revised Edition, {{ISBN|1-929631-20-0}}</ref> The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League's membership eventually grew to some 4,000 strong. According to [[David Caute]], its often wealthy members were "able to contribute as much to [Communist] Party funds as the whole American working class," although they may not have been intending to support the Party cause.<ref name="autogenerated1">Caute, David, ''The Fellow Travellers: Intellectual Friends of Communism,'' New Haven: [[Yale University Press]] (1988), {{ISBN|0-300-04195-0}}</ref>

Parker also served as chair of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]]'s fundraising arm, "Spanish Refugee Appeal". She organized Project Rescue Ship to transport Loyalist veterans to Mexico, headed Spanish Children's Relief, and lent her name to many other left-wing causes and organizations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buhle |first=Paul |author2=Dave Wagner |title=Radical Hollywood: The Untold Story Behind America's Favorite Movies |publisher=The New Press |year=2002 |location=New York |page=89 |isbn=1-56584-718-0}}</ref> Her former Round Table friends saw less and less of her, and her relationship with Robert Benchley became particularly strained (although they would reconcile).<ref>Altman 314.</ref> Parker met [[S. J. Perelman]] at a party in 1932 and, despite a rocky start (Perelman called it "a scarifying ordeal"),<ref>Perelman 171.</ref> they remained friends for the next 35 years. They became neighbors when the Perelmans helped Parker and Campbell buy a run-down farm in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], near [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], a popular summer destination among many writers and artists from New York.

Parker was listed as a [[Communist]] by the publication ''[[Red Channels]]'' in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dorothy ParkerR Writer, Versifier |work=Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television |publisher=Counterattack |url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1950s/redchannels/redch115.html |access-date=September 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807192003/http://www.authentichistory.com/1950s/redchannels/redch115.html |archive-date=August 7, 2007}}</ref> The [[FBI]] compiled a 1,000-page dossier on her because of her suspected involvement in Communism during the era when Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] was raising alarms about communists in government and Hollywood.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kunkel |first=Thomas |title=Genius in Disguise: Harold Ross of The New Yorker |publisher=Carrol & Graf |year=1996 |page=[https://archive.org/details/geniusindisguise00kunk/page/405 405] |isbn=0-7867-0323-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/geniusindisguise00kunk/page/405}}</ref> As a result, movie studio bosses placed her on the [[Hollywood blacklist]]. Her final screenplay was ''[[The Fan (1949 film)|The Fan]],'' a 1949 adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', directed by [[Otto Preminger]].

Her marriage to Campbell was tempestuous, with tensions exacerbated by Parker's increasing alcohol consumption and Campbell's long-term affair with a married woman in Europe during [[World War II]].<ref>Meade 327.</ref> They divorced in 1947,<ref>Meade 329.</ref> remarried in 1950,<ref>Meade 339.</ref> then separated in 1952 when Parker moved back to New York.<ref name="google2">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mqz2cxXtwEQC&q=%22East+74th%22&pg=PA41 |author=James Malanowski |title=Dead & Famous; Where the Grim Reaper has Walked in New York |publisher=Spy |date=July 17, 1959 |access-date=April 10, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1962, she lived at the Volney Residential Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side and wrote book reviews for ''[[Esquire magazine]].''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Itzkovitz |first=Daniel |title=Dorothy Rothschild Parker (1893–1967) |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |date=May 28, 1998 |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/parker.html |access-date=September 25, 2005}}</ref> Her writing became increasingly erratic due to her continued abuse of alcohol. She returned to Hollywood in 1961, reconciled with Campbell, and collaborated with him on a number of unproduced projects until Campbell died from a drug overdose in 1963.<ref>Meade 392–3.</ref>

== Later life and death ==
Following Campbell's death, Parker returned to New York City and the Volney Residential hotel. In her later years, she denigrated the Algonquin Round Table, although it had brought her such early notoriety:
{{Quote | These were no giants. Think who was writing in those days—[[Ring Lardner|Lardner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]. Those were the real giants. The Round Table was just a lot of people telling jokes and telling each other how good they were. Just a bunch of loudmouths showing off, saving their gags for days, waiting for a chance to spring them&nbsp;... There was no truth in anything they said. It was the terrible day of the wisecrack, so there didn't have to be any truth&nbsp;...<ref>Herrmann p. 85.</ref>}}

Parker occasionally participated in radio programs, including ''[[Information Please]]'' (as a guest) and ''Author, Author'' (as a regular panelist). She wrote for the ''[[Columbia Workshop]]'', and both [[Ilka Chase]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]] used her material for radio monologues.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=John |title=On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-507678-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn}}</ref>

Parker died on June 7, 1967, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]<ref name="NYT obit" /> at the age of 73. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and upon King's death, to the [[NAACP]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Morris |title=Dorothy Parker's Will Leaves Estate of $10,000 to Dr. King |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 27, 1967 |page=22}}</ref><ref name="ashes-newyorker" />

===Burial===

Following her cremation, Parker's ashes were unclaimed for several years. Finally, in 1973, the crematorium sent them to her lawyer's office; by then he had retired, and the ashes remained in the custody of his colleague [[Paul O'Dwyer]]'s filing cabinet, for approximately 17 years.<ref>Meade 412.</ref><ref name="ashes-newyorker">{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=Laurie Gwen |title=The Improbable Journey of Dorothy Parker's Ashes |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-improbable-journey-of-dorothy-parkers-ashes |access-date=6 September 2020 |work=The New Yorker |date=4 September 2020}}</ref> In 1988, O'Dwyer brought this situation to public attention, with the aid of celebrity columnist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]]; after some discussion, the NAACP claimed Parker's remains and designed a memorial garden for them outside its Baltimore headquarters.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

In early 2020, the NAACP moved its headquarters to downtown Baltimore and the question about what would happen to Parker's ashes became the topic of much speculation, especially after the NAACP formally announced it would later move to Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Prudente |first1=Tim |title=Talks under way to move the ashes of famed New Yorker writer Dorothy Parker from her Baltimore resting place |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-dorothy-parker-grave-20200712-rirzjyfeozda7pubup3ybjbh4u-story.html |access-date=6 September 2020 |work=Baltimore Sun |date=12 July 2020}}</ref>

Relatives called for the ashes to be moved back to the family's plot in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], in the Bronx, where a place had been reserved for Parker by her father. On August 18, 2020, Parker's urn was exhumed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Kevin |title=Homecoming: Dorothy Parker's ashes buried in New York City |url=https://dorothyparker.com/2020/09/homecoming.html |website=Dorothy Parker Society |access-date=7 September 2020 |date=7 September 2020}}</ref> "Two executives from the N.A.A.C.P. spoke, and a rabbi who had attended her initial burial said [[Kaddish]]."

==Honors==

On August 22, 1992, the 99th anniversary of Parker's birth, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a 29¢ U.S. commemorative [[postage stamp]] in the Literary Arts series. The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged at the hotel, contributed to the Algonquin Hotel's being designated in 1987 as a New York City Historic Landmark.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Heller Anderson |first=Susan |title=City Makes It Official: Algonquin is Landmark |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 20, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/nyregion/city-makes-it-official-algonquin-is-landmark.html |access-date=October 21, 2007}}</ref> In 1996, the hotel was designated as a National Literary Landmark by the [[Friends of Libraries]] USA, based on the contributions of Parker and other members of the Round Table.

In 2014, Parker was elected to the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].

== In popular culture ==
Parker inspired a number of fictional characters in several plays of her day. These included "Lily Malone" in [[Philip Barry]]'s ''Hotel Universe'' (1932), "Mary Hilliard" (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]) in George Oppenheimer's ''Here Today'' (1932), "Paula Wharton" in Gordon's 1944 play ''[[Over 21 (play)|Over Twenty-one]]'' (directed by [[George S. Kaufman]]), and "Julia Glenn" in the Kaufman–[[Moss Hart]] collaboration ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (1934). Kaufman's representation of her in ''Merrily We Roll Along'' led Parker, once his Round Table compatriot, to despise him.<ref>Meade 241.</ref> She also was portrayed as "Daisy Lester" in [[Charles Brackett]]'s 1934 novel ''Entirely Surrounded''.<ref>Silverstein 10–11.</ref> She is mentioned in the original introductory lyrics in [[Cole Porter]]'s song "[[Just One of Those Things (song)|Just One of Those Things]]" from the 1935 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical [[Jubilee (musical)|''Jubilee'']], which have been retained in the standard interpretation of the song as part of the [[Great American Songbook]].

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] released "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker" in 1987; it was the first song recorded in his [[Chanhassen, Minnesota]] studio home.  Those closest to him at the time suggest the association between the poet and the waitress by the same name in the song is a coincidence, but Dorothy Parker died on Prince's birthday and chances are this brought her to his attention prior to writing the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/09/03/prince-the-story-of-sign-o-the-times-episode-2-the-dream-factory|title = Prince: The Story of Sign O' the Times, Episode 2: The Dream Factory}}</ref>

Parker is featured as a character in the novel ''The Dorothy Parker Murder Case'' by [[George Baxt]] (1984), in a series of ''Algonquin Round Table Mysteries'' by J. J.

Putnam Adult.  {{ISBN|039915907X}}</ref> She is the main character in "Love For Miss Dottie", a short story by Larry N Mayer, which was selected by writer [[Mary Gaitskill]] for the collection ''Best New American Voices 2009'' (Harcourt).

She has been portrayed on film and television by [[Dolores Sutton]] in ''F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'' (1976), [[Rosemary Murphy]] in ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977),<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/tony-nominee-and-emmy-winner-rosemary-murphy-dies-at-89-com-324377 |title=Tony Nominee and Emmy Winner Rosemary Murphy Dies at 89 |magazine=Playbill |date=July 9, 2014 |author=Simonson, Robert |author-link1=Robert Simonson}}</ref> [[Bebe Neuwirth]] in ''[[Dash and Lilly]]'' (1999), and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] in ''[[Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle]]'' (1994). Neuwirth was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for her performance, and Leigh received a number of awards and nominations, including a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

The [[Wild Colonials]] song, "Vicious Circle" from ''[[Life As We Know It EP]]'' (2007) is about Dorothy Parker. The chorus lyrics are, "I know how Dorothy Parker felt with someone in her way."

<!-- In the absence of reliable sources that a particular song is in reference to this Dorothy Parker please do not add it. The Prince song is definitely NOT about this Dorothy Parker, as noted on the talk page, and so should not be re-added. -->

==Adaptations==
In the 2010s some of her poems from the early 20th century have been set to music by the composer [[Marcus Paus]] as the operatic song cycle ''[[Hate Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Orchestra]]'' (2014);<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto2"/> Paus's ''Hate Songs'' was included on [[Tora Augestad]]'s and the [[Oslo Philharmonic]]'s album ''Portraying Passion: Works by Weill/Paus/Ives'' (2018) with works by Paus, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Charles Ives]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arkiv.klassekampen.no//article/20181203/PLUSS/181209808|title=Mange ansikter|website=Klassekampen}}</ref> It was described by musicologist [[Ralph P.
