'''Bryher''' (2 September 1894 – 28 January 1983) was the pen name of the English novelist, poet, memoirist, and magazine editor  '''Annie Winifred Ellerman''', of the Ellerman ship-owning family.

She was a major figure of the international set in Paris in the 1920s, using her fortune to help many struggling writers. With her lover [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.) and the Scottish writer [[Kenneth Macpherson]], she launched the film magazine ''Close Up'', which introduced [[Sergei Eisenstein]]’s work to British viewers. From her home in Switzerland, she helped to evacuate Jews from Hitler's Germany, and then became a popular historical novelist.

== Early life ==
Bryher was born in September 1894 in [[Margate]]. Her father was the shipowner and financier [[Sir John Ellerman, 1st Baronet|John Ellerman]], who at the time of his death in 1933 was the richest Englishman who had ever lived.<ref>Rubinstein, W.D. ''Men of Property'' (2006), page 60. {{ISBN|1-904863-12-4}}</ref> He lived with her mother Hannah Glover, but did not marry her until 1908.

Bryher traveled in Europe as a child, to France, Italy and Egypt. At the age of fourteen she was enrolled in a traditional English boarding school and at around this time her mother and father married. On one of her travels, Ellerman journeyed to the [[Isles of Scilly]] off the southwestern coast of Great Britain and acquired her future pseudonym from her favourite island, [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]].

During the 1920s, Bryher was an unconventional figure in Paris. Among her circle of friends were [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Sylvia Beach]] and [[Berenice Abbott]].<ref>{{Cite web  | last = Van Vechten  | first = Carl  | title = Extravagant Crowd  | url = http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/cvvpw/gallery/bryher.html  | access-date = 23 March 2009  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615100836/http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/cvvpw/gallery/bryher.html  | archive-date = 15 June 2010  | url-status = dead  }}</ref> Her wealth enabled her to give financial support to struggling writers, including Joyce and [[Edith Sitwell]]. She also helped with finance for Sylvia Beach's bookshop [[Shakespeare and Company (1919–1941)|Shakespeare and Company]] and certain publishing ventures, and started a film company [[Pool Group]]. She also helped provide funds to purchase a flat in Paris for the destitute Dada artist and writer [[Baron]]ess [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news|title=Winifred Bryher, Author, 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/obituaries/winifred-bryher-author-88.html|date=1983-02-01|access-date=2018-01-31|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Lifelong relationship and later life ==
Bryher knew from an early age that she was lesbian.<ref name="benstock">{{cite book | last = Benstock | first = Shari | author-link = Shari Benstock | year = 1986 | title = Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900–1940 | url = https://archive.org/details/womenofleftbank00shar | url-access = registration | location = Texas | publisher = University of Texas Press | isbn = 0-292-79040-6 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/womenofleftbank00shar/page/312 312]}}</ref> In 1918 she met and became involved in a same-sex relationship with poet [[Hilda Doolittle]] (better known by her initials, H.D.). The relationship was an [[Open relationship|open]] one, with both taking other partners.  In 1921 she entered into a [[marriage of convenience]] with the American author [[Robert McAlmon]], whom she divorced in 1927. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060824160933/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob6/bryh1.html]

That same year she married [[Kenneth Macpherson]], a writer who shared her interest in film and who was at the same time H.D.'s lover.  In Burier, Switzerland, overlooking Lake Geneva, the couple built a Bauhaus-style structure that doubled as a home and film studio, which they named Kenwin.  They formally adopted H.D.'s young daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant with Macpherson's child, but chose to abort the pregnancy. Bryher divorced MacPherson in 1947; she and Doolittle no longer lived together after 1946, but continued their relationship until Doolittle's death in 1961.

==Filmmaking and film criticism==
Bryher, H.D., and Macpherson formed the film magazine [[Close Up (magazine)|''Close Up'']], and the [[Pool Group]]. Only one ''POOL'' film, ''[[Borderline (1930 film)|Borderline]]'' (1930), starring H.D. and [[Paul Robeson]], survives in its entirety.  In common with the ''Borderline'' novellas, it explores extreme psychic states and their relationship to surface reality.<ref>{{Cite web  |  title = H.D. – Art History Online Reference and Guide  | url=http://www.arthistoryclub.com/art_history/H.D.  | access-date = 23 March 2009 }}</ref> Bryher herself plays an innkeeper.<ref>{{cite book | last = Latimer | first = Tirza True | title = Women Together / Women Apart: Portraits of Lesbian Paris | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 2005 | location = New Brunswick, NJ | pages = [https://archive.org/details/womentogetherwom00tirz/page/36 36] | isbn = 0-8135-3595-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/womentogetherwom00tirz/page/36 }}</ref>

Bryher's most notable non-fiction work was ''Film Problems of Soviet Russia'' (1929).  In ''Close Up'' she compared Hollywood unfavorably with Soviet filmmaking, arguing that the [[studio system]] had "lowered the standards" of cinema.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Williams | first = Deane | title = Screening Coldicutt: Introduction | journal = Screening the Past | issue = 2 | date = 8 December 1997 | url = http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/clasdec/cold.html | access-date = 1 November 2006 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060828115258/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/clasdec/cold.html | archive-date = 28 August 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Her writings also helped to bring [[Sergei Eisenstein]] to the attention of the British public.

== World War II and after ==
In a 1933 article in ''Close up'' entitled "What Shall You Do in the War?", Bryher wrote about the situation of Jews in Germany, urging readers to take action.  Starting that year, her home in Switzerland became a "receiving station" for refugees; she helped more than 100 people escape Nazi persecution before she began to fear for her own safety and returned to the UK.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bryher|title=Bryher: Two Novels: Development And Two Selves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ue_B3B7ZdzMC&pg=PR15|date=21 December 2000|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-16773-8|pages=15}}</ref>  This experience influenced her 1965 "Science Fantasy" novel ''[[Visa for Avalon]]'', about a group of people trying to escape an unnamed country for a place called Avalon on the eve of revolution.<ref>McCabe, Susan. "Introduction," xiii–xviii.  {{cite book | last = Bryher | title = Visa for Avalon | publisher = Paris Press | year = 2004 | location = Ashfield, Mass. | isbn = 1-930464-07-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/visaforavalon00bryh }}</ref>

From 1940 to 1946 she lived in London with H.D. and supervised the literary magazine ''[[Life and Letters To-day]]''.  She later wrote a memoir of these years entitled ''The Days of Mars'', as well as a novel, ''Beowulf'' (1948), set during the Blitz.

Starting in 1952, she wrote a series of historical novels.  Most are set in Britain during various eras; ''Roman Wall'' (1954) and ''The Coin of Carthage'' (1963) are set in the [[Roman Empire]]; ''Ruan'' (1960) is set in a post-[[King Arthur|Arthurian]] Britain. They are well researched and vivid, typically set in times of turmoil and often seen from the perspective of a young man. ''Ruan'' portrays the adventures of a [[Druid]] [[Novice]] who yearns to escape the confines of his surroundings and upbringing to become a sea captain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bryher {{!}} British author|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bryher|access-date=2018-01-31|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Acclaimed in her own time, her historical novels have now fallen out of print but used copies are readily available.  Since 2000, ''Visa for Avalon'', her early semi-autobiographical novels ''Development'' and ''Two Selves'', her memoir ''The Heart to Artemis'', and her historical novel ''The Player's Boy'' have been republished.
