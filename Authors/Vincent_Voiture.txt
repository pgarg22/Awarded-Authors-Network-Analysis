'''Vincent Voiture''' (24 February 1597 – 26 May 1648), French poet and writer of prose, was the son of a rich wine merchant of [[Amiens]]. He was introduced by a schoolfellow, the count [[Claude d'Avaux]], to [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans]], and accompanied him to [[Brussels]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] on diplomatic missions.

Although a follower of the Duke of Orléans, he won the favour of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], and was one of the earliest members of the [[Académie française]]. He also received appointments and pensions from [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Anne of Austria]].

He published nothing in book form, but his verses and his prose letters (published after his death by his nephew) were the delight of the coteries, and were copied, handed about and admired more perhaps than the work of any contemporary. He had been early introduced by [[Claude d'Urre du Puy Saint-Martin, sieur de Chaudebonne|Chaudebonne]] to the ''[[Hôtel de Rambouillet]]'', where he became a close friend of [[Julie d'Angennes]], the daughter of Charles d'Angennes and [[Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet|Catherine de Vivonne]], ''marquis'' and ''marquise de Rambouillet''. His ingenuity in providing amusement for the members of the circle ensured his popularity, which was never seriously threatened except by [[Antoine Godeau]] (nicknamed ''le Nain de Julie''), and this rivalry ceased when Richelieu appointed Godeau [[bishop of Grasse]].<ref>Jacques Lacombe & Charles Joseph Panckoucke, ''Encyclopediana, ou Dictionnaire encyclopédique des ana'', Hôtel de Thou, Rue des Poitevins, Paris, 1791, p. 492.</ref>

When at the desire of the [[Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier|duc de Montausier]], nineteen poets contributed to the ''[[Guirlande de Julie]]'', which was to decide the much-fêted Julie in favour of his suit, Voiture did not take part. The quarrel between the ''Uranistes'' and the ''Jobelins'' arose over the respective merits of a [[sonnet]] of Voiture addressed to a certain ''Uranie'', and of another composed by [[Isaac de Benserade]], till then unknown, on the subject of ''Job''.

Another famous piece of his of the same kind, ''La Belle Matineuse'', is less exquisite, but still admirable, and Voiture stands in the highest rank of writers of ''[[vers de société]]''. His prose letters are full of lively wit, and, in some cases, as in the letter on Richelieu's policy (Letter LXXIV), show considerable political penetration. He ranks with [[Jean Louis Guez de Balzac|Jean de Balzac]] as the chief director of the reform in French prose which accompanied that of [[François de Malherbe|Malherbe]] in French verse.

Voiture's death, on 26 May 1648, at the outbreak of the [[Fronde]], marked the beginning of the end of the society to which he was accustomed.
