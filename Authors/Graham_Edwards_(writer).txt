'''Graham Edwards''' (born 1965) is an English author of [[fantasy]] and [[crime fiction|crime]] novels. His most popular books have generally featured [[dragons]] as their central characters.

Born in [[Somerset]] and raised in [[Bournemouth]], Edwards studied art and design. He went on to work as a [[graphic designer]] and [[animator]] before developing his writing career in the 1990s. An accomplished artist, he often includes illustrations with his novels. They can be viewed in the art section of his [http://graham-edwards.com website.] Edwards now lives in [[Nottingham]] with his wife and two children.

==Body of work==

Edwards' major body of work consists of two related fantasy trilogies: the '''Ultimate Dragon Saga''' trilogy and the '''Stone''' trilogy (also known as the Amara trilogy).

The former series of books is a fantasy work set in times before humans, and as such there are no human characters in the novels. The dragons are sentient and, much like the rabbits and moles in [[Richard Adams]]' [[Watership Down]] and [[William Horwood (novelist)|William Horwood]]'s [[Duncton Wood]] respectively, they are anthropomorphised, displaying a large array of human characteristics, relationships and emotions.

The latter series is set - although not in an actual Earthly time period - parallel to the late 19th century. Its events are triggered by the eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, and feature human characters prominently, although the stories are also populated with other races such as dragons. This series can be read as a standalone trilogy, although minor plot and character connections to the Ultimate Dragon Saga mean that prior reading of the first trilogy will give a richer appreciation of the second.

Since finishing the Stone trilogy, Edwards has written several short stories, published in Realms Of Fantasy magazine. In 2008 he published his first crime novel, ''Runaway Minister'', under the pseudonym Nick Curtis.<ref>{{cite web | year=2008| title=Runaway Minister | author=Graham Edwards| url=http://graham-edwards.com/fiction/novels/runaway-minister-writing-as-nick-curtis/ | accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> It was published by Black Star Crime books.
