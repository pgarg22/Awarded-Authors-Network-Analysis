Captain '''Frederick Marryat''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CB|FRS}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=The National Portrait Gallery |date=1902 |publisher=Cassell, limited |page=284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLUaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA284 |language=en}}</ref> (10 July 1792 – 9 August 1848)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-Marryat |publisher=Ria Press |title=Frederick Marryat: English naval officer and author |authors=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=3 July 2016}}</ref> was a [[Royal Navy]] officer, a novelist, and an acquaintance of [[Charles Dickens]]. He is noted today as an early pioneer of [[nautical fiction]], particularly for his semi-[[autobiographical novel]] ''[[Mr Midshipman Easy]]'' (1836). He is remembered also for his children's novel ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'' (1847), and for a widely used system of [[maritime flag signalling]] known as [[maritime flag signalling#Marryat's Code of Signals|Marryat's Code]].

==Early life and naval career==
Marryat was born in Great George Street, [[Westminster]], London,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/9864373.Captain_Marryat___the_Wimbledonian_who_never_was/ |title=Captain Marryat - the Wimbledonian who never was |website=Wimbledon Guardian |access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref> the son of [[Joseph Marryat (1757–1824)|Joseph Marryat]], a "merchant prince" and member of Parliament, and his American wife, Charlotte, ''née'' von Geyer.<ref name="ODNB">J. K. Laughton, "Marryat, Frederick (1792–1848)", rev. Andrew Lambert, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18097 Retrieved 2 January 2016.] Charlotte was a daughter of Frederick Geyer of Boston and one of the first women admitted to membership of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]. She died in 1854.</ref> Marryat tried to run away to sea several times before he was permitted to enter the Royal Navy in 1806 as a midshipman aboard {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, a frigate commanded by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], who later served as inspiration for Marryat and other authors.

Marryat's time aboard the ''Imperieuse'' included action off the [[Gironde]], the rescue of a fellow midshipman who had fallen overboard, captures of many ships off the Mediterranean coast of Spain, and capture of the castle of [[Montgat]]. The ''Imperieuse'' shifted to operations in the [[Scheldt]] in 1809, where Marryat contracted malaria; he returned to England on the 74-gun [[HMS Victorious (1808)|HMS ''Victorious'']]. After recuperating, he returned to the Mediterranean in the 74-gun [[HMS Centaur (1797)|HMS ''Centaur'']] and again saved a shipmate by leaping into the sea after him. He then sailed as a passenger to Bermuda in the 64-gun [[HMS Atlas (1782)|HMS ''Atlas'']], and from there to Halifax, Nova Scotia on the schooner [[HMS Chub (1807)|HMS ''Chubb'']], where he joined the 32-gun frigate [[HMS Aeolus (1801)|HMS ''Aeolus'']] on 27 April 1811.

A few months later, Marryat once more earned distinction by leading the effort to cut away the ''Aeolus'''s mainyard to save the ship during a storm, and continuing a pattern, saved one of the men from the sea. Shortly after, he moved to the frigate [[HMS Spartan (1806)|HMS ''Spartan'']], participating in the capture of a number of American ships during the [[War of 1812]]. On 26 December 1812, he was promoted to lieutenant, and as such served in the sloop HMS ''Espiegle'' and in {{HMS|Newcastle|1813|6}}. Marryat led four barges from the ''Newcastle'' on a raid against [[Orleans, Massachusetts]] on 19 December 1814, the last combat in New England during the war. The affair had mixed results. Initially, Marryat cut out an American schooner and three sloops, but he managed to escape with just one sloop. The local militia avoided casualties while killing one Royal marine.<ref>James H. Ellis, ''A Ruinous and Unhappy War: New England and the War of 1812'', New York: Algora Publishing, 2009, pp. 236–237.</ref> Marryat was promoted to commander on 13 June 1815, just as the war ended.

===After the war===
Marryat then turned to scientific studies. He invented a lifeboat which earned him a gold medal from the [[Royal Humane Society]] and the nickname "Lifeboat". He developed a practical, widely used system of [[maritime flag signalling]] known as Marryat's Code based on his experience in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] escorting merchant ships in convoys. He also described a new gastropod genus ''[[Cyclostrema]]'' with the type species ''[[Cyclostrema cancellatum]]''.

In 1819, Marryat married Catherine Shairp with whom he had four sons and seven daughters, including [[Florence Marryat|Florence]], a prolific novelist and his biographer; [[Emilia Marryat|Emilia]], a writer of moralist adventure novels in her father's vein; and [[Augusta Marryat|Augusta]], also a writer of adventure fiction. Around this time, Marryat collaborated with [[George Cruikshank]] the caricaturist to produce ''The New Union Club'', an extravagant satire against abolitionism.<ref>See Temi Odumosu's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.</ref>

[[File:Napoleon Skizze von Marryat.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Marryat's sketch of Napoleon's body on his deathbed]]
In 1820, Marryat commanded the sloop HMS ''Beaver'' and temporarily commanded [[HMS Rosario (1808)|HMS ''Rosario'']] for the purpose of bringing back despatches announcing the death of [[Napoleon]] on [[Saint Helena]]. He also took the chance to make a sketch of Napoleon's body on his deathbed, which was later published as a lithograph. His artistic skills were modest, but he made numerous sketches of shipboard life above and below deck.<ref>National Maritime Museum (UK), [http://www.rmg.co.uk/researchers/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/capt-marryats-sketch-of-napoleon-bonaparte-after-his-death Capt.

In 1823, Marryat was appointed to HMS ''Larne'' and took part in an [[First Anglo-Burmese War|expedition against Burma]] in 1824, which resulted in large losses from disease. He was promoted to command the 28-gun HMS ''Tees'', which gave him the rank of [[post-captain]]. He was back in England in 1826, and that year donated two Burmese curiosities to the [[British Museum]], in an unsuccessful effort to become a trustee.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1826-0211-1 British Museum Collection]</ref><ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1826-0211-2 British Museum Collection]</ref> In 1829, he was commanding the frigate [[HMS Ariadne (1816)|HMS ''Ariadne'']] on a search for shoals around the [[Madeira islands|Madeira]] and [[Canary Islands]]. This was an uninspiring exercise, and as his first novel ''The Naval Officer'' had just been published, he decided to resign his commission in November 1830 and take up writing full time.

==Literary career==
From 1832 to 1835, Marryat edited ''[[The Metropolitan Magazine]]''.<ref name="ODNB" /> Additionally, he kept producing novels; his biggest success came with ''Mr Midshipman Easy'' in 1836. He lived in [[Brussels]] for a year, travelled in Canada and the United States, then moved to London in 1839, where he was in the literary circle of [[Charles Dickens]] and others. He was in North America in 1837 when the rebellion of that year broke out in [[Lower Canada]], and served with the expeditionary force sent to suppress it.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Marryat was named a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in recognition of his invention and other achievements. In 1843, he moved to a farm at Manor Cottage, [[Langham, Norfolk|Langham]] in Norfolk, where he died in 1848.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.british-towns.net/england/eastern/norfolk/north-norfolk/langham/album/manor-cottage-langham-norfolk |title=Manor Cottage Langham Norfolk |website=British Towns and Villages |access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref> His daughter [[Florence Marryat]] later became known as a writer and actress. His son [[Frank Marryat|Francis Samuel Marryat]] completed his father's late novel ''The Little Savage''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fmarryat.htm |title=Frederick Marryat |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217025022/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fmarryat.htm |archive-date=17 December 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Marryat's novels are typical of their time, with concerns of family connections and social status often overshadowing the naval action, but they are interesting as fictional renditions of the author's 25 years' experience at sea. Among those who admired them were [[Mark Twain]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]], and as the first nautical novels, served as models for later works by [[C. S. Forester]] and [[Patrick O'Brian]], also set in the time of [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] and telling of young men rising through the ranks through successes as naval officers.

Marryat was also known for short writings on nautical subjects. These short stories, plays, pieces of travel journalism, and essays appeared in ''The Metropolitan Magazine'' too, and were later published in book form as ''Olla Podrida''. Marryat's 1839 [[Gothic novel]] ''[[The Phantom Ship]]'' contained ''The White Wolf of the Hartz Mountains'', which includes the first female werewolf to appear in a short story.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Barger |first=Andrew |title=Shifters: The Best Werewolf Short Stories 1800–1849 |year=2010 |pages=35–36 |isbn=978-1933747255}}</ref>

In 1839, Marryat also published his ''Diary in America'', a travelogue that reflects his criticisms of American culture and society. The book and the author were both subject to acts of violence, including the burning of the book and of Marryat's effigy in public.

Controversy arose among Marryat's readers. Some criticized him for careless writing, others admired his vivacity about life at sea.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lang |first=Kathrin |title=Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism |url=http://c19index.chadwyck.com/fullrec/fullrec.do?id=925&resultNum=4&entries=7&area=dncj&forward=search&queryId=../session/1344883830_4583 |access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> His later novels were generally for the children's market, including his most famous novel today: ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'', published in 1847 and set in the countryside round the village of [[Sway, Hampshire]].
