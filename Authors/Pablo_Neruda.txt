'''Ricardo Eliécer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto''' (12 July 1904 – 23 September 1973), better known by his [[pen name]] and, later, legal name '''Pablo Neruda''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|r|uː|d|ə}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neruda "Neruda"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-es|ˈpaβlo neˈɾuða|lang}}), was a [[Chile]]an [[poet-diplomat]] and politician who won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1971. Neruda became known as a poet when he was 13 years old, and wrote in a variety of styles, including [[surrealism|surrealist]] poems, historical epics, overtly political manifestos, a prose autobiography, and passionate love poems such as the ones in his collection ''[[Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair]]'' (1924).

Neruda occupied many diplomatic positions in various countries during his lifetime and served a term as a Senator for the [[Chilean Communist Party]]. When President [[Gabriel González Videla]] [[Law of Permanent Defense of Democracy|outlawed communism]] in Chile in 1948, a warrant was issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months in the basement of a house in the port city of [[Valparaíso]], and in 1949 he escaped through [[Lilpela Pass|a mountain pass]] near [[Maihue Lake]] into Argentina; he would not return to Chile for more than three years. He was a close advisor to Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|socialist]] President [[Salvador Allende]], and, when he got back to Chile after accepting his Nobel Prize in [[Stockholm]], Allende invited him to read at the [[Estadio Nacional de Chile|Estadio Nacional]] before 70,000 people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wyman|first=Eva Goldschmidt|title=The Poets and the General: Chile's Voices of Dissent under Augusto Pinochet 1973–1989|year=2002|publisher=[[LOM Ediciones]]|location=Santiago de Chile |isbn=978-956-282-491-0 |edition=1st |author2=Zurita, Magdalena Fuentes |page = 18}} In Spanish and English.</ref>

Neruda was hospitalized with cancer in September 1973, at the time of the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by [[Augusto Pinochet]] that overthrew Allende's government, but returned home after a few days when he suspected a doctor of injecting him with an unknown substance for the purpose of murdering him on Pinochet's orders.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title = Neruda fue asesinado|url = http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=269909|website = Proceso|access-date = 6 November 2015|language = es-ES}}</ref> Neruda died in his house in Isla Negra on 23 September 1973, just hours after leaving the hospital. Although it was long reported that he died of heart failure, the Interior Ministry of the Chilean government issued a statement in 2015 acknowledging a Ministry document indicating the government's official position that "it was clearly possible and highly likely" that Neruda was killed as a result of "the intervention of third parties".<ref name=":0" /> However, an international forensic test conducted in 2013 rejected allegations that he was poisoned. It was concluded that he was suffering from prostate cancer.<ref name="internationaltest">{{Cite web|author=By Catherine E.

Neruda is often considered the [[national poet]] of Chile, and his works have been popular and influential worldwide. The [[Colombian people|Colombian]] novelist [[Gabriel García Márquez]] once called him "the greatest poet of the 20th century in any language",<ref name="Mendoza">{{cite book|author=Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza|title=The Fragrance of Guava: Conversations with Gabriel García Márquez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIpdAAAAMAAJ|access-date=4 August 2011|date=1 March 1983|publisher=Verso|page=49|isbn=9780860910657}}</ref> and the critic [[Harold Bloom]] included Neruda as one of the writers central to the Western tradition in his book ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]''.

==Early life==

Neruda's father opposed his son's interest in writing and literature, but he received encouragement from others, including the future Nobel Prize winner [[Gabriela Mistral]], who headed the local school. On 18 July 1917, at the age of thirteen, he published his first work, an essay titled "Entusiasmo y perseverancia" ("Enthusiasm and Perseverance") in the local daily newspaper ''La Mañana'', and signed it Neftalí Reyes.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 19</ref> From 1918 to mid-1920, he published numerous poems, such as "Mis ojos" ("My eyes"), and essays in local magazines as Neftalí Reyes. In 1919, he participated in the literary contest Juegos Florales del Maule and won third place for his poem "Comunión ideal" or "Nocturno ideal". By mid-1920, when he adopted the pseudonym Pablo Neruda, he was a published author of poems, prose, and journalism. He is thought to have derived his pen name from the [[Czechs|Czech]] poet [[Jan Neruda]],<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/pablo-neruda-9421737 Pablo Neruda].

In 1921, at the age of 16, Neruda moved to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]<ref name="Tarn14"/> to study [[French language|French]] at the [[Universidad de Chile]], with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, he was soon devoting all his time to writing poems and with the help of well-known writer [[Eduardo Barrios]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pablo-Neruda|title=Pablo Neruda {{!}} Chilean poet|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=23 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he managed to meet and impress Don Carlos George Nascimento, the most important publisher in Chile at the time. In 1923, his first volume of verse, ''Crepusculario'' (''Book of Twilights''), was published by Editorial Nascimento, followed the next year by ''[[Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada]]'' (''Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song''),<ref name="Tarn14"/> a collection of love poems that was controversial for its eroticism, especially considering its author's young age. Both works were critically acclaimed and have been translated into many languages. Over the decades, ''Veinte poemas'' sold millions of copies and became Neruda's best-known work, though a second edition did not appear until 1932. Almost one hundred years later, Veinte Poemas still retains its place as the best-selling poetry book in the Spanish language.<ref name="Tarn14"/> By the age of 20, Neruda had established an international reputation as a poet, but faced poverty.<ref name="Tarn14"/>

In 1926, he published the collection ''Tentativa del hombre infinito'' (''The Attempt of the Infinite Man'') and the novel ''El habitante y su esperanza'' (''The Inhabitant and His Hope'').<ref name="Tarn15">Tarn (1975) p. 15</ref> In 1927, out of financial desperation, he took an honorary consulship in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the capital of the British colony of [[Myanmar|Burma]], then administered from [[New Delhi]] as a province of [[British India]]. Rangoon was a place he had never heard of before.<ref name="Tarn15"/> Later, mired in isolation and loneliness, he worked in [[Colombo]] ([[Ceylon]]), [[Jakarta|Batavia]] ([[Java (island)|Java]]), and [[Singapore]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpMoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT120 |title=Neruda: el llamado del poeta |first=Mark |last=Eisner |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Espanol |date=1 May 2018 |page=120 |isbn=978-1-4185-9767-2}}</ref> In Batavia the following year he met and married (6 December 1930) his first wife, a Dutch bank employee named Marijke Antonieta Hagenaar Vogelzang (born as Marietje Antonia Hagenaar),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Marietje-Antonia-Reyes-Hagenaar/6000000003759568377|title=Marietje Antonia Reyes-Hagenaar|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=14 June 2019}}</ref> known as Maruca.<ref><nowiki> {{Mark Eisner</nowiki> : Pablo Neruda – The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 190</ref> While he was in the diplomatic service, Neruda read large amounts of verse, experimented with many different poetic forms, and wrote the first two volumes of [[Residence on Earth|''Residencia en la Tierra'']], which includes many [[surrealism|surrealist]] poems.

==Diplomatic and political career==

===Spanish Civil War===

After returning to Chile, Neruda was given diplomatic posts in [[Buenos Aires]] and then [[Barcelona]], Spain.<ref name="Tarn16">Tarn (1975) p. 16</ref> He later succeeded Gabriela Mistral as consul in [[Madrid]], where he became the center of a lively literary circle, befriending such writers as [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Federico García Lorca]], and the Peruvian poet [[César Vallejo]].<ref name="Tarn16"/> His only offspring, his daughter '''Malva Marina (Trinidad) Reyes''', was born in Madrid in 1934. She was plagued with severe health problems, especially suffering from [[hydrocephalus]].<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 109</ref> She died in 1943 (nine years old), having spent most of her short life with a foster family in the Netherlands after Neruda ignored and abandoned her, forcing her mother to take what jobs she could.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.publicbooks.org/nerudas-ghosts/ |title=Neruda's Ghosts |date=18 September 2018 |access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://worldcrunch.com/culture-society/the-tragic-story-of-pablo-neruda39s-abandoned-daughter |title=The Tragic Story Of Pablo Neruda's Abandoned Daughter |date= 8 March 2018 |access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20180226/441099715086/malva-marina-hija-pablo-neruda-hidrocefalica.html |title=La historia de cómo Pablo Neruda abandonó a su hija hidrocefálica |first=Matilde |last=Sánchez |date=26 February 2018 |access-date=29 November 2019 |newspaper=[[La Vanguardia]] |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2018/02/20/5a887f04468aeb31798b4592.html |title=La hija madrileña a la que Pablo Neruda abandonó y llamaba 'vampiresa de 3 kilos' |first=Paco |last=Rego |date=20 February 2018 |access-date=29 November 2019 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es |publisher=[[Unidad Editorial Información General]], S.L.U.}}</ref> Half that time was during the Nazi occupation of Holland, when for the Nazi mentality birth defects denoted genetic inferiority at best. During this period, Neruda became estranged from his wife and instead began a relationship with {{Interlanguage link multi|Delia del Carril|es}}, an aristocratic Argentine artist who was twenty years his senior.

[[File:Graf van Malva Marina Reyes, Oude Begraafplaats, Gouda.jpg|thumb|Grave of Malva Marina, sole daughter of Pablo Neruda]]
As Spain became engulfed in [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], Neruda became intensely politicised for the first time. His experiences during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath moved him away from privately focused work in the direction of collective obligation. Neruda became an ardent [[Communism|Communist]] for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends, as well as that of del Carril, were contributing factors, but the most important catalyst was the execution of García Lorca by forces loyal to the dictator [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name="Tarn16"/> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''España en el corazón'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'', 1938). He lost his post as consul due to his political militancy.<ref name="Tarn16"/> In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain, held in [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] and attended by many writers including [[André Malraux]], [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-141-01161-5 |page=678 |edition=50th Anniversary}}</ref>

Neruda's marriage to Vogelzang broke down and Neruda eventually obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1943. His estranged wife moved to [[Monte Carlo]] to escape the hostilities in Spain and then to the Netherlands with their very ill only child, and he never saw either of them again.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 434</ref> After leaving his wife, Neruda lived with Delia del Carril in France, eventually marrying her (shortly after his divorce) in [[Tetecala]] in 1943; however his new marriage was not recognized by Chilean authorities as his divorce from Vogelzang was deemed illegal.<ref><nowiki>{{Mark Eisner</nowiki> : Pablo Neruda – The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 306</ref>

Following the election of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] (whom Neruda supported) as President of Chile in 1938, Neruda was appointed special Consul for Spanish emigrants in Paris. There he was responsible for what he called "the noblest mission I have ever undertaken": transporting 2,000 Spanish refugees who had been housed by the French in [[Concentration camps in France|squalid camps]] to Chile on an old ship called the ''[[Winnipeg (ship)|Winnipeg]]''.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 141</ref> Neruda is sometimes charged with having selected only fellow Communists for emigration, to the exclusion of others who had fought on the side of the Republic.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 145</ref> Many Republicans and Anarchists were killed during the German invasion and occupation. Others deny these accusations, pointing out that Neruda chose only a few hundred of the 2,000 refugees personally; the rest were selected by the Service for the Evacuation of Spanish Refugees set up by [[Juan Negrín]], President of the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish Republican Government in Exile]].

===Mexican appointment===

Neruda's next diplomatic post was as Consul General in [[Mexico City]] from 1940 to 1943.<ref name="Tarn17">Tarn (1975) p. 17</ref> While he was there, he married del Carril, and learned that his daughter Malva had died, aged eight, in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands.<ref name="Tarn17"/>

In 1940, after the failure of an assassination attempt against [[Leon Trotsky]], Neruda arranged a Chilean visa for the Mexican painter [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], who was accused of having been one of the conspirators in the assassination.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 340</ref> Neruda later said that he did it at the request of the Mexican President, [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]]. This enabled Siqueiros, then jailed, to leave Mexico for Chile, where he stayed in Neruda's private residence. In exchange for Neruda's assistance, Siqueiros spent over a year painting a mural in a school in [[Chillán]]. Neruda's relationship with Siqueiros attracted criticism, but Neruda dismissed the allegation that his intent had been to help an assassin as "sensationalist politico-literary harassment".

===Return to Chile===

In 1943, after his return to Chile, Neruda made a tour of [[Peru]], where he visited [[Machu Picchu]],<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 244</ref> an experience that later inspired [[The Heights of Macchu Picchu|''Alturas de Macchu Picchu'']], a book-length poem in twelve parts that he completed in 1945 and which expressed his growing awareness of, and interest in, the ancient civilizations of the Americas. He explored this theme further in ''[[Canto General]]'' (1950). In ''Alturas'', Neruda celebrated the achievement of Machu Picchu, but also condemned the slavery that had made it possible. In ''Canto XII'', he called upon the dead of many centuries to be born again and to speak through him. [[Martín Espada]], poet and professor of creative writing at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has hailed the work as a masterpiece, declaring that "there is no greater political poem".

===Communism===

Bolstered by his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, Neruda, like many left-leaning intellectuals of his generation, came to admire the [[Soviet Union]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], partly for the role it played in defeating [[Nazi Germany]] and partly because of an idealist interpretation of [[Marxist]] doctrine.<ref name="Feinstein"/> This is echoed in poems such as "Canto a Stalingrado" (1942) and "Nuevo canto de amor a Stalingrado" (1943). In 1953, Neruda was awarded the [[Stalin Peace Prize]]. Upon Stalin's death that same year, Neruda wrote an ode to him, as he also wrote poems in praise of [[Fulgencio Batista]], "Saludo a Batista" ("Salute to Batista"), and later to [[Fidel Castro]]. His fervent Stalinism eventually drove a wedge between Neruda and his long-time friend [[Octavio Paz]], who commented that "Neruda became more and more Stalinist, while I became less and less enchanted with Stalin."<ref>Roman, Joe. (1993)  ''Octavio Paz'' Chelsea House Publishers  {{ISBN|978-0-7910-1249-9}}</ref> Their differences came to a head after the Nazi-Soviet [[Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact]] of 1939, when they almost came to blows in an argument over Stalin. Although Paz still considered Neruda "The greatest poet of his generation", in an essay on [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] he wrote that when he thinks of "Neruda and other famous Stalinist writers and poets, I feel the gooseflesh that I get from reading certain passages of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. No doubt they began in good faith [...] but insensibly, commitment by commitment, they saw themselves becoming entangled in a mesh of lies, falsehoods, deceits and perjuries, until they lost their souls."<ref>Paz, Octavio  (1991)  ''On Poets and Others''. Arcade. {{ISBN|978-1-55970-139-6}}  p.&nbsp;127</ref> On 15 July 1945, at [[Pacaembu Stadium]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, Neruda read to 100,000 people in honor of the Communist revolutionary leader [[Luís Carlos Prestes]].<ref>[http://www.neruda.uchile.cl/cronologia/cronologia6.htm Neruda, La vida del poeta: Cronología, 1944–1953], Fundación Neruda, University of Chile. Retrieved 29 December 2006.</ref>

Neruda also called [[Vladimir Lenin]] the "great genius of this century", and in a speech he gave on 5 June 1946, he paid tribute to the late Soviet leader [[Mikhail Kalinin]], who for Neruda was "man of noble life", "the great constructor of the future", and "a comrade in arms of Lenin and Stalin".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libros.libertaddigital.com/articulo.php/1276229541 |title=Alberto Acereda – El otro Pablo Neruda – Libros |publisher=Libros.libertaddigital.com |date=1 January 1990 |access-date=11 March 2010}}</ref>

Neruda later came to regret his fondness for the Soviet Union, explaining that "in those days, Stalin seemed to us the conqueror who had crushed [[Hitler]]'s armies."<ref name="Feinstein">Feinstein (2005) pp. 312–313</ref> Of a subsequent visit to China in 1957, Neruda wrote: "What has estranged me from the Chinese revolutionary process has not been [[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse-tung]] but Mao Tse-tungism." He dubbed this Mao Tse-Stalinism: "the repetition of a cult of a Socialist deity."<ref name="Feinstein"/> Despite his disillusionment with Stalin, Neruda never lost his essential faith in Communist theory and remained loyal to "the Party". Anxious not to give ammunition to his ideological enemies, he would later refuse publicly to condemn the Soviet repression of dissident writers like [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Joseph Brodsky]], an attitude with which even some of his staunchest admirers disagreed.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 263</ref>

{{Wikisource|I accuse (Neruda)|I Accuse}}
On 4 March 1945, Neruda was elected a Communist [[Senate of Chile|Senator]] for the northern provinces of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]] and [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]] in the [[Atacama Desert]].<ref>Shull (2009) p. 69</ref><ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 181</ref> He officially joined the [[Communist Party of Chile]] four months later.<ref name="Tarn17"/> In 1946, the Radical Party's presidential candidate, [[Gabriel González Videla]], asked Neruda to act as his campaign manager. González Videla was supported by a coalition of left-wing parties and Neruda fervently campaigned on his behalf. Once in office, however, González Videla turned against the Communist Party and issued the ''[[Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy|Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia]]'' (Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy). The breaking point for Senator Neruda was the violent repression of a Communist-led miners' strike in [[Lota, Chile|Lota]] in October 1947, when striking workers were herded into island military prisons and a [[Pisagua Prison Camp|concentration camp in the town of Pisagua]]. Neruda's criticism of González Videla culminated in a dramatic speech in the Chilean senate on 6 January 1948, which became known as "Yo acuso" ("I accuse"), in the course of which he read out the names of the miners and their families who were imprisoned at the concentration camp.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 199</ref>

In 1959 Neruda was present as [[Fidel Castro]] was honored at a welcoming ceremony offered by the [[Central University of Venezuela]] where he spoke to a massive gathering of students and read his [[Canto a Bolivar]]. Luis Báez summarized what Neruda said: "In this painful and victorious hour that the peoples of America live, my poem with changes of place, can be understood directed to Fidel Castro, because in the struggles for freedom the fate of a Man to give confidence to the spirit of greatness in the history of our peoples".

During the late 1960s, Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was asked for his opinion of Pablo Neruda. Borges stated, "I think of him as a very fine poet, a very fine poet. I don't admire him as a man, I think of him as a very mean man."<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 95.</ref> He said that Neruda had not spoken out against Argentine President [[Juan Perón]] because he was afraid to risk his reputation, noting "I was an Argentine poet, he was a Chilean poet, he's on the side of the Communists; I'm against them.

==Hiding and exile, 1948–1952==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-10640-0020, Berlin, III. Weltfestspiele, Vorbereitung.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Neruda with his wife and [[Erich Honecker]] in 1951]]
A few weeks after his "Yo acuso" speech in 1948, finding himself threatened with arrest, Neruda went into hiding and he and his wife were smuggled from house to house hidden by supporters and admirers for the next thirteen months.<ref name="Tarn17"/> While in hiding, Senator Neruda was removed from office and, in September 1948, the Communist Party was banned altogether under the ''Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia'', called by critics the ''Ley Maldita'' (Accursed Law), which eliminated over 26,000 people from the electoral registers, thus stripping them of their right to vote. Neruda later moved to [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], in southern Chile. From Valdivia he moved to ''Fundo Huishue'', a forestry estate in the vicinity of [[Huishue Lake]]. Neruda's life underground ended in March 1949 when he fled over the [[Lilpela Pass]] in the [[Andes Mountains]] to [[Argentina]] on horseback. He would dramatically recount his escape from Chile in his Nobel Prize lecture.

Once out of Chile, he spent the next three years in exile.<ref name="Tarn17"/> In [[Buenos Aires]], Neruda took advantage of the slight resemblance between him and his friend, the future Nobel Prize-winning novelist and cultural attaché to the [[Guatemala]]n embassy [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]], to travel to Europe using Asturias' passport.<ref name="Feinstein236">Feinstein (2005) pp. 236–7</ref> [[Pablo Picasso]] arranged his entrance into [[Paris]] and Neruda made a surprise appearance there to a stunned World Congress of Peace Forces{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, while the Chilean government denied that the poet could have escaped the country.<ref name="Feinstein236"/> Neruda spent those three years traveling extensively throughout Europe as well as taking trips to India, China, [[Sri Lanka]] and the Soviet Union. His trip to Mexico in late 1949 was lengthened due to a serious bout of [[phlebitis]].<ref name="Feinstein290">Feinstein (2005) p. 290</ref> A Chilean singer named [[Matilde Urrutia]] was hired to care for him and they began an affair that would, years later, culminate in marriage.<ref name="Feinstein290"/> During his exile, Urrutia would travel from country to country shadowing him and they would arrange meetings whenever they could. Matilde Urrutia was the muse for ''[[Los versos del capitán]]'', a book of poetry which Neruda later published anonymously in 1952.

from '''"Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon"'''

Full woman, fleshly apple, hot moon,
thick smell of seaweed, crushed mud and light,
what obscure brilliance opens between your columns?
What ancient night does a man touch with his senses?

Loving is a journey with water and with stars,
with smothered air and abrupt storms of flour:
loving is a clash of lightning-bolts
and two bodies defeated by a single drop of honey.

While in Mexico, Neruda also published his lengthy epic poem ''[[Canto General]]'', a [[Walt Whitman|Whitmanesque]] catalog of the history, geography, and flora and fauna of South America, accompanied by Neruda's observations and experiences. Many of them dealt with his time underground in Chile, which is when he composed much of the poem. In fact, he had carried the manuscript with him during his escape on horseback. A month later, a different edition of five thousand copies was boldly published in Chile by the outlawed Communist Party based on a manuscript Neruda had left behind. In Mexico, he was granted honorary Mexican citizenship.<ref name="Tarn22">Tarn (1975) p. 22</ref> Neruda's 1952 stay in a villa owned by Italian historian [[Edwin Cerio]] on the island of [[Capri]] was fictionalized in [[Antonio Skarmeta]]'s 1985 novel ''Ardiente Paciencia'' (''Ardent Patience'', later known as ''El cartero de Neruda'', or ''Neruda's Postman''), which inspired the popular film ''[[Il Postino]]'' (1994).<ref name="Feinstein278">Feinstein (2005) p. 278</ref>

==Second return to Chile==

[[File:Pablo Neruda (1966).jpg|thumb|right|Neruda recording his poetry at the U.S. Library of Congress in 1966]]
By 1952, the González Videla government was on its last legs, weakened by corruption scandals. The Chilean Socialist Party was in the process of nominating [[Salvador Allende]] as its candidate for the September 1952 presidential elections and was keen to have the presence of Neruda, by now Chile's most prominent left-wing literary figure, to support the campaign.<ref name="Tarn22"/> Neruda returned to Chile in August of that year and rejoined Delia del Carril, who had traveled ahead of him some months earlier, but the marriage was crumbling. Del Carril eventually learned of his affair with Matilde Urrutia and he sent her back to Chile in 1955.{{clarify|date=July 2021 |reason= Is "her" Urrutia? Where was she until 1955?}} She convinced the Chilean officials to lift his arrest,{{clarify|date=July 2021 |reason= What arrest?}} allowing Urrutia and Neruda to go to Capri, Italy.{{clarify|date=July 2021 |reason= Is this the same trip to Capri mentioned in the previous paragraph? That trip was said to have taken place in 1952, but the previous sentence had seemingly brought us up to 1955.}} Now united with Urrutia, Neruda would, aside from many foreign trips and a stint as Allende's ambassador to France from 1970 to 1973, spend the rest of his life in Chile.{{clarify|date=July 2021 |reason= The previous sentence had Neruda and Urrutia in Capri, so was it just a short trip if he can be said to have spent "the rest of his life in Chile"?}}

By this time, Neruda enjoyed worldwide fame as a poet, and his books were being translated into virtually all the major languages of the world.<ref name="Tarn17"/> He vigorously denounced the United States during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and later in the decade he likewise repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. But being one of the most prestigious and outspoken left-wing intellectuals alive, he also attracted opposition from ideological opponents. The [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], an anti-communist organization covertly established and funded by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]], adopted Neruda as one of its primary targets and launched a campaign to undermine his reputation, reviving the old claim that he had been an accomplice in the attack on Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940.<ref name="Feinstein487">Feinstein (2005) p. 487</ref> The campaign became more intense when it became known that Neruda was a candidate for the 1964 Nobel Prize, which was eventually awarded to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]<ref name="Feinstein334">Feinstein (2005) pp. 334–5</ref> (who rejected it).

[[File:La Sebastiana Neruda 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|La Sebastiana, Neruda's house in [[Valparaíso]]]]
In 1966, Neruda was invited to attend an [[International PEN]] conference in [[New York City]].<ref name="Feinstein342">Feinstein (2005) pp. 341–5</ref> Officially, he was barred from entering the U.S. because he was a communist, but the conference organizer, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], eventually prevailed upon the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] Administration to grant Neruda a visa.<ref name="Feinstein342"/> Neruda gave readings to packed halls, and even recorded some poems for the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name="Feinstein342"/> Miller later opined that Neruda's adherence to his communist ideals of the 1930s was a result of his protracted exclusion from "bourgeois society". Due to the presence of many [[Eastern Bloc]] writers, Mexican writer [[Carlos Fuentes]] later wrote that the PEN conference marked a "beginning of the end" of the [[Cold War]].<ref name="Feinstein342"/>

Upon Neruda's return to Chile, he stopped in Peru, where he gave readings to enthusiastic crowds in [[Lima]] and [[Arequipa]] and was received by President [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]].<ref name="Feinstein342"/> However, this visit also prompted an unpleasant backlash; because the Peruvian government had come out against the government of [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], July 1966 saw more than one hundred Cuban intellectuals retaliate against the poet by signing a letter that charged Neruda with colluding with the enemy, calling him an example of the "tepid, pro-Yankee revisionism" then prevalent in Latin America. The affair was particularly painful for Neruda because of his previous outspoken support for the Cuban revolution, and he never visited the island again, even after receiving an invitation in 1968.

After the death of [[Che Guevara]] in [[Bolivia]] in 1967, Neruda wrote several articles regretting the loss of a "great hero".<ref name="Feinstein326">Feinstein (2005) p. 326</ref> At the same time, he told his friend Aida Figueroa not to cry for Che, but for [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], the father of the Chilean communist movement, who preached a pacifist revolution over Che's violent ways.

==Last years and death==
[[File:La Chascona Santiago de Chile.jpg|thumb|La Chascona, Neruda's house in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]]]
In 1970, Neruda was nominated as a candidate for the Chilean presidency, but ended up giving his support to [[Salvador Allende]], who later won the [[1970 Chilean presidential election|election]] and was inaugurated in 1970 as Chile's first democratically elected socialist head of state.<ref name="Tarn22"/><ref name="Feinstein367">Feinstein (2005) p. 367</ref> Shortly thereafter, Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France, lasting from 1970 to 1972; his final diplomatic posting. During his stint in Paris, Neruda helped to renegotiate the external debt of Chile, billions owed to European and American banks, but within months of his arrival in Paris his health began to deteriorate.<ref name="Tarn22"/> Neruda returned to Chile two and a half years later due to his failing health.
[[File:Neruda Argentina.jpg|thumb|left| Buenos Aires 1971]]

In 1971, Neruda was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]],<ref name="Tarn22"/> a decision that did not come easily because some of the committee members had not forgotten Neruda's past praise of Stalinist dictatorship. But his Swedish translator, [[Artur Lundkvist]], did his best to ensure the Chilean received the prize.<ref name="Feinstein333">Feinstein (2005) p. 333</ref> "A poet," Neruda stated in his Stockholm speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize, "is at the same time a force for solidarity and for solitude."<ref>Pablo Neruda (1994). ''Late and posthumous poems, 1968–1974''. Grove Press.</ref> The following year Neruda was awarded the prestigious Golden Wreath Award at the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strugapoetryevenings.com/poets/english-pablo-neruda/?lang=en|title=Pablo Neruda|work=Струшки вечери на поезијата|access-date=15 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415225333/http://www.strugapoetryevenings.com/poets/english-pablo-neruda/?lang=en|archive-date=15 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As the [[Chilean coup of 1973|coup d'état of 1973]] unfolded, Neruda was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. The military coup led by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] saw Neruda's hopes for Chile destroyed. Shortly thereafter, during a search of the house and grounds at Isla Negra by Chilean armed forces at which Neruda was reportedly present, the poet famously remarked: "Look around – there's only one thing of danger for you here – poetry."<ref name="Feinstein413">Feinstein (2005) p. 413</ref>
[[File:Féretro Neruda.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Neruda laid out in his coffin, 1973]]

It was originally reported that, on the evening of 23 September 1973, at Santiago's Santa María Clinic, Neruda had died of heart failure;<ref>"Pablo Neruda, Nobel Poet, Dies in a Chilean Hospital", ''The New York Times'', 24 September 1973.</ref><ref>''Neruda and Vallejo: Selected Poems'', Robert Bly, ed.; Beacon Press, Boston, 1993, p. xii.</ref><ref>''Earth-Shattering Poems'', Liz Rosenberg, ed.; Henry Holt, New York, 1998, p. 105.</ref>

However, “(t)hat day, he was alone in the hospital where he had already spent five days. His health was declining and he called his wife, Matilde Urrutia, so she could come immediately because they were giving him something and he wasn’t feeling good."<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Chile believes it "highly likely" that poet Neruda was murdered in 1973|url = http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/11/05/inenglish/1446738467_173724.html|date = 6 November 2015|access-date = 6 November 2015|first = Ediciones El|last = País}}</ref> On 12 May 2011, the Mexican magazine ''Proceso'' published an interview with his former driver Manuel Araya Osorio in which he states that he was present when Neruda called his wife and warned that he believed Pinochet had ordered a doctor to kill him, and that he had just been given an injection in his stomach.<ref name=":1" /> He would die six and a half hours later. Even reports from the pro-Pinochet El Mercurio newspaper{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} the day after Neruda's death refer to an injection given immediately before Neruda's death. According to an official Chilean Interior Ministry report{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} prepared in March 2015 for the court investigation into Neruda's death, "he was either given an injection or something orally" at the Santa María Clinic "which caused his death six-and-a-half hours later. The 1971 Nobel laureate was scheduled to fly to Mexico where he may have been planning to lead a government in exile that would denounce General Augusto Pinochet, who led the coup against Allende on September 11, according to his friends, researchers and other political observers".<ref name=":0" /> The funeral took place amidst a massive [[Carabineros de Chile|police]] presence, and mourners took advantage of the occasion to protest against the new regime, established just a couple of weeks before. Neruda's house was broken into and his papers and books taken or destroyed.<ref name="Tarn22" />

In 1974, his ''Memoirs'' appeared under the title ''I Confess I Have Lived'', updated to the last days of the poet's life, and including a final segment describing the [[death of Salvador Allende]] during the storming of the Moneda Palace by General Pinochet and other generals&nbsp;– occurring only twelve days before Neruda died.<ref name="Tarn22"/> [[Matilde Urrutia]] subsequently compiled and edited for publication the memoirs and possibly his final poem "Right Comrade, It's the Hour of the Garden". These and other activities brought her into conflict with Pinochet's government, which continually sought to curtail Neruda's influence on the Chilean collective consciousness{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. Urrutia's own memoir, ''My Life with Pablo Neruda'', was published posthumously in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urrutia|first=Matilde|title=My Life with Pablo Neruda|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-5009-7|author2=translated by Alexandria Giardino}}</ref> Manuel Araya, his Communist Party-appointed chauffeur, published a book about Neruda's final days in 2012.<ref name="aljaz"/>

== Controversy ==

===Rumored murder and exhumation===
In June 2013, a Chilean judge ordered that an investigation be launched, following suggestions that Neruda had been killed by the [[Pinochet]] regime for his pro-[[Salvador Allende|Allende]] stance and political views. Neruda's driver, Manuel Araya, stated that doctors had administered poison as the poet was preparing to go into exile.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13634042 | work=BBC News | title=Chile judge orders Pablo Neruda death probe | date=2 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Exhumation"/> In December 2011, Chile's Communist Party asked Chilean Judge Mario Carroza to order the exhumation of the remains of the poet.

In June 2013 a court order was issued to find the man who allegedly poisoned Neruda. Police were investigating [[Michael Townley]], who was facing trial for the killings of General [[Carlos Prats]] (Buenos Aires, 1974), and ex Chancellor [[Orlando Letelier]] (Washington, 1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2013/06/03/mundo-79206-revelan-que-un-ex-agente-de-la-cia-enveneno-a-neruda.php|title=Revelan que un ex agente de la CIA envenenó a Neruda|work=INFOnews|access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130604013019/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/chilean-judge-issues-order-to-investigate-poet-nerudas-alleged-killer/2013/06/01/bd8bf8b6-cb34-11e2-9cd9-3b9a22a4000a_story.html ''Washington Post''], 2 June 2013, "Chilean judge issues order to investigate poet Neruda's alleged killer"</ref> The Chilean government suggested that the 2015 test showed it was “highly probable that a third party” was responsible for his death.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-10-23|title=Pablo Neruda: experts say official cause of death 'does not reflect reality'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/23/pablo-neruda-experts-say-official-cause-of-death-does-not-reflect-reality|access-date=2020-09-10|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

Test results were released on 8 November 2013 of the seven-month investigation by a 15-member forensic team. Patricio Bustos, the head of Chile's medical legal service, stated "No relevant chemical substances have been found that could be linked to Mr. Neruda's death" at the time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131109224723/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/forensic-tests-show-no-chemical-agents-in-remains-of-chilean-poet-pablo-neruda/2013/11/08/492f6ae0-487d-11e3-95a9-3f15b5618ba8_story.html "Forensic tests show no poison in remains of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda" 8 November 2013] ''Washington Post''.</ref> However, Carroza said that he was waiting for the results of the last scientific tests conducted in May (2015), which found that Neruda was infected with the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacterium, which can be highly toxic and result in death if modified.<ref name=":0" />

A team of 16 international experts led by Spanish forensic specialist Aurelio Luna from the [[University of Murcia]] announced on 20 October 2017 that "from analysis of the data we cannot accept that the poet had been in an imminent situation of death at the moment of entering the hospital" and that death from prostate cancer was not likely at the moment when he died. The team also discovered something in Neruda's remains that could possibly be a laboratory-cultivated bacteria. The results of their continuing analysis were expected in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-neruda/researchers-raise-doubts-over-cause-of-chilean-poet-nerudas-death-idUSKBN1CQ005|title=Researchers raise doubts over cause of Chilean poet Neruda's death|newspaper=Reuters|date=21 October 2017}} ''Reuters''.</ref> His cause of death was in fact listed as a heart attack.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Guardian Staff|date=2011-12-06|title=Pass notes No 3,091: Pablo Neruda|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/dec/06/pass-notes-pablo-neruda|access-date=2020-09-10|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Scientists who exhumed Neruda's body in 2013 also backed claims that he was suffering from prostate cancer when he died as well.<ref name=internationaltest />

===Feminist protests===
In November 2018 the Cultural Committee of Chile's lower house voted in favour of renaming Santiago's main airport after Neruda. The decision sparked protests from feminist groups, who highlighted a passage in Neruda's memoirs describing a sexual assault of a member of his staff in 1925. Several feminist groups, bolstered by a growing [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] and [[Ni una menos|anti-femicide movement]] stated that Neruda should not be honoured by his country, describing the passage as evidence of rape. Neruda remains a controversial figure for Chileans, and especially for [[Feminism in Chile|Chilean feminists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/23/chile-neruda-airport-rename-outrage-admitted-rape-memoirs|title= Poet, Hero, Rapist – Outrage of Chilean Plan to Rename Airport After Nerudo|website= [[TheGuardian.com]]|date= 23 November 2018}} ''Guardian''</ref>

==Legacy==

Neruda owned three houses in Chile; today they are all open to the public as museums: [[La Chascona]] in Santiago, La Sebastiana in [[Valparaíso]], and [[Casa de Isla Negra]] in [[El Quisco|Isla Negra]], where he and Matilde Urrutia are buried.
