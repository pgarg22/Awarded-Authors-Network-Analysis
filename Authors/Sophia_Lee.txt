'''Sophia Lee''' (1750 – 13 March 1824) was an English [[novelist]], [[dramatist]] and educator. She was a formative writer of [[Gothic fiction]].

==Life and literary production==
She was the daughter of [[John Lee (actor 1781)|John Lee]] (died 1781), actor and theatrical manager, and was born in [[London]]. Her first piece, ''The Chapter of Accidents'', a three-act drama based on [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Le père de famille]]'', was produced by [[George Colman the Elder]] at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] on 5 August 1780 and was an immediate success.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

When her father died in 1781, Lee spent the proceeds of the play on establishing a school at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where she made a home for her sisters Anne and [[Harriet Lee|Harriet]]. Her novel ''The Recess, or a Tale of other Times'' (1783–1785) was a historical romance. ''The Recess'', set in Elizabethan times, revolves around two fictional daughters of [[Cultural depictions of Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref>Siobhan Carroll, ''An Empire of Air and Water: Uncolonizable Space in the British Imagination, 1750-1850''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015 (pp.162-6).</ref> Lee also wrote the play ''[[Almeyda, Queen of Granada]]'' (1796) was a long [[tragedy]] in [[blank verse]], which opened at [[Drury Lane]] on 20 April 1796 but ran for only five nights.{{sfn|Lee|1892}}

''The Recess'' can also be regarded as a formative work of the original Gothic, echoing and pre-dating themes from other contemporary [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] writers. It was so popular that a spin-off novelette appeared in 1820, ''Rose Douglas; or, The Court of Elizabeth''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grundy|first1=Isobel|title=Sophia Lee|url=http://orlando.cambridge.org|website=Orlando Database of Women's Writing in the British Isles, Beginning to Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press Online|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref> {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[William Hazlitt]] might consider it "dismal" by comparison with the works of [[Ann Radcliffe]], but its influence both on the Gothic school of the [[Minerva Press]], and on figures like [[Walter Scott]] is nonetheless clear.<ref>C. Spooner ed. ''The Routledge Companion to Gothic'' (2007) pp. 10, 73, and 156</ref> From this work, Italian writer Carlo Federici wrote the play ''Il paggio di Leicester'' ''(Leicester's Page)'' and, in turn, that became the source of ''[[Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra]]'', ''(Elizabeth, Queen of England)'' the 1812 opera by [[Gioachino Rossini]], the libretto of which was written by Giovanni Schmidt.

With her sister [[Harriet Lee]], Sophia also wrote a series of ''Canterbury Tales'' (1797). Other works included ''The Life of a Lover'' (1804) and ''Ormond; or the Debauchee'' (1810). She died at her house near [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 13 March 1824.{{sfn|Lee|1892}}
