Cavafy's friend [[E. M. Forster]],  the novelist and literary critic, introduced his poems to the English-speaking world in 1923, famously describing him as "a Greek gentleman in a straw hat, standing absolutely motionless at a slight angle to the universe."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Forster |first1=E.

Cavafy - Greek writer|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>

Cavafy wrote 155 poems, while dozens more remained incomplete or in sketch form. During his lifetime, he consistently refused to formally publish his work and preferred to share it through local [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, or even print it out himself and give it away to anyone interested. His most important poems were written after his fortieth birthday, and officially published two years after his death.

==Biography==

Cavafy was born in 1863 in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt Province|Egypt]], to [[Greek people|Greek]] parents who originated from the [[Rum Millet| Greek community of Constantinople]] (Istanbul), and was baptized into the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Greek Orthodox Church]]. His father's name was {{lang|el|Πέτρος Ἰωάννης}}, ''Petros Ioannēs''—hence the ''Petrou'' [[patronymic]] (<small>[[Genitive case|GEN]]</small>) in his name—and his mother's ''Charicleia'' (Greek: {{lang|el|Χαρίκλεια}}; née {{lang|el|Γεωργάκη Φωτιάδη}}, ''Georgakē Photiadē''). His father was a prosperous importer-exporter who had lived in [[England]] in earlier years and acquired [[UK|British]] nationality. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in [[Liverpool]]. In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the [[Panic of 1873|Long Depression of 1873]], so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.

In 1882, disturbances in Alexandria caused the family to move again, though temporarily, to [[Constantinople]]. This was the year when a revolt broke out in Alexandria against the Anglo-French control of Egypt, thus precipitating the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War]]. [[Bombardment of Alexandria (1882)|Alexandria was bombarded]] by a British fleet, and the family apartment at Ramleh was burned.

In 1885, Cavafy returned to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. His first work was as a journalist; then he took a position with the British-run Egyptian Ministry of Public Works for thirty years. (Egypt was a British [[protectorate]] until 1926.) He published his poetry from 1891 to 1904 in the form of broadsheets, and only for his close friends. Any acclaim he was to receive came mainly from within the Greek community of Alexandria. Eventually, in 1903, he was introduced to mainland-Greek literary circles through a favourable review by [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]]. He received little recognition because his style differed markedly from the then-mainstream Greek poetry. It was only twenty years later, after the Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], that a new generation of almost [[nihilism|nihilist]] poets (e.g. [[Karyotakis]]) found inspiration in Cavafy's work.

A biographical note written by Cavafy reads as follows:

{{quote|I am from Constantinople by descent, but I was born in Alexandria—at a house on Seriph Street; I left very young, and spent much of my childhood in England. Subsequently I visited this country as an adult, but for a short period of time. I have also lived in France. During my adolescence I lived over two years in Constantinople. It has been many years since I last visited Greece. My last employment was as a clerk at a government office under the Ministry of Public Works of Egypt. I know [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and a little [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite book

}}

He died of [[cancer of the larynx]] on April 29, 1933, his 70th birthday. Since his death, Cavafy's reputation has grown. His poetry is taught in school in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], and in universities around the world.

[[E. M. Forster]] knew him personally and wrote a memoir of him, contained in his book ''Alexandria''. Forster, [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], and [[T. S. Eliot]] were among the earliest promoters of Cavafy in the English-speaking world before the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In 1966, [[David Hockney]] made a series of prints to illustrate a selection of Cavafy's poems, including ''[[In the dull village]]''.

==Work==

[[File:Kavafis.jpg|thumb|200px|Cavafy's poem Κρυμμένα ("Krimmena", ''Hidden Things'') painted on a building in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]

Cavafy was instrumental in the revival and recognition of [[Greek literature|Greek]] [[poetry]] both at home and abroad. His poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and ''milieux'' that have played roles in Greek culture. Uncertainty about the future, sensual pleasures, the moral character and [[psychology]] of individuals, [[homosexuality]], and a fatalistic [[existential crisis|existential]] [[nostalgia]] are some of the defining themes.

Besides his subjects, unconventional for the time, his poems also exhibit a skilled and versatile craftsmanship, which is extremely difficult to [[translation|translate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/01/more-cavafy/|title=More Cavafy by A. E. Stallings|date=27 January 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> Cavafy was a perfectionist, obsessively refining every single line of his poetry. His mature style was a free [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] form, free in the sense that verses rarely [[rhyme]] and are usually from 10 to 17 [[syllable]]s. In his poems, the presence of rhyme usually implies [[irony]].

Cavafy drew his themes from personal experience, along with a deep and wide knowledge of history, especially of the [[Hellenistic era]]. Many of his poems are pseudo-historical, or seemingly historical, or accurately but quirkily historical.

One of Cavafy's most important works is his 1904 poem "[[Waiting for the Barbarians (poem)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]". The poem begins by describing a city-state in decline, whose population and legislators are waiting for the arrival of the barbarians. When night falls, the barbarians have not arrived. The poem ends: "What is to become of us without barbarians? Those people were a solution of a sort." The poem heavily influenced books like [[The Tartar Steppe]] and [[Waiting for the Barbarians|Waiting for the Barbarians (Coetzee)]].

In 1911, Cavafy wrote "Ithaca", inspired by the [[Homer]]ic return journey of [[Odysseus]] to [[Ithaca|his home island]], as depicted in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The poem's theme is the destination which produces the journey of life: "Keep Ithaca always in your mind. / Arriving there is what you’re destined for". The traveller should set out with hope, and at the end you may find Ithaca has no more riches to give you, but "Ithaca gave you the marvelous journey".

Almost all of Cavafy's work was in Greek; yet, his poetry remained unrecognized and underestimated in Greece, until after the publication of the first anthology in 1935 by Heracles Apostolidis (father of [[Renos Apostolidis]]). His unique style and language (which was a mixture of [[Katharevousa]] and [[Demotic Greek]]) had attracted the criticism  of [[Kostis Palamas]], the greatest poet of his era in mainland Greece, and his followers, who were in favour of the simplest form of [[Demotic Greek]].

He is known for his prosaic use of metaphors, his brilliant use of historical imagery, and his aesthetic perfectionism. These attributes, amongst others, have assured him an enduring place in the literary pantheon of the Western World.

===Historical poems===
Cavafy wrote over a dozen historical poems about famous historical figures and regular people.  He was mainly inspired by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]] with [[Alexandria]] at primary focus. Other poems originate from [[Classical antiquity|Helleno-romaic antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine era]]. Mythological references are also present. The periods chosen are mostly of decline and decadence (e.g. Trojans); his heroes facing the final end. His historical poems include: "The Glory of the Ptolemies", "In Sparta", "Come, O King of Lacedaemonians", "The First Step", "In the Year 200 B.C.", "If Only They Had Seen to It", "The Displeasure of Seleucid", "Theodotus", "Alexandrian Kings", "In Alexandria, 31 B.C.", "The God Forsakes Antony", "In a Township of Asia Minor", "Caesarion", "The Potentate from Western Libya", "Of the Hebrews (A.D. 50)", "Tomb of Eurion", "Tomb of Lanes", "Myres: Alexandrian A.D. 340", "Perilous Things", "From the School of the Renowned Philosopher", "A Priest of the Serapeum", "Kleitos{{'}} Illness", "If Dead Indeed", "In the Month of Athyr", "Tomb of Ignatius", "From Ammones Who Died Aged 29 in 610", "Aemilianus Monae", "Alexandrian, A.D. 628-655", "In Church", "Morning Sea" (a few poems about Alexandria were left unfinished due to his death).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Savvopoulos |first1=Kyriakos |title=A Historical Guide to Cavafy's Alexandria (331 BCE - 641 CE) |date=2013 |publisher=Bibliotheca Alexandrina |location=Alexandria |isbn=978-977-452-243-7 |pages=105–194}}</ref>

===Homoerotic poems===

Cavafy's sensual poems are filled with the lyricism and emotion of [[same-sex love]]. inspired by recollection and remembrance. The past and former actions, sometimes along with the vision for the future underlie the muse of Cavafy in writing these poems.  As poet George Kalogeris observes:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kalogeris |first1=George |title=The Sensuous Archaism of C.P. Cavafy |journal=The Critical Flame |date=September-October 2009 |issue=3 |url=http://criticalflame.org/the-sensuous-archaism-of-c-p-cavafy/ |access-date=15 June 2021}}</ref>
<blockquote>He is perhaps most popular today for his erotic verse, in which the Alexandrian youth[s] in his poems seem to have stepped right out of the [[Greek Anthology]], and into a less accepting world that makes them vulnerable, and often keeps them in poverty, though the same Hellenic amber immures their beautiful bodies.  The subjects of his poems often have a provocative glamour to them even in barest outline: the homoerotic one night stand that is remembered for a lifetime, the oracular pronouncement unheeded, the talented youth prone to self destruction, the offhand remark that indicates a crack in the imperial façade.</blockquote>

===Philosophical poems===
Also called instructive poems, they are divided into poems with consultations to poets, and poems that deal with other situations such as isolation (for example, "The walls"), duty (for example, "Thermopylae"), and human dignity (for example, "[[The God Abandons Antony]]").

The poem "Thermopylae" reminds us of the famous [[battle of Thermopylae]] where the 300 Spartans and their allies fought against the greater numbers of Persians, although they knew that they would be defeated. There are some principles in our lives that we should live by, and Thermopylae is the ground of duty. We stay there fighting although we know that there is the potential for failure. (At the end the traitor [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] will appear, leading the Persians through the secret trail).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brushheadmusings.wordpress.com/2008/06/30/thermopylae-a-poem-on-the-good-kind-of-life/|title=Thermopylae – a poem on the good kind of life|date=30 June 2008|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>

In another poem, "In the Year 200 B.C.", he comments on the historical epigram “Alexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks, except of Lacedaemonians,...”, from the donation of Alexander to Athens after the [[Battle of the Granicus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavafy.com/poems/content.asp?id=129&cat=1|title=C.P. Cavafy - Poems - The Canon|website=www.cavafy.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> Cavafy praises the [[Hellenistic era]] and idea, so condemning the closed-mind and localistic ideas about Hellenism. However, in other poems, his stance displays ambiguity between the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] ideal and the Hellenistic era (which is sometimes described with a tone of decadence).

Another poem is the Epitaph of a Greek trader from [[Samos]] who was sold into slavery in [[India]] and dies on the shores of the [[Ganges]]: regretting the greed for riches which led him to sail so far away and end up "among utter barbarians", expressing his deep longing for his homeland and his wish to die as "In [[Hades]] I would be surrounded by Greeks".

[[Cavafy Museum|Cavafy's Alexandria apartment]] has since been converted into a museum. The museum holds several of Cavafy's sketches and original manuscripts as well as containing several pictures and portraits of and by Cavafy.

==Bibliography==
Selections of Cavafy's poems appeared only in pamphlets, privately printed booklets and broadsheets during his lifetime. The first publication in book form was "Ποιήματα" (''Poiēmata'', "Poems"), published posthumously in Alexandria, 1935.
