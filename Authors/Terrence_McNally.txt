==Early life and education==
McNally was born November 3, 1938, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], to Hubert Arthur and Dorothy Katharine (Rapp) McNally,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Galanes |first1=Philip |title=A Conversation With Terrence McNally, the Bard of American Theater |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/10/t-magazine/terrence-mcnally-interview.html |work=The New York Times |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> two transplanted New Yorkers from Irish Catholic backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web | title= Terrence McNally's love of Irish energy | publisher = Irish Central | access-date = April 22, 2020 | date=June 10, 2015 |first = Cahir | last = O'Doherty | url = https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irishvoice/terrence-mcnallys-love-of-irish-energy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/terrence-mcnally-obituary-us-playwright-who-charted-gay-experience-1.4219135 | title= Terrence McNally Obituary: US playwright who charted gay experience | work = The Irish Times | access-date = April 22, 2020 | date=April 4, 2020 }}</ref> His parents ran a seaside bar and grill called The Pelican Club, but after a hurricane destroyed the establishment, the family briefly relocated to [[Port Chester, New York]], then to [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], and finally to [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. There Hubert McNally purchased and managed a [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz beer]] distributorship,<ref>{{cite news |title=Clipped From The Corpus Christi Caller-Times |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9524013/the-corpus-christi-caller-times/ |access-date=24 March 2020 |work=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times |date=23 September 1976 |pages=26}}</ref> and McNally attended [[W. B. Ray High School|W.B. Ray High School]]. Despite his distance from New York City, McNally's parents enjoyed Broadway musicals. When McNally was eight years old, his parents took him to see ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', starring [[Ethel Merman]], and on a subsequent outing, McNally saw [[Gertrude Lawrence]] in ''[[The King and I]]''.<ref>{{cite book | page= 3 | title= Terrence McNally: A Casebook | first = Toby Silverman | last = Zinman | date= 1997 | publisher = Routledge}}</ref> McNally later said: "When I saw ''On the Town'', with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin with the Staten Island Ferry and the Empire State Building, I said: 'That's where I want to live.' I've never regretted it."<ref name=barnes/>{{efn|He continued: "I feel at home in New York, or I feel like a very welcome visitor.... If you really want to work in theater and you're serious about it — and I got serious about this pretty early — it's the only practical city to live in. If you can find a way. And I was very lucky that this was a much more welcoming city to new artists in the '60s than it is now. It's too expensive to live here now. The young writers I know live in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens. Nobody can live on the island now. When I got here at 17, I didn't even visit Brooklyn. I wouldn't leave the island, and now young people can't afford to be on the island, but they seem happy and find a way to make ends meet.<ref name=barnes/>}} In high school McNally was encouraged to write by a gifted English teacher, Maurine McElroy (1913–2005).{{efn|He dedicated both ''Apple Pie'' (1968), a collection of one-act plays, and ''Frankie and Johnnie'' to her.<ref name=pie/><ref>{{cite book | access-date = March 26, 2020 | page= 3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-VhOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 | publisher = McFarland | date= 2013 |title= The Theater of Terrence McNally: A Critical Study | first = Peter | last = Wolfe| isbn= 9780786474950 }}</ref>}}

He enrolled at [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]] in 1956. There he especially enjoyed Andrew Chiappe's two-semester course on [[Shakespeare]] in which students read Shakespeare's plays in roughly the order of their composition.<ref>{{cite interview |first= Terrence | last = McNally | access-date = March 27, 2020 | url = https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/latest/take-five/take-five-terrence-mcnally-60 | work= Columbia College Today | interviewer = Michael Nagle | title= Take Five with Terrence McNally '60 }}</ref> He joined the [[Boar's Head Society]]<ref name="columbiareview">{{cite web|title = History |publisher = Columbia Review |url = http://columbiareviewmag.com/history/|date = May 22, 2014|access-date = March 5, 2016 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064703/http://columbiareviewmag.com/history/|archive-date = March 14, 2016 }}</ref> and wrote Columbia's annual [[Varsity Show]], which featured music by fellow student [[Edward Kleban|Edward L.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduation, McNally moved to Mexico to focus on his writing, completing a one-act play which he submitted to the [[Actors Studio]] in New York City for production. While the play was turned down by the acting school, the Studio was impressed with the script, and McNally was invited to serve as the Studio's [[Stage management|stage manager]] so that he could gain practical knowledge of theater. His earliest full-length play, ''This Side of the Door'', deals with a sensitive boy's battle of wills with his overbearing father and was produced in an [[Actors Studio|Actor's Studio]] Workshop in 1962, featuring a young [[Estelle Parsons]].<ref name= glbtqfrontain/> Starting a career that covered both off-Broadway and Broadway, his plays cried out against [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], satirized stale family dynamics, mocked sexual mores and became a part of the social protest movement of the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrencemcnally.com/about/4590365869|title=About – Terrence McNally|website=www.terrencemcnally.com|access-date=November 22, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123054108/http://www.terrencemcnally.com/about/4590365869|archive-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref>

In 1964, his next play ''[[And Things That Go Bump in the Night]]'' put [[homosexuality]] squarely on stage which brought him the ire of New York City's conservative theatre critics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HNofesJcG0C&pg=PA165 | page= 165 |title=Broadway Babylon: Glamour, Glitz, and Gossip on the Great White Way|last=Hadleigh|first=Boze|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|date= 2013 | isbn=9780307830135}}</ref> It opened at the [[Royale Theatre]] on Broadway to generally negative reviews. The play explores the psycho-social dynamic of anxiety that leads one to preemptively and defensively accuse others of creating problems that in actuality result from one's own insecurity. McNally later said, "My first play, ''Things That Go Bump in the Night'', was a big flop. I had to begin all over again."<ref name=parademag>{{Cite web|url=https://parade.com/273718/dotsonrader/playwright-terrence-mcnally-the-most-significant-thing-a-writer-can-do-is-reach-someone-emotionally/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414112246/http://parade.condenast.com/273718/dotsonrader/playwright-terrence-mcnally-the-most-significant-thing-a-writer-can-do-is-reach-someone-emotionally/|url-status=dead|title=Playwright Terrence McNally: 'The Most Significant Thing a Writer Can Do Is Reach Someone Emotionally'|first=Dotson|last=Rader|date=March 24, 2014|archive-date=April 14, 2014|website=Parade}}</ref> Nevertheless, the producer, [[Theodore Mann]] dropped the price of tickets to $1.00 which allowed the production to run with sold-out houses for three weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/12/AR2010031200148.html|title=Playwright Terrence McNally's Love of Opera Takes Center Stage at Kennedy Center|last=Marks|first=Peter|date=March 14, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305144327/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/12/AR2010031200148.html|archive-date=March 5, 2018}}</ref>

''[[Next (play)|Next]]'' (1968), which brought him his greatest early acclaim and was directed by [[Elaine May]] and starred [[James Coco]], follows a married, middle-aged, businessman who has been mistakenly drafted into the armed forces. ''[[Botticelli (play)|Botticelli]]'' (1968) centers on two American soldiers standing guard in the jungle while making a game of the great names in Western Civilization. ''¡Cuba Si!'' (1968) satirizes the disdain that many Americans feel for the idea of revolution though United States was itself born out of a revolution. It starred [[Melina Mercouri]]. In ''[[Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone?]]'' (1971) he celebrates while mourning the ineffectiveness of the American youth movement's conviction to "blow this country up so we can start all over again." ''[[Sweet Eros]]'' (1968) is about a young man who professes his love to a naked woman he has gagged and bound to a chair. In ''Let It Bleed'' (1972) a young couple showers and becomes convinced an intruder is lurking on the other side of the shower curtain. These and his other early plays, including ''Tour'' (1967), ''[[Witness (play)|Witness]]'' (1968), and ''[[Bringing It All Back Home (play)|Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1970), and ''[[Whiskey (play)|Whiskey]]'' (1973), form a dark satire on American moral complacency.<ref name= glbtqfrontain/>

McNally turned to comedy and [[farce]], beginning with ''[[Noon (play)|Noon]]'' (1968), a sexual farce revolving around five strangers who are lured to an apartment in lower Manhattan by a personal advertisement. ''[[Bad Habits (play)|Bad Habits]]'', which satirizes American reliance upon [[psychotherapy]], premiered at the John Drew Theatre in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton, New York]], in 1971 starring [[Linda Lavin]]. It transferred to the [[Booth Theatre]] on Broadway in 1974 and garnered an [[Obie Award]]. ''[[The Ritz (play)|The Ritz]]'' is a farce centering on a straight man who inadvertently takes refuge in a Mafia-owned gay bathhouse. It opened at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and moved to the [[Longacre Theatre]] on Broadway in 1975.

=== Mid-career ===
After the failure of ''Broadway, Broadway'' and living briefly in [[Hollywood]], he returned to New York City and formed an artistic relationship with Manhattan Theatre Club. The rapid spread of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] fundamentally changed his writing.<ref name= glbtqfrontain/> McNally only became truly successful with works such as the off-Broadway production of ''[[Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune]]'' and its screen adaptation with stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. His first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical was ''[[The Rink (musical)|The Rink]]'' in 1984, a project he joined after the score by composer [[John Kander]] and lyricist [[Fred Ebb]] had been written. In 1990, McNally won an [[Emmy Award]] for Best Writing in a Miniseries or Special for ''[[Andre's Mother]]'', a drama about a woman coping with her son's death from AIDS. A year later, in ''[[Lips Together, Teeth Apart]]'', two married couples spend the Fourth of July weekend at a summer house on [[Fire Island]]. They are all afraid to use the pool given that its owner who has just died of AIDS. It was written for [[Christine Baranski]], [[Anthony Heald]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]] (taking the place of [[Kathy Bates]]), and frequent McNally collaborator [[Nathan Lane]], who had also starred in ''[[The Lisbon Traviata]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last= Rothstein |first= Mervyn | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/03/theater/terrence-mcnally-s-four-stars-talk-happily-of-his-lips-together.html |title = Terrence McNally's Four Stars Talk Happily of His 'Lips Together' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106104335/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/03/theater/terrence-mcnally-s-four-stars-talk-happily-of-his-lips-together.html |archive-date=January 6, 2017 | work =New York Times | date= July 3, 1991}}</ref><ref>[http://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=913 "The Story"] &nbsp;[{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624124529/http://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=913 |date=June 24, 2004 }} dramatists.com, accessed March 26, 2014</ref>

With ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'' (based on the novel by [[Manuel Puig]]) in 1992, McNally returned to the musical stage, collaborating with Kander and Ebb on a script which explores the complex relationship between two men jailed together in a Latin American prison. ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' won the 1993 [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical]], the first of McNally's four [[Tony Award]]s. He collaborated with [[Stephen Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens]] on ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' in 1997, a musical adaptation of the [[E. L. Doctorow]] novel, which tells the story of Coalhouse Walker Jr., a black musician who demands retribution when his [[Model T]] is destroyed by a mob of white troublemakers. The musical also features such historical figures as [[Harry Houdini]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[J. P. Morgan]], and [[Henry Ford]]. For his libretto, McNally won his third Tony Award. ''Ragtime'' finished its Broadway run on January 16, 2000. A revival in 2009 closed after only two months.<ref>[http://www.readperiodicals.com/201104/2236775641.html#b "The Sondheim Review: Mutual admiration, Sondheim and playwright Terrence McNally began a collaboration in 1991, by Raymond-Jean Frontain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116205312/http://www.readperiodicals.com/201104/2236775641.html |date=January 16, 2014 }} readperiodicals.com, April 1, 2011</ref>

''[[Master Class]]'' (1995); a character study of legendary opera soprano [[Maria Callas]], which starred [[Zoe Caldwell]] and won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]], McNally's fourth; and the least-known of the group, ''Dedication or The Stuff of Dreams'' (2005) with Lane and [[Marian Seldes]].<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/3777 "''Dedication or The Stuff of Dreams'' Listing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308014510/http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/3777 |date=March 8, 2016 }} lortel.org, accessed February 29, 2016</ref>

McNally's ''[[Corpus Christi (play)|Corpus Christi]]'' (1997) became the subject of protests. In this retelling of the story of Jesus' birth, ministry, and death, he and his disciples are portrayed as homosexual. The play was initially canceled because of death threats against the board members of the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]], which produced the play.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/28/opinion/censoring-terrence-mcnally.html|title=Censoring Terrence McNally|date=May 28, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 8, 2018}}</ref> The board relented after several other playwrights, including [[Athol Fugard]], threatened to withdraw their plays if ''Corpus Christi'' was not produced. A crowd of almost 2,000 protested the play as blasphemous at its opening. After it opened in London in 1999, a group called the "Defenders of the Messenger Jesus" issued a [[fatwa]] sentencing McNally to death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/493436.stm|title=Fatwa for 'gay Jesus' writer|date=October 29, 1999|access-date=April 19, 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112050733/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/493436.stm|archive-date=November 12, 2006}}</ref> In 2008, the play was revived in New York City at [[Rattlestick Playwrights Theater|Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre]]. Reviewing this production for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Jason Zinoman wrote that "without the noise of controversy, the play can finally be heard.

=== Late career ===

In 2001, McNally started what became a 15-year developmental process towards Broadway with the musical ''[[The Visit (musical)|The Visit]]'', for which he wrote the book.  The music is written by [[John Kander]] and the lyrics by [[Fred Ebb]]. &nbsp; Adapted from [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]’s 1956 satire, ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' is the story of a widow who has amassed enormous sums of wealth and returns to her hometown to seek revenge on the villagers who scorned her in her youth.  The project originally starred [[Angela Lansbury]] who departed the process to care for her ailing husband. [[Chita Rivera]] became the new star and ''The Visit'' had its first production at [[Goodman Theatre|The Goodman Theater]] in [[Chicago]] in 2001. The first preview was held just ten days after the [[September 11 attacks]], and the producers were unable to get many investors or critics from New York City to fly to Chicago. In 2004, Fred Ebb, the lyricist, died. Its next regional production occurred in 2008 at The [[Signature Theatre (Arlington, Virginia)|Signature Theatre]] outside of Washington D.C. In 2014, under the direction of [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]] and starring [[Chita Rivera]] and [[Roger Rees]], ''The Visit'' had a new production at [[Williamstown Theatre Festival|Williamstown Theatre]] and then transferred to Broadway at The [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/theater/the-long-journey-of-the-visit.html|title=A Tenacious Show Finds a New Stage|last=Wallenberg|first=Christopher|date=July 17, 2014|website=New York Times|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/01/chita-rivera-broadway-the-visit-1201344607/|title=Chita River's Destination: Broadway's Lyceum For 'The Visit'|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|date=January 8, 2015|website=Deadline|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> The musical was nominated for five Tony awards including for McNally's book.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livedesignonline.com/theatre/visit-garners-five-tony-nominations|title=The Visit Garners Five Tony Nominations|last=Perkins|first=Meghan|date=May 15, 2015|website=Live Design|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

He had previously overcome [[lung cancer]] in the late 1990s that cost him portions of both his lungs due to the disease, and he was living with [[COPD]] at the time of his death.<ref name=nytobit/>

==On theater==
For McNally, the most important function of theatre was to create community and bridge rifts opened between people by differences in religion, race, gender, and particularly sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frontain|first1=Raymond-Jean|title=McNally After the 'Gay Jesus' Play|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-320/|website=The Gay and Lesbian Review|access-date=October 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124046/http://www.glreview.org/article/article-320/|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

In an address to members of the [[League of American Theatres and Producers]] he remarked, "I think theatre teaches us who we are, what our society is, where we are going. I don't think theatre can solve the problems of a society, nor should it be expected to ... plays don't do that. People do. [But plays can] provide a forum for the ideas and feelings that can lead a society to decide to heal and change itself."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frontain|first1=Raymond-Jean|title="Theatre Matters": Discovering the True Self in Terrence McNally's Dedication|journal=Journal of Contemporary Drama in English|date=November 2013|volume=1|issue=2|pages=261–78|doi=10.1515/jcde-2013-0021}}</ref>

== Archive ==
McNally donated his papers covering the years from the 1950s to 2002 to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in a series of gifts between 1999 and 2003. The archive includes all of his major works for stage, screen, and television, as well as correspondence, posters, production photographs, programs, reviews, awards, speeches, and recordings. It is an open archive.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00276 |title = Terrence McNally: A Preliminary Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |website     = norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date = February 29, 2016 |url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310065558/http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00276 |archive-date = March 10, 2016}}</ref> He had previously deposited his papers at the University of Michigan.
