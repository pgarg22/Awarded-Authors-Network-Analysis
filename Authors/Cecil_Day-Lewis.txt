'''Cecil Day-Lewis''' (or '''Day Lewis''') {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (27 April 1904 – 22 May 1972), often written as '''C. Day-Lewis''', was an Irish-born, British poet and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] from 1968 until his death in 1972. He also wrote mystery stories under the pseudonym of '''Nicholas Blake'''.

During World War II, Day-Lewis worked as a publications editor in the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] for the UK government, and also served in the [[Musbury]] branch of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British Home Guard]].<ref>McKinstry, Leo Operation Sealion: How Britain Crushed the German War Machine's Dreams of Invasion in 194 London: John Murray Publishers, 2015 201. {{ISBN|1848547048}}</ref> He is the father of actor Sir [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], and documentary filmmaker and television chef [[Tamasin Day-Lewis]].

==Life and work==
Day-Lewis was born in 1904 in Ballintubbert, [[Athy]]/[[Stradbally]] border, Queen's County (now known as [[County Laois]]), Ireland.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Garden at Ballintubbert: Stradbally, County Laois | url = http://www.ballintubbert.com/ | access-date = 23 January 2012  }}</ref> He was the son of Frank Day-Lewis, a [[Church of Ireland]] rector of that parish, and Kathleen Blake (née Squires; died 1906).<ref>{{cite book|author=C. S. Lewis|title=The Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis, Volume 3: Narnia, Cambridge, and Joy, 1950 - 1963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPYhDojB6sUC&pg=PA1657|year=2009|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0-06-194728-5|page=1657}}</ref> Some of his family were from England (Hertfordshire and Canterbury). His father took the surname "Day-Lewis" as a combination of his own birth father's ("Day") and adoptive father's ("Lewis") surnames.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Stanford|title=C Day-Lewis: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3jUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|year=2007|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-8603-5|page=5}}</ref> 
In his autobiography ''The Buried Day'' (1960), Day-Lewis wrote, "As a writer I do not use the hyphen in my surname – a piece of inverted snobbery which has produced rather mixed results".<ref>{{Cite book |author=Cecil Day-Lewis |title=The Buried Day |year=1960 |page=17}}</ref>

|quote =<poem>
IS IT FAR TO GO?

''Is it far to go?''
A step — no further.
''Is it hard to go?''
Ask the melting snow,
The eddying feather.

''What can I take there?''
Not a hank, not a hair.
''What shall I leave behind?''
Ask the hastening wind,
The fainting star.

''Shall I be gone long?''
For ever and a day.
''To whom there belong?''
Ask the stone to say,
Ask my song.

''Who will say farewell?''
The beating bell.
''Will anyone miss me?''
That I dare not tell —
Quick, Rose, and kiss me. </poem>
(c. 1940)
<ref>"Is It Far to Go?" in ''Modern English Poetry'' (1963) edited by N. Das Gupta, Vol. 2, p. 92</ref>}}

After the death of his mother in 1906, when he was two years old, Cecil was brought up in London by his father, with the help of an aunt, spending summer holidays with relatives in [[County Wexford]]. He was educated at [[Sherborne School]] and at [[Wadham College, Oxford]]. In Oxford, Day-Lewis became part of the circle gathered around [[W. H. Auden]] and helped him to edit ''Oxford Poetry 1927''. His first collection of poems, ''Beechen Vigil'', appeared in 1925.<ref name=greenwichpast/>

In 1928 Day-Lewis married Constance Mary King, the daughter of a Sherborne teacher. Day-Lewis worked as a schoolmaster in three schools, including Larchfield School, [[Helensburgh]], Scotland (now [[Lomond School]]).<ref name=greenwichpast>[http://wwp.greenwichpast.com/vip/writers/day-lewis.htm Cecil Day-Lewis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427062702/http://wwp.greenwichpast.com/vip/writers/day-lewis.htm |date=27 April 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/31/helensburgh.heroes|title=Helensburgh lays claim to title of UK's most talented town|first1=Paul|last1=Kelbie|first2=Caroline|last2=Davies|date=30 August 2008|access-date=9 July 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> During the 1940s he had a long and troubled love affair with the novelist [[Rosamond Lehmann]]. His first marriage was dissolved in 1951, and he married actress [[Jill Balcon]], daughter of [[Michael Balcon]].

During the [[Second World War]] he worked as a publications editor in the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], an institution satirised by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', but equally based on Orwell's experience of the [[BBC]]. During the Second World War his work was now no longer so influenced by Auden and he was developing a more traditional style of [[lyric poetry|lyricism]]. Some critics believe that he reached his full stature as a poet in ''Word Over All'' (1943), when he finally distanced himself from Auden.<ref name=bbc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/audiointerviews/profilepages/daylewisc2.shtml|title=BBC|access-date=9 July 2019|archive-date=14 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514070213/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/audiointerviews/profilepages/daylewisc2.shtml|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the war he joined the publisher [[Chatto & Windus]] as a director and senior editor.

In 1946, Day-Lewis was a lecturer at [[Cambridge University]], publishing his lectures in ''The Poetic Image'' (1947). Day-Lewis was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] by [[George VI]] in his [[1950 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38929 |date=2 June 1950 |page=2785  |supp=y}}</ref> He later taught poetry at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he was [[Professor of Poetry]] from 1951 to 1956.<ref name=greenwichpast/> During 1962–1963, he was the Norton Professor at [[Harvard University]]. Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968, in succession to [[John Masefield]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44494 |date=2 January 1968 |page=89}}</ref>

Day-Lewis was chairman of the [[Arts Council]] Literature Panel, vice-president of the [[Royal Society of Literature]], an Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], a Member of the Irish Academy of Letters and a [[Gresham Professor of Rhetoric|Professor of Rhetoric]] at [[Gresham College]], London.

Cecil Day-Lewis died from [[pancreatic cancer]] on 22 May 1972, aged 68, at [[Lemmons]], the Hertfordshire home of [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]], where he and his family were staying. As a great admirer of [[Thomas Hardy]], he arranged to be buried near the author's grave at St Michael's Church in [[Stinsford]], [[Dorset]].<ref name=greenwichpast/>

==Nicholas Blake==
In 1935, Day-Lewis decided to increase his income from poetry by writing a detective novel, ''[[A Question of Proof]]'' under the pseudonym Nicholas Blake. He created [[Nigel Strangeways]], an amateur investigator and [[gentleman detective]] who, as the nephew of an Assistant Commissioner at [[Scotland Yard]], has the same access to, and good relations with, official crime investigation bodies as those enjoyed by other fictional sleuths such as [[Ellery Queen]], [[Philo Vance]] and [[Lord Peter Wimsey]].<ref name="neglected">{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadlypleasures.com/Scowcroft.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060508130138/http://www.deadlypleasures.com/Scowcroft.htm|url-status=dead|title=Neglected British Crime Writers|archive-date=8 May 2006|access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref> He published nineteen more crime novels. (In the first Nigel Strangeways novel, the detective is modelled on [[W. H. Auden]], but Day-Lewis developed the character as a far less extravagant and more serious figure in later novels.)<ref name=greenwichpast/> From the mid-1930s Day-Lewis was able to earn his living by writing.<ref name=greenwichpast/> Four of the Blake novels – ''[[A Tangled Web (1956 novel)|A Tangled Web]]'', ''[[A Penknife in My Heart]]'', ''[[The Deadly Joker]]'', ''[[The Private Wound]]'' – do not feature Strangeways.

''[[Minute for Murder]]'' is set against the background of Day-Lewis's Second World War experiences in the Ministry of Information.  ''Head of a Traveller'' features as a principal character a well-known poet, frustrated and suffering writer's block, whose best poetic days are long behind him. Readers and critics have speculated whether the author is describing himself or one of his colleagues, or has entirely invented the character.

==Political views==
In his youth and during the disruption and suffering of the [[Great Depression]], Day-Lewis adopted communist views, becoming a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] from 1935 to 1938. His early poetry was marked by didacticism and a preoccupation with social themes.<ref name=infoplease>[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0814844.html Day Lewis, C], Infoplease</ref> In 1937 he edited ''The Mind in Chains: Socialism and the Cultural Revolution''. In the introduction, he supported a popular front against a "Capitalism that has no further use for culture". He explains that the title refers to [[Prometheus]] bound by his chains, quotes [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s preface to ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' and says the contributors believe that "the Promethean fire of enlightenment, which should be given for the benefit of mankind at large, is being used at present to stoke up the furnaces of private profit". The contributors were: [[Rex Warner]], [[Edward Upward]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], Barbara Nixon, [[Anthony Blunt]], [[Alan Bush]], [[Charles Madge]], Alistair Brown, [[J. D. Bernal]], [[T. A. Jackson]] and [[Edgell Rickword]].

After the late 1930s, which were marked by the widespread purges, repression, and executions under [[Josef Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, Day-Lewis gradually became disillusioned with communism.<ref name=greenwichpast/> In his autobiography, ''The Buried Day'' (1960), he renounces former communist views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artehistoria.com/frames.htm?http://www.artehistoria.com/historia/personajes/7266.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310171718/http://www.artehistoria.com/frames.htm?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artehistoria.com%2Fhistoria%2Fpersonajes%2F7266.htm|url-status=dead|title=Arte Historia Personajes|archive-date=10 March 2007|access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref> His detective novel, ''[[The Sad Variety]]'' (1964), contains a scathing portrayal of doctrinaire communists, the Soviet Union's repression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and the ruthless tactics of Soviet intelligence agents. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
