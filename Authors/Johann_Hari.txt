After university, he joined the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he worked between 2001 and 2003, and then wrote two columns a week for ''The Independent''. At the 2003 ''[[Press Gazette]]'' Awards, he won [[British Press Awards|Young Journalist of the Year]].<ref name="Spanner">{{cite news |last=Spanner |first=Huw |title=Let The Fiery Columns Glow |work=[[Third Way Magazine]] |pages=16–19 |date=November 2004}}</ref> A play by Hari, ''Going Down in History'', was performed at the Garage Theatre in [[Edinburgh]], and his book ''God Save the Queen?'' was published by Icon Books in 2002.<ref name="Spanner" />

==Plagiarism==
In 2011, bloggers at ''Deterritorial Support Group'' and ''[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

The [[Media Standards Trust]] instructed the Council of the [[Orwell Prize]], who had given their 2008 prize to Hari, to examine the allegations.<ref name=HariOrwell>{{cite news |last=Gunter |first=Joel |title=Orwell Prize Council begins investigation into Johann Hari |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/orwell-prize-council-begins-investigation-into-johann-hari/s2/a544924/ |work=journalism.co.uk |publisher=Mousetrap Media |date=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=HariMST>{{cite press release |title=Media Standards Trust response to Johann Hari allegations |url=http://mediastandardstrust.org/mst-news/media-standards-trust-response-to-johann-hari-allegations/ |publisher=Media Standards Trust |date=28 June 2011}}</ref> Hari returned the prize,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.orwellfoundation.com/news/the-orwell-prize-and-johann-hari/|title=The Orwell Prize and Johann Hari|date=28 September 2011}}</ref> though he did not initially return the prize money of £2,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pugh|first=Andrew|title=Johann Hari yet to return Orwell prize £2,000|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=47949&c=1|access-date=25 July 2017|newspaper=Press Gazette|date=27 September 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302025226/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=47949&c=1|archive-date=2 March 2012}}</ref> He later offered to repay the sum, but ''Political Quarterly'', which had paid the prize money, instead invited him to make a donation to [[English PEN]], of which [[George Orwell]] had been a member. Hari arranged with English PEN to make a donation equal to the value of the prize, to be paid in installments when he returned to work at ''The Independent'', but he did not return to work there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.englishpen.org/press/the-orwell-prize-and-johann-hari/|title=The Orwell Prize and Johann Hari – English PEN|date=4 October 2011}}</ref>

==Wikipedia smear campaign==
In September 2011, Hari admitted that he had edited articles on Wikipedia about himself and journalists with whom he had had disputes. Posing as a journalist named "David Rose", he added false and defamatory claims to articles about journalists including [[Nick Cohen]], [[Cristina Odone]], [[Francis Wheen]], [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]], [[Niall Ferguson]],<ref name="cohen hari wiki">{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Nick|date=9 July 2011|title=Diary|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|location=London|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/diary---9-july-2011|url-status=dead|access-date=28 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804025853/http://www.spectator.co.uk/politics/all/7075743/diary.thtml|archive-date=4 August 2011}}</ref> and [[Oliver Kamm]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Thompson, Damian|date=11 July 2011|title=The scandal that will not go away|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] blog|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100096411/the-scandal-that-will-not-go-away|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825110027/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100096411/the-scandal-that-will-not-go-away/|archive-date=25 August 2011}}</ref> and edited the article about himself "to make him seem one of the essential writers of our times".<ref name="cohen hari wiki" />

In July 2011, Cohen wrote about the suspicious Wikipedia editing in ''[[The Spectator]],<ref name="cohen hari wiki" />'' prompting ''[[New Statesman]]'' journalist [[David Allen Green]] to publish a blog post collecting evidence.<ref name="DAG_newstatesman">{{cite news|author=Allen Green, David|author-link=David Allen Green|date=15 September 2011|title=The tale of Mr Hari and Dr Rose|work=[[New Statesman]]|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/09/hari-rose-wikipedia-admitted|access-date=22 September 2011}}</ref> This led to a community investigation and "David Rose" was blocked from Wikipedia.<ref name="DAG_newstatesman" /> Hari published an apology in ''The Independent'', admitting that he had been "David Rose" and writing: "I edited the entries of people I had clashed with in ways that were juvenile or malicious: I called one of them anti-Semitic and homophobic, and the other a drunk. I am mortified to have done this, because it breaches the most basic ethical rule: don't do to others what you don't want them to do to you. I apologise to the latter group unreservedly and totally."<ref name="Hari149">Hari, Johann (14 September 2011).

==Later career==
In January 2012, after leaving ''The Independent'', Hari announced that he was writing a book on the [[war on drugs]], which was subsequently published as ''[[Chasing the Scream]]: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hari |first=Johann |url=http://johannhari.com/2012/01/20/a-short-update/ |title=Update |publisher=Johannhari.com |date=20 January 2012 |access-date=17 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118175610/http://johannhari.com/2012/01/20/a-short-update/ |archive-date=18 January 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/chasing-the-scream-9781408857854/|title=Chasing the Scream
|website=Bloomsbury Publishing}}</ref>

His 2015 [[TED Talk]], entitled "Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong", has been viewed over 15 million times (as of 22 February 2020) and lays out the idea that most addictions are functional responses to experiences and a lack of healthy supportive relationships, rather than a simple biological need for a particular substance.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong/ | title=TED talk: Everything you thought you knew about addictions is wrong |date=18 January 2018}}</ref>

In January 2018, Hari's book ''Lost Connections'', which deals with depression and anxiety, was published, with Hari citing his childhood issues, career crisis, and experiences with antidepressants and psychotherapy as fuelling his curiosity in the subject.<ref name=anthony18/> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/johann-hari/lost-connections/ | title=Kirkus Review: Lost Connections | date =23 January 2018}}</ref> Material from the book was criticised by neuroscientist and ''Guardian'' writer Dean Burnett, who pointed out that Hari appeared to be reporting as his own discoveries material—such as the [[biopsychosocial model]]—that has been common knowledge for decades, and for misrepresenting the medical, psychiatric, and scientific establishments as "some shadowy monolithic organisation, in thrall to the drug industry". Burnett's review was based on an excerpt of ''Lost Connections'' published in ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/jan/08/is-everything-johann-hari-knows-about-depression-wrong-lost-connections |first=Dean |last=Burnett |date=9 January 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Is everything Johann Hari knows about depression wrong? |access-date=10 January 2018 }}</ref> Burnett subsequently wrote that he had been pressured by friends of Hari's at ''The Guardian'' to offer Hari a pre-emptive right to reply and, after publication, to link to Hari's attempt at rebuttal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/garwboy/status/1352648404980162566 |title=[Thread] This has come up a few times lately. But it suddenly dawned on me that I'm not employed by the Guardian any more, so can be more honest about how this went down.
