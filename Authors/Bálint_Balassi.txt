==Life==
Balassi was born at [[Zvolen|Zólyom]] in the Captaincy of Cisdanubia and Mining Towns in the Kingdom of Hungary (today Zvolen, Slovakia). He was educated by the reformer [[Péter Bornemisza]] and by his mother, the highly gifted [[Protestantism|Protestant]] zealot, Anna Sulyok.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Balassa, Bálint|volume=3|page=240}}</ref>

His first work was a translation of [[Michael Bock]]'s ''Wurlzgertlein für die krancken Seelen'', (published in [[Kraków]]), to comfort his father while in Polish exile. On his father's rehabilitation, Bálint accompanied him to court, and was also present at the coronation [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] in Pressburg (today's [[Bratislava]]), capital of [[Royal Hungary]] in 1572. He then joined the army and fought the Turks as an officer in the fortress of [[Eger]] in North-Eastern Hungary. Here he fell violently in love with Anna Losonczi, the daughter of the captain of [[Timișoara|Temesvár]], and evidently, from his verses, his love was not unrequited. But after the death of her first husband she gave her hand to Kristóf Ungnád.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Naturally Balassi only began to realize how much he loved Anna when he had lost her. He pursued her with gifts and verses, but she remained true to her pique and to her [[marriage vows]], and he could only enshrine her memory in immortal verse.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1574 Bálint was sent to the camp of [[Gáspár Bekes]] to assist him against [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]]; but his troops were encountered and scattered on the way there, and he himself was wounded and taken prisoner. His not very rigorous captivity lasted for two years,<ref name="EB1911"/> during which he accompanied Báthory where the latter was crowned as [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]]. He returned to Hungary soon after the death of his father, János Balassi.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

In 1584 he married his cousin, Krisztina Dobó, the daughter of the valiant commandant, [[István Dobó]] of [[Eger]]. This became the cause of many of his subsequent misfortunes. His wife's greedy relatives nearly ruined him by legal processes, and when in 1586 he turned [[Catholic]] to escape their persecutions they slandered him, saying that he and his son had embraced Islam.<ref name="EB1911"/> His desertion of his wife and legal troubles were followed by some years of uncertainty, but in 1589 he was invited to Poland to serve there in the impending war with Turkey. This did not take place and after a spell in the [[Collegium Hosianum|Jesuit College]] of [[Braniewo|Braunsberg]], Balassi, somewhat disappointed, returned to Hungary in 1591. In the 15 years war he joined the Army, and died at the siege of [[Esztergom]]-[[Víziváros]] the same year as the result of a severe leg wound caused by a cannonball.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02000/02042/html/8.html Lóránt Czigány: A History of Hungarian Literature / Bálint Balassi]</ref> He is buried in [[Hybe]] in today's [[Slovakia]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

Balassi's poems fall into four divisions: hymns, patriotic and martial songs, original love poems, and adaptations from the [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]]. They are all most original, exceedingly objective and so excellent in point of style that it is difficult even to imagine him a contemporary of [[Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos]] and [[Péter Ilosvay]]. But his erotics are his best productions. They circulated in manuscript for generations and were never printed until 1874, when [[Farkas Deák]] discovered a perfect copy of them in the Radványi library. For beauty, feeling and transporting passion. there is nothing like them in Magyar literature until we come to the age of [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz]] and [[Sándor Petőfi]]. Balassi was also the inventor of the [[strophe]] which goes by his name. It consists of nine lines a b c c b d d b, or three rhyming pairs alternating with the rhyming third, sixth and ninth lines.<ref name="EB1911"/>
