'''Samuel Rowley''' was a 17th-century English dramatist and actor.

Rowley first appears in the historical record as an associate of [[Philip Henslowe]] in the late 1590s. Initially he appears to have been an actor, perhaps a sharer, in the [[Admiral's Men]], who performed at the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]]. After 1598, he assumed some non-acting responsibilities, helping Henslowe and [[Edward Alleyn]] manage the business affairs of the company. Yet he remained an actor as late as 1617, as he appears in the "plots" for plays including ''Frederick and Basilea'' (as Heraclius), ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' (as an ambassador), and ''1 Tamar Cam''. He remained with the company through its successive patronage by [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] and [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|the Palsgrave]].

As a writer, Rowley belonged to the crowd of collaborating playwrights who kept Henslowe and Alleyn supplied with new drama. Henslowe paid him for additions to [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]''; tradition, deferential to Marlowe, has assigned him the clown's bits in the 1616 edition. He wrote the now-lost ''Judas'' with William Borne (or Bird, or Boyle) and Edward Juby. He also wrote alone. His only extant solo work is ''[[When You See Me You Know Me]]'' (1603&ndash;5), a history of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] from the death of [[Jane Seymour]] to the visit of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. He also wrote a play on [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and two apparent comedies, ''Hard Shift for Husbands'' and ''A Match or no Match''â€”all three licensed shortly before his death, and none of which has survived.

On stylistic grounds, H. D. Sykes assigned him a share in ''[[The Famous Victories of Henry V]]'', ''[[The Taming of a Shrew]]'', and parts of [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s ''Orlando Furioso''. These attributions are possible but not widely accepted, as the plays are associated with [[Queen Elizabeth's Men]], a troupe with which Rowley is not otherwise associated. MacD. P. Jackson also credits him with writing ''[[Richard II, Part One]]'' which others attribute to Shakespeare.

The long-uncertain question of his connection to the more-famous [[William Rowley]] was perhaps clarified by the discovery of his will in the 1960s: in this document, a brother named William is bequeathed all of Samuel's books. Samuel Rowley died in the parish of St Mary's in [[Whitechapel]], where he had resided for decades.
