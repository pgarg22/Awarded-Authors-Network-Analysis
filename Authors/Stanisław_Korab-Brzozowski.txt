'''Stanisław Korab-Brzozowski''' (1876 - 1901 in [[Warsaw]]) was a Polish poet and translator, brother of the poet [[Wincenty Korab-Brzozowski]] and son of the romantic bard [[Karol Brzozowski]]. Representative of Polish [[decadence]]. One of the greatest poets of [[Young Poland]].

There is no information about the personal life of Stanisław Korab-Brzozowski. He was a member of [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]]'s bohema called ''children of Satan''. In 1901 Korab-Brzozowski committed suicide, probably because of his tragic love to [[Dagny Juel]].

His poems were published in the book ''Nim serce ucichło'' (Before the Heart died away) in 1910 and he translated [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s [[Fleurs du Mal]] into Polish.
