Her first collection of poetry, ''A Change of World'', was selected by renowned poet [[W. H. Auden]] for the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Award]]. Auden went on to write the introduction to the published volume. She famously declined the [[National Medal of Arts]], protesting the vote by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] to end funding for the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].

==Early life and education==

Adrienne Cecile Rich was born in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, on May 16, 1929,<ref name="nytobit"/> the elder of two sisters. Her father, pathologist [[Arnold Rice Rich]], was the chairman of [[pathology]] at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School|The Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. Her mother, Helen Elizabeth (Jones) Rich,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rich-adrienne-cecile |title=Adrienne Cecile Rich |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> was a concert pianist and a composer. Her father was from a Jewish family,<ref>{{cite book|last=Langdell|first=Cheri Colby|title=Adrienne Rich: the moment of change|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-313-31605-0|page=20}}</ref>  and her mother was a Southern Protestant;<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyvXLgnTNpIC&q=%22around+that+time%22+Adrienne+Rich&pg=PA274 |title=A to Z of American women writers – Carol Kort |date=October 30, 2007|isbn=9781438107936|last1=Kort |first1=Carol }}</ref> the girls were raised as Christians. Adrienne Rich's early poetic influence stemmed from her father, who encouraged her to read but also to write her own poetry. Her interest in literature was sparked within her father's library, where she read the work of writers such as [[Ibsen]],<ref Name="Shuman1278">Shuman (2002)  p1278</ref> [[Matthew Arnold|Arnold]], [[William Blake|Blake]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]. Her father was ambitious for Adrienne and "planned to create a prodigy." Adrienne Rich and her younger sister were home schooled by their mother until Adrienne began public education in the fourth grade. The poems ''Sources'' and ''After Dark'' document her relationship with her father, describing how she worked hard to fulfill her parents' ambitions for her—moving into a world in which she was expected to excel.<ref Name="Shuman1278"/><ref>''Critical Survey of Poetry'' (1992) Ed. Frank Northen Magill, Salem Press, p2752</ref>

In later years, Rich went to [[Roland Park Country School]], which she described as a "good old fashioned girls' school [that] gave us fine role models of single women who were intellectually impassioned."<ref Name="Martin">Martin, Wendy (1984) ''An American triptych: Anne Bradstreet, Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich'' The University of North Carolina Press p174 {{ISBN|0-8078-4112-9}}</ref> After graduating from high school, Rich earned her college diploma at [[Radcliffe College]], where she focused primarily on poetry and learning writing craft, encountering no women teachers at all.<ref Name="Martin"/> In 1951, her last year at college, Rich's first collection of poetry, ''A Change of World'', was selected by the senior poet [[W. H. Auden]] for the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Award]]; he went on to write the introduction to the published volume. Following her graduation, Rich received a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study at Oxford for a year. Following a visit to Florence, she chose not to return to Oxford, and spent her remaining time in Europe writing and exploring Italy.<ref Name="Pioneer"/>

==Early career: 1953–75==
In 1953, Rich married [[Alfred Haskell Conrad]], an economics professor at [[Harvard University]] she met as an undergraduate. She said of the match: "I married in part because I knew no better way to disconnect from my first family.  I wanted what I saw as a full woman's life, whatever was possible."<ref Name="Pioneer"/> They settled in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and had three sons. In 1955, she published her second volume, ''The Diamond Cutters'', a collection she said she wished had not been published, saying "a lot of the poems are incredibly derivative," and citing a "pressure to produce again... to make sure I was still a poet."<ref Name="Pioneer"/> That year she also received the Ridgely Torrence Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America.<ref name="Langdell"/> Her three children were born in 1955 (David), 1957 (Pablo) and 1959 (Jacob).

The 1960s began a period of change in Rich's life: she received the National Institute of Arts and Letters award (1960), her second Guggenheim Fellowship to work at the Netherlands Economic Institute (1961), and the [[Bollingen Foundation]] grant for the translation of Dutch poetry (1962).<ref Name="Langdell">{{cite book|last=Langdell|first=Cherl Colby|title=Adrienne Rich: The Moment of Change|year=2004|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|pages=xv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Academy of Arts and Letters |url=http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_popup.php?abbrev=Academy |work=American Academy of Arts and Letter Award Winners |access-date=December 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013232000/http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_popup.php?abbrev=Academy |archive-date=October 13, 2008 }}</ref><ref Name="Shuman1281"/> In 1963, Rich published her third collection, ''Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law'', which was a much more personal work examining her female identity, reflecting the increasing tensions she experienced as a wife and mother in the 1950s, marking a substantial change in Rich's style and subject matter. In her 1982 essay "Split at the Root: An Essay on Jewish Identity", Rich states: "The experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me." The book met with harsh reviews. She comments, "I was seen as 'bitter' and 'personal'; and to be personal was to be disqualified, and that was very shaking because I'd really gone out on a limb ... I realised I'd gotten slapped over the wrist, and I didn't attempt that kind of thing again for a long time."<ref Name="Pioneer"/>

Moving her family to New York in 1966, Rich became involved with the [[New Left]] and became heavily involved in anti-war, civil rights, and feminist activism.<ref Name="Shuman1281"/> Her husband took a teaching position at [[City College of New York]].<ref Name="Shuman1281"/> In 1968, she signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>  Her collections from this period include ''Necessities of Life'' (1966), ''Leaflets'' (1969), and ''The Will to Change'' (1971), which reflect increasingly radical political content and interest in poetic form.<ref Name="Shuman1281"/>

From 1967 to 1969, Rich lectured at [[Swarthmore College]] and taught at Columbia University School of the Arts as an adjunct professor in the Writing Division. Additionally, in 1968, she began teaching in the SEEK program in City College of New York, a position she continued until 1975.<ref Name="Langdell"/> During this time, Rich also received the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize from ''Poetry Magazine''.<ref Name="Langdell"/> Rich and Conrad hosted anti-war and Black Panther fundraising parties at their apartment.

In 1976, Rich began her partnership with Jamaican-born novelist and editor [[Michelle Cliff]], which lasted until her death. In her controversial work ''Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution'', published the same year, Rich acknowledged that, for her, lesbianism was a political as well as a personal issue, writing, "The suppressed lesbian I had been carrying in me since adolescence began to stretch her limbs."<ref Name="Pioneer"/> The pamphlet ''Twenty-One Love Poems'' (1977), which was incorporated into the following year's ''Dream of a Common Language'' (1978), marked the first direct treatment of lesbian desire and sexuality in her writing, themes which run throughout her work afterwards, especially in ''A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far'' (1981) and some of her late poems in ''The Fact of a Doorframe'' (2001).<ref>Aldrich and Wotherspoon (2000) ''Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History, Vol 2''. Routledge p352 {{ISBN|0-415-22974-X}}.</ref> In her analytical work ''Adrienne Rich: the moment of change'', Langdell suggests these works represent a central rite of passage for the poet, as she (Rich) crossed a threshold into a newly constellated life and a "new relationship with the universe".<ref>Langdell, Cheri Colby (2004) ''Adrienne Rich: the moment of change''. p159 Praeger Publishers {{ISBN|0-313-31605-8}}</ref>  During this period, Rich also wrote a number of key socio-political essays, including "[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]", one of the first to address the theme of lesbian existence.<ref Name="Pioneer">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview6 ''Guardian'' article, profile: "Poet and pioneer". 15 June 2002]. Retrieved August 10, 2010.</ref> In this essay, she asks "how and why women's choice of women as passionate comrades, life partners, co-workers, lovers, community, has been crushed, invalidated, forced into hiding".<ref Name="Pioneer"/> Some of the essays were republished in ''[[On Lies, Secrets and Silence]]: Selected Prose, 1966–1978'' (1979). In integrating such pieces into her work, Rich claimed her sexuality and took a role in leadership for sexual equality.<ref Name="Pioneer"/>

From 1976 to 1979, Rich taught at City College and [[Rutgers University]] as an English professor. In 1979, she received an honorary doctorate from Smith College and moved with Cliff to Montague, MA. Ultimately, they moved to Santa Cruz, where Rich continued her career as a professor, lecturer, poet, and essayist. Rich and Cliff took over editorship of the lesbian arts journal ''[[Sinister Wisdom]]'' (1981–1983).<ref>[http://www.sinisterwisdom.org/about.html#history Sinister Wisdom history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208094710/http://www.sinisterwisdom.org/about.html |date=February 8, 2012 }}</ref><ref Name="CAWP"/> Rich taught and lectured at [[UC Santa Cruz]], [[Scripps College]], [[San Jose State University]], and [[Stanford University]] during the 1980s and 1990s.<ref Name="CAWP">Cucinella, Catherine (2002)  ''Contemporary American women poets: an A-to-Z guide''. p295 Greenwood Press {{ISBN|0-313-31783-6}}</ref> From 1981 to 1987, Rich served as an A.D.

She also was awarded the Ruth Paul Lilly Poetry Prize (1986), the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in Arts and Letters from [[NYU]], and the National Poetry Association Award for Distinguished Service to the Art of Poetry (1989).<ref Name="Langdell"/><ref name="Poets.org"/>

In 1977, Rich became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}} The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}</ref> WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization.

In June 1984, Rich presented a speech at the International Conference of Women, Feminist Identity, and Society in [[Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]] titled ''Notes Toward a Politics of Location.''<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Blood, Bread, and Poetry: Selected Prose, 1979-1985|url=https://archive.org/details/bloodbreadpoetry00adri|url-access=registration|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|publisher=Norton|year=1986|isbn=0393311627|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bloodbreadpoetry00adri/page/210 210]}}</ref> Her keynote speech is a major document on politics of location and the birth of the concept of female "locatedness."  In discussing the location from which women speak, Rich attempts to reconnect female thought and speech with the female body; specifically, with an intent of reclaiming the body through verbalizing self-representation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Littman|first=Linda|year=2003|title="Old Dogs, New Tricks": Intersections of the Personal, the Pedagogical, the Professional|jstor=3650498|journal=The English Journal|volume=93|issue=2|page=66|doi=10.2307/3650498}}</ref> Further focusing on location, Rich begins the speech by noting that while at that moment in time she speaks these words in Europe, she has searched for these words in the [[United States]].<ref name=":0" /> By acknowledging her location in an essay on the progression of the women's movement, she expresses her concerns for all women, not limited to just women in her Providence. Through widening her audience to women across the whole wide world Rich not only influences a larger movement but more importantly, she invites all women to consider their existence. Through imagining geographical locations on a map as history and as a place where women are created, and further focusing on the geographical locations, Rich ask women to examine where they themselves were created. In an attempt to try to find a sense of belonging in the world, Rich asks the audience not to begin with a continent, country, or house, but to start with the geography closest to themselves –which is their body.<ref name=":0" /> Rich, therefore, challenges members of the audience and readers to form their own identity by refusing to be defined by the parameters of government, religion, and home.<ref name=":0" /> The essay hypothesizes where the women's movement should be at the end of the 20th century. In an encouraging call for the women's movement, Rich discusses how the movement for change is an evolution in itself. Through de-masculinizing itself and de-Westernizing itself, the movement becomes a critical mass of so many different, voices, languages and overall actions. She pleads that the movement must change in order to experience change. She further insists that women must change it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeShazer|first=Mary K.|year=1996|title="The End of a Century": Feminist Millennial Vision in Adrienne Rich's "Dark Fields of the Republic"|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=8|issue=3|page=46|doi=10.2979/NWS.1996.8.3.36}}</ref> In her essay, Rich considers how one's background might influence their identity. She furthers this notion by noting her own exploration of the body, her body, as female, as white, as [[Jews|Jewish]] and as a body in a nation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eagleton|first=Mary|year=2000|title=Adrienne Rich, Location And The Body.|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|volume=9|issue=3|pages=299–312|via=Academic Search Premier|doi=10.1080/713678003|s2cid=143486606}}</ref> Rich is careful to define the location in which her writing takes place. Throughout her essay, Rich relates back to the concept of location. She recounts her growth towards understanding how the women's movement grounded in the [[Western culture]] is limited to the concerns of white women to the verbal and written indications of Black United States citizens. Such professions have allowed her to experience the meaning of her whiteness as a point of location for which she needed to take responsibility.<ref name=":0" /> In 1986, she later published the essay in her prose collection ''Blood, Bread, and Poetry''.<ref name=":0" />

Rich's work with the [[New Jewish Agenda]] led to the founding of ''Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists and Our Friends'' in 1990, a journal of which Rich served as the editor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|title=Arts of the Possible: Essays and Conversations|year=2001|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|location=New York|pages=138–144}}</ref> This work coincided explored the relationship between private and public histories, especially in the case of Jewish women's rights.  Her next published piece, ''An Atlas of the Difficult World'' (1991), won both the ''Los Angeles Times'' Book Award in Poetry and the Lenore Marshall/''Nation'' Award as well as the Poet's Prize in 1993 and Commonwealth Award in Literature in 1991.<ref name="Langdell" /><ref name="Poets.org" /> During the 1990s Rich became an active member of numerous advisory boards such as the Boston Woman's Fund, National Writers Union and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa. On the role of the poet, she wrote, "We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rich/onlineessays.htm |title=Adrienne Rich: Online Essays and Letters |publisher=English.illinois.edu |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> In July 1994, Rich won the MacArthur Fellowship and Award, specifically the "Genius Grant" for her work as a poet and writer.<ref>{{cite web|title=MacArthur: The John D. and Catherine T.

In 1997, Rich declined the [[National Medal of Arts]] in protesting against the House of Representatives' vote to end the National Endowment for the Arts as well as policies of the Clinton Administration regarding the arts generally and literature in particular, stating that "I could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House because the very meaning of art, as I understand it, is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration ...

In the early 2000s, Rich participated in anti-war activities, protesting against the threat of war in Iraq, both through readings of her poetry and other activities. In 2002, she was appointed a chancellor of the newly augmented board of the Academy of American Poets, along with [[Yusef Komunyakaa]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[Jay Wright (poet)|Jay Wright]] (who declined the honor, refusing to serve), [[Louise Glück]], [[Heather McHugh]], [[Rosanna Warren]], [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], [[Robert Creeley]], and [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]].<ref Name="Langdell"/> She was the winner of the 2003 Yale Bollingen Prize for American Poetry and applauded by the panel of judges for her "honesty at once ferocious, humane, her deep learning, and her continuous poetic exploration and awareness of multiple selves."<ref name="Poets.org"/> In October 2006, Equality Forum honored Rich's work, featuring her as an icon of LGBT history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbthistorymonth.com/adrienne-rich |title=Adrienne Rich |publisher=LGBTHistoryMonth.com |date=2011-08-20 |access-date=2020-12-03}}</ref>

== Views on feminism ==
Rich wrote several pieces that explicitly tackle the rights of women in society. In ''Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law'' she offers a critical analysis of the life of being both a mother and a daughter-in-law, and the impact of their gender in their lives.  ''Diving Into the Wreck'' was written in the early 'seventies, and the collection marks the start of her darkening tone as she writes about feminism and other social issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Women's Poetry: Adrienne Rich's 'Diving into the Wreck' and Harryette Mullen's 'She Swam On from Sea to Shine'|last=Kloeckner|first=Christian|publisher=Wissenschaftlicher Verlag Trier (WVT)|year=2015|isbn=9783868216103|location=Trier, Germany|page=400}}</ref>  In particular, she writes openly about her outrage with the patriarchal nature of the greater society.  In doing so, she becomes an example for other women to follow in the hopes that continued proactive work against sexism will eventually counteract it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Adrienne Rich|last=Riley|first=Jeannette E.|publisher=The University of South Carolina Press|isbn=9781611177008|location=Columbia, South Carolina|pages=39–41|date=August 31, 2016}}</ref>

Her poems are also famous for their feminist elements. One such poem is "Power", which was written about [[Marie Curie]], one of the most important female icons of the 20th century. In this poem, she discusses the element of power and feminism. More specifically, it tackles the problem that Curie was slowly succumbing to the radiation she acquired from her research, to which Rich refers in the poem as her source of power. This poem discusses the concept of power, particularly from a woman's point of view.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Power for Women: Poems of Adrienne Cecile Rich|last=Selvalakshmi, S. & Girija Rajaram}}</ref>

Besides poems and novels, Rich also wrote and published a number of nonfiction books that tackle feminist issues. Some of these books are: ''Of Woman Born, Motherhood as Experience and Institution, Blood, Bread and Poetry, etc.'' Especially the ''Bread and Poetry'' contains the famous feminist essay entitled "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence", and ''Feminism and Community. ''

The works listed above, as well as her various interviews and documentaries, demonstrate that Rich has an in-depth perspective on feminism and society.

For one, Rich has something to say about the use of the term itself. According to her, she prefers to use the term "women's liberation" rather than feminism. For her, the latter term is more likely to induce resistance from women of the next generation. Also, she fears that the term would amount to nothing more than a label if it is used extensively. On the other hand, using the term women's liberation means that women can finally be free from factors that can be seen as oppressive to their rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adrienne Rich and the Women's Liberation Movement: A Politics of Reception|last=Sheridan|first=Susan}}</ref>

Rich also writes in depth about "white feminism" and the need for intersectionality within the feminist movement. In ''Blood, Bread, and Poetry'', Rich writes that "feminism became a political and spiritual base from which I could move to examine rather than try to hide my own racism, recognize that I have anti-racist work to do continuously within myself". She goes on to write that "so long as [feminists] identify only with white women, we are still connected to that system of objectification and callousness and cruelty called racism". Rich implores white feminists to consider the fact that "[they], as victims of objectification, have objectified other women" through their role as the oppressor, and through the white privilege they inherently possess under a racist regime.

Rich's views on feminism can be found in her works. She says in ''Of Woman Born'' that "we need to understand the power and powerlessness embodied in motherhood in patriarchal culture." She also speaks regarding the need for women to unite in her book ''On Lies, Secrets and Silence.'' In this book, she wrote:

"Women have often felt insane when cleaving to the truth of our experience. Our future depends on the sanity of each of us, and we have a profound stake, beyond the personal, in the project of describing our reality as candidly and fully as we can to each other."

Given the feminist conditions in the 1950s–1970s era, it can be said that Rich's works on feminism are revolutionary. Her views on equality and the need for women to maximize their potential can be seen as progressive during her time. Her views strongly coincide with the feminist way of thinking during that time period. According to Rich, society as a whole is founded on patriarchy and limits the rights of women. For equality to be achieved between the sexes, the prevailing notions will have to be readjusted to fit the female perspective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Michael J|title=The Unearthing of the Body in Adrienne Rich's Politics|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1067&context=theses|journal=Seton Hall ERepository, Seton Hall University}}</ref>

== Views on racism ==

Rich has written at-length on the topic of white feminism and intersectionality within the feminist movement. Citing such prominent Black feminist activists and academics as [[Akasha Gloria Hull|Gloria T. Hull]], Michele Russel, [[Lorraine Bethel]], and [[Toni Morrison]] in her works, Rich dedicates several chapters of her book ''Blood, Bread, and Poetry'' to the subject of racism. Of her essay ''Of Woman Born,'' Rich writes that her essay "could have been stronger had it drawn on more of the literature by Black woman toward which [[Toni Morrison|Toni Morrison's]] ''Sula'' inevitably pointed me".

Touching on the privilege conferred to her as white feminist author, Rich writes in ''Blood, Bread, and Poetry'' that she "is probably going to be taken more seriousy in some quarters than the Black woman scholar whose combined experience and research give her far more penetrating knowledge and awareness than mine. I will be taken more seriously because I am white, [..] and because the invisibility of the woman of color who is the scholar/critic ''or'' the poet ''or'' the novelist is part of the structure of ''my'' privilege, even my credibility."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Blood, Bread, and Poetry: selected prose, 1979-1985 – Four Poets|url=https://exhibitions.lib.udel.edu/four-poets/exhibition-item/blood-bread-and-poetry-selected-prose-1979-1985/|access-date=2021-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1981, Rich co-presented the keynote address for the [[National Women's Studies Association]] Convention in [[Storrs, Connecticut]] along with [[Audre Lorde]], delivering her speech entitled "‘Disobedience is What NWSA is Potentially About.". The theme of the convention was "Women Respond to Racism", and Rich notes the homophobia and racism that still exists "in the enclave of Women's studies itself, where lesbians are still feared and women of color are still ignored". Rich goes on to say that "women of color who are found in the wrong place as defined at any given time by the white fathers will receive their retribution unseen: if they are beaten, raped, insulted, harassed, mutilated, murdered, these events will go unreported, unpunished, unconnected; and white women are not even supposed to know they occur, et alone identify with the sufferings endured." Rich goes on to ask audiences this: "how disobedient will Women's Studies be in the 1980s: how will this Association address the racism, misogyny, homophobia of the university and of the corporate and militisit society in which it is embedded; how will white feminist scholars and teachers and students practice disobedience to patriarchy?" Rich implores audiences to rid themselves of the idea that "by opposing racist violence, by doing anti-racist work, or by becoming feminists white women somehow cease to carry racism within them", noting that white women are never absolved of their white privilege and must continually commit to anti-racist work while they are still in the role of the oppressor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|date=1981|title=Disobedience Is What NWSA Is Potentially about|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40003904|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=9|issue=3|pages=4–6|issn=0732-1562}}</ref>
