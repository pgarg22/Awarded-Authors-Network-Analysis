'''Rita Frances Dove''' (born August 28, 1952) is an American poet and essayist. From 1993 to 1995, she served as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]]. She is the first [[African American]] to have been appointed since the position was created by an act of Congress in 1986 from the previous "consultant in poetry" position (1937–86). Dove also received an appointment as "special consultant in poetry" for the Library of Congress's bicentennial year from 1999 to 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=1850|title=Rita Dove|date= March 14, 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date= March 15, 2018}}</ref> Dove is the second African American to receive the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]], in 1987, and she served as the [[Poet Laureate of Virginia]]<ref name="test"/> from 2004 to 2006. Since 1989, she has been teaching at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], where she held the chair of Commonwealth Professor of English from 1993 to 2020; as of 2020 she holds the chair of Henry Hoyns Professor of Creative Writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://creativewriting.virginia.edu/people/rita-dove|title = Rita Dove &#124; Creative Writing Program}}</ref>

==Early life==
Rita Dove was born in [[Akron, Ohio]], to Ray Dove, one of the first African-American chemists to work in the U.S. tire industry (as research chemist at [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]), and Elvira Hord, who achieved honors in high school and would share her passion for reading with her daughter.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rita Dove | title=Comprehensive Biography of Rita Dove | url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rfd4b/compbio.html | publisher=University of Virginia | year=2008 | access-date=January 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Rita Dove Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/rita-dove/#interview}}</ref> In 1970, Dove graduated from [[Buchtel High School]] as a [[Presidential Scholar]]. Later, Dove graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. from [[Miami University]] in 1973. In 1974, she held a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] from [[University of Tübingen]], Germany. Some of her poems, translated by [[Paol Keineg]], were published in French in the Breton magazine [[Bretagnes]] in 1976.<ref>([[Bretagnes]] n°2, Morlaix, commission paritaire 57 157, p. 37-39.</ref> She received her MFA from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1977.

Dove taught creative writing at [[Arizona State University]] from 1981 to 1989. She received the 1987 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]]. In 1992, she was named [[United States Poet Laureate]]<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/dove/, Library of Congress Online resources], with links to works, commentary and recorded works.</ref> by the [[Librarian of Congress]], an office she held from 1993 to 1995. At the age of 40, Dove was the youngest person to hold the position and is the first [[African American]] to hold the position since the title was changed to Poet Laureate ([[Robert Hayden]] had served as the first non-white Consultant in Poetry from 1976 to 1978, and [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] had been the last Consultant in Poetry in 1985–86). Early in her tenure as poet laureate, Dove was featured by [[Bill Moyers]] in a one-hour interview on his [[PBS]] prime-time program ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/content/poet-laureate-rita-dove/|title=Poet Laureate Rita Dove - BillMoyers.com|access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref> Since 1989, she has been teaching at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], where she holds the chair of Commonwealth Professor of English.

Rita Dove also served as a Special Bicentennial [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] in 1999/2000, along with [[Louise Glück]] and [[W. S. Merwin]]. In 2004, then-governor [[Mark Warner]] of [[Virginia]] appointed her to a two-year position as [[Poet Laureate of Virginia]].<ref name="test">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/virginia.html|title=Virginia - State Poet Laureate (State Poets Laureate of the United States, Main Reading Room, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref> In her public posts, Dove concentrated on spreading the word about poetry and increasing public awareness of the benefits of literature. As [[United States Poet Laureate]], for example, she brought together writers to explore the African diaspora through the eyes of its artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/poetslaureate/faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions: United States Poets Laureate - Library of Congress Bibliographies, Research Guides, and Finding Aids (Virtual Programs&Services, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>

Dove was on the board of the [[Associated Writing Programs]] (AWP) (now "Association of Writers and Writing Programs") from 1985 to 1988. She led the organization as its president from 1986 to 1987. From 1994 to 2000, she was a senator (member of the governing board) of the national academic honor society [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. From 2006 to 2012, she served as a chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. Since 1991, she has been on the jury of the annual [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]]s—from 1991 to 1996 serving together with [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Henry Louis Gates]]; and since 1997 with Gates, [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Simon Schama]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (until his death in 2002) and [[Steven Pinker]] (who replaced Gould in 2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anisfield-wolf.org|title=Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards - The 82nd Annual|website=Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards|access-date= March 15, 2018}}</ref>

In the spring of 2018, Dove was named poetry editor of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.<ref>Fitzgerald, Brendan (May 25, 2018), [https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/nyt-magazine-rita-dove-poetry-editor.php/ "''NYT Magazine''’s Rita Dove on What Poetry Might Grant Unsuspecting News Readers"], ''Columbia Journalism Review'' (CJR.org).  Retrieved November 5, 2018.</ref> She resigned from the position in August 2019.

Dove's work cannot be confined to a specific era or school in contemporary literature; her wide-ranging topics and the precise poetic language with which she captures complex emotions defy easy categorization. Her most famous work to date is ''Thomas and Beulah'', published by [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] Press in 1986, a collection of poems loosely based on the lives of her maternal grandparents, for which she received the Pulitzer Prize in 1987. Dove has published ten volumes of poetry, a book of short stories (''Fifth Sunday'', 1985), a collection of essays (''The Poet's World'', 1995), and a novel, ''Through the Ivory Gate'' (1992). Her ''Collected Poems 1974–2004'' was released by [[W.W. Norton|W. W. Norton]] in 2016; it carries an excerpt from [[President Barack Obama]]'s 2011 [[National Medal of Arts]] commendation on its back cover.

In 1994, she published the play ''The Darker Face of the Earth'' (revised stage version 1996), which premiered at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Ashland, Oregon]] in 1996 (first European production: [[Royal National Theatre]], London, 1999). She collaborated with composer [[John Williams]] on the song cycle ''Seven for Luck'' (first performance: [[Boston Symphony]], [[Tanglewood]], 1998, conducted by the composer). For "America's Millennium", the [[White House]]'s 1999/2000 New Year's celebration, Ms. Dove contributed — in a live reading at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], accompanied by John Williams' music — a poem to Steven Spielberg's documentary ''The Unfinished Journey''.<ref>{{YouTube|fCFhBhAbqgQ|Rita Dove reading at "America's Millennium"}}</ref>

Dove's most ambitious collection of poetry to date, ''Sonata Mulattica'',<ref>{{cite web|last=May |first=Lori A. |url=http://www.poetsquarterly.com/2013/07/sonata-mulattica-rita-doves-juggling-act.html |title=Poets' Quarterly: Sonata Mulattica: Rita Dove's Juggling Act |publisher=Poetsquarterly.com |date=2013-07-11 |access-date=August 18, 2013}}</ref> was published in 2009; it received the 2010 [[Hurston-Wright Legacy Award]]. Over its more than 200 pages, it "has the sweep and vivid characters of a novel", as [[Mark Doty]] wrote in ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.<ref>Mark Doty, [http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Sonata-Mulattica-by-Rita-Dove-Book-Review "The Silenced Violin"], ''O, The Oprah Magazine'', April 2009.</ref>

Dove's 11th collection of poetry, ''Playlist for the Apocalypse'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393867770|title = Playlist for the Apocalypse}}</ref> was published by [[W.W. Norton|W. W. Norton]] in August 2021. New York Times critic [[Dwight Garner]] called it "among her best", "poems that are by turns delicate, witty and audacious."<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/books/review-playlist-for-apocalypse-rita-dove.html</ref>

Dove edited ''The Penguin Anthology of 20th-Century American Poetry'', published in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Brown |title=In Anthology, Rita Dove Connects American Poets' Intergenerational Conversations |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec11/ritadove_12-16.html |work=PBS NewsHour |publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions |date=December 16, 2011 |access-date=December 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Mary Jo |last=Brooks |title=Friday on the NewsHour: Rita Dove |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2011/12/friday-on-the-newshour-rita-dove.html |publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions |date=December 16, 2011 |access-date=December 17, 2011}}</ref> The collection provoked heated controversy as some critics complained that she valued an inclusive, populist agenda over quality. Poet [[John Olson (poet and writer)|John Olson]] commented that "her exclusions are breathtaking". Well-known poets left out include [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[George Oppen]], [[Charles Reznikoff]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/22/poetry-anthology-race-row?INTCMP=SRCH "Poetry anthology sparks race row"], ''The Guardian'', December 22, 2011.</ref>

As Dove explained in her foreword and in media interviews, she had originally selected works by Plath, Ginsberg and Brown but these as well as some other poets were left out against her editorial wishes; their contributions had to be removed from print-ready copy at the very last minute because their publisher forbade their inclusion due to a disagreement with [[Penguin (publisher)|Penguin]] over permission fees. Critic [[Helen Vendler]] condemned Dove's choices, asking "why are we being asked to sample so many poets of little or no lasting value?"<ref>{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Vendler | title=Are These the Poems to Remember?|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/are-these-poems-remember/| work=The New York Review of Books| date=November 24, 2011}}</ref> Dove defended her choices and omissions vigorously in her response to Vendler in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',<ref>{{cite news |first=Rita |last=Dove | title=Defending An Anthology|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/dec/22/defending-anthology/| work=The New York Review of Books| date=December 22, 2011}}</ref> as well as in wide-ranging interviews with ''[[The Writer's Chronicle]]'',<ref>{{cite news | title=Editing the Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry: An Interview with Rita Dove|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rfd4b/interviews/2011/writers-chronicle-interview-dec%202011.pdf|work=The Writer's Chronicle|date=December 2011}}</ref> with poet [[Jericho Brown]] on the Best American Poetry website,<ref>{{cite news | title=Until the Fulcrum Tips: A Conversation with Rita Dove and Jericho Brown|url=http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/201le1/12/until-the-fulcrum-tips-a-conversation-with-rita-dove-and-jericho-brown.html}}</ref> and with [[Bill Moyers]] on his public television show ''[[Moyers & Company]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title=Rita Dove on the Power of Poetry|publisher=Moyers|date=February 17, 2012| url=http://billmoyers.com/segment/rita-dove-on-the-power-of-poetry/}}</ref> The ''[[Boston Review]]'' continued the discussion from different angles with an aggressive attack by scholar [[Marjorie Perloff]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/poetry/marjorie-perloff-poetry-lyric-reinvention |title=Poetry on the Brink |work=Boston Review |date=May 18, 2012 |access-date=August 18, 2013}}</ref> and a spirited counter-attack by poet and scholar [[Evie Shockley]], who took on both Vendler and Perloff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/poetry/shifting-imbalance |title=Shifting the (Im)balance |work=Boston Review |date=June 6, 2013 |access-date=August 18, 2013}}</ref>

In 2019, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Walt Whitman's birth, Dove put the African-American poetic reception of Whitman into perspective at a poetry festival in Bogotá, Colombia, during a round-table session with [[Robert Pinsky]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPM2hxekwU "Rita Dove on Walt Whitman (Sept. 2019)"].
