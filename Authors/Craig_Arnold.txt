==Disappearance==

On April 27, 2009, Arnold went missing on the small volcanic island of [[Kuchinoerabujima]], Japan. He went for a solo hike to explore an active volcano on the island and never returned to the inn where he was staying. While Japanese law mandates government-backed searches for three days, on April 30, 2009, the Japanese government agreed to extend the search an additional three days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/04/japan.missing.professor/|title=Search for U.S. professor in Japan extended through Tuesday - CNN.com|last=Hanna|first=Jason|website=www.cnn.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-13}}</ref> Arnold was not found, and the search was then picked up by the international [[NGO]] 1st Special Response Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trackers find trail of missing US poet in Japan|agency=Associated Press|date=2009-05-06|last=Yamaguchi|first=Mari|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gLhJ5hsGFROyZtfT6uRyIiG0_MwwD980VT5G3|access-date=2009-05-06}}</ref> Arnold's trail was found near a high cliff, and he was presumed to have died from a fall near the date of his disappearance.<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/news/showrelease.asp?id=31201 University of Wyoming > News Release > News Release: ''UW Poet and Professor Believed to Have Died After Fall'' > May 8, 2009]</ref>
