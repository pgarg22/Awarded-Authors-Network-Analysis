==Biography and career==
===Biography===
Alice Mary Norton was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1912.<ref>Bankston, John. Andre Norton. New York: Chelsea House, 2010, p. 16.</ref>  Her parents were Adalbert Freely Norton, who owned a rug company, and Bertha Stemm Norton. Alice began writing at [[Collinwood High School (Cleveland)|Collinwood High School]] in Cleveland, under the tutelage of Sylvia Cochrane. She was the editor of a literary page in the school's paper, ''The Collinwood Spotlight'', for which she wrote short stories. During this time, she wrote her first book, ''Ralestone Luck'', which was eventually published as her second novel in 1938.

After graduating from high school in 1930, Norton planned to become a teacher, and began studying at [[Flora Stone Mather College]] of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]]. However, in 1932 she had to leave because of the Depression and began working for the [[Cleveland Public Library|Cleveland Library System]],<ref name="Mclellan" /> where she remained for 18 years, latterly in the children's section of the Nottingham Branch Library in Cleveland. In 1934, she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton, a pen name she had adopted for her first book, published later that year, to increase her marketability, since boys were the main audience for fantasy.<ref name="Mclellan" />

During 1940–1941, she worked as a special librarian in the cataloging department of the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>Bankston, John. Andre Norton. New York: Chelsea House, 2010, p. 50.</ref> She was involved in a project related to alien citizenship which was abruptly terminated upon the American entry into [[World War&nbsp;II]].<!--cn--> In 1941 she bought a bookstore called Mystery House in [[Mount Rainier, Maryland]], the eastern neighbor of [[Washington, D.C.]] The business failed, and she returned to the Cleveland Public Library until 1950, when she retired due to ill health.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Holland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |title=Obituary: Andre Norton &#124; Books |work=The Guardian |date=2013-07-06 |access-date=2013-07-14}}</ref> She then began working as a [[publisher's reader|reader]] for publisher-editor [[Martin Greenberg]]{{efn|[[Martin Greenberg]] is no relation of [[Martin H. Greenberg]] (1941–2011)<!-- MHG claimed, we say --> with whom Norton co-edited the ''Catfantastic'' series of five anthologies ([[DAW Books]], 1989 to 1999).}} at [[Gnome Press]], a [[small press]] in New York City that focused on science fiction.<!-- source is our Gnome Press --> She remained until 1958, when, with 21 novels published,<!--publ dates 1934 to 1957--><ref name="Lehmannhaupt" /><ref name="kirkus-search"/> she became a full-time professional writer.

As Norton's health became uncertain, she moved to [[Winter Park, Florida]] in November 1966, where she remained until 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andre-norton.org/anorton/anbio.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130223162336/http://www.andre-norton.org/anorton/anbio.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-23 |title=ANDRE NORTON ORG: Biography of Andre Norton |publisher=Andre-norton.org |date=1912-02-17 |author=Maciej Zaleski-Ejgierd |access-date=2013-07-14 }}</ref>  She moved to [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] in 1997 and was under [[hospice care]] from February 21, 2005. She died at home on March 17, 2005, of congestive heart failure.

===Literary career===
{{For|a full list of Norton's books|Andre Norton bibliography}}
[[File:Fantasy book 1947 v1 n1.jpg|thumb|right|Norton's novelette "The People of the Crater", published under her "Andrew North" pseudonym, was the cover story in the debut issue of ''Fantasy Book'' in 1947.]]

[[File:Fantasy book 1948 n3.jpg|thumb|right|"The Gifts of Asti", also published under the "North" byline, took the cover of the third issue of ''Fantasy Book'' in 1948.]]

In 1934, her first book, ''The Prince Commands, being sundry adventures of Michael Karl, sometime crown prince & pretender to the throne of Morvania'', with illustrations by [[Kate Seredy]],  was published by [[D. Appleton & Company|D.&nbsp;Appleton–Century Company]] (cataloged by the U.S. Library of Congress as by "André Norton").<ref name="LCC" /><ref name="LCC1" /> She went on to write several historical novels for the juvenile (now called "young adult") market.

Norton's first published science fiction was a [[short story]], "The People of the Crater", which appeared under the name "Andrew North" as pages 4–18 of the inaugural 1947 number of ''[[Fantasy Book]]'', a magazine from [[Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc.]]<ref name="isfdb" /><!-- eds. owner [[William L. Crawford]] and Margaret Crawford; eight numbers 1947 to 1951 --> Her first fantasy novel, ''Huon of the Horn'', published by [[Harcourt Brace]] under her own name in 1951, adapted the 13th-century story of [[Huon of Bordeaux|Huon, Duke of Bordeaux]].<ref name="isfdb-huon" /> Her first science fiction novel, ''Star Man's Son, 2250 A.D.'', appeared from Harcourt in 1952.<ref name="Locus" /> She became a prolific novelist in the 1950s, with many of her books published for the juvenile market, at least in their original hardcover editions.

As of 1958, when she became a full-time professional writer, ''Kirkus'' had reviewed 16 of her novels,{{efn|name=starred}} and awarded four of them starred reviews.<ref name="kirkus-search"/>  Her four starred reviews to 1957 had been awarded for three historical adventure novels—''Follow the Drum'' (1942), ''Scarface'' (1948), ''Yankee Privateer'' (1955)—and one cold war adventure, ''At Swords' Points'' (1954). She received four starred reviews subsequently, latest in 1966, including three for science fiction.<ref name= "kirkus-search"/>

Norton was twice nominated for the [[Hugo Award]], in 1964 for the novel ''Witch World'' and in 1967 for the novelette "Wizard's World". She was nominated three times for the [[World Fantasy Award]] for lifetime achievement, winning the award in 1998. Norton won a number of other genre awards and regularly had works appear in the ''Locus'' annual "best of year" polls.<ref name="SFAwards" />

She was a founding member of the [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America]] (SAGA), a loose-knit group of [[heroic fantasy]] authors founded in the 1960s, led by [[Lin Carter]], with entry by fantasy credentials alone. Norton was the only woman among the original eight members.<!-- source is our SAGA; later 15 inclg 5 women --> Some works by SAGA members were published in [[Lin Carter]]'s ''[[Flashing Swords!]]'' anthologies.

In 1976, [[Gary Gygax]] invited Norton to play ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' in his [[Greyhawk]] world. Norton subsequently wrote ''Quag Keep'', which involved a group of characters who travel from the real world to Greyhawk. It was the first novel to be set, at least partially, in the Greyhawk setting and, according to ''Alternative Worlds'', the first to be based on ''D&D''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Andre|author2=Jean Rabe|title=Return to Quag Keep |publisher=MacMillan |date=2006 | pages=Introduction | isbn=0-7653-1298-0 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zRiBR0YlFJAC&q=greyhawk+gygax&pg=PP3 }}</ref> ''Quag Keep'' was excerpted in Issue 12 of ''The Dragon'' (February 1978) just prior to the book's release.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Norton| first = Andre | author-link = Andre Norton | title = Quag's Keep (excerpts) | journal = The Dragon | issue = 12 | pages = 22–30 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | location = Lake Geneva WI |date=February 1978}}</ref> She and [[Jean Rabe]] were collaborating on the sequel to her 1979 [[Greyhawk]] novel ''Quag Keep'' when she died. ''Return to Quag Keep'' was completed by Rabe and published by [[Tor Books]] in January 2006.<ref name="isfdb" />

Her final complete novel, ''Three Hands for Scorpio'', was published on April 1, 2005. Besides ''Return to Quag Keep'', Tor has published two more novels with Norton and Rabe credited as co-authors, ''Dragon Mage'' (November 2006) and ''Taste of Magic'' (January 2008).<ref name="isfdb" /> <!-- our bibliography and ISFDB suggest that a continuing project with Mercedes Lackey was cancelled -->

===Series===
Norton wrote more than a dozen [[speculative fiction]] series, but her longest, and longest-running project was "[[Witch World]]", which began with the novel ''[[Witch World (novel)|Witch World]]'' in 1963. The first six novels were [[Ace Books]] [[paperback originals]] published from 1963 to 1968.<ref name="isfdb" /> From the 1970s most of the books in the series were first published in hardcover editions.<ref name="isfdb" /> From the 1980s some were written by Norton and a co-author, and others were anthologies of short fiction for which she was editor. (Witch World became a [[shared universe]].){{efn|name=mcconchie}} There were dozens of books in all.<ref name="Locus" />

The five novels of The Cycle of Oak, Yew, Ash, and Rowan, ''To the King a Daughter'',  ''Knight or Knave'', ''A Crown Disowned'',  ''Dragon Blade'', and ''The Knight of the Red Beard'', were written with [[Sasha Miller]].<ref>Andre Norton and Sasha Miller (2008), ''The Knight of the Red Beard'', 2009 reprint, New York:  Tor, p. [2].</ref>  The fifth and last novel was dedicated "To my late collaborator, Andre Norton, whose vision inspired the NordornLand cycle."<ref>Andre Norton and Sasha Miller (2008), ''The Knight of the Red Beard'', 2009 reprint, New York:  Tor, p. [7].</ref>  ("NordornLand cycle" is another name for this cycle.)

On February 20, 2005, the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]], which had honored Norton with its [[Grand Master Nebula|Grand Master]] Award in 1984, announced the creation of the [[Andre Norton Award]], to be given each year for an outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for the [[young adult literature]] market, beginning with 2005 publications. While the Norton Award is not a [[Nebula Award]], it is voted on by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot and shares some procedures with the Nebula Awards.<ref name="SFWA2012" /><ref name="SFWAnorton" /><ref name="SFAwards-nebula" /> Nominally for a young adult book, actually the eligible class is middle grade and young adult novels.<!-- for one, Jenn Reese on the blog tour --> This added a category for genre fiction to be recognized and supported for young readers.<ref>KRISTIN L.

==High Hallack Library==
The High Hallack Library was a facility that Norton was instrumental in organizing and opening. Designed as a research facility for genre writers, and scholars of "popular" literature (the genres of science fiction, fantasy, mystery, western, romance, gothic, and horror), it was located near Norton's home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.<ref name="norton">{{cite web|url=http://www.andre-norton.org/highhallack/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703173204/http://www.andre-norton.org/highhallack/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-07-03 |title=High Hallack Genre Writers' Research and Reference Library |publisher=Andre-Norton.org }}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.</ref>

The facility, named after one of the continents in Norton's ''Witch World'' series, was home to over 10,000 texts, videos and various other media.  Attached to the facility were three guest rooms, allowing authors and scholars the chance to stay on-site to facilitate their research goals.<ref name="norton" />

The facility was opened on February 28, 1999, and operated until March 2004.  Most of the collection was sold during the closing days of the facility.  The declining health of Andre Norton was one of the leading causes of its closing.<ref name="norton" />

{{notelist |30em |notes=
{{efn|name=mcconchie |1=
Regarding ''The Duke's Ballad'' "by Andre Norton and Lyn McConchie", published in 2005, McConchie states "Witch World setting, marketed as by Andre Norton and Lyn McConchie, although all writing and revision done by Lyn using Andre's background." And she says much the same for all four of their Witch World novels (1995 to 2005).
