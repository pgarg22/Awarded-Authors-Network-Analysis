Oak knew "since the age of five" that she "wanted to be a writer,"<ref name="Magnolia Chapter One">[http://magnoliachapterone.com/words-fail-writer/ Magnolia Chapter One.], Oak, Raven, "When Words Fail a Writer."</ref> a wish that never changed through the years. "They said I could be anything, do anything. So I did!"<ref name="Magnolia Chapter One" />

Of Oak's music, Score! Music says: "Perfectly stunning musical compositions that, though they lack vocals, do not lack in emotional impact; it’s as though one can venture inside Oak’s being through her beautiful piano work. Think Tori Amos unplugged and without lyrics."<ref name="Score Review">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100410141758/http://www.scoremusicmagazine.com/ Score! Music Magazine.], Jeanne.
