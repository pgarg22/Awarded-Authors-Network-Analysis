'''Ram Prasad Bismil''' ({{audio|Bismil.ogg|pronunciation}}) (11 June 1897 — 19 December 1927) was an Indian revolutionary who participated in the [[Mainpuri]] Conspiracy of 1918, and the [[Kakori Conspiracy]] of 1925, and fought against [[British rule in India]]. Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil was a freedom fighter who played an active role in India’s freedom struggle. In memory of his contribution towards India’s independence, June 11 is celebrated as his birth anniversary.He was known for being a part of the Manipuri conspiracy in 1918 and the Kakori incident in 1925. The Kakori incident was one of the important events of Jung-e-Azadi. He also had a command of Urdu and the Hindi language, which made him a prominent revolutionary. He was also a multilingual translator and his famous poem Manipuri’s Pratigya became very famous.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=DelhiJune 11|first1=India Today Web Desk New|last2=June 11|first2=2021UPDATED|last3=Ist|first3=2021 13:23|title=Ram Prasad Bismil Birth Anniversary 2021: All you need to know|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/information/story/ram-prasad-bismil-birth-anniversary-2021-all-you-need-to-know-1813566-2021-06-11|access-date=2021-11-25|website=India Today|language=en}}</ref> Bismil was hanged on 19 December 1927 by the British for his revolutionary activities. As well as being a freedom fighter, he was a patriotic poet and wrote in Hindi and Urdu using the pen names '''Ram''', '''Agyat''' and '''Bismil'''. But, he became popular with the last name "Bismil" only. He was associated with [[Arya Samaj]] where he got inspiration from ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', a book written by [[Swami Dayanand Saraswati]]. He also had a confidential connection with [[Lala Har Dayal]] through his guru Swami Somdev, a preacher of [[Arya Samaj]]. Bismil was one of the founding members of the revolutionary organization [[Hindustan Republican Association]]. [[Bhagat Singh]] praised him<ref>{{cite book |title=Musings from the gallows : autobiography of Ram Prasad Bismil |first=Malwinder Jit Singh |last=Waraich|page=101 |publisher=Unistar Books, [[Ludhiana]] |year=2007|oclc = 180690320}}</ref> as a great poet-writer of Urdu and Hindi, who had also translated the books ''Catherine'' from English and ''Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot'' from [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

He was admitted to an English-language school, despite his father's disapproval, and also joined the [[Arya Samaj]] in [[Shahjahanpur]]. Bismil showed a talent for writing patriotic poetry.<ref name="TheWire"/>

===Contact with Somdev===
As an 18-year-old student, Bismil read of the death sentence passed on [[Bhai Parmanand]], a scholar and companion of [[Har Dayal]]. At that time he was regularly attending the Arya Samaj Temple at Shahjahanpur daily, where Swami Somdev, a friend of Paramanand, was staying.{{Sfn|Waraich|2007|p=32}} Angered by the sentence, Bismil composed a poem in Hindi titled ''Mera Janm'' (en: My Birth), which he showed to Somdev. This poem demonstrated a commitment to remove the British control over India.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-11|title=Who is Ram Prasad Bismil, the young freedom fighter who inspired a generation|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-ram-prasad-bismil-freedom-fighter-poet-5774792/|access-date=2020-09-14|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref>

===Lucknow Congress===
Bismil left school in the following year and travelled to [[Lucknow]] with some friends. The ''Naram Dal'' (of the Indian National Congress) was not prepared to allow the [[Garam Dal]] to stage a grand welcome of Tilak in the city. They organised a group of youths and decided to publish a book in Hindi on the history of American independence, ''America Ki Swatantrata Ka Itihas'', with the consent of Somdev. This book was published under the authorship of the fictitious Babu Harivans Sahai and its publisher's name was given as Somdev Siddhgopal Shukla. As soon as the book was published, the government of Uttar Pradesh proscribed its circulation within the state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lucknow Congress|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Lucknow-Pact|website=Britannica}}</ref>

==Mainpuri conspiracy==
Bismil formed a revolutionary organisation called ''Matrivedi'' (''Altar of Motherland'') and contacted [[Genda Lal Dixit]], a school teacher at [[Auraiya]]. Somdev arranged this, knowing that Bismil could be more effective in his mission if he had experienced people to support him. Dixit had contacts with some powerful dacoits of the state. Dixit wanted to utilise their power in the armed struggle against the British rulers. Like Bismil, Dixit had also formed an armed organisation of youths called ''Shivaji Samiti'' (named after [[Shivaji Maharaj]]). The pair organised youths from the Etawah, Mainpuri, Agra and Shahjahanpur districts of [[United Province]] (now Uttar Pradesh) to strengthen their organisations.{{Sfn|Bismil|1927|p=27}}

On 28 January 1918, Bismil published a pamphlet titled ''Deshvasiyon Ke Nam Sandesh'' (''A Message to Countrymen''), which he distributed along with his poem ''Mainpuri Ki Pratigya'' (''Vow of Mainpuri''). To collect funds for the party looting was undertaken on three occasions in 1918. Police searched for them in and around Mainpuri while they were selling books proscribed by the U.P. Government in the Delhi Congress of 1918. When police found them, Bismil absconded with the books unsold. When he was planning another looting between Delhi and Agra, a police team arrived and firing started from both the sides. Bismil jumped into the [[Yamuna]] and swam underwater. The police and his companions thought that he had died in the encounter. Dixit was arrested along with his other companions and was kept in [[Agra fort]]. From here, he fled to Delhi and lived in hiding. A criminal case was filed against them. The incident is known as the "Mainpuri Conspiracy". On 1 November 1919 the Judiciary Magistrate of Mainpuri B. S. Chris announced the judgement against all accused and declared Dixit and Bismil as absconders.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Revolutionary actions in Mainpuri|url=http://www.sankalpindia.net/book/revolutionary-actions-Mainpuri#:~:text=It%20is%20known%20as%20the,spite%20of%20all%20their%20efforts.|website=Sankalp Foundation}}</ref>

==Underground activities==
From 1919 to 1920 Bismil remained inconspicuous, moving around various villages in Uttar Pradesh and producing several books. Among these was a collection of poems written by him and others, entitled ''Man Ki Lahar'', while he also translated two works from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (''Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot'' and ''Yogik Sadhan'') and fabricated ''Catherine or Swadhinta Ki Devi'' from an English text. He got all these books published through his own resources under ''Sushilmala'' – a series of publications except one ''Yogik Sadhan'' which was given to a publisher who absconded and could not be traced. These books have since been found. Another of Bismil's books, ''Kranti Geetanjali'', was published in 1929 after his death and was proscribed by [[British Raj]] in 1931.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ramprasad Bismil's Idea of Revolution Is Impervious to Saffronisation|url=https://thewire.in/history/ramprasad-bismil-ideology|access-date=2020-09-15|website=The Wire}}</ref>

==Formation of Hindustan Republican Association==
In February 1920, when all the prisoners in the Manipuri conspiracy case were freed, Bismil returned home to Shahjahanpur, where he agreed with the official authorities that he would not participate in revolutionary activities. This statement of Ram Prasad was also recorded in vernacular before the court.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hindustan Republic Association|url=https://www.iastoppers.com/flashcard/who-founded-the-hindustan-republican-association-hra-3/#:~:text=Hindustan%20Republican%20Association%20(HRA)%20was,an%20offshoot%20of%20Anushilan%20Samiti.|website=IAS toppers}}</ref>

In 1921, Bismil was among the many people from Shahjahanpur who attended the [[Ahmedabad]] Congress. He had a seat on the dias, along with the senior congressman [[Prem Krishna Khanna]], and the revolutionary [[Ashfaqulla Khan]]. Bismil played an active role in the Congress with [[Maulana Hasrat Mohani]] and got the most debated proposal of ''Poorna Swaraj'' passed in the General Body meeting of Congress. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], who was not in the favour of this proposal became quite helpless before the overwhelming demand of youths. He returned to Shahjahanpur and mobilised the youths of United Province for non-co-operation with the Government. The people of U.P. were so much influenced by the furious speeches and verses of Bismil that they became hostile against British Raj. As per statement of Banarsi Lal (approver)<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0gQCrZ6hZwC&pg=PA180 |title=Perspectives in Indian History |editor-first=Atul Kumar |editor-last=Sinha |year=2004 |chapter=Revisiting Kakori Case on the basis of Vernacular Reportage |first=Habib |last=Manzar |page=180|isbn=9788179750766 }}</ref> made in the court – "Ram Prasad used to say that independence would not be achieved by means of non-violence."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-10-01|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_14_2/review_article.pdf|access-date=2020-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001140644/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_14_2/review_article.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2015}}</ref>

In February 1922 some agitating farmers were killed in [[Chauri Chaura incident|Chauri Chaura by the police]]. The police station of Chauri Chaura was attacked by the people and 22 policemen were burnt alive. Gandhi, without ascertaining the facts behind this incident, declared an immediate stop the non-co-operation movement without consulting any executive committee member of the Congress. Bismil and his group of youths strongly opposed Gandhi in the [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] session of Indian National Congress (1922). When Gandhi refused to rescind his decision, its then-president [[Chittranjan Das]] resigned. In January 1923, the rich group of party formed a new [[Swaraj Party]] under the joint leadership of [[Moti Lal Nehru]] and Chittranjan Das, and the youth group formed a revolutionary party under the leadership of Bismil.{{Sfn|Arya|1984}}{{Sfn|Waraich|2007|p=56}}

==Yellow Paper constitution==
With the consent of [[Lala Har Dayal]], Bismil went to Allahabad where he drafted the constitution of the party in 1923 with the help of [[Sachindra Nath Sanyal]] and another revolutionary of [[Bengal]], Dr. [[Jadugopal Mukherjee]]. The basic name and aims of the organisation were typed on a ''Yellow Paper''<ref name="Manzar 2004 178">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0gQCrZ6hZwC&pg=PA180 |title=Perspectives in Indian History |editor-first=Atul Kumar |editor-last=Sinha |year=2004 |chapter=Revisiting Kakori Case on the basis of Vernacular Reportage |first=Habib |last=Manzar |pages=178|isbn=9788179750766 }}</ref> and later on a subsequent Constitutional Committee Meeting was conducted on 3 October 1924 at [[Kanpur|Cawnpore]] in U.P. under the Chairmanship of Sachindra Nath Sanyal.{{Sfn|Bhishma|1929|p=71}}

This meeting decided the name of the party would be the [[Hindustan Republican Association]] (HRA). After a long discussion from others Bismil was declared there the District Organiser of Shahjahanpur and Chief of Arms Division. An additional responsibility of Provincial Organiser of United Province (Agra and Oudh) was also entrusted to him. Sachindra Nath Sanyal, was unanimously nominated as National Organiser and another senior member [[Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee]], was given the responsibility of Coordinator, [[Anushilan Samiti]]. After attending the meeting in Kanpur, both Sanyal and Chatterjee left the U.P. and proceeded to Bengal for further extension of the organisation.{{Sfn|Simha|2009|p=v. 11}}

==Manifesto of H.R.A.==
{{Main|Manifesto of H.R.A.}}
A pamphlet entitled as ''The Revolutionary'' was distributed throughout the United Province in India in the beginning of January 1925. Copies of this leaflet, referred to in the evidence as the "White Leaflet", were also found with some other alleged conspirators of Kakori Conspiracy as per judgement of the Chief Court of Oudh. A typed copy of this manifesto was found with [[Manmath Nath Gupta]].<ref name="Manzar 2004 178"/> It was nothing but the [[Manifesto of H.R.A.]] in the form of a four paged printed pamphlet on white paper which was circulated secretly by post and by hands in most of the districts of United Province and other parts of India.

This pamphlet bore no name of the printing press. The heading of the pamphlet was: "The Revolutionary" (An Organ of the Revolutionary Party of India). It was given 1st number and 1st issue of the publication. The date of its publication was given as 1 January 1925.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hanging of Ram Prasad Bismil : the judgement |first=Malwinder Jit Singh |last=Waraich |pages=12–13 |publisher=Unistar Books, [[Chandigarh]] |year=2007|oclc = 219562122}}</ref>

==Kakori train robbery==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2o0lxDKSU Kakori train action.]}}
Bismil executed a meticulous plan for looting the government treasury carried in a train at [[Kakori]], near Lucknow in U.P. This historical event happened on 9 August 1925 and is known as the [[Kakori train robbery]]. Ten revolutionaries stopped the 8 Down Saharanpur-Lucknow passenger train at Kakori – a station just before the Lucknow Railway Junction. German-made [[Mauser C96]] semi-automatic pistols were used in this action. Ashfaqulla Khan, the lieutenant of the HRA Chief Ram Prasad Bismil gave away his Mauser to [[Manmath Nath Gupta]] and engaged himself to break open the cash chest. Eagerly watching a new weapon in his hand, Manmath Nath Gupta fired the pistol and accidentally shot and killed passenger Ahmed Ali, who had gotten down from the train to see his wife in the ladies compartment.

More than 40 revolutionaries were arrested whereas only 10 persons had taken part in the decoity. Persons completely unrelated to the incident were also captured. However some of them were let off. The government-appointed [[Jagat Narain Mulla]] as public prosecutor at an incredible fee. Dr. Harkaran Nath Mishra (Barrister M.L.A.) and Dr. Mohan Lal Saxena (M.L.C.) were appointed as defence counsel. The defence committee was also formed to defend the accused.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0gQCrZ6hZwC&pg=PA180 |title=Perspectives in Indian History |editor-first=Atul Kumar |editor-last=Sinha |year=2004 |chapter=Revisiting Kakori Case on the basis of Vernacular Reportage |first=Habib |last=Manzar |pages=179–180|isbn=9788179750766 }}</ref> [[Govind Ballabh Pant]], [[Chandra Bhanu Gupta]] and Kripa Shankar Hajela defended their case. The men were found guilty and subsequent appeals failed. On 16 September 1927, a final appeal for clemency was forwarded to the [[Privy Council]] in London but that also failed.{{Sfn|Waraich|2007|p=97}}

Following 18 months of legal process, Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan, Roshan Singh and [[Rajendra Nath Lahiri]] were sentenced to death. Bismil was hanged on 19 December 1927 at [[Gorakhpur]] Jail, Ashfaqulla Khan at the [[Faizabad]] Jail and Thakur Roshan Singh at Naini Allahabad Jail. Lahiri had been hanged two days earlier at [[Gonda, Uttar Pradesh|Gonda]] Jail.

Bismil's body was taken to the [[West Rapti River|Rapti]] river for a Hindu cremation, and the site became known as ''Rajghat.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=VIDEO: देश में बना पहला अशफाक उल्ला खां और राम प्रसाद बिस्मिल स्मारक, हिंदू-मुस्लिम भाईचारे की मिसाल कर रहा पेश|url=https://www.patrika.com/bulandshahr-news/first-ashfaq-ullah-khan-and-ram-prasad-bismil-smarak-5684595/|access-date=2020-09-14|website=Patrika News|date=23 January 2020|language=hi}}</ref>

==Literary works==
Bismil published a pamphlet titled ''Deshvasiyon ke nam sandesh'' (en: A message to my countrymen). While living underground, he translated some of Bengali books viz. ''Bolshevikon Ki Kartoot'' (en: The Bolshevik's programme) and ''Yogik Sadhan'' (of Arvind Ghosh). Beside these a collection of poems ''Man Ki Lahar'' (en: A sally of mind) and ''Swadeshi Rang'' was also written by him. Another ''Swadhinta ki devi: Catherine'' was fabricated from an English book<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/littlegrandmothe00bresuoft|title=The little grandmother of the Russian revolution;|first1=Ekaterina Konstantinovna|last1=Breshko-Breshkovskaia|first2=Alice Stone|last2=Blackwell|date=1 January 1918|publisher=Boston, Little, Brown|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> into Hindi. All of these were published by him in ''Sushil Mala'' series. Bismil wrote his autobiography while he was kept as [[condemned prisoner]] in Gorakhpur jail.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rajesh Tanti|url=http://archive.org/details/HindiRamprasadBismilKiAtmakatha|title=Hindi Ramprasad Bismil Ki Atmakatha|date=2016-06-24}}</ref>{{Sfn|Arya|1984|p=93}}

The autobiography of Ram Prasad Bismil was published under the cover title of ''Kakori ke shaheed'' by [[Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi]] in 1928 from Pratap Press, [[Kanpur|Cawnpore]]. A rough translation of this book was prepared by the Criminal Investigation Department of United Province in British India. Translated book was circulated as confidential document for official and police use throughout the country.<ref>{{cite book |title= Kakori-ke-shahid : martyrs of the Kakori conspiracy case|first=(pseud) |last=Bhishma |pages=125 |publisher=Government Press, United Provinces, Allahabad |year=1929|oclc = 863324363}}</ref>

He immortalised the poem [[Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna]], [[Man Ki Lahar]] and [[Swadeshi Rang]] as a war cry during the [[British Raj]] period in India.
