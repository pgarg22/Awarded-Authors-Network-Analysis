'''Massimo Bontempelli''' (12 May 1878 &ndash; 21 July 1960) was an Italian poet, playwright, novelist and composer. He was influential in developing and promoting the literary style known as [[magic realism|magical realism]].<ref name=keala>{{cite journal|author=Keala Jewell|title=Magic Realism and Real Politics: Massimo Bontempelli's Literary Compromise|journal=Modernism/Modernity|year=2008|volume=15|issue=4|pages=725–744|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mod/summary/v015/15.4.jewell.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|doi=10.1353/mod.0.0033|s2cid=145586857|quote=That the foremost literary practitioner of magic realism in Italy, Massimo Bontempelli, was also the head of the National Fascist Writers Union for crucial years in the mid- to late-1920s is no accident of history.}}</ref>

==Life==
Bontempelli graduated from the University of Turin in 1903. He taught elementary school for seven years, doing his writing on the side, but abandoned teaching for journalism when he could not secure a position at a secondary school. He served as a war correspondent during World War I. After the war, he settled in Milan and became interested in the literary styles of futurism and magical realism. In 1926, he, along with [[Curzio Malaparte]], founded the journal [["900", Cahiers d'Italie et d'Europe|"900"]]. [[James Joyce]], [[Max Jacob]], and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] sat on the editorial committee and [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Blaise Cendrars]] were among the contributors.<ref name=keala/>

During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Bontempelli was close to the fascism. He served as a secretary of the fascist writers' union and spent time abroad lecturing on Italian culture. However, in 1938 he refused to accept a university post formerly held by a Jewish professor and was kicked out of the Fascist party, drifting towards [[Communism]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kibler |first1=Louis |title=Reviewed Work: Sogni e visioni: Massimo Bontempelli fra surrealismo e futurismo by Elena Urgnani |journal=Annali d'Italianistica |date=1993 |volume=11 |page=326-328}}</ref> After World War II, Bontempelli won a Senate race on the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]] ticket but the results were voided when his fascist ties were discovered.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marrone |first1=Gaetana |title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A-J |date=2007 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=288}}</ref> In 1953, Bontempelli's "L'amante Fedele" won the [[Strega Prize]], Italy's most prestigious literary award.
