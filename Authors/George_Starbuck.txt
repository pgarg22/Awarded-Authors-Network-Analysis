Starbuck had five children: Margaret, Stephen, John, Anthony, and Joshua.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/17/arts/george-starbuck-wry-poet-is-dead-at-65.html|title=George Starbuck, Wry Poet, Is Dead at 65|last=Jr|first=Robert Mcg Thomas|date=1996-08-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  His papers are held at the [[University of Alabama]] library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.ua.edu/content/findingaids/pdf/ms_1337.pdf |title=W |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref>

Starbuck's work is marked by clever rhymes, witty asides, and the fusing of Romantic themes with cynicism about modern life. For example, his book ''Bone Thoughts'' was published with half its pages blank, and he called his style of formalism "SLABS" (Standard Length And Breadth Sonnets). He was not widely appreciated in the mainstream culture during his lifetime, but two new collections of his poems have been published in the last few years, ''Poems Selected from Five Decades'' and ''Visible Ink'', helping win him a wider audience.

Starbuck's best-known poems include "Tuolumne," "On an Urban Battlefield," and "Sonnet With a Different Letter At the End of Every Line."
