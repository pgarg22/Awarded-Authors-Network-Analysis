[[File:Plaque Anne Hébert à Québec.jpg|thumb|Plaque in memory of Anne Hébert in Quebec]]
'''Anne Hébert''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OQ}} (pronounced {{IPA-fr|an eˈbɛʁ|}} in French) (August 1, 1916 – January 22, 2000), was a [[French Canadian]] author and poet. She won Canada's top literary honor, the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]], three times, twice for fiction and once for poetry.

==Early life==
Hébert was born in Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault (name later changed to Sainte-Catherine-de-Portneuf, and in 1984 to [[Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier]]), [[Quebec]]. Her father, [[Maurice Hébert]], was a poet and literary critic.<ref name="dlb" /> She was a cousin and childhood friend of [[Modernist poetry|modernist poet]] [[Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau]].<ref name="bandw" /> She began writing poems and stories at a young age.

==Career==
By the time she was in her early twenties, Hébert's work had been published in a number of periodicals.<ref name="nwp" /> Her first collection of poems, ''Les Songes en Équilibre'', was published in 1942. In it she writes of  herself as existing in solitude in a "dreamlike torpor".<ref name="lemieux" /> It received positive reviews and won her the [[:fr:Prix David|Prix David]].

Saddened by the 1943 death of her thirty-one-year-old cousin, Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau, and by the death of her only sister Marie in 1952, Hébert's poetry became filled with images of death and drowning."<ref name="athabasca" />
No Quebec publisher would publish her 1945 collection of stories, ''Le Torrent''. It was finally published in 1950 at the expense of Roger Lemelin.<ref name="nwp" /> The provocative tales were considered shocking at the time, but later grew in popularity.<ref name="lemieux" />

Hébert was affiliated with Canada's first film bureau. She worked for [[Radio Canada]], Film Board of Canada and National Film Board of Canada during the 1950s.<ref name="bandw" />

Again, she could not find a publisher for her second book of anguish-filled poetry, ''Le Tombeau des rois'' (The Tomb of Kings), and had to publish it at her own expense in 1953.<ref name="nwp" /> In 1954 Hébert used a grant from the [[Royal Society of Canada]] to move to [[Paris]], thinking that the city would be more receptive to her writing.<ref name="nwp" />

''Les Chambres de bois'' (1958), her first novel, was a passionate story which depicted violence and brutality through evocative imagery.<ref name="lemieux" /> Hébert was one of the first Québécois writers to experiment in her work with the expression of alienation and rebellion, rather than realistic narration and discussion."<ref name="athabasca" />

In 1960 during Québec's [[Quiet Revolution]], Hébert published ''Mystère de la parole'', a new collection of poems  about more down-to-earth subjects than her previous work.<ref name="jrank" />

Hébert's 1970 novel ''Kamouraska'' combines two romantic yet suspenseful stories and is set in 19th-century Québec.<ref name="lemieux" />

Hébert returned to Canada in the 1990s. Her last novel ''Un Habit de lumière'' was published in 1998.

Hébert died of [[bone cancer]] on January 22, 2000 in [[Montreal]].<ref name="litweb" />

==Recognition==
Hébert's first book of poetry, ''Les Songes en Équilibre'', won Quebec's [[:fr:Prix David|Prix David]].<ref name="nwp" /> She won the [[:fr:Prix Québec-Paris|Prix France-Canada]] and the [[Ludger-Duvernay Prize]] in 1958 for ''Les chambres de bois''.<ref name="anansi" />

Hébert was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1960.<ref name="lemieux" />

Her ''Poèmes'' (a reprinting of ''Le Tombeau des rois'', coupled with a section of new poems, ''Mystère de la parole'') won the [[Governor General's Award]] for poetry in [[1960 Governor General's Awards|1960]]. She twice won the Governor General's Award for fiction, for her novels ''Les enfants du sabbat'' ([[1975 Governor General's Awards|1975]]) and ''L'enfant chargé des songes'' ([[1992 Governor General's Awards|1992]]).<ref name="athabasca" />

She won the Molson Prize in 1967.<ref name="jrank" />

Hébert won France's Prix de librairies for her 1970 novel ''Kamouraska'' and its [[:fr:Prix Fémina|Prix Fémina]] for her 1982 novel ''Les fous de Bassan''. Both books have also been made into movies, ''Kamouraska'' in 1973 directed by [[Claude Jutra]], and ''Les fous de Bassan'' in 1986 by [[Yves Simoneau]].<ref name="lemieux" /> ''Kamouraska'' also won the Grand Prix of the Académie royale de la langue françaises de Belgique.<ref name="athabasca" />

Hébert's work has been translated into at least seven languages, including English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. ''The First Garden,'' the English translation of ''Le premier jardin'', won the Félix Antoine-Savard Prize for Translation in 1991,<ref name="anansi" />

L'école Anne-Hébert, opened in Vancouver in 1983, is an elementary school that offers instruction from kindergarten through grade 6 in French only.<ref name="ecole" />

In 2013, documentary filmmaker [[Michel Langlois]] released ''Anne des vingt jours'', a biographical documentary about Hébert.<ref name="gazette" />

===Commemorative postage stamp===
On September 8, 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[National Library of Canada]], [[Canada Post]] released a special commemorative series, "The Writers of Canada", with a design by Katalina Kovats, featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps. Three million stamps were issued. The two French-Canadian authors used were Hébert and her cousin, [[Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau]].<ref name="post" />
