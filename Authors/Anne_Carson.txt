==Life and work==

===Education===
In high school, a Latin instructor introduced Carson to the world and language of Ancient Greece and tutored her privately.<ref name="LitEncyc">{{cite web |last1=Rae |first1=Ian |title=Anne Carson |url=https://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=758 |website=The Literary Encyclopedia |access-date=16 September 2020 |date=27 December 2001}}</ref> Enrolling at [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]] at the [[University of Toronto]], she left twice—at the end of her first and second years. Carson, disconcerted by curricular constraints (particularly by a required course on [[John Milton|Milton]]), retired to the world of graphic arts for a short time.<ref name="LitEncyc" /> She did eventually return to the University of Toronto where she completed her B.A. in 1974, her M.A. in 1975, and her Ph.D. in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Val |author-link1=Val Ross |title=Alumni: Classic Carson |journal=University of Toronto Magazine |date=23 March 2001 |url=https://magazine.utoronto.ca/people/alumni-donors/about-anne-carson-poetry/ |access-date=16 September 2020}}</ref> She also spent a year studying Greek metrics and Greek textual criticism at the [[University of St Andrews]].<ref name="Cove Park">{{cite journal |last1=Munoz |first1=Theresa |title=Theresa Munoz and Anne Carson at Cove Park |journal=Scottish Review of Books |date=9 October 2013 |url=https://www.scottishreviewofbooks.org/2013/10/theresa-munoz-and-anne-carson-at-cove-park/ |access-date=16 September 2020}}</ref>

===Writing===
Trained as a classicist, and with an interest in [[comparative literature]], [[anthropology]], history, and the arts, Carson fuses ideas and themes from many fields in her writing. She frequently references, modernises, and translates [[Ancient Greek literature|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin literature]] – writers such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Catullus]], [[Euripides]], [[Homer]], [[Ibycus]], [[Mimnermus]], [[Sappho]], [[Simonides]], [[Sophocles]], [[Stesichorus]], and [[Thucydides]]. She is also influenced by, and references more modern writers and thinkers, such as [[Emily Brontë]], [[Paul Celan]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[John Keats]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Simone Weil]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. Many of her books blend the forms of poetry, essay, prose, criticism, translation, dramatic dialogue, fiction, and non-fiction to varying degrees.

First editions of Carson's sixteen books of writings (as of 2019) have been published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]], and the [[Princeton University Press]] in the US, by [[Brick (magazine)|Brick Books]] and [[McClelland & Stewart]] in Canada, and by [[Bloodaxe Books]], [[Jonathan Cape]], [[Oberon Books]], and Sylph Editions in the UK.

=== Personal life ===
Carson is known to be reticent about her private life, and discourages autobiographical readings of her writings.<ref name="Willard 2011">{{cite book |last1=Willard |first1=Thomas |editor1-last=Canfield Reisman |editor1-first=Rosemary M. |title=Critical Survey of Poetry: British, Irish and Commonwealth Poets |date=2011 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Pasadena, California |isbn=9781587657559 |pages=225–228 |url=https://www.academia.edu/490379 |access-date=26 August 2020 |chapter=Anne Carson}}</ref> Information about her in publications is often limited to the phrase: "Anne Carson was born in Canada and teaches ancient Greek for a living."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Anne |author-mask=1 |title=Short Talks |date=2015 |publisher=Brick Books Classics |location=London, Ontario |isbn=978-1-77131-342-1}}</ref> While not a confessional poet, her work is considered personal.<ref name="Scranton 2014" /> Carson has said that in her work, she uses her life democratically as just one set of facts among others in the world.<ref name="D'Agata 1997">{{cite journal |last1=Carson |first1=Anne |last2=D'Agata |first2=John |author-link2=John D'Agata |title=A ___ with Anne Carson |journal=The Iowa Review |date=Summer 1997 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.17077/0021-065X.4868 |url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4868&context=iowareview |access-date=12 July 2020|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Carson's first marriage, during which she used the surname Giacomelli, lasted eight years and ended in 1980.<ref name="LitEncyc" /> This union, and its aftermath, has been claimed as a source for "Kinds of Water" (collected in ''Plainwater''), and for ''[[The Beauty of the Husband: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos|The Beauty of the Husband]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Merkin |first1=Daphne |author-link1=Daphne Merkin |title=Last Tango |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/books/last-tango.html |access-date=8 October 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=30 September 2001 |quote=It is always difficult, of course, to gauge how much is autobiographical in a writer's material, and Carson is trickier than most in this regard, but 'Husband' strikes me as being the least cloaked about its origins in lived life.}}</ref> Carson has confirmed that her first husband took her notebooks when they divorced (as happens to the protagonist in ''The Beauty of the Husband''), though later returned them.<ref name="Wachtel 2012">{{cite journal |last1=Carson |first1=Anne |last2=Wachtel |first2=Eleanor |title=An Interview with Anne Carson |journal=Brick: A Literary Journal |date=Summer 2012 |issue=89 |pages=29–47 |url=https://brickmag.com/an-interview-with-anne-carson/ |access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref>

Carson's father Robert had [[Alzheimer's disease]]. "[[The Glass Essay]]" (collected in ''Glass, Irony, and God''), "Very Narrow" (collected in ''Plainwater''), and "Father's Old Blue Cardigan" (collected in ''[[Men in the Off Hours]]'') all deal with his mental and physical decline.

Carson's mother Margaret (1913–1997) died during the writing of ''Men in the Off Hours''. Carson closed the collection with the prose piece "Appendix to Ordinary Time", using crossed-out phrases from the diaries and manuscripts of [[Virginia Woolf]] to craft an epitaph for her.<ref name="LitEncyc" /> ''[[Red Doc|Red Doc>]]'' has been read as a second elegy for the death of her mother.<ref name="Scranton 2014" /> Carson has described her mother as the love of her life.<ref name="Wachtel 2012" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Anne |title=Decreation: Poetry, Essays, Opera |date=2006 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-7890-5 |page=5 |chapter=Lines}}</ref>

Carson's brother Michael was arrested for drug dealing in 1978. Jumping bail, he fled Canada and she never saw him again.<ref name="Wachtel 2012" /> Carson dealt with the disappearance of her brother from her life in "Water Margins: An Essay on Swimming by My Brother" (collected in ''Plainwater''), which is written as a kind of memoir.<ref name="Willard 2011" /> In 2000, he called her and they arranged to meet in Copenhagen where he lived, but he died before they could reconnect.<ref name="Sehgal 2011">{{cite news |last1=Carson |first1=Anne |last2=Sehgal |first2=Parul |author-link2=Parul Sehgal |title=Evoking the starry lad her brother was |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/evoking-the-starry-lad-her-brother-was-1.577255 |access-date=10 October 2020 |work=The Irish Times |date=19 March 2011}}</ref> ''Nox'', an epitaph Carson created for her brother in 2000 and published in 2010, has been described as her most explicitly personal work.<ref name="Scranton 2014" />
