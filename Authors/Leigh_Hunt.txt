'''James Henry Leigh Hunt''' (19 October 1784{{snd}}28 August 1859), best known as '''Leigh Hunt''', was an English [[critic]], [[essay]]ist and [[poet]].

Hunt co-founded ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', a leading intellectual journal expounding radical principles. He was the centre of the [[Hampstead]]-based group that included [[William Hazlitt]] and [[Charles Lamb]], known as the "Hunt circle". Hunt also introduced [[John Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] to the public.

Hunt's presence at Shelley's funeral on the beach near [[Viareggio]] was immortalised in the painting by [[Louis Édouard Fournier]], although in reality Hunt did not stand by the pyre, as portrayed. Hunt inspired aspects of the Harold Skimpole character in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Bleak House]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dickens |first1=Charles |title=Mr. Dickens on Leigh Hunt. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/09/archives/mr-dickens-on-leigh-hunt.html |access-date=9 April 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=9 January 1860 |ref=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/09/archives/mr-dickens-on-leigh-hunt.html}}</ref>

==Early life==
James Henry Leigh Hunt was born 19 October 1784, at [[Southgate, London]], where his parents had settled after leaving the United States. His father, Isaac, a lawyer from [[Philadelphia]], and his mother, Mary Shewell, a merchant's daughter and a devout [[Quaker]], had been forced to come to Britain because of their [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] sympathies during the [[American War of Independence]].

Once in England, Isaac Hunt became a popular preacher but was unsuccessful in obtaining a permanent living. He was then employed by [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]], as tutor to his nephew, James Henry Leigh<ref name=DNB00>{{cite DNB

}}</ref> for whom Isaac named his son.

==Education==
Leigh Hunt was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] in London from 1791 to 1799, a period that Hunt described in his [[autobiography]].  [[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]] was a school friend. One of the boarding houses at Christ's Hospital is named after Hunt.

As a boy, Hunt was an admirer of [[Thomas Gray]] and [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]], writing many verses in imitation of them. A speech impediment, later cured, prevented Hunt from going to university. "For some time after I left school," he says, "I did nothing but visit my school-fellows, haunt the book-stalls and write verses."

Hunt's first poems were published in 1801 under the title of [[Juvenilia (book)|''Juvenilia'']], introducing him into British literary and theatrical society. He began to write for the newspapers and published in 1807 a volume of [[theatre criticism]], and a series of ''Classic Tales'' with critical essays on the authors.

Hunt's early essays were published by [[Edward Quin]], editor and owner of ''The Traveller''.<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Quin, Edward|last= Donoghue|first=David James|author-link=David James O'Donoghue|volume=47}}</ref>

==Family==
In 1809, Leigh Hunt married Marianne Kent, whose parents were Thomas and Ann. Over the next 20 years, the couple had ten children: [[Thornton Leigh Hunt|Thornton Leigh]] (1810–73), John Horatio Leigh (1812–46), Mary Florimel Leigh (1813–49), Swinburne Percy Leigh (1816–27), Percy Bysshe Shelley Leigh (1817–99), Henry Sylvan Leigh (1819–76), Vincent Leigh (1823–52), Julia Trelawney Leigh (1826–72), Jacyntha Leigh (1828–1914), and Arabella Leigh (1829–30).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epsomandewellhistoryexplorer.org.uk/HuntLeigh.html|title=LEIGH HUNT|website=www.epsomandewellhistoryexplorer.org.uk|access-date=27 January 2018}}</ref>

Marianne Hunt, in poor health for most of her life, died on 26 January 1857, at the age of 69. Leigh Hunt made little mention of his family in his autobiography. Marianne's sister, [[Elizabeth Kent (writer)|Elizabeth Kent]] (Hunt's sister-in-law), became his [[amanuensis]].{{sfn|Hay|2008}}

==Newspapers==
===''The Examiner''===
In 1808, Hunt left the [[War Office]], where he had been working as a clerk, to become editor of ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', a newspaper founded by his brother, [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]]. His brother [[Robert Hunt (critic)|Robert Hunt]] contributed to its columns.

Robert Hunt's criticism earned the enmity of [[William Blake]], who described the office of ''The Examiner'' as containing a "nest of villains".<ref name="Symons">{{cite book| last=Symons| first=Arthur| author-link=Arthur Symons| title=William Blake| url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/William_Blake_%28Symons%29/William_Blake#150| year=1907| pages=150| publisher=Dutton| location=New York}}</ref> Blake's response also included Leigh Hunt, who had published several vitriolic reviews in 1808 and 1809 and had added Blake's name to a list of so-called "quacks".<ref name="BlakeEssick1998">{{cite book| last1=Blake| first1=William| last2=Essick| first2=Robert N.| last3=Viscomi| first3=Joseph| title=Milton a poem, and the final illuminated works: The ghost of Abel, On Homers poetry, <nowiki>[</nowiki>and<nowiki>]</nowiki> On Virgil, Laocoön| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEflqI3X0IEC&pg=PA151| access-date=2 December 2010| date=1998-09-04| publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-691-00148-7| page=151}}</ref>

''The Examiner'' soon acquired a reputation for unusual political independence; it would attack any worthy target "from a principle of taste," as [[John Keats]] expressed it. In 1813 (or 1812), ''The Examiner'' attacked [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent George]], apparently for describing his physique as "corpulent"; the British government tried the three Hunt brothers and sentenced them to two years in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas R.|title=corpulent (adj.)|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/corpulent#etymonline_v_19101|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20201216042922/https://www.etymonline.com/word/corpulent%23etymonline_v_19101#etymonline_v_19101|archive-date=16 December 2020|access-date=December 15, 2020|website=[[Online Etymological Dictionary]]}}</ref> Leigh Hunt served his term at the [[Horsemonger Lane Gaol|Surrey County Gaol]].<ref name=Roe>Roe, Nicholas. "'The Hunt Era': Jeffrey N. Cox, Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School: Keats, Shelley, Hunt and their Circle and The Examiner, 1818–1822, introduced by Yasuo Deguchi." [http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1999/v/n14/005854ar.html Romanticism on the Net] 14 (May 1999). Accessed 19 December 2006.</ref>

Leigh Hunt's visitors at Surrey County Gaol included [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]],<ref>See Byron's "To Thomas Moore: Written The Evening Before His Visit To Mr. Leigh Hunt in Horsemonger Lane Gaol, 19 May 1813".</ref> [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Henry Brougham]], and [[Charles Lamb]]. The stoicism with which Leigh Hunt bore his imprisonment attracted general attention and sympathy. His imprisonment allowed him many luxuries and access to friends and family, and Lamb described his decorations of the cell as something not found outside a fairy tale. When [[Jeremy Bentham]] called on him, he found Hunt playing [[battledore]].<ref name=DNB00 />

From 1814 to 1817, Leigh Hunt and Hazlitt wrote a series of essays in ''The Examiner'' that they titled  "The Round Table".  These essays were published in two volumes in 1817 in ''[[The Round Table (1817 book)|The Round Table]]''. Twelve of the 52 essays were written by Hunt, the rest by Hazlitt.<ref>Hazlitt, William. ''The Complete Works of William Hazlitt'' (ed. P.P. Howe), vol. 4. London: Dent & Sons, 1910, "Bibliographical Note" and "Advertisement to the Edition of 1817" (unpaginated).</ref>

===''The Reflector''===
From 1810 to 1811, Leigh Hunt edited a quarterly magazine, ''The Reflector'', for his brother John. He wrote "[[The Feast of the Poets]]" for publication. His work was a [[satire]] that offended many contemporary poets, particularly [[William Gifford]].

===''The Indicator''===
From 1819 to 1821, Hunt edited ''The Indicator'', a weekly literary periodical that was published by Joseph Appleyard. Hunt probably wrote much of the content, which included reviews, essays, stories and poems.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=John O.|title=The Romantic Reviewers, 1802–1824|year=1969|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=263}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|editor=Hunt, Leigh|title=The Indicator, 1819–1821|issue= 1–76|location=London|publisher=Joseph Appleyard|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000058991}}</ref>

===''The Companion''===
From January to July 1828, Hunt edited ''The Companion'', a weekly literary periodical that was published by Hunt and Clarke. The journal dealt with books, theatrical productions and miscellaneous topics.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Companion|year=1828|issue= 1–29|location=London|publisher=Hunt and Clarke|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000526498}}</ref>

==Poetry==
In 1816, Hunt published the poem ''Story of Rimini''. The work was based on the tragic episode of [[Francesca da Rimini]], as told in [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']].<ref>"The following story is founded on a passage in Dante, the substance of which is contained in the concluding paragraph of the third canto. For the rest of the incidents, generally speaking, the praise or blame remains with myself." (Hunt, "Preface").</ref>

Hunt's preference was decidedly for [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s verse style, as adapted to [[Modern English]] by [[John Dryden]]. That was in contrast to the epigrammatic [[couplet]] of [[Alexander Pope]]. The ''Story of Rimini'' is an optimistic narrative that runs contrary to the tragic nature of its subject. Hunt's flippancy and familiarity, often degenerating into the ludicrous, subsequently made him a target for ridicule and parody.

In 1818, Hunt published a collection of poems entitled ''Foliage'', followed in 1819 by ''Hero and Leander'', and ''Bacchus and Ariadne''. In the same year, he reprinted ''The Story of Rimini'' and ''The Descent of Liberty'' with the title of ''Poetical Works''. Hunt also started the ''Indicator''.

Both Keats and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] belonged to a literary group that gathered around Hunt at Hampstead. The Hunt Circle also included Hazlitt, Lamb, [[Bryan Procter]], [[Benjamin Haydon]], [[Charles Cowden Clarke]], [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|C. W. Dilke]], [[Walter Coulson]] and [[John Hamilton Reynolds]]. The group was known pejoratively as the Cockney School.<ref name=Roe/>

Some of Hunt's most popular poems are "[[Jenny kiss'd Me]]", "Abou Ben Adhem" (1834) and "A Night-Rain in Summer".

==Friendship with Keats and Shelley==
Hunt maintained close friendships with both Keats and Shelley. Financial help from Shelley saved Hunt from ruin. In return, Hunt provided Shelley with support during his family problems and defended him in ''The Examiner''. Hunt introduced Keats to Shelley and wrote a very generous appreciation of him in ''The Indicator''. Keats seemingly, however, later felt that Hunt's example as a poet had been in some respects detrimental to him.

After Shelley's departure for [[Italy]] in 1818, Hunt experienced more financial difficulties. In addition, both his health and that of his wife Marianne failed.  As a result, Hunt was forced to discontinue ''The Indicator'' (1819–1821) and stated that he had "almost died over the last numbers".

==Trip to Italy==
Shelley suggested that Hunt could join him and Byron in Italy to establish a quarterly magazine. The advantage was that they would be able to publish [[liberalism|liberal]] opinions without repression from the British government.  Byron's motive for this proposal was allegedly to acquire more influence over ''The Examiner'' with Hunt out of England. However, Byron soon discovered that Hunt was no longer interested in ''The Examiner''.

Leigh Hunt left England for Italy in November 1821, but storm, sickness, and misadventure delayed his arrival until 1 July 1822. [[Thomas Love Peacock]] compared their voyage to that of the character [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].

[[File:Louis Edouard Fournier - The Funeral of Shelley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''The Funeral of Shelley'' by [[Louis Édouard Fournier]] (1889); pictured in the centre are, from left, [[Edward John Trelawny|Trelawny]], Hunt, and Byron. (As a matter of fact, Hunt was not standing before the fire but remained in his coach for the entire time.)]]

One week after Hunt arrived in Italy, Shelley died. Hunt was now virtually dependent upon Byron, who was not interested in supporting him and his family. Byron's friends also scorned Hunt. The ''Liberal'' lived through four quarterly numbers, containing contributions no less memorable than Byron's "[[The Vision of Judgment|Vision of Judgment]]" and Shelley's translations from ''[[Faust]]''.

In 1823, Byron left Italy for Greece, abandoning the quarterly. Hunt, remaining in [[Genoa]], enjoyed the Italian climate and culture and stayed in Italy until 1825. Meanwhile, he created  ''Ultra-Crepidarius: a Satire on William Gifford'' (1823), and his translation (1825) of [[Francesco Redi]]'s ''Bacco in Toscana''.

==Return to England==
In 1825, a lawsuit with one of his brothers made Hunt return to England.  In 1828, Hunt published ''Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries''. The work was designed to counter what Hunt perceived as an inaccurate public image of Byron. The public was shocked that Hunt, who had been obliged to Byron for so much, would "bite the hand that fed him". Hunt especially writhed under the withering satire of Moore.

During his later years, Hunt continued to suffer from poverty and sickness. He worked unremittingly, but one effort failed after another. Two journalistic ventures, the ''Tatler'' (1830–1832), a daily devoted to literary and dramatic criticism, and ''London Journal'' (1834–1835) failed even though the latter contained some of his best writing. Hunt's editorship (1837–1838) of the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'' was also unsuccessful.

In 1832, Hunt published by subscription a collected edition of his poems. The subscribers included many of his opponents. Also in 1832, Hunt printed for private circulation ''Christianism'', the work afterward published (1853) as ''The Religion of the Heart''. A copy sent to [[Thomas Carlyle]] secured his friendship, and Hunt went to live next door to him in [[Cheyne Row]] in 1833.

Hunt's romance, ''Sir Ralph Esher'', about [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s was successful. ''Captain Sword and Captain Pen'', published in 1835, a spirited contrast between the victories of peace and the victories of war, deserves to be ranked among his best poems.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captain Sword and Captain Pen. A poem by Leigh Hunt; With Some Remarks on War and Military Statesmen|publisher=Charles Knight, Ludgate Street  |place=London|year= 1835  |url=https://archive.org/stream/captainsword00huntrich#page/n7/mode/2up|access-date= 8 December 2016|via= Internet Archive}}</ref>

In 1840, Hunt's play ''Legend of Florence'' had a successful engagement at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], which helped him financially. ''Lover's Amazements'', a comedy, was acted several years afterwards and was printed in ''Journal'' (1850–1851); other plays remained in manuscript.

Also in 1840, Hunt wrote introductory notices to the work of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] and to [[Edward Moxon]]'s edition of the works of [[William Wycherley]], [[William Congreve]], [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[George Farquhar]], a work that furnished the occasion of [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s essay on the Dramatists of the Restoration. A narrative poem, ''The Palfrey'', was published in 1842.

During the 1830s, Hunt also wrote for the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''

==Final years==
In 1844 [[Mary Shelley]] and her son, on succeeding to the family estates, settled an annuity of £120 upon Hunt (Rossetti 1890). In 1847 [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] set up a pension of £200 for Hunt.

With his finances in better shape, Hunt published the companion books ''Imagination and Fancy'' (1844) and ''Wit and Humour'' (1846).  These were two volumes of selections from English poets, which displayed his refined, discriminating critical tastes. Hunt also published a book on the pastoral poetry of [[Sicily]], ''A Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla'' (1848). ''The Town'' (2 vols., 1848) and ''Men, Women and Books'' (2 vols., 1847) are partly made up from former material. ''The Old Court Suburb'' (2 vols., 1855; ed. A Dobson, 2002) is a sketch of [[Kensington]], where Hunt long resided.

In 1850 Hunt published his ''Autobiography'' (3 vols.).  It has been described as a naive and affected, but accurate, piece of self-portraiture. Hunt published ''A Book for a Corner'' (2 vols.) in 1849 and ''Table Talk'' appeared in 1851. In 1855, he published his narrative poems, both original and translated, under the title ''Stories in Verse''.

Hunt died in [[Putney]] in London on 28 August 1859.  He was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. In September 1966, Christ's Hospital named one of its houses in the memory of Hunt. Today, a residential street in his birthplace of Southgate is named Leigh Hunt Drive in his honour.

In a letter of 25 September 1853, Dickens stated that Hunt had inspired the character of Harold Skimpole in ''Bleak House''; "I suppose he is the most exact portrait that was ever painted in words! ... It is an absolute reproduction of a real man". A contemporary critic commented, "I recognized Skimpole instantaneously; ... and so did every person whom I talked with about it who had ever had Leigh Hunt's acquaintance."<ref>Page, Norman, editor, ''Bleak House'', Penguin Books, 1971, p. 955 (note 2 to Chapter 6).</ref> [[G. K. Chesterton]] suggested that Dickens "May never once have had the unfriendly thought, 'Suppose Hunt behaved like a rascal!'; he may have only had the fanciful thought, 'Suppose a rascal behaved like Hunt!'" (Chesterton 1906).
