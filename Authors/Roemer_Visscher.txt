'''Roemer Pieterszoon Visscher''' (1547 â€“ 19 February 1620) was a successful [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchant, the first Dutch underwriter and writer of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].

==Life==
Visscher was born in and lived in [[Amsterdam]] and was an important and central figure of the cultural scene there and member of the ''[[rederijkers]]kamer'' ''De [[Egelantier|Eglantier]]'' with as [[slogan]] ''"In liefde bloeiende"'' ("Blossoming in love"). Other members of this scene were the Dutch writers [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P.C. Hooft]], [[Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero|Bredero]] and [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]]. Vondel called Visschers house ''"het saligh Roemers huys"'' ("delightful house of Roemer"), because artists of all kinds visited his house on the [[Gelderse Kade]] in Amsterdam, varying from painters to poets. Roemer was the father of three daughters [[Maria Tesselschade Visscher]], Gertruid, and [[Anna Visscher]].<ref>Geoffrey Cotterell, "Amsterdam: The Life of a City".

==Works==
The [[humanism|humanistic]] and [[moralism|moralistic]] content of his works belongs to the period of the [[Renaissance]], although the form was more conservative and characteristic to the ''[[rederijkers]]''. Visscher was a specialist in the [[epigram]], but he also wrote [[emblemata]]. The emblemata is a genre in which pictures are accompanied by one or two rhyming sentences. An example of the emblemata is Visschers Sinnepoppen. One emblema is called ''"Elck wat wils"'' which is still a common expression in Dutch, meaning "To each his own".

Among his works are:
*''T'loff vande mutse, ende van een blaewe scheen'' (1612)
*''Brabbeling'' (1614)
*''Sinnepoppen'' (1614)
