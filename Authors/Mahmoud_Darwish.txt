'''Mahmoud Darwish''' ({{lang-ar|محمود درويش|Maḥmūd Darwīsh}}, 13 March 1941 – 9 August 2008) was a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] poet and author who was regarded as the Palestinian national poet.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7551918.stm "Palestinian 'national poet' dies"], BBC News, 9 August 2008.</ref> He won numerous awards for his works.

A year later, Darwish's family returned to the [[Akko|Acre]] area, which was part of [[Israel]], and settled in [[Deir al-Asad]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990823093225/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/2549/darwish.html GeoCities] Mahmoud Darwish Biography. Sameh Al-Natour.</ref> Darwish attended high school in [[Kfar Yasif|Kafr Yasif]], two kilometers north of [[Judeide-Makr|Jadeidi]]. He eventually moved to [[Haifa]].

He published his first book of poetry, ''Asafir bila ajniha,'' or "Wingless Birds," at the age of 19. He initially published his poems in ''[[Al Jadid (magazine)|Al Jadid]],'' the literary periodical of the [[Israeli Communist Party]], eventually becoming its editor. Later, he was assistant editor of ''[[Al Fajr]],'' a literary periodical published by the Israeli Workers Party (Mapam).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tnuathaavoda.info/zope/home/5/press/1123065116/|title=Web Site of the Israeli Labor Party |publisher=Israeli Labor Party|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1995, he returned to attend the funeral of his colleague, [[Emile Habibi]], receiving a permit to remain in Haifa for four days.<ref name="NYT1">Joel Greenberg, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1DA1539F933A25756C0A960958260&scp=3&sq=Mahmoud%20Darwish&st=cse "Ramallah Journal; Suitcase No Longer His Homeland, a Poet Returns"], ''New York Times'', 10 May 1996.</ref> That year Darwish was allowed to settle in [[Ramallah]],<ref name="NYT"/> but he said he felt he was living in exile there, and did not consider the West Bank his "private homeland."<ref name="haaretz.com"/>

Darwish was twice married and divorced. His first wife was the writer [[Rana Kabbani]]. After they divorced, in the mid-1980s, he married an Egyptian translator, Hayat Heeni. He had no children.<ref name="Gua"/> The "Rita" of Darwish's poems was a Jewish woman whom he loved when he was living in Haifa. The relationship was the subject of the film ''[[Write Down, I Am an Arab]]'' by filmmaker [[Ibtisam Mara'ana]] Menuhin, an Arab Muslim woman married to a Jewish man. (While such relationships are rare today, they were more common during the Palestinian Mandate period, and among communists, who were united by class struggle.<ref>Alona Ferber, [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/shavuot/.premium-1.596773# "When the Palestinian national poet fell in love with a Jew: The love letters between Mahmoud Darwish and 'Rita' intrigued Israeli-Arab filmmaker [[Ibtisam Mara'ana]] Menuhin for her own, very personal reasons"], ''Haaretz'', 4 June 2014</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Robyn Creswell|date=February 2009|title=Unbeliever in the impossible : the poetry of Mahmoud Darwish|journal=[[Harper's]]|volume=318|issue=1905 |pages=69–74}}</ref><ref>Hala Khamis Nassar and Najat Rahman (eds), ''Mahmoud Darwish, Exile's Poet: Critical Essays''.

Darwish had a history of heart disease, suffering a heart attack in 1984. He had two heart operations, in 1984 and 1998.<ref name="Gua"/>

His final visit to Israel was on 15 July 2007, to attend a poetry recital at Mt. Carmel Auditorium in Haifa.<ref>Yoav Stern, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/877733.html "Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish to attend event in Haifa"], ''Ha'aretz''.</ref> There he criticized the factional violence between [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] as a "suicide attempt in the streets."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6900624.stm "Palestinian poet derides factions"], ''BBC News'', 16 July 2007.</ref>

===Literary career===
Over his lifetime, Darwish published more than 30 volumes of poetry and eight books of prose. At one time or another, he was editor of the periodicals ''Al-Jadid,'' ''Al-Fajr,'' ''Shu'un Filistiniyya,'' and ''Al-Karmel''.

By the age of seventeen, Darwish was writing poetry about the suffering of the refugees in the [[Nakba]] and the inevitability of their return, and had begun reciting his poems at poetry festivals.<ref>Maha Nassar (2017), ''Brothers Apart: Palestinian Citizens of Israel and the Arab World'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 93</ref> Seven years later, on 1 May 1965, when the young Darwish read his poem "Bitaqat huwiyya" ["Identity Card"] to a crowd in a Nazareth movie house, there was a tumultuous reaction. Within days the poem had spread throughout the country and the Arab world.<ref>Snir, Reuven.

Darwish's work has won numerous awards and been published in 20 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fencemag.com/v5n1/text/darwish.html|title=Fencemag.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021001094516/http%3A//www.fencemag.com/v5n1/text/darwish.html|archive-date=1 October 2002|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A central theme in Darwish's poetry is the concept of ''watan'' or [[homeland]].

===Writing style===
Darwish's early writings are in the classical Arabic style. He wrote monorhymed poems adhering to the metrics of traditional [[Arabic poetry]]. In the 1970s he began to stray from these precepts and adopted a "free-verse" technique that did not abide strictly by classical poetic norms. The quasi-Romantic diction of his early works gave way to a more personal, flexible language, and the slogans and declarative language that characterized his early poetry were replaced by indirect and ostensibly apolitical statements, although politics was never far away.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011855.html, Passing in passing words]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Haaretz''.</ref>

===Literary influences===
Darwish was impressed by the Iraqi poets [[Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati]] and [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]].<ref name="Gua2">Peter Clark, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/11/poetry.israelandthepalestinians "Mahmoud Darwish"], ''The Guardian''. 11 August 2008.</ref> He cited [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] as literary influences.<ref name="Gua"/> Darwish admired the Hebrew poet [[Yehuda Amichai]], but described his poetry as a "challenge to me, because we write about the same place. He wants to use the landscape and history for his own benefit, based on my destroyed identity. So we have a competition: who is the owner of the language of this land? Who loves it more? Who writes it better?"<ref name="Gua"/>

===Political views towards Israel===
Darwish is widely perceived as a Palestinian symbol<ref name="haaretz.com"/> and a spokesman for Arab opposition to Israel. He rejected accusations of antisemitism: "The accusation is that I hate Jews. It's not comfortable that they show me as a devil and an enemy of Israel. I am not a lover of Israel, of course. I have no reason to be. But I don't hate Jews."<ref>Susan Sachs, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E6D71238F934A35750C0A9669C8B63&scp=4&sq=Mahmoud%20Darwish&st=cse "Ramallah Journal; Poetry of Arab Pain: Are Israeli Students Ready?"] ''New York Times'', 7 March 2000.</ref> Darwish wrote in Arabic, and also spoke English, French, and [[Hebrew]].

According to the Israeli author [[Haim Gouri]], who knew him personally, Darwish's Hebrew was excellent.<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011812.html Hasen], ''Haaretz''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818143255/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011812.html |date=18 August 2008 }}</ref> Four volumes of his poetry were translated into Hebrew by Muhammad Hamza Ghaneim: ''Bed of a Stranger'' (2000), ''Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone?'' (2000), ''State of Siege'' (2003), and ''Mural'' (2006).<ref name="haaretz.com"/> [[Salman Masalha]], a bilingual Arabic-Hebrew writer, translated his book ''[[Memory for Forgetfulness]]'' into Hebrew.<ref name="haaretz.com"/>

In March 2000, [[Yossi Sarid]], the Israeli education minister, proposed that two of Darwish's poems be included in the Israeli high school curriculum. Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] rejected the proposal on the grounds that Israel was "not ready."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/668702.stm "Poetry sends Israel into political storm"], ''BBC News'', 7 March 2000. Retrieved 6 October 2014.</ref> It has been suggested that the incident had more to do with internal Israeli politics in trying to damage Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s government than with poetry.<ref>[[Susan Sontag]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E0D7133BF937A25750C0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&&scp=10&sq=Mahmoud%20Darwish&st=cse "Barak Survives 2 No-Confidence Motions"], ''New York Times'', 14 March 2000.</ref> With the death of Darwish, the debate about including his poetry in the Israeli school curriculum was re-opened in 2008.<ref>Ehud Zion Waldoks, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1218104259194&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Should Darwish's poetry be taught in schools?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204003602/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1218104259194&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=4 February 2012 }} ''Jerusalem Post'',. 10 August 2008.</ref>

"Although it is now technically possible for Jewish students to study Darwish, his writing is still banned from Arab schools. The curriculum used in Arab education is one agreed in 1981 by a committee whose sole Jewish member vetoed any works he thought might 'create an ill spirit'."<ref>Susan Nathan (2005), ''The Other Side of Israel: Crossing The Jewish-Arab Divide''.</ref>

Darwish described Hebrew as a "language of love."<ref name="theamericanscholar" /> He considered himself to be part of the Jewish civilization that existed in Palestine and hoped for a reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Jews. When this happens, "the Jew will not be ashamed to find an Arab element in himself, and the Arab will not be ashamed to declare that he incorporates Jewish elements."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Behar|first=Almog|title=Mahmoud Darwish: Poetry's State of Siege|journal=[[Journal of Levantine Studies]]|year=2011|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Mahmoud+Darwish_h_hd_8_4.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107131508/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Mahmoud+Darwish_h_hd_8_4.aspx|archive-date=7 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Political activism==
[[File:Arafat Darwish Habash.jpg|thumb|[[Yasser Arafat]], Mahmoud Darwish & [[George Habash]] (pictured in 1980)]]

Darwish was a member of [[Maki (current political party)|Rakah]], the [[Communist Party of Israel|Israeli communist party]], before joining the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beirut.<ref name="Ha1"/> In 1970 he left for Moscow. Later, he moved to [[Cairo]] in 1971 where he worked for [[al-Ahram]] daily newspaper. In [[Beirut]], in 1973, he edited the monthly ''Shu'un Filistiniyya'' (''Palestinian Affairs'') and worked as a director in the Palestinian Research Center of the PLO and joined the organisation. In the wake of the Lebanon War, Darwish wrote the political poems ''Qasidat Beirut'' (1982) and ''Madih al-zill al'ali'' (1983). Darwish was elected to the [[PLO Executive Committee]] in 1987. In 1988 he wrote a manifesto intended as the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence|Palestinian people's declaration of independence]]. In 1993, after the [[Oslo accords]], Darwish resigned from the [[PLO Executive Committee]].<ref>Youseff M. Ibrahim, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D7103AF936A1575BC0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 "Palestinian Critics Accuse Arafat Of Secret Concessions to Israelis"], ''New York Times'', 25 August 1993, p. 2.</ref>

===Views on the peace process===
Darwish consistently demanded a "tough and fair" stand in negotiations with Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/darwish.htm |title=Mahmoud Darwish |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529235144/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/darwish.htm |archive-date=29 May 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Despite his criticism of both Israel and the Palestinian leadership, Darwish believed that peace was attainable. "I do not despair," he told the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]''. "I am patient and am waiting for a profound revolution in the consciousness of the Israelis. The Arabs are ready to accept a strong Israel with nuclear arms – all it has to do is open the gates of its fortress and make peace."<ref name="ST1"/>

===1988 poem controversy===
In 1988, one of his poems, "Passers Between the Passing Words," was cited in the [[Knesset]] by [[Yitzhak Shamir]].<ref name="Gua"/> Darwish was accused of demanding that the [[Jew]]s leave [[Israel]], although he claimed he meant the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]:<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD9113CF936A35757C0A96E948260&scp=7&sq=Mahmoud%20Darwish&st=cse "Palestinian's Poem Unnerves Israelis"], ''New York Times'' 5 April 1988.</ref> "So leave our land/Our shore, our sea/Our wheat, our salt, our wound." Adel Usta, a specialist on Darwish's poetry, said the poem was misunderstood and mistranslated.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2008/08/09/darwish-poet-obit.html "Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish dies"]. ''CBC''. 9 August 2008.</ref> Poet and translator [[Ammiel Alcalay]] wrote that "the hysterical overreaction to the poem simply serves as a remarkably accurate litmus test of the Israeli psyche ...

===Views on Hamas===
In 2005, outdoor music and dance performances in [[Qalqiliya]] were suddenly banned by the [[Hamas]]-led municipality, with authorities saying that such events were forbidden by Islam. The municipality also prohibited the playing of music in the Qualqiliya zoo.<ref name="freemuse"/><ref name="barel">[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/afghanistan-in-palestine-1.165006 Zvi Bar'el, "Afghanistan in Palestine"], ''Haaretz'', 26 July 2005</ref> In response, Darwish warned that "There are [[Taliban]]-type elements in our society, and this is a very dangerous sign."<ref name="freemuse">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw10095.asp|title=Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music|work=The World Forum on Music and Censorship|date=17 August 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807211707/http://www.freemuse.org/sw10095.asp|archive-date=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="barel"/><ref name="darwish">"Palestinians Debate Whether Future State Will be Theocracy or Democracy," ''Associated Press'', 13 July 2005.</ref><ref name="newhumanist">[http://newhumanist.org.uk/937/gaza-taliban "Gaza Taliban?"], ''The New Humanist'', '''121''' (1), January/February 2006.</ref>

In July 2007, Darwish returned to Ramallah and visited [[Haifa]] for a festive event held in his honor; it was sponsored by ''Masharaf'' magazine and the Israeli [[Hadash]] party.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> To a crowd of some 2,000 people who turned out for the event, he expressed his criticism of the [[Hamas]] takeover of the Gaza Strip: "We woke up from a coma to see a monocolored flag (of Hamas) do away with the four-color flag (of Palestine)."<ref name="AFP">[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5igYFPqJ-3jDYRqxlRY1rIVvtHvvg "Famed Palestinian poet Mahmud Darwish dies: hospital"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813080018/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5igYFPqJ-3jDYRqxlRY1rIVvtHvvg |date=13 August 2008 }}. ''AFP''. 9 August 2008.</ref>

===2016 poem controversy===
In July 2016 a controversy erupted over the broadcasting of Darwish's poem "Bitaqat hawiyya" ("Identity Card")<ref>{{cite news|title=The Mahmoud Darwish Poem That Enraged Lieberman and Regev - Poem of the Week - Haaretz|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/poem-of-the-week/1.732421|work=www.haaretz.com}}</ref> on Israeli radio station [[Army Radio|Galei Tzahal]]. Written in 1964, it includes the lines:

<blockquote>
Write down: <br />
I am an Arab <br />
Robbed of my ancestors’ vineyards <br />
And of the land cultivated <br />
By me and all my children. <br />
Nothing is left for us and my grandchildren <br /> 
Except these rocks… <br />
Will your government take them too, as reported? <br />
Therefore, <br />
Write at the top of page one: <br />
I do not hate people, <br />
I do not assault anyone, <br />
But…if I get hungry, <br />
I eat the flesh of my usurper. <br />
Beware…beware…of my hunger, <br />
And of my anger. 
</blockquote>

This enraged Israel defence minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]], who compared the poem to Hitler's ''Mein Kampf.''<ref>{{cite news|title=Israel's defense minister compares Palestinian's poetry to Hitler's 'Mein Kampf'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/22/israels-defense-minister-compares-palestinians-poetry-to-hitlers-mein-kampf/|work=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Beaumont|first1=Peter|title=Palestinian poet at heart of row on Israeli army radio broadcast|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/israel-palestine-poetry-mahmoud-darwish|work=The Guardian|date=23 July 2016}}</ref>

They have become anthems for at least two generations of Arabs. In the 1980s, [[Sabreen]], a Palestinian music group in Israel, recorded an album including versions of Darwish's poems "On Man" and "On Wishes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabreen.org/smoke_of_the_volcanoes.html|title=Smoke of the volcanoes|publisher=Sabreen|access-date=27 March 2011|archive-date=3 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203162735/http://www.sabreen.org/smoke_of_the_volcanoes.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The composer Marcel Khalife was accused of blasphemy and insulting religious values, because of his song entitled "I am Yusuf, oh my father," which he based on Darwish's lyrics, and which cited a verse from the [[Qur'an]].<ref>Mahmoud Darwish. [http://www.marcelkhalife.com/httpdocs/htmls/darwish1.html "In Defence of Freedom and Creativity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211095029/http://www.marcelkhalife.com/httpdocs/htmls/darwish1.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, Marcel Khalife's website.</ref> In this poem, Darwish shared the pain of ''Yusuf'' ([[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]), who was rejected by his brothers and fear him, because he is too handsome and kind. "Oh my father, I am Yusuf / Oh father, my brothers neither love me nor want me in their midst." Darwish presents the story of Joseph as an allegory for the rejection of the Palestinians by the Israelis.

Tamar Muskal, an Israeli-American composer, incorporated Darwish's "I Am From There" into her composition "The Yellow Wind," which combines a full orchestra, Arabic flute, Arabic and Israeli poetry, and themes from [[David Grossman]]'s book ''The Yellow Wind.''<ref>Youseff M. Ibrahim, Felicia R. Lee, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/14/arts/music/14yell.html?scp=28&sq=Mahmoud%20Darwish&st=cse "Letting Music Speak of Mideast Pain"], ''New York Times'', 14 May 2005.</ref>

In 2002, Swiss composer [[Klaus Huber]] completed a large work entitled "Die Seele muss vom Reittier steigen…", a [[chamber music]] concerto for cello, baritone and countertenor that incorporates Darwish's "The Soul Must Descend from its Mount and Walk on its Silken Feet."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Klaus Huber has passed away|url=https://www.ricordi.com/en-US/News/2017/10/Klaus-Huber.aspx|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.ricordi.com|language=en}}</ref>

In 2008, [[Mohammed Fairouz]] set selections from ''State of Siege'' to music.

Inspired by the attempted suppression of [[Marcel Khalife|Khalife]]'s composition "I am Yusuf, oh my father," the Norwegian singer-songwriter [[Moddi]] composed a fresh melody to the poem. The song is titled "Oh my father, I am Joseph," from his 2015 album ''[[Unsongs]]''.

In 2017, British musician [[Roger Waters]] set to music an English translation of Darwish's "Lesson From the Kama Sutra (Wait for Her)" on his album ''[[Is This the Life We Really Want?]]'' in a song titled "[[Wait for Her]]."<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Sedley|first1=David|last2=AFP|title=Roger Waters' new album features track inspired by Palestinian poet|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/roger-waters-new-album-features-track-inspired-by-palestinian-poet/|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Representation in other media==
In 1997, a documentary entitled ''Mahmoud Darwish'' was produced by French TV, directed by French-Moroccan director [[Simone Bitton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mahmouddarwish.com/english/biography.htm|title=Biography|publisher=Official Mahmoud Darwish website|access-date=20 August 2012|archive-date=13 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082656/http://www.mahmouddarwish.com/english/biography.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Darwish appeared as himself in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Notre Musique]]'' (2004).

In 2008 Darwish starred in the five-screen film ''[[Id identity of the soul|id – Identity of the Soul]]'' from Arts Alliance Productions, in which he narrates his poem "A Soldier Dreams of White Lilies" along with [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s poem "[[Terje Vigen]]." ''Id'' was his final performance. It premiered in Palestine in October 2008, with audiences of tens of thousands. In 2010, the film was continuing an international screening tour.

In 2009 Egin, a patchanka band from Italy, published a song setting the poem "Identity Card" to music.

In 2016, his poem "We Were Without a Present" served as the basis for the central song, "Ya Reit" by Palestinian rapper [[Tamer Nafar]] in the film "Junction 48".<ref>{{cite web |title=Junction 48 - Sound Track List |url=http://www.filmpressplus.com/wp-content/uploads/dl_docs/JUNCTION%2048-Music_Tracks.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, one of his poems was read as part of Nafar's speech during the [[Ophir Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Palestinian Rapper to Include Darwish Poem in 'Israeli Oscars' Performance |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/palestinian-rapper-to-sing-darwish-poem-at-ophir-awards-1.5441281 |publisher=Haaretz}}</ref>

In 2017, his poem "Think of Others" was set to music by a South African artist and 11-year old Palestinian youth activist, [[Janna Jihad|Janna Jihad Ayyad]].

==Death==
[[File:PS-Mahmoud Darwish memorial, Ramallah (6).JPG|thumb|right|Darwish's grave and memorial in [[Ramallah]]]]

Mahmoud Darwish died on 9 August 2008 at the age of 67, three days after heart surgery at [[Memorial Hermann Hospital]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. Before surgery, Darwish had signed a document asking not to be resuscitated in the event of brain death.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/08/200889171240520492.html "Palestinian poet Darwish dies"], ''Al Jazeera'', 10 August 2008.</ref> According to [[Ibrahim Muhawi]], the poet, though suffering from serious heart problems, did not require urgent surgery, and the day set for the operation bore a symbolic resonance. In his ''Memory for Forgetfulness,'' Darwish centered the narrative of [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel's invasion of Lebanon]] and [[Siege of Beirut|88-day siege of Beirut]] on 6 August 1982, which was the anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]]. A new bomb had been deployed, which could collapse and level a 12-storey building by creating a vacuum. Darwish wrote: "On this day, on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb, they are trying out the vacuum bomb on our flesh and the experiment is successful." By his choice of that day for surgery, Muwahi suggests, Darwish was documenting: "the nothingness he saw laying ahead for the Palestinian people."<ref>[[Ibrahim Muhawi]], [http://ccas.georgetown.edu/document/1242772109538/CCAS_Occasional%2BPaper_7.pdf "Contexts of Language in Mahmoud Darwish"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016235830/http://ccas.georgetown.edu/document/1242772109538/CCAS_Occasional%2BPaper_7.pdf |date=16 October 2014 }}, Center for Contemporary Arabic Studies, Georgetown University, 2009.</ref>

Early reports of his death in the Arabic press indicated that Darwish had asked in his will to be buried in Palestine. Three locations were originally suggested; his home village of al-Birwa, the neighboring village [[Jadeidi-Makr|Jadeida]], where some of Darwish's family still resides, or in the West Bank city of [[Ramallah]]. Ramallah Mayor [[Janet Mikhail]] announced later that Darwish would be buried next to Ramallah's Palace of Culture, at the summit of a hill overlooking [[Jerusalem]] on the southwestern outskirts of Ramallah, and a shrine would be erected in his honor.<ref name="Ha1"/> Ahmed Darwish said "Mahmoud doesn't just belong to a family or a town, but to all the Palestinians, and he should be buried in a place, where all Palestinians can come and visit him."<ref name="Jpo">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1218104248417&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "PA may request Galilee burial for poet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112001551/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1218104248417&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=12 January 2012 }}. ''Associated Press'' via ''JPost'', 10 August 2008.</ref>

Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] declared three days of mourning to honor Darwish and he was accorded the equivalent of a State funeral.<ref name="Ha1">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1009916.html Zvi Bar'el, "Palestinians: Mahmoud Darwish to be laid to rest in Israel", ''Ha'aretz''], 10 August 2008.</ref><ref>Mohammed Assadi, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081000679.html?sub=new "Palestinians plan big funeral for poet Darwish"], ''The Washington Post'', 10 August 2008.</ref> A set of four postage stamps commemorating Darwish was issued in August 2008 by the PA.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Stamps of Palestine 2008|author=Tobias Zywietz|access-date=13 June 2009|date=15 March 2009|url=http://www.zobbel.de/stamp/pna_2008.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mahmoud Darwish postal stamp released|work= Ma'an News Agency|access-date=13 June 2009|date=29 July 2008|url=http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&ID=30901}}</ref>

Arrangements for flying the body in from Texas delayed the funeral for a day.<ref>[http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Middle_East/10236279.html "Mahmoud Darwish funeral postponed till Wednesday"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815001254/http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Middle_East/10236279.html |date=15 August 2008 }}, Gulfnews.com, 11 August 2008.</ref> Darwish's body was then flown from [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] for the burial in Ramallah. The first [[eulogy]] was delivered by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to an orderly gathering of thousands. Several left-wing Knesset members attended the official ceremony; [[Mohammed Barakeh]] ([[Hadash]]) and [[Ahmed Tibi]] ([[United Arab List]]-[[Ta'al]]) stood with the family, and [[Dov Khenin]] (Hadash) and [[Jamal Zahalka]] ([[Balad (political party)|Balad]]) were in the hall at the [[Mukataa]]. Also present was the former French prime minister and poet [[Dominique de Villepin]].<ref>Avi Issacharoff and Jack Khoury, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011400.html "Mahmoud Darwish – The death of a Palestinian cultural symbol"], ''Ha'aretz'', 14 August 2008.</ref> After the ceremony, Darwish's coffin was taken in a cortege at walking pace from the Mukataa to the Palace of Culture, gathering thousands of followers along the way.

On 5 October 2008, the [[Berlin International Literature Festival|International Literature Festival Berlin]] held a worldwide reading in memory of Mahmoud Darwish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwide-reading.com/archiv-en/weltweite-lesung-in-memoriam-mahmud-darwisch-am-5.-oktober-2008?set_language=en|title=05.10.2008 - Worldwide Reading in Memory of Mahmoud Darwish — Worldwide Reading|website=www.worldwide-reading.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref>
