'''Ian Serraillier''' (24 September 1912 – 28 November 1994) was an English novelist and poet. He retold legends from England, Greece and Rome and was best known for his children's books, especially ''[[The Silver Sword]]'' (1956), a wartime adventure story that the [[BBC]] adapted for television in 1957 and again in 1971.

==Early life and education==
Serraillier, born in London on 24 September 1912, was the eldest of the four children of Lucien Serraillier (1886–1919) and Mary Kirkland Rodger (1883–1940). His father died in the [[Spanish flu|1918 Spanish flu pandemic]].

Serraillier was educated at [[Brighton College]], a [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], and at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]]. He then taught English at [[Wycliffe College (Gloucestershire)|Wycliffe College]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1936–1939, [[Dudley]] Grammar School, [[Worcestershire]], in 1939–1946, and [[Midhurst Grammar School]], West Sussex, in 1946–1961.

==Pacifism==
As a [[Quaker]] Serraillier was granted [[conscientious objector]] status in [[World War II]]. He was a member of the pacifist [[Peace Pledge Union]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://peacenews.info/node/5803/triumph-will |title=Review of 'The Silver Sword' |author=Cloves, Jeff |work=[[Peace News]] |date=July–August 2009 |access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |work=ODNB |author=Prichard, Mari |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47190|date=22 July 2013 |title=Ian Serraillier}}</ref>

==Writing and editing==
In 1946, Serraillier published his first three children's books: ''They Raced for Treasure'', a story of sailing, treasure and spies, and ''Thomas and the Sparrow''.<ref>British Library catalogue [http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt=0&frbg=&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&tab=local_tab&dstmp=1474363398362&srt=rank&ct=search&mode=Basic&vl(488279563UI0)=any&dum=true&tb=t&indx=1&vl(freeText0)=Ian%20Serraillier%201946&vid=BLVU1&fn=search Retrieved 20 September 2016.]</ref> These were followed by several more adventure stories, including his best-known one ''The Silver Sword'' (1956), which follows the story of four refugee children, three of them siblings: Ruth, Edek, and Bronia. The fourth, Jan, is another of the many Warsaw war orphans who has somehow met their father. He then fainted near the bombed-out basement that serves as the siblings' home. The four children join in their search for the siblings' parents in the chaos of Europe just after the Second World War. The book appeared in the United States under the title ''Escape from Warsaw''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Escape from Warsaw |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73806.Escape_From_Warsaw |author=Serraillier, Ian}}</ref>

From 1961, Serraillier spent most of his time writing fiction and non-fiction, poems, and educational programmes for television. He also retold classic and ancient legends for children, in prose and verse, including ''[[Beowulf]]'', works by [[Chaucer]], English folklore, and Greek and Roman myths. In 1948, he and with his wife, Anne Margaret Rogers, founded the New Windmill Series for [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]] Educational Books, to provide inexpensive editions of worthwhile fiction, travel and biography for older readers. He continued to co-edit the series until the early 1990s, when [[Alzheimer's disease]] set in.

''The Ivory Horn'' (1960), a retelling of the [[Roland]] legend, was a runner-up for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]]{{when|date=November 2015}}, as had been ''The Silver Sword''.<ref>Author's biography in the Puffin edition, reprinted in 1987.</ref> As a popular children's author, Serraillier was invited to Children's Literature Summer Camps for members of the [[Puffin Books|Puffin]] Book Club, run by Colony Holidays (predecessor to [[ATE Superweeks]]), along with other popular children's authors such as [[Joan Aiken]] and [[Clive King]].<ref>{{Cite web |website=Campaign for Summer Camps |url=http://www.campaignforsummercamps.org.uk/downloads/how-summer-camps-could-change-britain.pdf |title=How Summer Camps Could Change Britain}}</ref>
