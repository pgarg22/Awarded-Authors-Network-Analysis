'''John Anthony Burgess Wilson''', {{post-nominals|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|dʒ|ə|s}};<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/anthony-burgess|title=anthony-burgess - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes &#124; Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}</ref> 25 February 1917&nbsp;– 22 November 1993), who published under the name '''Anthony Burgess''', was an English writer and composer.

Although Burgess was primarily a comic writer, his [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] satire ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' remains his best-known novel.<ref>See the essay "A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece" by Theodore Dalrymple in "Not With a Bang but a Whimper" (2008), pp.&nbsp;135–149.</ref> In 1971, it was adapted into a controversial [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]], which Burgess said was chiefly responsible for the popularity of the book. Burgess produced numerous other novels, including the Enderby quartet, and ''[[Earthly Powers]]''. He wrote librettos and screenplays, including the 1977 TV mini-series ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]''. He worked as a literary critic for several publications, including ''[[The Observer]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'', and wrote studies of classic writers, notably [[James Joyce]]. A versatile linguist, Burgess lectured in phonetics, and translated ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', and the opera ''[[Carmen]]'', among others.

Burgess also composed over 250 musical works; he considered himself as much a composer as an author, although he achieved considerably more success in writing.<ref>[http://www.anthonyburgess.org/about-anthony-burgess/burgess-the-composer "Burgess... the Composer"], The International Anthony Burgess Foundation (IABF).</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
In 1917, Burgess was born at 91 Carisbrook Street in [[Harpurhey]], a suburb of [[Manchester]], [[England]], to Catholic parents, Joseph and Elizabeth Wilson.<ref name="Oxfordbiog">{{cite ODNB|last=Ratcliffe|first=Michael|contribution=Wilson, John Burgess [Anthony Burgess] (1917–1993)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51526?docPos=2|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/51526|edition=online|access-date=20 June 2011}}</ref> He described his background as [[lower middle class]]; growing up during the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], his parents, who were shopkeepers, were fairly well off, as the demand for their tobacco and alcohol wares remained constant. He was known in childhood as Jack, Little Jack, and Johnny Eagle.<ref name="Lewis67">{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=67}}</ref> At his [[Confirmation in the Catholic Church|confirmation]], the name Anthony was added and he became John Anthony Burgess Wilson. He began using the [[pen name]] '''Anthony Burgess''' upon the publication of his 1956 novel ''Time for a Tiger''.<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/>

His mother Elizabeth (''née'' Burgess) died at the age of 30 at home on 19 November 1918, during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. The causes listed on her death certificate were [[influenza]], acute [[pneumonia]], and [[Heart failure|cardiac failure]]. His sister Muriel had died four days earlier on 15 November from influenza, [[Bronchopneumonia|broncho-pneumonia]], and cardiac failure, aged eight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=62}}</ref> Burgess believed he was resented by his father, Joseph Wilson, for having survived, when his mother and sister did not.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=64}}</ref>

After the death of his mother, Burgess was raised by his maternal aunt, Ann Bromley, in [[Crumpsall]] with her two daughters. During this time, Burgess's father worked as a bookkeeper for a beef market by day, and in the evening played piano at a public house in [[Miles Platting]].<ref name="Lewis67"/> After his father married the landlady of this pub, Margaret Dwyer, in 1922, Burgess was raised by his father and stepmother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=68}}</ref> By 1924 the couple had established a [[tobacconist]] and [[Alcohol licensing laws of the United Kingdom#Off-licence|off-licence]] business with four properties.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=70}} Burgess was briefly employed at the tobacconist shop as a child.<ref name=":0" /> On 18 April 1938, Joseph Wilson died from cardiac failure, [[pleurisy]], and influenza at the age of 55, leaving no inheritance despite his apparent business success.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=70–71}} Burgess' stepmother died of a heart attack in 1940.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=107}}

Burgess has said of his largely solitary childhood "I was either distractedly persecuted or ignored. I was one despised.&nbsp;... Ragged boys in gangs would pounce on the well-dressed like myself."<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|pp=53–54}}</ref> Burgess attended St. Edmund's Elementary School before moving on to Bishop Bilsborrow Memorial Elementary School, both [[Catholic schools in the United Kingdom|Catholic schools]], in [[Moss Side]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=57}}</ref> He later reflected "When I went to school I was able to read. At the Manchester elementary school I attended, most of the children could not read, so I was&nbsp;... a little apart, rather different from the rest."<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=66}}</ref> Good grades resulted in a place at [[Xaverian College]] (1928–37).<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/>

====Music====
Burgess was indifferent to music until he heard on his home-built [[Radio receiver|radio]] "a quite incredible flute solo", which he characterised as "sinuous, exotic, erotic", and became spellbound.<ref name="McGraw 17-18">{{Harvnb|Burgess|1982|pp=17–18}}</ref> Eight minutes later the announcer told him he had been listening to ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'' by [[Claude Debussy]]. He referred to this as a "[[Psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] moment&nbsp;... a recognition of verbally inexpressible spiritual realities".<ref name="McGraw 17-18"/> When Burgess announced to his family that he wanted to be a composer, they objected as "there was no money in it".<ref name="McGraw 17-18"/> Music was not taught at his school, but at the age of about 14 he taught himself to play the piano.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burgess|1982|p=19}}</ref>

====University====
Burgess had originally hoped to study music at university, but the music department at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] turned down his application because of poor grades in [[physics]].<ref name=HRC>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fa/burgess.bio.html|title=Anthony Burgess, 1917–1993, Biographical Sketch|work=Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830172945/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fa/burgess.bio.html|archive-date=30 August 2005|date=8 June 2004}}</ref> Instead, he studied [[English language]] and [[English literature|literature]] there between 1937 and 1940, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]]. His thesis concerned [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'', and he graduated with an [[British undergraduate degree classification#Upper second-class honours|upper second-class honours]], which he found disappointing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|pp=97–98}}</ref> When grading one of Burgess's term papers, the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] wrote "Bright ideas insufficient to conceal lack of knowledge."<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=95}}</ref>

====Marriage====
Burgess met Llewela "Lynne" Isherwood Jones at the university where she was studying economics, politics and modern history, graduating in 1942 with an upper second-class.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|pp=109–110}}</ref> She reportedly claimed to be a distant relative of [[Christopher Isherwood]], although the Lewis and Biswell biographies dispute this.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mitang|first=Herbert|title=Anthony Burgess, 76, Dies; Man of Letters and Music|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/obituaries/anthony-burgess-76-dies-man-of-letters-and-music.html|type=obituary|access-date=31 August 2013|date=26 November 1993}}</ref> Burgess and Jones were married on 22 January 1942.<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/>

===Military service===
Burgess spent six weeks in 1940 as a [[British Army]] recruit in [[Eskbank]] before becoming a Nursing Orderly Class 3 in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. During his service, he was unpopular and was involved in incidents such as knocking off a corporal's cap and polishing the floor of a corridor to make people slip.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=113}}</ref> In 1941, Burgess was pursued by the [[Royal Military Police]] for desertion after overstaying his leave from [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] military base with his future bride Lynne. The following year he asked to be transferred to the [[Army Educational Corps]] and, despite his loathing of authority, he was promoted to sergeant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=117}}</ref> During the [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]], his pregnant wife Lynne was raped and assaulted by four American deserters; perhaps as a result, she lost the child.<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/10/biography.anthonyburgess|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Nigel|last=Williams|title=Not like clockwork|date=10 November 2002}}</ref> Burgess, stationed at the time in [[Gibraltar]], was denied leave to see her.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|pp=107, 128}}</ref>

At his stationing in Gibraltar, which he later wrote about in ''[[A Vision of Battlements]]'', he worked as a training college lecturer in speech and drama, teaching alongside Ann McGlinn in [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>[http://wiredforbooks.org/anthonyburgess ''Wired for books'' Burgess, audio interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406011337/http://www.wiredforbooks.org/anthonyburgess/ |date=6 April 2005 }}; accessed 29 August 2010</ref> McGlinn's [[communism|communist]] ideology would have a major influence on his later novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Burgess played a key role in "[[The British Way and Purpose]]" programme, designed to introduce members of the forces to the [[Post-war consensus|peacetime socialism]] of the [[Postwar Britain (1945–1979)|post-war years]] in Britain.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n03/colin-burrow/not-quite-nasty |title=Not Quite Nasty |author=Colin Burrow | date=9 February 2006 |magazine=London Review of Books |access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref> He was an instructor for the Central Advisory Council for Forces Education of the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/> Burgess' flair for languages was noticed by [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|army intelligence]], and he took part in debriefings of Dutch expatriates and [[Free French]] who found refuge in Gibraltar during the war. In the neighbouring [[Francoist Spain|Spanish]] town of [[La Línea de la Concepción]], he was arrested for insulting [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]] but released from custody shortly after the incident.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biswell|2006}}</ref>

===Early teaching career===
Burgess left the army in 1946 with the rank of [[sergeant-major]]. For the next four years he was a lecturer in speech and drama at the Mid-West School of Education near [[Wolverhampton]] and at the Bamber Bridge Emergency Teacher Training College near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/> Burgess taught in the extramural department of [[Birmingham University]] (1946–50).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85075/Anthony-Burgess Anthony Burgess profile], britannica.com; accessed 26 November 2014.</ref>

In late 1950, he began working as a secondary school teacher at [[Banbury School|Banbury Grammar School]] (now [[Banbury School]]) teaching English literature. In addition to his teaching duties, he supervised sports and ran the school's drama society. He organised a number of amateur theatrical events in his spare time. These involved local people and students and included productions of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=168}}</ref> Reports from his former students and colleagues indicate that he cared deeply about teaching.<ref name="BurgessIngersoll2008">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Burgess|author2=Earl G. Ingersoll|author3=Mary C. Ingersoll|title=Conversations with Anthony Burgess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMQddeQeC-8C|year=2008|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-096-8|page=xv}}</ref>

With financial assistance provided by Lynne's father, the couple was able to put a down payment on a cottage in the village of [[Adderbury]], close to [[Banbury]]. He named the cottage "Little Gidding" after one of Eliot's ''[[Four Quartets]]''. Burgess cut his journalistic teeth in Adderbury, writing several articles for the local newspaper, the ''[[Banbury Guardian]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://geoffreygrigson.wordpress.com ''Tiger: The Life and Opinions of Anthony Burgess''], geoffreygrigson.wordpress.com; accessed 26 November 2014.{{Better source needed|date=January 2018}}</ref>

===Malaya===
[[File:Overfloor and Big Tree, Malay College.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Malay College]] in [[Kuala Kangsar]], Perak, where Burgess taught 1954–55]]
In 1954, Burgess joined the [[Colonial Service|British Colonial Service]] as a teacher and education officer in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], initially stationed at [[Kuala Kangsar]] in Perak. Here he taught at the ''Malay College'' (now [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]] – MCKK), modeled on [[Public school (United Kingdom)|English public school l]]<nowiki/>ines. In addition to his teaching duties, he was a housemaster in charge of students of the [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], who were housed at a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansion known as "King's Pavilion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sakmongkol.blogspot.com/2009/06/life-and-times-of-dato-mokhtar-bin-dato_15.html|title=SAKMONGKOL AK47: The Life and Times of Dato Mokhtar bin Dato Sir Mahmud|publisher=Sakmongkol.blogspot.com|date=15 June 2009|access-date=14 February 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://mcoba.org/pesentation-by-old-boys-at-the-100-years-prep-school-centenary-celebration-2013 MCOBA – PESENTATION(sic) BY OLD BOYS AT THE 100 YEARS PREP SCHOOL CENTENARY CELEBRATION – 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20141126194541/http://mcoba.org/pesentation-by-old-boys-at-the-100-years-prep-school-centenary-celebration-2013 |date=26 November 2014 }}, mcoba.org; accessed 26 November 2014.</ref> A variety of the music he wrote there was influenced by the country, notably [[Sinfoni Melayu]] for orchestra and brass band, which included cries of [[Merdeka]] (independence) from the audience.

Burgess and his wife had occupied a noisy apartment where privacy was minimal, and this caused resentment. Following a dispute with the Malay College's principal about this, Burgess was reposted to the Malay Teachers' Training College at [[Kota Bharu]], Kelantan.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=223–224}} Burgess attained fluency in [[Malay language|Malay]], spoken and written, achieving distinction in the examinations in the language set by the [[Colonial Office]]. He was rewarded with a salary increase for his proficiency in the language.

He devoted some of his free time in Malaya to creative writing "as a sort of gentlemanly hobby, because I knew there wasn't any money in it," and published his first novels: ''[[Time for a Tiger]]'', ''[[The Enemy in the Blanket]]'' and ''[[Beds in the East]]''.<ref>Aggeler, Geoffrey (Editor) (1986) ''Critical Essays on Anthony Burgess.'' G K Hall. p. 1; {{ISBN|0-8161-8757-6}}.</ref> These became known as ''[[The Malayan Trilogy]]'' and were later published in one volume as ''[[The Long Day Wanes]]''.

===Brunei===
[[File:Sultan Ismail Petra Arch, Kota Bharu.jpg|thumb|Burgess was an education officer at the Malay Teachers' Training College 1955 and 1958.]]
After a brief period of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the [[Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin]] College in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]], Brunei. Brunei had been a British protectorate since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled ''[[Devil of a State]]'' and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to [[Zanzibar]], named Dunia. In his autobiography ''[[Little Wilson and Big God, Being the First Part of the Confessions of Anthony Burgess|Little Wilson and Big God]]'' (1987) Burgess wrote:{{quote|"This novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed [[Naraka]], Malay-Sanskrit for 'hell.' Little invention was needed to contrive a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, for what it was worth it was made a choice of the book society. [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous. In early 1958, ''The Enemy in the Blanket'' appeared and at once provoked a libel suit."<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yeQ9wr5SrmgC&lpg=PA431&dq=This%20novel%20was%2C%20is%2C%20about%20Brunei%2C%20which%20was%20renamed%20Naraka%2C%20Malayo-Arabic%20for%20hell.%20Little%20invention%20was%20needed%20to%20contrive%20a%20large%20cast%20of%20unbelievable%20characters%20and%20a%20number%20of%20interwoven%20plots.%20Though%20completed%20in%201958%2C%20the%20work%20was%20not%20published%20until%201961%2C%20for%20what%20it%20was%20worth%20it%20was%20made%20a%20choice%20of%20the%20book%20society.%20Heinemann%2C%20my%20publisher%2C%20was%20doubtful%20about%20publishing%20it%3A%20it%20might%20be%20libelous.%20I%20had%20to%20change%20the%20setting%20from%20Borneo%20to%20an%20East%20African%20one.%20Heinemann%20was%20right%20to%20be%20timorous.%20In%20early%201958%20'The%20Enemy%20in%20the%20Blanket'%20appeared%20and%20this%20at%20once%20provoked%20a%20libel%20suit.&pg=PA431#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Little Wilson and Big God''], Anthony Burgess, Random House, 2012, page 431</ref>}}

About this time, Burgess collapsed in a Brunei classroom while teaching history and was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain tumour.<ref name=HRC/> Burgess was given just a year to live, prompting him to write several novels to get money to provide for his widow.<ref name=HRC /> He gave a different account, however, to [[Jeremy Isaacs]] in a ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' interview on the BBC ''[[The Late Show (BBC TV series)|The Late Show]]'' (21 March 1989). He said "Looking back now I see that I was driven out of the [[Colonial Service]]. I think possibly for political reasons that were disguised as clinical reasons".<ref>''Conversations with Anthony Burgess'' (2008) Ingersoll & Ingersoll ed. p. 180.</ref> He alluded to this in an interview with Don Swaim, explaining that his wife Lynne had said something "obscene" to the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] during an official visit, and the colonial authorities turned against him.<ref Name="Ingersol1512">''Conversations with Anthony Burgess'' (2008), Ingersoll & Ingersoll, pp&nbsp;151–152.</ref><ref name="swaim">{{cite web |url=http://www.wiredforbooks.org/anthonyburgess/ |title=1985 interview with Anthony Burgess (audio) |publisher=Wiredforbooks.org |date=19 September 1985 |access-date=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811164114/http://www.wiredforbooks.org/anthonyburgess/ |archive-date=11 August 2011}}</ref> He had already earned their displeasure, he told Swaim, by writing articles in the newspaper in support of the revolutionary opposition party the [[Brunei People's Party|Parti Rakyat Brunei]], and for his friendship with its leader [[A.M. Azahari|Dr. Azahari]].<ref Name="Ingersol1512"/><ref name="swaim"/> Burgess' biographers attribute the incident to the author's notorious [[mythomania]]. [[Geoffrey Grigson]] writes, {{quote|He was, however, suffering from the effects of prolonged heavy drinking (and associated poor nutrition), of the often oppressive south-east Asian climate, of chronic constipation, and of overwork and professional disappointment. As he put it, the scions of the sultans and of the élite in Brunei "did not wish to be taught", because the free-flowing abundance of oil guaranteed their income and privileged status. He may also have wished for a pretext to abandon teaching and get going full-time as a writer, having made a late start.<ref name=autogenerated1 />}}

===Repatriate years===
Burgess was invalided home in 1959<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=243}}</ref> and relieved of his position in Brunei. He spent some time in the neurological ward of a London hospital (see ''[[The Doctor is Sick]]'') where he underwent cerebral tests that found no illness. On discharge, benefiting from a sum of money which Lynne Burgess had inherited from her father, together with their savings built up over six years in the East, he decided to become a full-time writer. The couple lived first in an apartment in [[Hove]], near Brighton. They later moved to a semi-detached house called "Applegarth" in [[Etchingham]], about four miles from Bateman's where [[Rudyard Kipling]] had lived in [[Burwash, East Sussex|Burwash]], and one mile from the [[Robertsbridge]] home of [[Malcolm Muggeridge]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=280}}</ref> Upon the death of Burgess's father-in-law, the couple used their inheritance to decamp to a terraced town house in [[Chiswick]]. This provided convenient access to the [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] where he later became a frequent guest. During these years Burgess became a regular drinking partner of the novelist [[William S. Burroughs]]. Their meetings took place in London and [[Tangiers]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=325}}</ref>

A sea voyage the couple took with the Baltic Line from [[Tilbury]] to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in June 1961<ref>{{Harvnb|Biswell|2006|p=237}}</ref> resulted in the novel ''[[Honey for the Bears]]''. He wrote in his autobiographical ''You've Had Your Time'' (1990), that in re-learning [[Russian language|Russian]] at this time, he found inspiration for the Russian-based slang [[Nadsat]] that he created for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', going on to note, "I would resist to the limit any publisher's demand that a glossary be provided."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Craik|first1=Roger|s2cid=162676494|title='Bog or God' in A Clockwork Orange|journal=ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews|date=January 2003|volume=16|issue=4|pages=51–54|doi=10.1080/08957690309598481}}</ref><ref group='Notes' name='a'>A British edition of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (Penguin 1972; {{ISBN|0-14-003219-3}}) and at least one American edition did have a glossary.

The affair was hidden from Burgess's [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] wife, whom he refused to leave for fear of offending his cousin (by Burgess's stepmother, Margaret Dwyer Wilson), [[George Dwyer]], the [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds]].<ref name=TelegDec07/>

Lynne Burgess died from [[alcoholic liver cirrhosis|cirrhosis of the liver]], on 20 March 1968.<ref name="Oxfordbiog"/> Six months later, in September 1968, Burgess married Liana, acknowledging her four-year-old boy as his own, although the birth certificate listed Roy Halliday, Liana's former partner, as the father.<ref name=TelegDec07/> Paolo Andrea (also known as Andrew Burgess Wilson) died in London in 2002, aged 37.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biswell|2006|p=4}}</ref> Liana died in 2007.<ref name=TelegDec07/>

Burgess was a Conservative (though, as he clarified in an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'', his political views could be considered "a kind of [[anarchism]]" since his ideal of a "[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Imperialism|imperial]] [[Monarchism|monarch]]" wasn't practicable<ref name=paris/>), a [[Lapsed Catholic|(lapsed) Catholic]] and Monarchist, harbouring a distaste for all [[Republic|republics]]. He believed [[socialism]] for the most part was "ridiculous" but did "concede that [[Socialized medicine|socialised medicine]] is a priority in any civilised country today."<ref name=paris>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/media/3994_BURGESS.pdf |title=The art of fiction no. 48: Anthony Burgess|magazine=The Paris Review|date=March 1971 |last=Cullinan|first=John |access-date=14 February 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028164633/http://www.theparisreview.org/media/3994_BURGESS.pdf |archive-date = 28 October 2007}}</ref> To avoid the 90% tax the family would have incurred because of their high income, they left Britain and toured Europe in a [[Bedford Dormobile]] motor-home. During their travels through France and across the [[Alps]], Burgess wrote in the back of the van as Liana drove.

In this period, he wrote novels and produced film scripts for [[Lew Grade]] and [[Franco Zeffirelli]].<ref name=TelegDec07/> His first place of residence after leaving England was [[Lija]], Malta (1968–70). The negative reaction from a lecture that Burgess delivered to an audience of Catholic priests in Malta precipitated a move by the couple to Italy<ref name=TelegDec07/> after the Maltese government confiscated the property.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Summerfield|first=Nicholas|date=December 2018|title=Freedom and Anthony Burgess|journal=The London Magazine|volume=December/January 2019|pages=64–69}}</ref> (He would go on to fictionalise these events in ''[[Earthly Powers]]'' a decade later.)<ref name=":0" /> The Burgesses maintained a flat in Rome, a country house in [[Bracciano]], and a property in Montalbuccio. On hearing rumours of a [[Sicilian Mafia|mafia]] plot to kidnap Paolo Andrea while the family was staying in Rome, Burgess decided to move to [[Monaco]] in 1975.<ref>{{citation |last=Asprey |first=Matthew |title=Peripatetic Burgess |journal=End of the World Newsletter |date=July–August 2009 |issue=3 |pages=4–7 |url=http://www.anthonyburgess.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/01-newsletter-060709.pdf |access-date=31 August 2013}}</ref> Burgess was also motivated to move to the [[tax haven]] of Monaco as the country did not levy [[income tax]] and widows were exempt from [[death duties]], a form of taxation on their husband's estates.{{sfn|Biswell|2006|p=356}}

The couple also had a villa in France, at [[Callian, Var]], [[Provence]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=12}}

Burgess lived for two years in the United States, working as a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]] with the creative writing program (1970) and as a distinguished professor at the [[City College of New York]] (1972). At City College he was a close colleague and friend of [[Joseph Heller]]. He went on to teach creative writing at [[Columbia University]] and was writer-in-residence at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1969) and at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] (1976). He lectured on the novel at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1975. Eventually he settled in [[Monaco]] in 1976, where he was active in the local community, becoming a co-founder in 1984 of the [[Princess Grace Irish Library]], a centre for Irish cultural studies.

In May 1988, Burgess made an [[After Dark (TV series)#"What is Sex For?"|extended appearance]] with, among others, [[Andrea Dworkin]] on the episode ''What Is Sex For?'' of discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]''. He spoke at one point about [[divorce]]: <blockquote>"Liking involves no discipline; love does{{nbsp}}... A [[marriage]], say that lasts twenty years or more, is a kind of [[Civilization|civilisation]], a kind of [[Microcosm–macrocosm analogy|microcosm]] - it develops its own [[language]], its own [[semiotics]], its own [[slang]], its own [[Shorthand|shorthand{{nbsp}}]]... sex is part of it, part of the semiotics. To destroy, wantonly, such a relationship, is like destroying a whole civilisation."<ref>Quoted in Anthony McCarthy (2016), ''Ethical Sex'', Fidelity Press</ref></blockquote>

Although Burgess lived not far from [[Graham Greene]], whose house was in [[Antibes]], Greene became aggrieved shortly before his death by comments in newspaper articles by Burgess, and broke off all contact.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Gore Vidal]] revealed in his 2006 memoir ''Point to Point Navigation'' that Greene disapproved of Burgess's appearance on various European television stations to discuss his (Burgess') books.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Vidal recounts that Greene apparently regarded a willingness to appear on television as something that ought to be beneath a writer's dignity.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> "He talks about his books", Vidal quotes an exasperated Greene as saying.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

During this time, Burgess spent much time at his chalet two kilometres (1¼ miles) outside [[Lugano]], Switzerland.

===Death===
[[File:ABABBAABBA Monaco.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Burgess's grave marker at the [[Columbarium]] in Monaco's cemetery.]]
Burgess wrote: "I shall die somewhere in the Mediterranean lands, with an inaccurate obituary in the ''[[Nice-Matin]]'', unmourned, soon forgotten."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ilovemanchester.com/2015/09/09/anthony-burgess-manchesters-neglected-hero.aspx|title=Anthony Burgess - Manchester's Neglected Hero?|last=Fitzgerald|first=Laurence|date=9 September 2015|work=I Love Manchester|access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref> In fact, Burgess died in the country of his birth. He returned to [[Twickenham]], an outer suburb of London, where he owned a house, to await death. Burgess died on 22 November 1993 from [[lung cancer]], at the [[St John's Wood|Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth]] in London. His ashes were inurned at the [[Monaco Cemetery]].

The epitaph on Burgess's marble memorial stone, reads: "Abba Abba" which means "Father, father" in Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages and is pronounced by [[Jesus|Christ]] during his agony in [[Gethsemane]] (Mark 14:36) as he prays God to spare him. It is also [[Abba Abba|the title of Burgess's 22nd novel]], concerning the death of [[John Keats]]. Eulogies at his memorial service at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]], London in 1994 were delivered by the journalist [[Auberon Waugh]] and the novelist [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} ''The Times'' obituary heralded the author as "a great moralist".<ref>"Anthony Burgess", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> His estate was worth US$3 million, and included a large European property portfolio of houses and apartments.<ref name=TelegDec07/>

==Life in music==
An accomplished musician, Burgess composed regularly throughout his life, and once said: {{quote|"I wish people would think of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side."<ref>Walter Clemons, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TyMcAQAAMAAJ&q=%22musician+who%22 "Anthony Burgess: Pushing On"], ''New York Times Book Review'', 29 November 1970, p. 2. Google Books.</ref>}} Several of his pieces were broadcast during his lifetime on [[BBC Radio]]. His Symphony No. 3 in C was premiered by the [[University of Iowa]] orchestra in Iowa City in 1975. Burgess described his ''[[Sinfoni Melayu]]'' as an attempt to "combine the musical elements of the country [Malaya] into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones." The structure of ''[[Napoleon Symphony|Napoleon Symphony: A Novel in Four Movements]]'' (1974) was modelled on Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica symphony]], while ''[[Mozart and the Wolf Gang]]'' (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No.40]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] features prominently in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and in [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Stanley Kubrick's film version]] of the novel). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in ''This Man and Music''. He wrote a good deal of music for recorder as his son played the instrument. Several of his pieces for recorder and piano including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and "Tre Pezzetti" have been included on a major [[Compact disc|CD]] release from recorder player John Turner and pianist Harvey Davies; the double album also includes related music from 15 other composers and is titled ''Anthony Burgess – The Man and his Music''.<ref>Metier records, release September 2013.</ref>

Burgess produced a translation of [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]] and [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]]'s libretto to [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', which was performed by the [[English National Opera]], and wrote for the 1973 Broadway musical ''[[Cyrano (musical)|Cyrano]]'', using his own adaptation of the original [[Edmond Rostand|Rostand]] play as his basis. He created ''[[Blooms of Dublin]]'' in 1982, an [[operetta]] based on [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (televised for the BBC) and wrote a libretto for Weber's ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'', performed by the Glasgow-based [[Scottish Opera]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On the BBC's ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' radio programme in 1966,<ref>{{cite web|title=Anthony Burgess|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/dc3f4365#p009y34z|work=Desert Island Discs|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref> Burgess chose as his favourite music [[Henry Purcell|Purcell's]] "Rejoice in the Lord Alway"; [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' No. 13; [[Edward Elgar|Elgar's]] [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1 in A-flat major]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] "Walter's Trial Song" from ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''; [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] "Fêtes" from ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]''; [[Constant Lambert|Lambert's]] ''[[The Rio Grande (Lambert)|The Rio Grande]]''; [[William Walton|Walton's]] [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|Symphony No. 1 in B-flat minor]]; and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams']] ''On Wenlock Edge''.

==Linguistics==
"Burgess's linguistic training", wrote Raymond Chapman and Tom McArthur in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'': "...{{nbsp}}is shown in dialogue enriched by distinctive pronunciations and the niceties of register."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} During his years in Malaya, and after he had mastered [[Jawi script|Jawi]], the Arabic script adapted for Malay, Burgess taught himself the [[Persian language]], after which he produced a translation of Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'' into Persian (unpublished). He worked on an anthology of the best of English literature translated into Malay, which failed to achieve publication. Burgess's published translations include two versions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Rostand |first=Edmond |author2=Anthony Burgess |title=Cyrano de Bergerac, translated and adapted by Anthony Burgess |publisher=Nick Hern Books |year=1991 |edition=New |isbn=978-1-85459-117-3}}</ref> ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus the King]]''<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-0816606672 |title=Oedipus the King. (Minnesota drama editions) (9780816606672): Anthony Burgess: Books |year=1972 |author1=Sophocles }}</ref> and ''[[Carmen]]''.

Burgess's interest in language was reflected in the invented, [[Anglo-Russian]] teen slang of ''A Clockwork Orange'' ([[Nadsat]]), and in the movie ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]]'' (1981), for which he [[Constructed language|invented]] a prehistoric language (''Ulam'') for the characters. His interest is reflected in his characters. In ''[[The Doctor is Sick]]'', Dr Edwin Spindrift is a lecturer in linguistics who escapes from a hospital ward which is peopled, as the critic Saul Maloff put it in a review, with "brain cases who happily exemplify varieties of English speech." Burgess, who had lectured on phonetics at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the late 1940s, investigates the field of linguistics in ''[[Language Made Plain]]'' and ''[[A Mouthful of Air]]''.

The depth of Burgess's multilingual proficiency came under discussion in [[Roger Lewis]]'s [[Anthony Burgess: A Life|2002 biography]]. Lewis claimed that during production in Malaysia of the BBC documentary ''A Kind of Failure'' (1982), Burgess's supposedly fluent [[Malay language|Malay]] was not understood by waitresses at a restaurant where they were filming. It was claimed that the documentary's director deliberately kept these moments intact in the film to expose Burgess's linguistic pretensions. A letter from David Wallace that appeared in the magazine of the London ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper on 25 November 2002 shed light on the affair. Wallace's letter read, in part:

{{quote|...&nbsp;the tale was inaccurate. It tells of Burgess, the great linguist, "bellowing Malay at a succession of Malayan waitresses" but "unable to make himself understood". The source of this tale was a 20-year-old BBC documentary&nbsp;... [The suggestion was] that the director left the scene in, in order to poke fun at the great author. Not so, and I can be sure, as I was that director&nbsp;... The story as seen on television made it clear that Burgess knew that these waitresses were not Malay. It was a Chinese restaurant and Burgess's point was that the ethnic Chinese had little time for the government-enforced national language, [[Bahasa Malaysia]] [Malay]. Burgess may well have had an accent, but he did speak the language; it was the girls in question who did not.}}

Lewis may not have been fully aware of the fact that a quarter of Malaysia's population is made up of [[Hokkien]]- and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]-speaking [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]]. However, Malay had been installed as the National Language with the passing of the [[Language Act]] of 1967. By 1982 all [[Education in Malaysia|national primary and secondary schools in Malaysia]] would have been teaching with [[Bahasa Melayu]] as a base language (see [[Harold Crouch]], ''Government and Society in Malaysia'', Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996).

==Work==
===Novels===
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
His Malayan trilogy ''[[The Long Day Wanes]]'' was Burgess's first published fiction. Its three books are ''[[Time for a Tiger]],'' ''[[The Enemy in the Blanket]]'' and ''[[Beds in the East]].'' ''[[Devil of a State]]'' is a follow-on to the trilogy, set in a fictionalised version of [[Brunei]]. It was Burgess's ambition to become "the true fictional expert on Malaya."{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In these works, Burgess was working in the tradition established by [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] for [[British Raj|British India]], and [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]] and [[W. Somerset Maugham|Maugham]] for [[Southeast Asia]]. Burgess operated more in the mode of Orwell, who had a good command of [[Urdu]] and [[Burmese language|Burmese]] (necessary for Orwell's work as a police officer) and Kipling, who spoke [[Hindi]] (having learnt it as a child). Like many of his fellow English expatriates in Asia, Burgess had excellent spoken and written command of his operative language(s), both as a novelist and as a speaker, including [[Malay language|Malay]].

Burgess's repatriate years (c. 1960–69) produced ''[[Inside Mr. Enderby|Enderby]]'' and ''[[The Right to an Answer]],'' which touches on the theme of death and dying, and ''[[One Hand Clapping (novel)|One Hand Clapping]],'' a satire on the vacuity of popular culture. ''[[The Worm and the Ring]]'' (1961) had to be withdrawn from circulation under the threat of libel action from one of Burgess's former colleagues, a school secretary.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=9}}</ref>

His dystopian novel, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', was published in 1962. It was inspired initially by an incident during the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] of [[World War II]] in which his wife Lynne was robbed, assaulted, and violated by deserters from the [[United States Army|US Army]] in London during the [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]. The event may have contributed to her subsequent miscarriage. The book was an examination of free will and morality. The young [[anti-hero]], [[Alex DeLarge|Alex]], captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of [[aversion therapy]] treatment to curb his violent tendencies. This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him. In the non-fiction book ''Flame into Being'' (1985), Burgess described ''A Clockwork Orange'' as "a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks. It became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence." He added, "the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die." In a 1980 BBC interview, Burgess distanced himself from the novel and cinematic adaptations. 
Near the time of publication, the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book. Burgess had written ''A Clockwork Orange'' with 21 chapters, meaning to match the [[age of majority]]. "21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility," Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition. Needing money and thinking that the publisher was "being charitable in accepting the work at all," Burgess accepted the deal and allowed ''A Clockwork Orange'' to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted. Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter. In 2021, The International Anthony Burgess Foundation premiered a webpage cataloging various stage productions of "A Clockwork Orange" from around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anthonyburgess.org/a-clockwork-orange-on-stage/?fbclid=IwAR2ou3dPNp1_9Vq3wxrqpWbN0Qu9TdghMS1-iNHoQJzk4KoqDEJaQjDjdgU|title=A Clockwork Orange On Stage}}</ref>

In [[Martin Seymour-Smith]]'s ''Novels and Novelists: A Guide to the World of Fiction,'' Burgess related that he would often prepare a synopsis with a name-list before beginning a project. Seymour-Smith wrote: {{quote|"Burgess believes overplanning is fatal to creativity and regards his unconscious mind and the act of writing itself as indispensable guides. He does not produce a draft of a whole novel but prefers to get one page finished before he goes on to the next, which involves a good deal of revision and correction."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Stephen D |title=A Dictionary of Made-Up Languages |date=2011 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4405-2817-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTXrDQAAQBAJ&q=Burgess+believes+overplanning+is+fatal+to+creativity+and+regards+his+unconscious+mind+and+the+act+of+writing+itself+as+indispensable+guides.+He+does+not+produce+a+draft+of+a+whole+novel+but+prefers+to+get+one+page+finished+before+he+goes+on+to+the+next,+which+involves+a+good+deal+of+revision+and+correction&pg=PT350 |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>}}

''[[Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life|Nothing Like the Sun]]'' is a fictional recreation of [[Shakespeare]]'s love-life and an examination of the supposedly partly syphilitic sources of the bard's imaginative vision. The novel, which drew on [[Edgar I. Fripp]]'s 1938 biography ''Shakespeare, Man and artist,'' won critical acclaim and placed Burgess among the first rank novelists of his generation. ''[[M/F]]'' (1971) was listed by the writer himself as one of the works of which he was most proud. ''[[Beard's Roman Women]]'' was revealing on a personal level, dealing with the death of his first wife, his bereavement, and the affair that led to his second marriage. In ''[[Napoleon Symphony]],'' Burgess brought [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] to life by shaping the novel's structure to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' symphony. The novel contains a portrait of an [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] society under occupation by a Christian western power ([[Egypt]] by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[First French Empire|France]]). In the 1980s, religious themes began to feature heavily (''[[The Kingdom of the Wicked]],'' ''[[Man of Nazareth]],'' ''[[Earthly Powers]]''). Though Burgess lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth, the influence of the Catholic "training" and worldview remained strong in his work all his life. This is notable in the discussion of free will in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' and in the apocalyptic vision of devastating changes in the Catholic Church&nbsp;– due to what can be understood as Satanic influence&nbsp;– in ''Earthly Powers'' (1980).

Burgess kept working through his final illness and was writing on his deathbed. The late novel ''[[Any Old Iron (novel)|Any Old Iron]]'' is a generational saga of two families, one Russian-Welsh, the other Jewish, encompassing the [[sinking of the Titanic]], [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[World War II]], the [[History of Israel|early years of the State of Israel]], and the rediscovery of [[Excalibur]]. ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]],'' about [[Christopher Marlowe]], is a companion novel to ''[[Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life|Nothing Like the Sun]].'' The verse novel ''[[Byrne: A Novel|Byrne]]'' was published posthumously.

Burgess announced in a 1972 interview that he was writing a novel about the [[Edward the Black Prince|Black Prince]] which incorporated [[John Dos Passos]]' narrative techniques, although he never finished writing it.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Interviewed by John Cullinan |url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3994/the-art-of-fiction-no-48-anthony-burgess |title=The Art of Fiction No. 48, Anthony Burgess |publisher=Paris Review |date=2 December 1972 |volume=Spring 1973 |issue=56 |access-date=19 September 2012}}</ref> After Burgess's death, English writer [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] completed this novel, and it was published in 2018.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=Adam |author2=Anthony Burgess |title=The Black Prince |publisher=Unbound |year=2018 |edition=New |isbn=978-1-78352-647-5}}</ref> In 2019, a previously unpublished analysis of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was discovered titled, "The Clockwork Condition."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/a-clockwork-orange-sequel-scli-gbr-intl/index.html|title=Lost 'A Clockwork Orange' sequel discovered in author's archives|first=Rob|last=Picheta|date=25 April 2019|website=CNN Style}}</ref> It is structured as Burgess' philosophical musings on the novel that won him so much acclaim.

===Critical studies===
Burgess started his career as a critic. His ''English Literature, A Survey for Students'', was aimed at newcomers to the subject. He followed this with ''The Novel To-day'' (Longmans, 1963) and ''The Novel Now: A Student's Guide to Contemporary Fiction'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1967). He wrote the [[James Joyce|Joyce]] studies ''Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for the Ordinary Reader'' (also published as ''Re Joyce'') and ''[[Joysprick|Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce]]''. Also published was ''A Shorter '[[Finnegans Wake]]'',' Burgess's abridgement. His 1970 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' entry on the novel (under "[https://www.britannica.com/art/novel Novel, the]") is regarded as a classic of the genre.{{By whom|date=September 2010}} Burgess wrote full-length critical studies of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway and D. H. Lawrence, as well as ''[[Ninety-nine Novels]]: The Best in English since 1939''.<ref>[http://neglectedbooks.com/?page_id=54 The Neglected Books Page], neglectedbooks.com; accessed 26 November 2014.</ref>

===Screenwriting===
Burgess wrote the screenplays for ''[[Moses the Lawgiver]]'' (Gianfranco De Bosio 1974), ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' ([[Franco Zeffirelli]] 1977), and ''[[A.D. (miniseries)|A.D.]]'' ([[Stuart Cooper]], 1985). Burgess was co-writer of the script for the TV series ''Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson'' (1980). The [[film treatment]]s he produced include ''[[Amundsen]]'', ''[[Attila]]'', ''[[The Black Prince]]'', ''[[Cyrus the Great]]'', ''Dawn Chorus'', ''The Dirty Tricks of Bertoldo'', ''Eternal Life'', ''Onassis'', ''Puma'', ''Samson and Delilah'', ''Schreber'', ''The Sexual Habits of the English Middle Class'', ''Shah'', ''That Man Freud'' and ''Uncle Ludwig''. Burgess devised a [[Stone Age]] language for ''[[La Guerre du Feu (film)|La Guerre du Feu]]'' (''Quest for Fire''; [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], 1981).

Burgess wrote many unpublished scripts, including ''Will!'' or ''The Bawdy Bard'' about [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], based on the novel ''Nothing Like The Sun''. Encouraged by the success of ''[[Tremor of Intent: An Eschatological Spy Novel|Tremor of Intent]]'' (a parody of [[James Bond]] adventures), Burgess wrote a screenplay for ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' featuring characters from and a similar tone to the novel''.''<ref name=rubin>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Steven Jay|title=The James Bond films: a behind the scenes history|url=https://archive.org/details/jamesbondfilmsbe0000rubi|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=Arlington House|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-87000-523-7}}</ref> It had Bond fighting the criminal organization CHAOS in [[Singapore]] to try to stop an assassination of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] using surgically-implanted bombs at [[Sydney Opera House]].

== Archive ==
The largest archive of Anthony Burgess's belongings is housed at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in [[Manchester, UK]]. The holdings include: handwritten journals and diaries; over 8000 books from Burgess's personal library; manuscripts of novels, journalism and musical compositions; professional and private photographs dating from between 1918 and 1993; an extensive archive of sound recordings; Burgess's music collection; furniture; musical instruments including two of Burgess's pianos; and correspondence that includes letters from [[Angela Carter]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Thomas Pynchon]] and other notable writers and publishers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anthonyburgess.org/the-collections/about-the-collections/|title=About the collections}}</ref> The International Anthony Burgess Foundation was established by Burgess's widow, Liana, in 2003.
