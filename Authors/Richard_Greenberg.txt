'''Richard Greenberg''' (born February 22, 1958) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] and [[television writer]] known for his subversively humorous depictions of middle-class American life. He has had more than 25 plays premiere on and off-broadway in New York City and eight at the  [[South Coast Repertory|South Coast Repertory Theatre]] (Costa Mesa, California), including ''[[The Violet Hour]]'', ''Everett Beekin'', and ''Hurrah at Last.''<ref name=doollee>{{cite web|title=Richard Greenberg (1958-)|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsG/greenberg-richard.html|work=Doollee's Complete Guide to the Playwright, Plays, Theatres, and Agents|access-date=May 10, 2012|year=2003}}</ref><ref name=injured/>

Greenberg is perhaps best known for his 2003 [[Tony Award]] winning play, ''[[Take Me Out (play)|Take Me Out]]'' about the conflicts that arise after a Major League Baseball player nonchalantly announces to the media that he is gay. The play premiered in London and ran in New York as the first collaboration between England's [[Donmar Warehouse]] and New York's [[The Public Theater|Public Theater]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|title=Theatre Review: Love Affair With Baseball And a Lot of Big Ideas|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9c04e3d9123cf93ba15751c0a9659c8b63|access-date=May 10, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 28, 2003}}</ref>  After its [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] transfer in early 2003, ''Take Me Out'' won widespread critical acclaim for Greenberg and numerous prestigious awards.

==Background and education==
Greenberg grew up in [[East Meadow, New York]], a middle-class Long Island town in Nassau County, east of New York City. His father, Leon Greenberg, was an executive for New York's Century Theaters movie chain and his mother Shirley was a homemaker.<ref name=Contemporary>{{cite web|title=Richard Greenberg.|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&disableHighlighting=false&prodId=BIC1&action=e&windowstate=normal&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CH1000039309&mode=view&userGroupName=iuclassb&jsid=56aafbc1a40570cb4c277837a6c158c8|work=Contemporary Authors Online.

Department of English |title=A Romantic Career - A Novel |url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/dsp01b2773x15r |language=en}}</ref> At Princeton, Greenberg studied creative writing under [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and roomed with future [[Harvard]] [[economics]] professor [[Greg Mankiw]]. He later attended Harvard for graduate work in English and American Literature, but later dropped out of the program when he was accepted to the [[Yale School of Drama]]'s playwriting program in 1985.<ref name="Witchel"/>

==Career==
Along with ''[[Take Me Out (play)|Take Me Out]]'', Greenberg's plays include ''The Dazzle'', ''[[The American Plan]]'', ''[[Life Under Water]]'', and ''The Author’s Voice''.  His adaptation of [[August Strindberg]]’s ''[[The Dance of Death (Strindberg)|Dance of Death]]'' ran on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] in 2002, starring [[Ian McKellen]], [[Helen Mirren]] and [[David Strathairn]].

He received the [[Oppenheimer Award|George Oppenheimer Award]], presented by ''Newsday'' in 1985 for ''The Bloodletters'', produced Off-Off Broadway while he was at Yale.<ref>Bryer, Jackson R. and Hartig, Mary C.

===Style===
According to ''The Methuen Drama Guide to Contemporary American Playwrights'', Greenberg's "most prominent" interest is in history "and the past". "He has a pronounced tendency to draw on historical characters or events——the Lost Generation, the Collyer Brothers, the New York Yankees." He also has an intellectual and "witty use of language."<ref>Innes, Christopher (and others) editor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OcQBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT54&lpg=PT54&dq=%22Life+Under+Water%22+%22Richard+Greenberg%22&source=bl&ots=lJC3vj79Wv&sig=rhoeNXBSXhi4YY5u3ttYAHnV6Mw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj875LT0onOAhXCUiYKHS08DWY4HhDoAQg7MAc "Richard Greenberg"] ''The Methuen Drama Guide to Contemporary American Playwrights'' (no page number), A&C Black, 2013, {{ISBN|1408134810}}</ref>
