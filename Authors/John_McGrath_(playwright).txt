'''John Peter McGrath''' (1 June 1935 – 22 January 2002) was a British [[playwright]] and theatre theorist who took up the cause of [[Socialism]] in his plays.!

==Early life and career==
From an Irish Catholic background, McGrath was born in [[Birkenhead]], and educated in Mold and, after his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]], at [[St John's College, Oxford]].<ref name="Billington">Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/24/guardianobituaries.books Obituary: John McGrath], ''The Guardian'', 24 January 2002</ref> During the early 1960s he worked for the BBC, and wrote and directed many of the early episodes of the corporation's police series ''[[Z-Cars]]'' which began in 1962.

==Theatrical career==
McGrath is best remembered as a playwright and for his theoretical formulation of the principles of a radical, popular theatre. The [[7:84|7:84 Theatre Company]] was established in 1971 by McGrath, his wife ([[Elizabeth MacLennan]]) and her brother ([[David MacLennan (theatre practitioner)|David MacLennan]]),<ref name="Davidson">Ewan Davidson [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/466025/index.html "''Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil, The'' (1974)"], BFI screenonline</ref> and ''[[The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil]]'' (1973), his best-known play, was created with these principles in mind. It utilizes some of the [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] and theatrical techniques of [[Epic theater|epic theatre]] – actors take on multiple roles and frequently slip out of character – of the type associated with the German dramatist [[Bertolt Brecht]], but which McGrath argued have a genealogy that stretches far further back through the history of popular traditions of performance. The title of the play refers to three pivotal periods in the history of [[class struggle]] in Scotland: the clearing of the [[Scottish highlands]] to make way for grazing land, the subsequent use of this land by the wealthy for [[shooting]], and its current exploitation in the oil market. These changes are identified as forming a recurrent pattern of abuse of the land and the exploitation of the people by outsiders and by wealthier locals. It was broadcast in the BBC's ''[[Play for Today]]'' series in 1974.<ref name="Davidson"/>

He adapted the satirical [[morality play]] ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates]]'' (1540) by [[David Lyndsay]] as a contemporary morality ''A Satire of the Four Estaites'', which was presented by Wildcat Theatre Company at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre as part of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in 1996.<ref name=mcgrath>From the programme to the production.</ref> This production opened on 16 August 1996 and featured [[Sylvester McCoy]].<ref name=mcgrath/>

==Personal life==
In 1962 he had married Elizabeth MacLennan, the Scottish actress, whom he had met while they were both at Oxford University; the couple had two sons and a daughter. 

==Death==
McGrath died from [[leukemia]] in January 2002.<ref>Brian Logan [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/15/artsfeatures "What did you do in the class war, Daddy?"], ''The Guardian'', 15 May 2002</ref> In McGrath’s obituary published by ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] wrote: "No one since [[Joan Littlewood]] did more to advance the cause of popular theatre in Britain than John McGrath".<ref name="Billington"/>
