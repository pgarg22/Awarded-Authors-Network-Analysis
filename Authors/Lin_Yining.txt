==Life and career==
Lin Yining was born in 1655, near the [[Zhejiang]] section of the [[Zhe River]].{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} Her father Lin Lun was a ''[[jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'',{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} and her mother introduced her to classical Chinese literature.{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=406}} She was "very talented and could write [[poetry]] and [[prose]]"; additionally, Lin dabbled in [[calligraphy]]{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=406}} and was "especially well-versed in drawing [[bamboo]] in ink and wash".{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} She married Qian Zhaoxi, who worked at the local [[censorate]] and was also acquainted with traditional [[Chinese opera]].{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} While they were based in [[Luoyang]],{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} the couple would write each other love poems that were later compiled into an anthology titled ''Collected Works of Fengxiao Tower''.{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=136}} Qian's mother, Gu Zhiqiong,{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=405}} was instrumental in bringing together talented female poets, and at her behest, the "Banana Garden Five" ({{lang|zh|蕉园五子}}), comprising Lin, Zhu Rouze, Chai Jingyi, Qian Yunyi, and Xu Can, was formed.{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} The group later became the Banana Garden Seven ({{lang|zh|蕉园七子}}) and its roster was changed to include Lin, Qian, Mao Anfang, Feng Youling, Gu Jiji, Zhang Chayun, and Chai Jingyi.{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=135}} Lin penned the [[preface]] to [[Hangzhou]] poet Liang Ying's ''Every Fragrant Word'' that collects Liang's poems on [[plum blossom]]s.{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=136}} A [[lost work|lost]] play titled ''Wisteria Pass'' was allegedly written by Lin.{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=406}}

Lin and Qian had two children {{endash}} a son, Qing, and a daughter, Tao, neither of whom, according to Lin herself, "dared" to take up Chinese literature.{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=406}} It is not known for certain when Lin Yining died, but the ''Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women'', citing an unspecified source, gives her death year as 1730.{{Sfn|Stefanowska, Lee & Lau|2015|p=136}} According to an entry on Lin Yining in ''Women Writers of Traditional China'', "Lin's poetry is distinguished by its direct and fluent diction, and vivid visual imagery".{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=407}} She is also praised for presenting her "personal interests" in her poetry, and not adhering to the "conventional themes and scenarios derived from [[Scholar-official|literati]] construction of feminine voices".{{Sfn|Saussy|1999|p=407}}
