'''Edgar Hoffmann Price''' (July 3, 1898 – June 18, 1988) was an [[American literature|American writer]] of popular fiction (he was a self-titled 'fictioneer') for the [[pulp magazine]] marketplace.<ref name="A">"Price, E. Hoffmann" in  [[Lee Server|Server Lee]]. ''Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers''. New York: Facts on File, 2002. (p. 214-215).</ref> He collaborated with [[H. P. Lovecraft]] on "[[Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]".

==Biography==
Price was born at [[Fowler, California]].

Originally intending to be a career soldier, Price graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]]; he served in the [[American Expeditionary Force]] in [[World War I]], and with the American military in [[Mexico]] and the [[Philippines]].  He was a champion fencer and boxer, an amateur [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], and a student of the [[Arabic language]]; science-fiction author [[Jack Williamson]], in his 1984 autobiography ''Wonder's Child'', called E. Hoffmann Price a "real live soldier of fortune".<ref name="A" />

In his literary career, Hoffmann Price produced fiction for a wide range of publications, from ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' to ''[[Terror Tales]]'', from ''Speed Detective'' to ''Spicy Mystery Stories.'' Yet he was most readily identified as a ''[[Weird Tales]]'' writer, one of the group who wrote regularly for editor [[Farnsworth Wright]], a group that included Lovecraft, [[Robert E. Howard]], and [[Clark Ashton Smith]]. Price published 24 solo stories in ''Weird Tales'' between 1925 and 1950, plus three collaborations with [[Otis Adelbert Kline]], and his works with Lovecraft, noted above.

His first sale was to ''Droll Stories'' in 1924, followed almost immediately by the first of scores of acceptances by ''Weird Tales'', "The Rajah's Gift" (Jan 1925).<ref name="A" />

Some of Price's stories aroused controversy; "The Stranger from Kurdistan" (1925), a story which featured a dialogue between a certain personage and [[Satan]], was criticised by some readers as blasphemous but proved popular with ''Weird Tales'' readers. (Lovecraft professed to find it especially powerful). "The Infidel's Daughter" (1927), a [[satire]] on the [[Ku Klux Klan]], also angered some Southern readers, but Wright defended the story.<ref>See ''The Weird Tales Story'', by Robert Weinberg, 1977.</ref>

Price worked in a range of popular genres—including science fiction, horror, crime, and fantasy—but he was best known for adventure stories with Oriental settings and atmosphere. Price also contributed to Farnsworth Wright's short-lived magazine ''[[Oriental Stories|The Magic Carpet]]'' (1930–34), along with Kline, Howard, Smith, and other ''Weird Tales'' regulars. For ''Spicy Western Stories'', Price wrote a series about a libidinous cowboy, Simon Bolivar Grimes.<ref name="A" /> For ''Clues Detective Stories'', Price created a series centering on Pâwang Ali, a Malaysian detective in Singapore.<ref name="A" />

Like many other pulp-fiction writers, Price could not support himself and his family on his income from literature. Living in [[New Orleans]] in the 1930s, he worked for a time for the [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide Corporation]]. Nonetheless he managed to travel widely and maintain friendships with many other pulp writers, including Kline and [[Edmond Hamilton]]. On a trip to Texas in the mid-1930s, Price was the only pulp writer to meet [[Robert E. Howard]] face to face. He was also the only man known to have met Howard and also [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Clark Ashton Smith]] (the great 'Triumvirate' of ''Weird Tales'' writers) in person. Over the course of his long life, Price made reminiscences of many significant figures in pulp fiction, Howard, Lovecraft, and Hamilton among them.

Late in life, Price experienced a major literary resurgence. In the 1970s and '80s he issued a series of SF, fantasy, and adventure novels, published in paperback; ''[[The Devil Wives of Li Fong]]'' (1979) is one noteworthy example. He also had published two collections of his pulp stories during his lifetime--''[[Strange Gateways]]'' and ''[[Far Lands, Other Days]]''. During this period, Price corresponded frequently with the novelist and poet [[Richard L. Tierney]].

Price was one of the first speakers at San Francisco's [[Maltese Falcon Society]] in 1981.

He received the [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement|World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |access-date=4 Feb 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archive-date=2010-12-01 }}</ref> A collection of his literary memoirs, ''Book of the Dead: Friends of Yesteryear, Fictioneers & Others'', was published posthumously in 2001. His writing friends and colleagues included [[Richard L. Tierney]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[August Derleth]], [[Jack Williamson]], [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Seabury Quinn]], [[Otis Adelbert Kline]], [[Ralph Milne Farley]], [[Robert Spencer Carr]], and [[Farnsworth Wright]] among others.

Price was a [[Buddhist]] and a supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>"Price, E(dgar) Hoffmann", in  ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy ''by [[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]].</ref>

He died at [[Redwood City, California]], in 1988.

==H. P. Lovecraft==
[[File:H. P. Lovecraft in DeLand Florida, June 1934.png|thumb|upright|alt=H. P. Lovecraft in June 1934, facing left|[[H. P. Lovecraft]] in June 1934]]
When Lovecraft visited New Orleans in June 1932, Howard telegraphed Price to alert him to the visitor's presence, and the two writers spent much of the following week together. A disproven myth claims that Price took Lovecraft to a New Orleans brothel, where Lovecraft was amused to find that several of the employees there were fans of his work; the same apocryphal story was originally told about [[Seabury Quinn]] sometime earlier.<ref>Joshi and Schultz, p. 212.</ref>

The meeting of Price and Lovecraft began a correspondence that continued until Lovecraft's death. They even proposed at one time forming a writing team whose output would, "conservatively estimated, run to a million words a month", in Lovecraft's whimsical prediction. They planned to use the pseudonym "Etienne Marmaduke de Marigny" for their collaboration; a similar name was used for a character in "Through the Gates of the Silver Key", the only collaboration of Price and Lovecraft to transpire.<ref>Carter, pp. 94-95.</ref> Another collaboration between Lovecraft  and Hoffmann Price is the short tale "Tarbis of the Lake".

That story had its origins in Price's enthusiasm for an earlier Lovecraft tale. "One of my favorite HPL stories was, and still is, '[[The Silver Key]]'," Price wrote in a 1944 memoir. "In telling him of the pleasure I had had in rereading it, I suggested a sequel to account for [[protagonist]] [[Randolph Carter]]'s doings after his disappearance."<ref>E. Hoffman Price, ''The Acolyte'', 1944; cited in Carter, p. 93.</ref> After convincing an apparently reluctant Lovecraft to collaborate on such a sequel, Price wrote a 6,000-word draft in August 1932; in April 1933, Lovecraft produced a 14,000-word version that left unchanged, by Price's estimate, "fewer than fifty of my original words,"<ref>Carter, p. 93.</ref> though ''[[An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia]]'' reports that Lovecraft "kept as many of Price's conceptions as possible, as well as some of his language."<ref name="Joshi and Schultz, p. 213">Joshi and Schultz, p. 213.</ref>

In any case, Price was pleased with the result, writing that Lovecraft "was right of course in discarding all but the basic outline. I could only marvel that he had made so much of my inadequate and bungling start."<ref>Carter, p. 94.</ref> The story appeared under both authors' bylines in the July 1934 issue of ''Weird Tales''; Price's draft was published as "The Lord of Illusion" in ''[[Crypt of Cthulhu]]'' No. 10 in 1982.

Price visited Lovecraft in Providence in the summer of 1933. When he and a mutual friend showed up at Lovecraft's house with a six-pack of beer, the teetotaling Lovecraft is said to have remarked, "And what are you going to do with so ''much'' of it?"<ref name="Joshi and Schultz, p. 213"/>
