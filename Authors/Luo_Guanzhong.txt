'''Luo Ben''' (c. 1330–1400,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9048659/Luo-Guanzhong Luo Guanzhong. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']</ref> or c.1280–1360<ref name="Chen 2007">{{Cite journal|title = Two Luo Guanzhong|last = Chen|first = Liao|date = 2007|journal = Jiangsu Social Sciences,N.004，P179-182}}</ref>), better known by his [[courtesy name]] '''Guanzhong''' (<small>Mandarin pronunciation:&nbsp;</small>{{IPAc-cmn|l|uo|-|g|uan|zh|ong}}), was a Chinese writer who lived during the [[Ming dynasty]]. He was also known by his pseudonym '''Huhai Sanren''' ({{zh|t=湖海散人|s=湖海散人|p=Húhǎi Sǎnrén|l=Leisure Man of Lakes and Seas}}).<ref>Luo Guanzhong (2000). ''Sanguo yanyi: Three Kingdoms'', 三國演義 [Romance of the Three Kingdoms]. Translated by Moss Roberts. Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, P31.</ref>  Luo was attributed with writing ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]].

==Identity==
The location and date of Luo's birth are controversial. One possibility{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} was that he was from [[Taiyuan]], and lived in the late [[Yuan dynasty]] and early [[Ming dynasty]] by the record of  his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), who said that he had met him in 1364{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Another possibility was that he was born in [[Dongping County|Dongyuan]], the province of  [[Shandong]], in about 1280 – 1360.<ref name="Chen 2007"/> Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including [[Hangzhou]] and [[Jiangnan]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

According to Meng Fanren{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} (孟繁仁), Luo can be identified in the pedigree of the Luo family, and Taiyuan is most likely his hometown. But, his name is not in this pedigree, and some people believe that pedigree of the Luo Family can't prove that [[Bilal Ibn Rabah|Luo]] is the author of Three Kingdoms.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Discuss the pedigree of the Luo family|last1 = Jiao|first1 = Tai|last2 = Guo|first2 = Weizhong}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = That Luo is not the author of Three Kingdoms|last = Chen|first = Liao|date = 2000|journal = Forum on Chinese Culture}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = The case of wrong research about the author of "three kingdoms|last = Du|first = Guichen|date = 2002|journal = Journal of Peking University,N.2}}</ref> Some people doubt that If Luo came from Taiyuan, why he had intimate knowledge of people life in Shandong, and he had taken all his time and energy to write about them, and not about people in Taiyuan. Some people believe that the source of Taiyuan statement, which was written by Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), is most likely wrong  in handwritten copy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Luo Guanzhong who had written "Three Kingdoms" came from DongPing|last = Du|first = Guichen|date = 2002|journal = Academic Forum of Nandu, N.6}}</ref> According to recent research, there were two people named Luo Guanzhong during this time (陈辽，Chen Liao<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Two Luo Guanzhong|last = Chen|first = Liao|date = 2007|journal = Jiangsu Social Sciences,N.004，P179-182}}</ref>): one was a drama artist who came from Taiyuan, and the other was the author of the novel who came from Dongping.

Recent research has suggested that his date of birth was between 1315–1318.<ref name="roberts938">Ouyang Jian, referenced in Roberts 1991, pg. 938</ref> But other sources state it was nearer to 1330.{{which|date=December 2016}}

==Works==
The stories forming the bulk of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' and ''Water Margin'' are thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} to have been developed by many independent storytellers. [[Shi Nai'an]] is thought<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ge|first=Liangyan|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr0tj|title=Out of the Margins: The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction|date=2001|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2370-2}}</ref> to be the first to assemble ''Water Margin'' into a unified work, and Luo subsequently brought it to the current form of 100 chapters. Luo is usually considered{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} the author of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.

''[[The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt]]'' (平妖傳) is a [[shenmo|shenmo fantasy]] story attributed{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} to Luo with 20 chapters, developed from the original pieces of storytelling based on a rebellion at the end of the [[Northern Song]], and later expanded by [[Feng Menglong]] (馮夢龍){{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} into 40 chapters. ''Can Tang Wudai Shi Yanzhuan'' (殘唐五代史演義傳) is a chronicle of the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] and the following [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], a compilation of storytelling pieces based on the rebellion of [[Zhu Wen]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.
