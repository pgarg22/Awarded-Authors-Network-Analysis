'''Edith Mary Pargeter''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OBE|BEM}} (28 September 1913 – 14 October 1995),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/16/obituaries/edith-pargeter-82-author-of-mysteries.html|page=B7|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Edith Pargeter, 82; Author of Mysteries|date=October 16, 1995}}</ref> also known by her ''[[Pen name|nom de plume]]'' '''Ellis Peters''', was an English author of works in many categories, especially [[history]] and [[historical fiction]], and was also honoured for her translations of [[Czech literature|Czech]] classics. She is probably best known for her murder mysteries, both historical and modern, and especially for her medieval detective series [[The Cadfael Chronicles]].

==Personal==
Pargeter was born in the village of [[Horsehay]] ([[Shropshire]], England). Her father was a clerk at a local ironworks. She was educated at [[Dawley]] Church of England School and the old [[Coalbrookdale]] High School for Girls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/99473.Edith_Pargeter |title=Edith Pargeter, author |publisher=Goodreads |access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref> She had Welsh ancestry, and many of her short stories and books (both fiction and non-fiction) are set in Wales and its borderlands, or have Welsh protagonists.

During [[World War II]], she worked in an administrative role in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (the "Wrens") and had reached the rank of [[petty officer]] by 1 January 1944 when she was awarded the [[British Empire Medal]] (BEM) in the [[New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36309 |supp=y|page=28|date=31 December 1943}}</ref>

In 1947 Pargeter visited [[Czechoslovakia]] and became fascinated by the Czech language and culture. She became fluent in Czech and published award-winning translations of Czech poetry and prose into English.<ref name=BBC2008>{{cite web |title=In Profile: Edith Pargeter |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2008/07/08/edith_pargeter_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC - Shropshire |date=July 2008 |access-date=5 December 2013}}</ref>

==Writing career==
She devoted the rest of her life to writing, both nonfiction and well-researched fiction. She never attended university but became a self-taught scholar in areas that interested her, especially Shropshire and Wales. [[Birmingham University]] gave her an honorary master's degree. She never married, but did fall in love with a Czech man. She remained friends with him after he married another woman.<ref name=Biederman>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-18/news/we-12381_1_medieval-mysteries |title=A Woman of Mystery : Fans Sleuth Out the English Creator of Tales of a Medieval Monk |author=Biederman, Patricia Ward |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=18 March 1993 |access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> She was pleased that she could support herself with her writing from the time after the Second World War until her death.<ref name=Biederman />

Pargeter wrote under a number of [[pseudonym]]s; it was under the name Ellis Peters that she wrote her later crime stories, especially the highly popular series of [[Cadfael|Brother Cadfael]] [[historical mystery|medieval mysteries]], featuring a Benedictine monk at the Abbey in Shrewsbury. That pseudonym was drawn from the name of her brother, Ellis, and a version of the name of the daughter of friends, Petra.<ref name=Biederman /> Many of the novels were made into films for television. Although she won her first award for a novel written in 1963, her greatest fame and sales came with the ''Cadfael Chronicles'', which began in 1977. At the time of the 19th in the series of 20 novels, sales exceeded 6.5 million.<ref name=Biederman /> The ''Cadfael Chronicles'' drew international attention to Shrewsbury and its history, and greatly increased tourism to the town. In an interview in 1993, she mentioned her own work before the Second World War as a chemist's assistant, where they prepared many of the compounds they sold. "We used to make bottled medicine that we compounded specially, with ingredients like gentian, rosemary, horehound. You never see that nowadays; those tinctures are never prescribed. They often had bitters of some sort in them, a taste I rather liked. Some of Cadfael’s prescriptions come out of those years."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.motherearthliving.com/mother-earth-living/mystery-in-the-garden.aspx |title=Mystery in the Garden: Interview with Ellis Peters |author=Cranch, Robbie |journal=Mother Earth Living |date=January 1993 |access-date=18 May 2016 |location=Topeka, Kansas}}</ref>

Her Cadfael novels show great appreciation for the ideals of medieval Catholic Christianity, but also a recognition of its weaknesses, such as quarrels over the finer points of theology (''[[The Heretic's Apprentice]]''), and the desire of the church to own more and more land and wealth (''[[Monk's Hood]]'', ''[[Saint Peter's Fair]]'', ''[[The Rose Rent]]'').

==Death==
She died at her home in [[Madeley, Shropshire]], in 1995 at the age of 82, having recently returned home from hospital following a stroke. On 14 September 1997, a new stained glass window depicting St Benedict was installed in [[Shrewsbury Abbey]] and was dedicated to the memory of Edith Pargeter, with funds raised by donations from admirers of the author.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitshrewsbury.com/shrewsbury-famous-people.php |title=Visit Shrewsbury |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063807/http://www.visitshrewsbury.com/shrewsbury-famous-people.php |archive-date=9 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.originalshrewsbury.co.uk/visit/shrewsbury-abbey |title=Shrewsbury Abbey |access-date=18 May 2016 |publisher=Shrewsbury, the original one-off}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-literator-inside-publishing-5559824.html |title=The Literator: INSIDE PUBLISHING |date=6 July 1997 |access-date=18 May 2016 |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

==Recognition==
The [[Mystery Writers of America]] gave Pargeter their [[Edgar Award]] in 1963 for ''Death and the Joyful Woman''. In 1980, the [[Crime Writers Association|British Crime Writers Association]] awarded her the [[Gold Dagger|Silver Dagger]] for ''[[Monk's Hood]]''. In 1993 she won the [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]], an annual award given by the CWA to authors who have made an outstanding lifetime's contribution to the field of crime and mystery writing. Pargeter was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) "for services to Literature" in the 1994 New Year Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=53527|page=13|date=30 December 1993}}</ref> To commemorate Pargeter's life and work, in 1999 the CWA established their [[Ellis Peters Historical Dagger]] award (later called the Ellis Peters Historical Award) for the best historical crime novel of the year.<ref name="CWA Dagger Main">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecwa.co.uk/daggers/index.html |title=The CWA Dagger Awards |website=theCWA.co.uk |access-date=18 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723043537/http://www.thecwa.co.uk/daggers/index.html |archive-date=23 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="Hist Dagger Main">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecwa.co.uk/daggers/historical.html |title=The CWA Ellis Peters Historical Dagger |website=theCWA.co.uk |access-date=17 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107114654/http://www.thecwa.co.uk/daggers/historical.html |archive-date=7 November 2013}}</ref>

Pargeter's ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles|Cadfael Chronicles]]'' are often credited for popularizing what would later become known as the historical mystery.<ref name="PW Picker 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/43024-mysteries-of-history.html|title=Mysteries of History |first=Lenny |last=Picker |date=3 March 2010 |access-date=13 November 2013 |website=PublishersWeekly.com }}</ref><ref name="WSJ 2010">{{cite web |url=http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474?mobile=y |title=Five Best Historical Mystery Novels |first=David B. |last=Rivkin Jr. |date=27 February 2010 |access-date=17 November 2013 |website=WSJ.com |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204114320/http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474?mobile=y |archive-date=4 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
