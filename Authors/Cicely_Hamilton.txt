'''Cicely Mary Hamilton''' (née '''Hammill'''; 15 June 1872 – 6 December 1952), was an English actress, writer, journalist, [[suffragist]] and [[feminist]], part of the struggle for [[women's suffrage in the United Kingdom]]. She is now best known for the [[feminist theatre|feminist play]] ''How the Vote was Won'', which sees a male anti-suffragist change his mind when the women in his life go on strike.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3346832?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Ff5%3Dall%26amp%3Bc4%3DAND%26amp%3Bq4%3D%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bc6%3DAND%26amp%3Bbk%3Don%26amp%3Bf2%3Dall%26amp%3Bc1%3DAND%26amp%3Bla%3D%26amp%3Bf0%3Dall%26amp%3Bms%3Don%26amp%3Bq5%3D%26amp%3Bc3%3DAND%26amp%3Bq3%3D%26amp%3Bpm%3Don%26amp%3Bc5%3DAND%26amp%3Bq6%3D%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bisbn%3D%26amp%3Bf3%3Dall%26amp%3Bq2%3D%26amp%3Bsd%3D%26amp%3Bf4%3Dall%26amp%3Bq0%3Dhow%2Bthe%2Bvote%2Bwas%2Bwon%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bar%3Don%26amp%3Bpt%3D%26amp%3Bed%3D%26amp%3Bc2%3DAND%26amp%3Bf6%3Dall%26amp%3Bq1%3Dcicely%2Bhamilton%26amp%3Bf1%3Dall&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Cicely Hamilton, Independent Feminist"], ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Vol 11'' No. 2/3 1990</ref><ref name="ls">Lisa Shariari, "Hamilton, Cicely" in Faye Hammill, Ashlie Sponenberg and Esme Miskimmin (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of British Women's Writing, 1900-1950''.

==Biography==
Born in 1872, Cicely Hammill in [[Paddington]], London, she was the eldest of the four children of Maude Mary and Denzil Hammil. She was educated in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]] and in [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=38633 |last1=Joannou |first1=Maroula |title=Hamilton [''née'' Hammill], (Mary) Cicely (1872–1952), writer and campaigner for women's rights  |url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38633 |accessdate=12 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Hammill was raised by foster parents because her mother had gone missing.<ref name="ls" /> After a short spell in teaching she acted in a touring company. She took the pseudonym "Cicely Hamilton" out of consideration for her family. Then she wrote drama, including feminist themes, and enjoyed a period of success in the commercial theatre. Hamilton was praised for her acting in a performance of ''[[Fanny's First Play]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref name="ls" />

In 1908 she and [[Bessie Hatton]] founded the [[Women Writers' Suffrage League]]. This grew to around 400 members, including [[Ivy Compton-Burnett]], [[Sarah Grand]], [[Violet Hunt]], [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]], [[Alice Meynell]], [[Olive Schreiner]], [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]], [[May Sinclair]] and [[Margaret L. Woods]]. It produced campaigning literature, written by Sinclair amongst others, and recruited many prominent male supporters.

Hamilton supplied the lyrics of "[[The March of the Women]]", the song which [[Ethel Smyth]] composed in 1910 for the [[Women's Social and Political Union]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bennett|first=Jory|editor=Crichton, Ronald|title=The Memoirs of Ethel Smyth: Abridged and Introduced by Ronald Crichton, with a list of works by Jory Bennett|publisher=Viking|location=Harmondsworth|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofethelsm00smyt/page/378 378]|isbn=0-670-80655-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofethelsm00smyt/page/378}}</ref> was first performed at an 'At Home' in Suffolk Street Galleries, [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] to celebrate the release of women violently arrested on [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]]; it had suitably stirring lyrics for such an occasion:

Shout, shout up with your song! 
Cry with the wind for the dawn is breaking.
March, march swing you along, 
Wide blows our banner and hope is waking,
Sing with its story, dreams with their glory,
Lo! They call and glad is their word!
Forward! Hark how it swells
Thunder and freedom, the voice of the Lord!<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|title=Rise up, women! : the remarkable lives of the suffragettes|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2018|isbn=978-1-4088-4404-5|location=London|pages=245, 540|oclc=1016848621}}</ref></poem>}}

In the days before radio, one effective way to get a message out into society and to have it discussed was to produce short plays that could be performed around the country, and so [[suffrage drama]] was born. [[Elizabeth Robins]]'s ''Votes for Women'' and Cicely Hamilton and [[Christabel Marshall|Christopher St. John]]'s ''How the Vote Was Won'' are two predominant examples of the genre.<ref name="MaroulaJoannou">Maroula Joannou & [[June Purvis]], The Women's Suffrage Movement: New Feminist Perspectives (Manchester University Press, 1998), 127</ref> Hamilton also wrote ''A Pageant of Great Women'', a highly successful women's suffrage play based on the ideas of her friend, the theatre director [[Edith Craig]].  Hamilton played Woman while Craig played the painter [[Rosa Bonheur]], one of the 50 or so great women in the play.<ref name=Craig/> [[Lena Connell]]'s photographs of the leading players were sold to assist the suffrage cause and Connell exhibited the pictures at the Royal Photographic Society in 1910/11.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMTiDQAAQBAJ&q=Lena+Connell+1949&pg=PT121|title=Edith Craig and the Theatres of Art|last=Cockin|first=Katharine|date=2017-01-26|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-7063-5|language=en}}</ref> The play was produced all over the UK from 1909 until the [[First World War]].<ref name=Craig>Cockin, Katharine. ''Edith Craig (1869–1947): Dramatic Lives'', Cassell (1998).</ref> Hamilton was a member of Craig's theatre society, the Pioneer Players.  Her play ''Jack and Jill and a Friend'' was one of the three plays in the Pioneer Players' first production in May 1911.<ref name=Pioneer>Cockin, Katharine. ''Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players 1911–25'', Palgrave (2001)</ref> Hamilton inspired young schoolgirls, supportive of suffrage, like Winifred Starbuck, who had Hamilton and other leaders pictures on her desk in purple white and green frames and later herself protested in school disorder such as graffiti and hiding the school registers and handbell, a milder form of resistance to authority for women's suffrage.<ref name=":0" />

During World War I Hamilton initially worked in the organisation of nursing care, with the Scottish women's ambulance service near [[Paris]],<ref name=":0" /> and then joined the army as an auxiliary.<ref name="ls" /> Later she formed a [[repertory company]] to entertain the troops.  After the war, she wrote as a freelance journalist, particularly on [[birth control]], and was a press officer for the [[Geneva]] International Suffrage Conference<ref name=":0" /> and as a playwright for the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Birmingham Repertory Company]].<ref name="ls" /> When [[Lena Ashwell Players]] Ltd was formed in 1923, Hamilton was one of the directors. The other three were [[Lena Ashwell]], [[Esme Church]] and [[Marion Fawcett]]. Those three were the company's theatre managers.<ref name=herbook>{{Cite book|last=Leask|first=Margaret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7DIAwAAQBAJ&q=lena+ashwell+Fawcett%2C+Marion&pg=PA1914-IA90|title=Lena Ashwell: Actress, Patriot, Pioneer|date=2012|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|page=1914|isbn=978-1-907396-64-9|language=en}}</ref>

Hamilton was a regular contributor to ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Time]]'' magazine, and an active member of the feminist [[Six Point Group]], campaigning for the rights of children, widows and unmarried mothers; equal guardianship of children, and equal pay in teaching and civil service.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="ls" /><ref>Anne Logan, ''Feminism and criminal justice : a historical perspective''.

She was a friend of [[E. M. Delafield]] and is thought to be the model for "Emma Hay" in Delafield's ''Provincial Lady'' books.<ref>[http://www.starcourse.org/emd/emdwho.htm EM Delafield web page]</ref>

Hamilton's autobiography ''Life Errant'' was published in 1935. She died in Chelsea in 1952.<ref name=":0" />

In July 2017, the [[Finborough Theatre]] staged the first London production of Hamilton's play 'Just to Get Married' in over 100 years.
