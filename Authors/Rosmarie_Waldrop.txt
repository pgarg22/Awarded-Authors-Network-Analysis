'''Rosmarie Waldrop''' (born '''Rosmarie Sebald'''; August 24, 1935) is an [[United States poetry|American poet]], [[novelist]], [[translator]], [[essay]]ist and [[Publishing|publisher]]. Born in [[Germany]], she has lived in the [[United States]] since 1958 and has settled in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] since the late 1960s. Waldrop is a co-editor and publisher of [[Burning Deck Press]].

==Early life in Germany==
Waldrop was born in [[Kitzingen]] am Main on August 24, 1935. Her father, Joseph Sebald, taught physical education at the town's high school.<ref>Steve Evans, "[http://thirdfactory.net/archive_waldrop.html Rosmarie Waldrop]," ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' v.169 (1996).</ref> Towards the end of the [[Second World War]], she joined a travelling theatre, but returned to school in early 1946. At school, she studied piano and flute and played in a youth orchestra. During Christmas in 1954, the orchestra gave a concert for American soldiers stationed at Kitzingen. After the performance, [[Keith Waldrop]], a member of the audience, invited members of the orchestra to listen to his records. He and Rosmarie became friendly and worked together over the next few months, translating [[German poetry]] into [[English language|English]].

==University years==
That same year, she entered the [[University of Würzburg]], where she studied [[literature]], [[art history]] and [[musicology]]. In 1955, she transferred to the [[University of Freiburg]], where she discovered the writings of [[Robert Musil]] and participated in a protest against a lecture given by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]. She then moved to the [[University of Aix-Marseille]], where Keith spent 1956–57 on his [[GI Bill]]. At the end of the year, he returned to the [[University of Michigan]]. In 1958, he won a [[Hopwood Award|Major Hopwood Prize]], sending most of the money to Rosmarie to pay for her passage to the United States.

==In the United States==
The couple married and Rosmarie enrolled at the University of Michigan, where she received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1966. She also became active in literary, musical and artistic circles around the university and the wider [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] community. She began serious translation of [[French poetry|French]] and [[German poetry]]. In [[1961 in poetry|1961]], the Waldrops bought a second-hand printing press and started ''Burning Deck Magazine''. This was the beginning of Burning Deck, which was to become one of the most influential small press publishers of innovative poetry in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} As such, she is sometimes closely associated with the [[Language poets]].{{By whom|date=May 2021}}

==Poetry and translations==
Rosmarie Waldrop started publishing her own poetry in English in the late 1960s. Since then, she has published over three dozen books of poetry, prose and translation. Today her work is variously characterized as verse experiment, philosophical statement and personal narrative.{{By whom|date=May 2021}} Of the many formative influences on her mature style, a crucial influence was a year spent in [[Paris]] in the early 1970s, where she came into contact with leading ''avant garde'' French poets, including [[Claude Royet-Journoud]], [[Anne-Marie Albiach]], and [[Edmond Jabès]]. These writers influenced her own work,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ukQrAQAAIAAJ|title=Talisman|date=1990|publisher=Talisman|language=en}}</ref> while at the same time she and Keith became some of the main translators of their work into English, with Burning Deck one of the main vehicles for introducing their work to an English-language readership.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Awards and honors==
Rosmarie Waldrop has given readings and published in many parts of Europe as well as the United States. She has received numerous awards and fellowships and was made a [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government. In 2003 she was awarded a grant from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]]' Grants to Artists Award. She was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2006. She received the 2008 [[PEN Award for Poetry in Translation]] for her translation of [[Ulf Stolterfoht]]'s book ''Lingos I - IX''. Her translation of ''Almost 1 Book / Almost 1 Life'' by [[Elfriede Czurda]] was nominated for the [[Best Translated Book Award]] in 2013. She was given the [[America Award in Literature]] for a lifetime contribution to international writing in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=6832 |title=2013 Best Translated Book Award: The Poetry Finalists |work=Three Percent |author=Chad W.
