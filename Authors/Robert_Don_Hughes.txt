'''Dr. Robert Don Hughes''' (born 1949), is an American [[educator]], writer, and pastor. He has authored mainstream [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] and evangelical [[non-fiction]].

==Education==
Hughes received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[California Baptist College]], his [[Master of Divinity|M.Div.]] from [[Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], also studying at the [[University of Redlands]].

==Educational career==
Hughes was formerly employed at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], as associate vice president for external programs and associate professor of communication and mass media. Later he was a professor of missions and evangelism at [[Clear Creek Baptist Bible College]]. He retired from Pastoral ministry in 2019. His last pastorate was East Jellico Missionary Baptist Church in Pineville, Ky. He has also worked as a [[missionary]] in [[Africa]].

==Literary works==
Hughes' fiction tends to deal seriously with religious themes, particularly in ''[[The Fallen: A Novel|The Fallen]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Eternity Gene]]''. Of his non-fiction, ''[[Satan's Whispers]]'' has the distinction of having been adopted for use by the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]].

Hughes' most extended body of work consists of his two fantasy sequences about a magical country split into three states by a two-headed dragon's occupation of the mountain pass linking each region with the others. As a result, the magical potential of each region has developed differently. The "Pelmen the Powershaper" trilogy tells of the end of the dragon's reign and its consequences; The unfinished "Wizard and Dragon" sequence, also projected as a trilogy, is set earlier in the country's history and deals with how the dragon was originally created.

Hughes' powerfully imagined dragon Vicia-Heinox with its two bickering heads has set a pattern for the portrayal of similar creatures in other media, including the animated film ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' (1998) and the [[public television]] children's program ''[[Dragon Tales]]'' (1999-2005).
