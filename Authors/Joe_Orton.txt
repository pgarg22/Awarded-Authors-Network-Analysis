'''John Kingsley Orton''' (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967), known under the [[pen name]] of '''Joe Orton''', was an English playwright, author and diarist. His public career, from 1964 until his death in 1967, was short but highly influential.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mocalondon.co.uk/uploads/1/0/1/4/101463086/what_the_artist_saw_ebook_2017_mocalondon.pdf|title=What the Artist Saw|author=Parker, Emma|date=15 January 2017|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/people/joe-orton|title=Joe Orton|website=The British Library|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite ODNB|title=Orton, John Kingsley [Joe] (1933–1967), playwright {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35334|isbn=9780198614128}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-40511985|title=The subversive genius of Joe Orton|author=Barnes, Liam|date=9 August 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://le.ac.uk/news/2017/september/leicester-playwright-joe-orton-lives-on-in-hollywood|title=Alec Baldwin learned from Joe Orton for awardwinning performance|date=18 September 2017|website=le.ac.uk|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> During this brief period he shocked, outraged and amused audiences with his scandalous [[black comedy|black comedies]].

==Early life==
Orton was born on 1 January 1933 at Causeway Lane Maternity Hospital, [[Leicester]], to William Arthur Orton and Elsie Mary Orton (née Bentley). William worked for Leicester County Borough Council as a gardener and Elsie worked in the local footwear industry until [[tuberculosis]] cost her a lung. At the time of Joe's birth William and Mary were living with William's family at 261 Avenue Road Extension in [[Clarendon Park, Leicester]]. The same year that Joe's younger brother Douglas was born, 1935, the Ortons moved to 9 Fayrhurst Road on the Saffron Lane Estate, a [[council estate]]. Orton's younger sisters Marilyn and Leonie were born in 1939 and 1944 respectively.<ref>''I Had It In Me'', Leonie Orton (Barnett), 2016, Leicester: Quirky Press, pp. 11-16.</ref>

Orton attended Marriot Road Primary School, but failed the [[eleven-plus]] exam after extended bouts of [[asthma]], and so took a secretarial course at Clark's College in Leicester from 1945 to 1947.<ref>''Stage and Screen Lives'', 9, Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 249.</ref> He began working as a junior clerk for £3 a week.

Orton became interested in performing in theatre around 1949 and joined a number of dramatic societies, including the Leicester Dramatic Society. While working on amateur productions he was determined to improve his appearance and physique, buying bodybuilding courses, taking [[elocution]] lessons. He was accepted for a scholarship at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in November 1950, and he left the [[East Midlands]] for London. His entrance into RADA was delayed until May 1951 by [[appendicitis]].

Orton met [[Kenneth Halliwell]] at RADA in 1951 and moved into a [[West Hampstead]] flat with him and two other students in June of that year. Halliwell was seven years older than Orton; they quickly formed a strong relationship and became lovers.

After graduating, both Orton and Halliwell went into regional repertory work: Orton spent four months in [[Ipswich]] as an assistant stage manager; Halliwell in [[Llandudno]], [[Wales]]. Both returned to London and began to write together. They collaborated on a number of unpublished novels (often imitating [[Ronald Firbank]]) with no success at gaining publication. The rejection of their great hope, ''The Last Days of Sodom,'' in 1957 led them to solo works.<ref>John Lahr, ''Prick Up Your Ears'', 1980 Penguin Books edition, Chapter 3, 'Unnatural Practices', pp. 129-132</ref> Orton wrote his last novel, ''The Vision of Gombold Proval'' (posthumously published as ''Head to Toe''), in 1959. He later drew on these manuscripts for ideas; many show glimpses of his stage-play style.

Confident of their "specialness," Orton and Halliwell refused to work for long periods. They subsisted on Halliwell's money (and unemployment benefits) and were forced to follow an ascetic life to restrict their spending to £5 a week. From 1957 to 1959, they worked in six-month stretches at [[Cadbury's]] to raise money for a new flat; they moved into a small, austere flat at 25 Noel Road in [[Islington]] in 1959.

==Crimes and punishment==
A lack of serious work led them to amuse themselves with pranks and hoaxes. Orton created the [[alter ego|second self]] Edna Welthorpe, an elderly theatre snob, whom he later revived to stir controversy over his plays. Orton chose the name as an allusion to [[Terence Rattigan]]'s archetypal playgoer Aunt Edna.

From January 1959, Orton and Halliwell began surreptitiously to remove books from several local public libraries and modify the [[cover art]] or the [[blurb]]s before returning them. A volume of poems by [[John Betjeman]] was returned to the library with a new dust jacket featuring a photograph of a nearly naked, heavily tattooed, middle-aged man.<ref>Philip Hoare, [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/30/halliwell-orton-art-collage-library-books "Kenneth Halliwell: lover, killer… artist?"], ''The Guardian'', 30 September 2013.</ref> The couple decorated their flat with many of the prints. They were discovered and prosecuted in May 1962. They were found guilty on five counts of theft and malicious damage, admitted damaging more than 70 books, and were sentenced to prison for six months (released September 1962) and fined £262. The incident was reported in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' as "Gorilla in the Roses", illustrated with the altered ''Collins Guide to Roses'' by [[Bertram Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joe Orton Life and Work|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Life11.html|access-date=2020-10-12|website=www.joeorton.org}}</ref>

Orton and Halliwell felt the sentence was unduly harsh "because we were queers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Life12.html |title=Life and Work: 'Because We were Queers': 1 OF 2|publisher=Joe Orton Online |date=28 April 1962 |access-date=30 March 2012}}</ref> Prison was a crucial formative experience; the isolation from Halliwell allowed Orton to break free of him creatively; and he saw what he considered the corruption, priggishness, and double standards of a purportedly liberal country. As Orton put it: "It affected my attitude towards society. Before I had been vaguely conscious of something rotten somewhere, prison crystallised this. The old whore society really lifted up her skirts and the stench was pretty foul.... Being in the nick brought detachment to my writing. I wasn't involved any more. And suddenly it worked."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Life13.html |title= Life and Work: 'Because We were Queers': 2 OF 2|publisher=Joe Orton Online |access-date=30 March 2012}}</ref> The book covers Orton and Halliwell vandalised have since become a valued part of the [[Islington Local History Centre]] collection. Some are exhibited in the [[Islington Museum]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Library books stolen by Joe Orton go on display|work=Evening Standard|date=12 May 2008|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/library-books-stolen-by-joe-orton-go-on-display-6680945.html}}<!-- "Evening Standard" did not acquire "London..." suffix until 2009. --></ref>

==Playwright==

===Breakthrough===
Orton began writing plays in 1959 with ''Fred and Madge''; ''[[The Visitors (play)|The Visitors]]'' followed two years later. In 1963, the BBC paid £65 for the radio play ''[[The Ruffian on the Stair]]'', broadcast on 31 August 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2007/04/12/ruffian_on_the_stair_event_feature.shtml|title=The Ruffian on the Stair|last=BBC}}</ref> It was substantially rewritten for the stage in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Plays2.html|title=Joe Orton Life and Work|website=www.joeorton.org}}</ref>

He had completed ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]'' by the time ''Ruffian'' was broadcast. He sent a copy to theatre agent [[Peggy Ramsay]] in December 1963. It premiered at the [[New Arts Theatre]] in Westminster 6 May 1964, produced by [[Michael Codron]]. Reviews ranged from praise to outrage. ''[[The Times]]'' described it as making "the blood boil more than any other British play in the last 10 years".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-40511985|title=The subversive genius of Joe Orton|first=Liam|last=Barnes|work=BBC News|date=9 August 2017}}</ref>

''Entertaining Mr Sloane'' lost money in its three-week run, but critical praise from playwright [[Terence Rattigan]], who invested £3,000 in it, ensured its survival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/it-was-35-years-ago-today-nihilism-with-a-smile-1092376.html|title=It was 35 years ago today: Nihilism with a smile|website=[[Independent.co.uk]]|date=9 May 1999}}</ref> The play was transferred to [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] at the end of June and to the [[Sondheim Theatre|Queen's Theatre]] in October.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIZiBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA161 |title=Murder and Mayhem in North London|first=Geoffrey|last=Howse|date=19 May 2010|publisher=Wharncliffe|via=Google Books|isbn=9781783374892}}</ref> ''Sloane'' tied for first in the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' Critics' Poll for Best New Play and Orton came second for Most Promising Playwright. Within a year, ''Sloane'' was performed in New York, Spain, Israel, and Australia as well as made into [[Entertaining Mr Sloane (film)|a film]] (after Orton's death) and a television play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1335133/|title=BFI Screenonline: Entertaining Mr Sloane (1970)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/444034/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Entertaining Mr Sloane (1968)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}</ref>

===''Loot''===
Orton's next performed work was [[Loot (play)|''Loot'']]. The first draft was written from June to October 1964 and was called ''Funeral Games'', a title Orton dropped at Halliwell's suggestion but later reused. The play is a wild [[parody]] of [[detective fiction]], adding the [[black comedy|blackest]] [[farce]] and jabs at established ideas on death, the police, religion, and justice. Orton offered the play to Codron in October 1964 and it underwent sweeping rewrites before it was judged fit for the West End.

Codron had manoeuvred Orton into meeting his colleague [[Kenneth Williams]] in August 1964. Orton reworked ''Loot'' with Williams in mind for Truscott. His other inspiration for the role was DS [[Harold Challenor]].

With the success of ''Sloane'', ''Loot'' was hurried into [[pre-production]] despite its flaws. Rehearsals began in January 1965, with plans for a six-week tour culminating in a West End debut. The play opened in [[Cambridge]] on 1 February to scathing reviews.

Orton, disputing director [[Peter Wood (director)|Peter Wood]] over the plot, produced 133 pages of new material to replace, or add to, the original 90. The play received poor reviews in [[Brighton]], [[Oxford]], [[Bournemouth]], Manchester, and finally [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in mid-March. Discouraged, Orton and Halliwell went on an 80-day holiday in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]].

In January 1966, ''Loot'' was revived, with [[Oscar Lewenstein]] taking up an option. Before his production, it had a short run (11–23 April) at the University Theatre, Manchester. Orton's growing experience led him to cut over 600 lines, raising the tempo and improving the characters' interactions.

Directed by [[Braham Murray]], the play garnered more favourable reviews. Lewenstein put the London production in a "sort of Off-West End theatre," the [[Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre]] in [[Bloomsbury]], under the direction of [[Charles Marowitz]].

Orton clashed with Marowitz, although the additional cuts they agreed to further improved the play. This production was first staged in London on 27 September 1966, to rave reviews. Ronald Bryden in ''[[The Observer]]'' asserted that it had "established Orton's niche in English drama".<ref>Colin Chambers ''Peggy: The Life of Margaret Ramsay, Play Agent'', Nick Hern Books, 1997, pp. 164-65.</ref> ''Loot'' moved to the [[Criterion Theatre]] in November where it ran for 342 performances.<ref>Chambers, p. 165.</ref> This time it won several awards, and he sold the film rights for £25,000. ''Loot'', when performed on Broadway in 1968, repeated the failure of ''Sloane'', and the film version of the play was not a success when it surfaced in 1970.<ref>Chambers, p. 166.</ref>

===Later works===
Over the next ten months, he revised ''The Ruffian on the Stair'' and ''The Erpingham Camp'' for the stage as a double called ''Crimes of Passion'', wrote ''[[Funeral Games (play)|Funeral Games]]'', the screenplay ''[[Up Against It]]'' for [[the Beatles]], and his final full-length play, ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]''.

''The Erpingham Camp'', Orton's take on ''[[The Bacchae]]'', written through mid-1965 and offered to [[Associated-Rediffusion]] in October of that year, was broadcast on 27 June 1966 as the "pride" segment in their series ''Seven Deadly Sins''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Plays10.html|title=Joe Orton Life and Work|website=www.joeorton.org}}</ref> ''[[The Good and Faithful Servant]]'' was a transitional work for Orton. A one-act television play, it was completed by June 1964 but first broadcast by Associated-Rediffusion on 6 April 1967, representing "faith" in the series ''Seven Deadly Virtues''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Plays5.html|title=Joe Orton Life and Work|website=www.joeorton.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b43d3fd|title=The Good and Faithful Servant (1967)}}</ref>

Orton rewrote ''Funeral Games'' four times from July to November 1966. Also intended for ''The Seven Deadly Virtues'', it dealt with [[charity (virtue)|charity]] — Christian charity — in a confusion of adultery and murder. Rediffusion did not use the play; instead, it was made as one of the first productions of the new ITV company [[Yorkshire Television]], and broadcast posthumously in the ''Playhouse'' series on 26 August 1968, five weeks after an adaptation of ''Mr Sloane''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Plays12.html|title=Joe Orton Life and Work|website=www.joeorton.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b71c69323|title=Funeral Games (1968)}}</ref>

In March 1967, Orton and Halliwell had intended another extended holiday in [[Libya]], but they returned home after one day because the only hotel accommodation they could find was a boat that had been converted into a hotel/nightclub.

Orton's once controversial farce ''What The Butler Saw'' was staged in the West End in 1969, more than 18 months after his death. It opened in March at the Queen's Theatre with [[Ralph Richardson|Sir Ralph Richardson]], [[Coral Browne]], [[Stanley Baxter]] and [[Hayward Morse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O153962/what-the-butler-saw-artwork-anderson-lindsay/|title=What The Butler Saw - Anderson, Lindsay - V&A Search the Collections|website=collections.vam.ac.uk}}</ref>

==Murder==

On 9 August 1967, Kenneth Halliwell bludgeoned 34-year-old Orton to death at their home in [[Islington]], London with nine hammer blows to the head, then killed himself with an overdose of [[Pentobarbital|Nembutal]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Orton|first=Joe|author2=Lahr, John|title=The Orton Diaries|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1996|page=266|isbn=978-0-306-80733-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7DiU-70SBgC&q=hammer}}</ref>

In 1970, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that four days before the murder, Orton had told a friend that he wanted to end his relationship with Halliwell, but did not know how to go about it.

Halliwell's doctor spoke to him by telephone three times on the day of the murder, and had arranged for him to see a psychiatrist the following morning. The last call was at 10 o'clock, during which Halliwell told the doctor, "Don't worry, I'm feeling better now. I'll go and see the doctor tomorrow morning."

Halliwell had felt increasingly threatened and isolated by Orton's success, and had come to rely on [[antidepressant]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. The bodies were discovered the following morning when a chauffeur arrived to take Orton to a meeting with director [[Richard Lester]] to discuss filming options on ''Up Against It''. Halliwell left a suicide note: "If you read his diary, all will be explained. KH PS: Especially the latter part." This is presumed to be a reference to Orton's description of his [[promiscuity]]; the diary contains numerous incidents of [[cottaging]] in public lavatories and other casual sexual encounters, including with rent boys on holiday in North Africa. The diaries have since been published.<ref name=Lahr>Lahr, J. (2013). ''The Orton Diaries''.

Orton was [[cremation|cremated]] at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]], his maroon cloth-draped coffin being brought into the west chapel to a recording of The Beatles song "[[A Day in the Life]]".<ref>A ''Times'' correspondent, 19 August 1967 – timesonline archive assessed 27 August 2009.</ref> [[Harold Pinter]] read the eulogy, concluding with "He was a bloody marvellous writer." Orton's agent [[Peggy Ramsay]] described Orton's relatives as "the little people in Leicester",<ref>"A Ceremony" by Leonie Barnett, ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' Programme, Ambassadors' Theatre Group, 2009.</ref> leaving a cold, nondescript note and bouquet at the funeral on their behalf.

At the suggestion of Halliwell's family, Peggy Ramsay asked Orton's brother Douglas if Orton and Halliwell's ashes could be mixed. Douglas agreed, "As long as nobody hears about it in Leicester."<ref>John Lahr, ''Prick Up Your Ears'', 1980 Penguin Books edition, Chapter 6, 'The Freaks' Roll-Call', p. 337</ref> The mixed ashes were scattered<ref>John Lahr, ''Prick Up Your Ears'', 1980 Penguin Books edition, Chapter 6, 'The Freaks' Roll-Call', p. 337</ref> in section 3-C of the Garden of Remembrance at Golders Green. There is no memorial.<ref>Golders Green Crematorium guide notes</ref>

==Biography and film, radio, TV==
[[John Lahr]]'s biography of Orton, entitled ''[[Prick Up Your Ears]]'' (a title Orton himself had considered using), was published in 1978 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. A 1987 [[Prick Up Your Ears|film adaptation]] of the same name was released based on Orton's diaries and on Lahr's research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/484991/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Prick Up Your Ears (1987)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> Directed by [[Stephen Frears]], it stars [[Gary Oldman]] as Orton, [[Alfred Molina]] as Halliwell and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Peggy Ramsay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b75bba80a|title=Prick up Your Ears (1987)|publisher=British Film Institute|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> [[Alan Bennett]] wrote the screenplay.

In 2017, film-maker Chris Shepherd made an animated short inspired by Orton's Edna Welthorpe letters, 'Yours Faithfully, Edna Welthorpe (Mrs)', starring [[Alison Steadman]] as Edna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ednawelthorpe.co.uk/the-film/|title=Yours Faithfully, Edna Welthorpe|author=Shepherd, Christopher|year=2017|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref>

Two archive recordings of Orton are known to survive: a short BBC radio interview first transmitted in August 1967 and a video recording, held by the [[British Film Institute]], of his appearance on [[Eamonn Andrews]]' [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] chat show transmitted 23 April 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b70fd1a28|title=The Eamonn Andrews Show[23/04/67] (1967)|publisher=British Film Institute|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref>

In July 2019 Dr Emma Parker, professor at the [[University of Leicester]] and an Orton expert, launched a campaign to install a statue of him in Leicester, the city of his birth. The campaign drew support from several actors including [[Sheila Hancock]], [[Kenneth Cranham]] and [[Alec Baldwin]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-49102154/murdered-playwright-joe-orton-was-among-first-to-write-openly-gay-stage-characters|title=Call to honour murdered 'modern-day Oscar Wilde'|work=BBC News}}</ref>
