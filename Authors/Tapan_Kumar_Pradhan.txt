==Human rights and crusade against corruption==
In 2009, Pradhan petitioned the [[Central Information Commission]] of India to increase transparency in the Performance Appraisal System in [[Reserve Bank of India|RBI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/397233|title=Central Information Commission Award dated August 9, 2010}}</ref> Pradhan was first person in RBI and public sector employee to obtain his [[performance appraisal|PAR]] report through [[RTI Act]]. As against CIC's view that PAR was "confidential personal information", Pradhan contended that PAR is the appraisal committee's ''impersonal'' evaluation of the ''public'' service rendered by ''public'' servants in their ''impersonal'' capacity in a ''public'' organisation; and hence there was nothing "personal" about PAR.<ref>Appeal No. 34/ 2009-10/RIA 2831/ 2008–09 against Reserve Bank of India</ref> Following his petition, RBI began disclosing [[performance appraisal|PAR]] reports to all employees<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rti.india.gov.in/cic_decisions/CIC_SM_A_2009_001832_M_50763.pdf|title=CIC Decision on Performance Appraisal Disclosure}}</ref> before moving over to a more objective method of appraisal called Performance Management System. In the words of [[Usha Thorat|Smt Usha Thorat]], the ex-Deputy Governor of RBI, Pradhan makes "ingenious use of the RTI Act" to redress individual grievances.<ref>Appeal No 77/ 2009-10/ RIA 3284/ 08-09 of Reserve Bank of India (Order dated 13 September 2009)</ref>

==Professional career==
Under [[University Grants Commission of India|UGC]] Fellowship, Pradhan was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 2001 for his dissertation on ''Structural and Economic Dimensions of Communal Conflict''.<ref>"Dimensions of Integration and Conflict in a Cross-cultural Cross-communal Setting : A Comparative Analysis", Utkal University, 2001.</ref> He has researched the [[Kandh]]-Pana conflict in [[Kandhamal]] district, [[Hindu]]-[[Muslim]] relations in [[Bhadrak]] and [[Harijan]]-[[Savarna]] [[caste]] dynamics at Brahmabarada in [[Jajpur]] district of [[Odisha]]. He taught Sociology at [[Fakir Mohan University]], Balasore, before joining [[Reserve Bank of India]] in 1999 as a Grade-B officer. In 2014, Pradhan left RBI to join [[Government of Odisha]] as Director and Additional Secretary in Finance Department. He established transparent score-based ranking of banks on [[Financial Inclusion]] parameters for awarding of Government business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/odisha-selects-15-banks-for-handling-govt-business-116053101258_1.html|title=Odisha Selects 15 Banks for Govt Business (''Business Standard'', 31 May 2016}}</ref>

In 2001 Pradhan married Suvashree, a trained [[Odissi|Odishi]] dancer. The couple have a son and a daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.veethi.com/india-people/tapan_kumar_pradhan-profile-4530-25.htm|title=Poet Profile - Tapan kumar Pradhan|work=Veethi.com|access-date=2019-07-14}}</ref>
