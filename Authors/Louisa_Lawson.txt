'''Louisa Lawson''' (née '''Albury''') (17 February 1848 – 12 August 1920) was an Australian poet, writer, publisher, [[Suffragette|suffragist]], and [[feminist]]. She was the mother of the poet and author [[Henry Lawson]].

==Early life==

Louisa Albury was born on 17 February 1848 at Guntawang Station near [[Gulgong, New South Wales]], the daughter of Henry Albury and Harriet Winn.<ref name="smh1932">{{cite news |

On 7 July 1866 aged 18 she married Niels Larsen (Peter Lawson), a Norwegian sailor, at the Methodist parsonage at [[Mudgee, New South Wales]].<ref name="smh1932"/> He was often away gold mining or working with his father-in-law, leaving her on her own to raise four children – Henry 1867, Jack 1869, Poppy 1873 and Lucy 1877, the twin of Tegan who died at eight months. Louisa grieved over the loss of Tegan for many years and left the care of her other children to the oldest child, Henry. This led to ill feelings on Henry's part towards his mother and the two often fought. In 1882 she and her children moved to Sydney, where she managed boarding houses.<ref>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last= Radi |first= Heather |year= 1986 |volume= 10 |id2=lawson-louisa-7121 |title=Lawson, Louisa (1848–1920) |accessdate= 25 June 2015 }}</ref>

Lawson used the money saved while running her boarding houses to purchase shares in the radical pro-[[Australian federation|federation]] newspaper ''The Republican'' in 1887. She and son Henry edited ''The Republican'' in 1887–88, which was printed on an old press in Louisa's cottage. ''The Republican'' called for an Australian republic uniting under 'the flag of a Federated Australia, the Great Republic of the Southern Seas'. The Republican was replaced by the Nationalist, but it lasted two issues.<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/people/lawsonl.html The National Library of Australia's Federation Gateway: Louisa Lawson], accessed 22 February 2011.</ref>

With her earnings and her experience from working on ''The Republican'', Lawson was able in May 1888, to edit and publish ''[[The Dawn (feminist magazine)|The Dawn]]'', Australia's first journal produced solely by women which was distributed throughout Australia and overseas. ''The Dawn'' had a strong feminist perspective and frequently addressed issues such as women's right to vote and assume public office, women's education, women's economic and legal rights, [[domestic violence]], and [[Temperance movement|temperance]]. ''The Dawn'' was published monthly for 17 years (1888–1905) and at its height employed 10 female staff. Lawson's son Henry also contributed poems and stories for the paper, and in 1894 ''The Dawn'' press printed Henry's first book, ''Short Stories in Prose and Verse''.

Around 1904 Louisa published her own volume, ''Dert and Do'', a simple story of 18,000 words.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12297868 National Library of Australia, ''"Dert" and "Do"'', by Louisa Lawson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195335/http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12297868 |date=24 October 2012 }}, accessed 22 February 2011.</ref> In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, ''The Lonely Crossing and other Poems''.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5749571 National Library of Australia, ''The lonely crossing and other poems'', by Louisa Lawson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195400/http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5749571 |date=24 October 2012 }}, accessed 22 February 2011.</ref> Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son's literary work in its earliest days.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-1502333858|title=Steelman and Steelman's Pupil|last1=Lawson|first1=Henry|date=10 September 2014}}</ref>

==Suffragist==

In 1889 Lawson founded The Dawn Club, which became the hub of the suffrage movement in Sydney. In 1891 the [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] formed to campaign for women's suffrage, and Lawson allowed the League to use the Dawn office to print pamphlets and literature free of charge. When women were finally given the vote, in 1902 with the passing of the New South Wales ''Womanhood Suffrage Bill'', Lawson was introduced to the members of Parliament as 'The Mother of Suffrage in New South Wales'. For the women at the time [[universal suffrage]] was not the key issue, Lawson did not criticise the government for failing to give [[Indigenous Australian]]s the vote.

== Later life==
Lawson retired in 1905 but continued to write for Sydney magazines and published ''[[The Lonely Crossing and Other Poems]]'', a collection of 53 poems. She died on Thursday 12 August 1920 aged 72 after a long and painful illness in [[Gladesville Mental Hospital]]. On Saturday 14 August 1920, she was buried with her parents in the [[Church of England]] section of [[Rookwood Cemetery]].<ref name="smh1932"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15902547 | title=Mrs. Louisa Lawson. | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=17 August 1920 | access-date=22 February 2011 | page=8 | via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15902175 | title=Family Notices. | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=14 August 1920 | access-date=22 February 2011 | page=11 | via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

== Memorials ==

In 1941, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' reported a [[Memorial bench|memorial seat]] was to be erected in [[The Domain, Sydney]] as a tribute to Louisa Lawson.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17762929 | title=Louisa Lawson memorial | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=14 August 1941 | access-date=3 February 2011 | page=5 | via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1975 [[Australia Post]] released a stamp in honour of Louisa. The Stamp was designed by Des and Jackie O'Brien, and was one in a series of six stamps released on 6 August 1975 to commemorate the International Year of Women. It was printed at the Melbourne Note Printing Branch, using the photogravure process in three colours.<ref>[http://australianstrampcatalogue.com/1975.php 1975 Issues: Australian Stamp Catalogue], accessed 22 February 2011.</ref><ref>[http://issuu.com/stamps/docs/famous_women_2011 Archival Snapshot, National Philatelic Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524022911/http://issuu.com/stamps/docs/famous_women_2011 |date=24 May 2014 }} accessed 10 April 2012</ref>

A park in Marrickville, New South Wales is named in her honour. The Louisa Lawson Reserve also contains a large colourful mosaic depicting the front cover of ''[[The Dawn (feminist magazine)|The Dawn]]'', and a plaque that reads "Louisa Lawson (1848–1920) Social Reformer, Writer, Feminist and Mother of Henry Lawson. These stones are all that remain from the walls of her home in Renwick Street, Marrickville."

Louisa Lawson Crescent, in the Canberra suburb of [[Gilmore, Australian Capital Territory|Gilmore]], is named in her honour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237537813|title=Australian Capital Territory National Memorials Ordinance 1928 Determination — Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.
