'''Zoé Oldenbourg''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Зоя Серге́евна Ольденбург}}) (31 March 1916<ref>''Encyclopedia of World Literature in the Twentieth Century: O to Z, Volume 3'' (F. Ungar, 1971: {{ISBN|0-8044-3094-2}}), p. 11.</ref> – 8 November 2002<ref>''Histoires littéraires: Revue trimestrielle consacrée à la littérature française des XIXème et XXème siècles'' 4/13-14 (2003): 124.</ref>) was a Russian-born French popular historian and novelist who specialized in [[medieval French history]], in particular the [[Crusades]] and [[Cathars]].

==Life==
She was born in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], Russia into a family of scholars and historians. Her father Sergei was a journalist and historian, her mother Ada Starynkevich was a mathematician, and her grandfather [[Sergey Oldenburg|Sergei]] was the permanent secretary of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Saint Petersburg.<ref>Christiane P. Makward and Madeleine Cottenet-Hage, ''Dictionnaire littéraire des femmes de langue française'' (KARTHALA Editions, 1996: {{ISBN|2-86537-676-1}}), p. 448.</ref> Her early childhood was spent among the privations of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolutionary period]] and the first years of Communism. Her father fled the country and established himself as a journalist in Paris.

With her family, she emigrated to Paris in 1925 at the age of nine and graduated from the [[w:fr:Lycée Molière (Paris)|Lycée Molière]] in 1934 with her [[Baccalauréat]] diploma. She went on to study at the [[Sorbonne]] and then she studied painting at the [[Académie Ranson]]. In 1938 she spent a year in England<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NlYqut4rJQMC&lpg=PA449&ots=rJNZiaZDf7&dq=br%C3%BBl%C3%A9s%20oldenbourg&pg=PA448#v=snippet&q=%C3%A9tudie%20la%20th%C3%A9ologie&f=false Dictionnaire littéraire...] October 2010</ref> and studied theology. During [[World War II]] she supported herself by hand-painting scarves.

She was encouraged by her father to write and she completed her first work, a novel, ''Argile et cendres'' in 1946. Although she wrote her first works in Russian, as an adult she wrote almost exclusively in French.<ref>Lucille Frackman Becker, ''Twentieth-Century French Women Novelists'' (Twayne Publishers, 1989: {{ISBN|0-8057-8251-6}}), p. 55.</ref>

She married Heinric Idalovici in 1948<ref>Cf. Wilson, p.936</ref> and had two children, Olaf and Marie-Agathe.<ref>''European Biographical Directory'', vol. 2 (Editions Database, 1991), p. 1627.</ref>

==Work==
She combined a high level of scholarship with a deep feeling for the Middle Ages in her historical novels. Her first novel, ''The World is Not Enough'', offered a panoramic view of the twelfth century.  Her second, ''The Cornerstone,'' was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in America.  Other works include ''The Awakened'', ''The Chains of Love'', ''Massacre at Montsegur'', ''Destiny of Fire'', ''Cities of the Flesh'', and ''Catherine the Great'', a Literary Guild selection.  In ''The Crusades'', Zoe Oldenbourg returned to writing about the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Crusades|last=Oldenbourg|first=Zoé|publisher=Random House|year=1966|location=New York, N.Y|pages=the book jacket}}</ref>
