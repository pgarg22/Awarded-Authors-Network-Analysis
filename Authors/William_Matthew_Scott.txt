'''William Matthew Scott''' (30 September 1893 – 7 May 1964), pen name '''Will Scott''', was a British author of stories and books for adults and children, published from 1920 to 1965. Towards the end of his life he was best known for ''The Cherrys'' series, written for children and published between 1952 and 1965. However, in earlier years he was known for his detective novels, his stage plays which were made into films, notably ''The Limping Man'' in 1931 and 1936, and for the 2,000 short stories<ref name="Times-WScottObituary-190564" /> that he contributed to magazines and newspapers; believed to be a record for the United Kingdom during his lifetime.<ref name="WS-CherrysbytheSea-1954" /> As of 2011, his books are out of print.

At least until 1911 Scott lived in the working-class areas of [[Little London, Leeds|Little London]] and [[Woodhouse, Leeds|Woodhouse]], next to [[Meanwood Beck]]. The area has a history of poverty, and within living memory were the Woodhouse [[cholera]] epidemic of the 1840s, and the [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] epidemic in nearby [[Headingley]] of 1889. When Scott was born, the [[midden]]s and ashpits which had nurtured the diseases were being replaced by communal [[Flush toilet|water closets]]. That meant that inhabitants of the [[Back-to-back houses|back-to-backs]] had to walk to the end of the row to use the lavatory or empty a [[chamber pot]] but they would not catch cholera; communal outside lavatories and cobbled streets with [[clothes line|washing lines]] overhead persisted while Scott lived there. However it should be remembered that street communities were strong, public transport was efficient and good quality education and libraries were available for working people.<ref name=AJTaylor-VictorianLeeds>{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Leeds|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719007811|pages=389–407|author=Arthur J.

==Career==

"After being a cartoonist, an art critic, an art editor and a drama critic, Will Scott settled down as a fiction writer. He has written over 2,000 short stories, which is believed to be a record for this country. When his own daughters were small he wrote plays and books, all for grown ups. It was grandchildren who turned his thoughts to books for young readers. He says they are 'the greatest fun in the world'".<ref name="WS-CherrysbytheSea-1954" />

===Mask Players (The)===
The Mask Players was the amateur Herne Bay drama group started for charity purposes by Edward Anstee in March 1930, with twelve or twenty-four founder members; this number had risen to 300 by 1935. Between 1930 and 1940, 673 people had contributed to the group and 176 acting members had taken part in 179 performances and two thousand rehearsals. There was a monthly show called "Green Room Night".<ref name=HBGazette-8jan98/> Will Scott was involved with this society as director for most of its life. The group celebrated its tenth anniversary and 63rd green room night on 28 March 1940 at St John's Hall in Herne Bay, although the previous cast of hundreds had been whittled down to dozens by the [[World War II|war]].<ref name=HBPress-MaskPlayersAd-23mar1940>{{cite news|title=The Mask Players (advertisement)|newspaper=Herne Bay Press|date=23 March 1940}}<!--|accessdate=7 March 2011--></ref> On this occasion the entertainment consisted of variety sketches and turns, including and accompanied by "a breezy pianoforte selection". It also included a rare speech by Scott, who was known to "shun the limelight".<ref name="Times-WScottObituary-190564"/> The group was named after Scott's play, ''The Mask'', its first play which opened on 28 March 1930 at the King's Hall and produced a £42 donation for a local charity. The Players regularly performed yearly Christmas pantomimes, the early ones starring a disguised Eileen Wilson as principal boy. It also functioned as a social club for the players, with garden parties at Beltinge.

<blockquote>"Will Scott, an artist and author, has written in ''The Limping Man'' a comedy thriller which is far above the average if only for the reason that it contains at least a score of very amusing lines. There is a valuable Rembrandt, a Henry VIII mansion, mysterious footsteps, a bell that rings by itself, a suspicious-looking butler, Americans, a man murdered at the crossroads – all sorts of ingredients that would mix up into a stage mystery. The solution is by no means an obvious one. Franklin Dyall is a modern man of mystery – a being who wanders all over the globe solving crimes that baffle every one else. Arthur Hardy, who has been acting in this play on tour for some months, has some admirable lines as a fashionable physician . . . If ''The Limping Man'' had been produced two years ago I should have promised it a long run."<ref name=TDE-LimpManReview-20jan1931>{{cite news|title=Another stage thriller: footsteps, hidden bells and murder!|url=http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/ukpressonline/getDocument?fileName=DExp_1931_01_20_009&fileType=PAG|accessdate=19 February 2011|newspaper=Daily Express|page=9; col.2}}</ref></blockquote>

===Herne Bay Pageant, 1937===
[[File:Herne Bay Pageant 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Some participants in the pageant]]

This is ''The Herne Bay Pageant in Celebration of the Coronation of their Majesties King George V1 and Queen Elizabeth'' which was written and directed by Will Scott for performance in [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] on 13 and 14 May 1937. It consists of an introduction and six single-scene episodes showing how the town celebrated previous coronations and events,<ref name=HBGazette-8jan98/> each representing eras of Herne Bay's history: 1821, 1831, 1838, 1902, 1911 and 1937. Some scenes reveal historical moments: for example the 1911 episode mentions fields laid out for development on Westcliff. Some of the scenes are humorous: for example the 1838 episode includes a light mockery of reactionary attitudes, showing an elderly resident worrying that the new clock tower is ''[[Wikt:déclassé|déclassé]]''. The 1937 episode includes a parade of individuals carrying placards representing all the institutions, groups and societies of Herne Bay. The entire pageant promotes pride in Herne Bay through understanding of its development from a fishing village to a complex town and tourist attraction.<ref>Ref C020300757.

The story begins with the classic scenario of the [[locked room mystery]], and moves thence to the morality of worldwide contemporary politics.<ref name="WS-DisherDetective1925" /> However, before the tale is halfway through, Scott puts into the mouth of his detective a suggestion that the tight [[detective fiction]] genre of clues, detection and denouement is already exhausted by 1925: <blockquote>
"Heaven is the place where the last chapter will be torn out of the finest story that ever will be written. And it is a heaven to me unattainable. Believe me, I never want to solve any of these so-called mysteries with which my name is associated. But I always do solve them. I can't help it. The greatest thing that my present career could hold for me would be a case that was utterly beyond my powers . . . if there were someone else who could do my job as well as I can do it, I'd drop it at once and go in for some inexact science that leads to nowhere and nothing.

===''Shadows'' (1928)===
[[File:Will Scott Shadows 003.jpg|thumb|left|''Shadows'', 1928]]

The 1928 Philadelphia edition is dedicated to "my friend W.A. Williamson, Skipper of the Good Ship ''Passing Show'' of London, who, also, thinks an Adventure in the Armchair is worth two in the Bush." Five editions were published 1928–1931 in English and German.<ref name="GADetection-ScottWill-2006" /><ref name="WS-shadows-1928"/><ref name="WorldCat-WillScott">{{cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no95-48265|title=WorldCat|work=Scott, Will|accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref> The [[British Library]] holds two reference copies.<ref name=BritLib-Shadows-1928>{{cite web|title=British Library |url=http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/6UEQTP7SDYNBQFPJQRTJEG88X5FYISAHSCJBFCH1J6R9XH16TE-19870?func=full-set-set&set_number=093212&set_entry=000021&format=999|work=Full record: Shadows by Will Scott|publisher=The British Library Board|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=BritLib-Shadows1928-2>{{cite web|title=The British Library|url=http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/8EXVU3YT31FVEVQXBQT3IA1V5QJ96SE1CQPYYG4CIKVN6IVRR8-38576?func=full-set-set&set_number=081070&set_entry=000025&format=999|work=Full record: Shadows (Cassell 1928) by Will Scott|publisher=The British Library Board|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref> The 1928 dust jacket is illustrated in [[art deco]] style. It shows a bright orange silhouette of the haunted house on a hill against a grey sky with full moon, and below it are black shadows of trees on the base of the hill. At the top and bottom of this picture it says: "Disher solves another mystery / Shadows / by Will Scott / author of ''The Black Stamp''". The dustjacket illustrates the fictional setting of the book at a grand and ancient house on a hill, called Tinker's Revel, described on page 12: <blockquote>"the Revel on its hill. . . Against a background of tall black trees the Revel stood up, a brilliant red silhouette, a haphazard collection of corners and gables and curly chimney-pots and stepped terraces . . ."<ref name="WS-shadows-1928"/></blockquote> This location may have been suggested by [[Folkestone Downs|Castle Hill]] in Kent. The novel is a mystery [[melodrama]] featuring the detective Disher and written almost in the form of a screenplay or stage play. Most of the characterisation and plot stem from the conversation, the description of the setting and the characters' movements which could be read as stage directions. As in a stage melodrama, almost all of the action takes place in one room, although there are one or two brief garden scenes. At the novel's [[Dramatic structure#Dénouement, resolution, or catastrophe|dénouement]] on page 294 is possibly one of the earliest usages of the word, "happenings", employed loosely in the sense of prearranged events, here compared with the scandalous plays of the [[Gay Nineties|Naughty Nineties]]: "These aren't the happenings for an old man to be dropped into.

===''The Mask'' (1929)===
[[File:Will Scott Mask 003.jpg|thumb|right|''The Mask'']]
Three editions were published 1929–1931 in English and German.<ref name="GADetection-ScottWill-2006" /><ref name="WorldCat-WillScott" /> The [[British Library]] holds a reference copy.<ref name=BritLib-TheMask-1929>{{cite web|title=The British Library |url=http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/6UEQTP7SDYNBQFPJQRTJEG88X5FYISAHSCJBFCH1J6R9XH16TE-22916?func=full-set-set&set_number=089291&set_entry=000390&format=999 |work=Full record: The Mask by Will Scott |publisher=The British Library Board |accessdate=24 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In this [[whodunit]] novel, private detective Will Disher is described as suave, plump, astute and bored, but Scotland Yard still asks him for help in solving the mystery. The plot begins with the masked-murderer scenario, this one being a [[toff]] in evening dress. Much of the plot takes place in an English country house, and some of it is set in London, but the general setting is the marshland just south of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] and [[Birchington]] in Kent. Real local place names such as [[Hoath|Maypole]], [[Whitstable]] and [[Stodmarsh]] are transmuted into fictional places with names such as the Hope Poles Inn, Winstonlea and Stodmere Farm, and a chase through countryside at night evokes the true atmosphere of the marshes around the rivers [[River Stour, Kent|Stour]] and [[River Wantsum|Wantsum]] with their [[levee|dykes]] or banked drainage trenches, twisting lanes and dark woods.<ref name="WS-TheMask-1929"/>

However this novel also offers glimpses of the area just before the beginning of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] when many local farmers and innkeepers went bankrupt and their land was sold for very little to itinerant farm labourers, as happened at [[Hoath|Shelvingford]] and [[Marshside, Kent|Marshside]]. The character Wilks the farmer with his [[Kentish dialect]] could be taken to represent the existing [[tenant farmer|peasantry]] in the area, as a contrast with the upper class in the novel's Georgian House. However it may be that Scott identifies with this character. The author's roots are after all in a poor suburb of Leeds; he began life speaking a [[Loiner]] dialect; as a writer he identified with the observing-neighbour character Wilks in his ''Cherrys'' series, saying that "Wilks" was a half-synonym for the beginning of "Will Sc-ott".<ref name="WS-TheMask-1929">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Mask|edition=1|year=1929|publisher=Macrae Smith Company|location=Philadelphia}}<!--|accessdate=11 February 2011--></ref><ref>Conversation with J. Spashett in 1963 when she thanked him for giving a set of ''The Cherrys'' books to her children</ref>

There are moments in ''The Mask'' which capture this landscape just as it was changing from that of the horse to that of the motor car. The farmer Wilks still has a horse and cart. However the taxi driver was a ploughman fifteen years before, and the local smithy is now a garage and petrol station. The bus, the train and walking are still preferred methods of travel for the majority, though, and even the car-owning gentry at the Georgian House are familiar with [[public transport timetable]]s.<ref name="WS-TheMask-1929"/>

==Children's books: ''The Cherrys'' series==
[[File:Will Scott The Cherrys series 001.jpg|thumb|left|''The Cherrys'' series]]

''The Cherrys'' series consists of 14 books, published from 1952 to 1965, the last being published after Will Scott died.<ref name="Times-WScottObituary-190564" /><ref name="CollectingBooks-Australia">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/1950s.html#CHERRYS|title=Collecting books and magazines: British 1950s series|work=Cherrys|accessdate=2 February 2011|location=Australia}}</ref> Numbers 1–12 in the series were illustrated by Lilian Buchanan who also illustrated some of [[Enid Blyton]]'s children's books.<ref name="LilianBuchanan-illustrations">{{cite web|url=http://www.heathersblytonpages.com/blytonillustrators-a-c.html#Buchanan|title=Heather's Blyton Pages|work=Lilian Buchanan (13 January 1914)|accessdate=2 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023210407/http://www.heathersblytonpages.com/blytonillustrators-a-c.html#Buchanan#Buchanan|archive-date=23 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Numbers 1–12 in the series contain various pictorial maps of the stories' fictional settings, for example Market Cray and River House, on the end papers. These twelve books are illustrated throughout with black and white drawings. The stories are about a family of children whose middle-class parents, especially the father, play with them and encourage adventures, some of which are imaginary. The series is aimed at a reading age of about 10 years in the middle classes of the 1950s to 1960s era. Many of the stories are set in the fictional village of Market Cray, which may have some reference to [[St Mary Cray]], or even an indirect or hidden reference to [[St. Mary Mead]], the fictional home of [[Agatha Christie]]'s sleuth [[Miss Marple]]. The characters are: Captain and Mrs Cherry; Jimmy Cherry; Jane Cherry; Roy Cherry; Pam Cherry; Mr Watson the monkey; Joseph the parrot; Mr and Mrs Wilks the neighbours; Sally Wilks; Mr Wilks' brother from the Isle of Wight; Mr and Mrs. Pringle; Joe Pringle; Betty Pringle; Mrs. Pearl the cleaner from Marigold Cottages; Mr Mount the baker. The fictional father Captain Cherry is a retired explorer whose name may be a reference to [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]].<ref name="LibraryThing-Cherrys">{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/topic/70343|title=Library Thing|last=AurelArkad|date=2009–2010|work=Children's Fiction: Will Scott's 14-book Cherrys Series|accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref>

===First: ''The Cherrys of River House'' (1952)===
[[File:Will Scott The Cherrys series 001b.jpg|thumb|right|''The Cherrys'' series nos 1–6]]
The dedication says, "A book for Mike to remind him of the days when all of us – and Daisy's sister – dashed about, like The Cherrys themselves, all over the place, from the beginning of [[Kent]] to the end of the [[River Windrush|Windrush]], having a high old time".<ref name="WS-CherrysofRiverHse-1952" /> The story is about children who have [[happening]]s "as they called their adventures", and this may be the first written example of the usage of the word, "happening" in this way.<ref name="WS-CherrysofRiverHse-1952">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys of River House |edition=1|series=1st of The Cherrys series|year=1952|publisher=Brockhampton Press Ltd|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> This book was published in French by Editions G.

===Second: ''The Cherrys and Company'' (1953)===
This edition was reprinted four times, in 1953, 1956, 1957 and 1961. The dust jacket carries a quotation from ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', "The Cherrys are a lively, likeable family of four children, their mother and their father, a retired explorer, who thinks he likes a quiet life in the country, and is constantly inventing "Happenings" which keep the family on the move round the countryside in their old car".<ref name="WS-CherrysandCompany-1953">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys and Company|edition=1|series=2nd of The Cherrys Series|year=1953|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> This book was published by American Book Company in 1962 in French under the title ''Les Cherry Et Compagnie''; illustrated by Pierre Le Guen.

===Third: ''The Cherrys by the Sea'' (1954)===
The happenings or adventures all take place at the fictional St Denis Bay, inspired by Minnis Bay at [[Birchington-on-Sea]], which setting may be partly informed by Scott's residence nearby at [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]]. The map of St Denis Bay on the book's endpapers, possibly by Scott himself, shows similarity to Minnis Bay along the beach, but the town is imaginary. The stories start with a message in a bottle and end with a haunted sea front.<ref name="WS-CherrysbytheSea-1954">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys by the Sea|edition=1|series=3rd of The Cherrys series|year=1954|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> It was published in French in 1963 by Rouge et Or Dauphine as ''Les Cherry au Bord de la Mer'', illustrated by Pierre Le Guen.<ref>Will Scott (1963), ''Les Cherry au Bord de la Mer'', Rouge et Or Dauphine, France.</ref> In 1970 it was published by Estudios Cor in Portuguese as ''Uma aventura na praia (A Familia Cherry)''.

[[File:Will Scott The Cherrys series 001c.jpg|thumb|right|''The Cherrys'' series nos 5–10]]
The Cherry children are joined by their new friends, the Pringle children, and their father Captain invents happenings or adventures for them. All stories are set in fictional St Mary Cray.<ref name="WS-CherrysandPringles-1955">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys and the Pringles |edition=1|series=4th of the Cherrys Series|year=1955|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> '''Happenings''': The great reception (the children lay on a reception committee greeting); Let it rain!

===Sixth: ''The Cherrys and the Double Arrow'' (1957)===
The story starts with Captain Cherry organising the children to find an [[elm]] tree in a wood; written before the second wave of [[Dutch elm disease#Europe|Dutch elm disease]] in 1967 caused most of these to be lost in the UK.

===Seventh: ''The Cherrys on Indoor Island'' (1958)===
This is perhaps the definitive ''Cherrys'' series happening: a rainy day on which the interior of River House becomes an imaginary indoor island for the children, organised as an adventure for the children by their father Captain Cherry.<ref name="WS-CherrysIndoorIsland-1958">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys on Indoor Island |edition=1|series=7th of The Cherrys series|year=1958|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> Happenings: The wreck; The castaways; The cave; Exploring the jungle; Mountain rescue; The mysterious footprint; Yes, it's pirates!; A sail!

===Eighth: ''The Cherrys on Zigzag Trail'' (1959)===
[[File:Will Scott The Cherrys series 001d.jpg|thumb|right|''The Cherrys'' series nos 6–12]]
There were two impressions in 1959 and 1962. The story starts with a game of Silly Golf, which may have been informed by the [[Miniature golf|crazy golf]] entertainment at [[Hampton-on-Sea]] near to Will Scott's home at Herne Bay.<ref name="WS-CherrysZigzagTrail-1959">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys on Zigzag Trail |edition=1|series=8th of The Cherrys series|year=1959|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> Happenings: Mr Wilks cries 'Look!’; Mr. Nobody; Nothing but mysteries; The standstill race; The Society For Finding Things Out; Old sailor from over the water; Away they go; Smart work; The same-sounding words; The end if the trail.<ref name="LibraryThing-Cherrys" /><ref name="WS-CherrysZigzagTrail-1959" />

===Ninth: ''The Cherrys' Mystery Holiday'' (1960)===
One edition was published in English in 1960. The title may have been informed by the novelty of the mystery tours being run by [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] companies at the time. Passengers paid for a day out at an unknown destination which could be a pleasant surprise but which sometimes brought them to their home area.<ref name="WorldCat-WillScott" /><ref name="WS-CherrysMysteryHol-1960">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys' Mystery Holiday |edition=1|series=9th of The Cherrys series|year=1960|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> Happenings: Keep your eyes open; The mystery of Mr Wotherspoon; The mystery of the pirate chief; Spik no English!; The great seaweed mystery; The writing in the sand; The mystery of the Jumping Jacks; The mystery of Neptune Island; Most mysterious of all; It's a mystery!<ref name="LibraryThing-Cherrys" /><ref name="WS-CherrysMysteryHol-1960" />

===Eleventh: ''The Cherrys' Famous Case'' (1962)===
Two editions were published in 1962 and 1972, in English and another language. The story starts by examining the idea of clues and evidence.<ref name="WorldCat-WillScott" /><ref name="WS-CherrysFamousCase-1962">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Cherrys' Famous Case |edition=1|series=11th of The Cherrys series|year=1962|publisher=Brockhampton Press|location=Leicester}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref> Happenings: The day that woke up; Missing!; The Home-made Police-Force; Hot on the trail; The footprint again; The light in the window; That third clue; Clue all the time; Action!; Portrait of the Queen.<ref name="LibraryThing-Cherrys" /><ref name="WS-CherrysFamousCase-1962" />

==Other children's books==

===''Half-Term Trail'' (1955)===
[[File:Will Scott Half Term Trail 002.jpg|thumb|right|''Half Term Trail'']]
This book is illustrated by Mary Willett.<ref name="CollectingBooks-Australia" /><ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=Half Term Trail|edition=1|year=1955|publisher=Blackie|location=London}}</ref> The [[British Library]] holds a reference copy.<ref name=BritLib-HalfTermTrail-1955>{{cite web|title=The British Library|url=http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/8EXVU3YT31FVEVQXBQT3IA1V5QJ96SE1CQPYYG4CIKVN6IVRR8-06545?func=full-set-set&set_number=081070&set_entry=000018&format=999|work=Full record: Half Term Trail by Will Scott|publisher=The British Library Board|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref> It is set in a recognisable version of [[Herne Bay, Kent]] and [[Hampton-on-Sea]]. These are given the fictional names of Sandilands and West Bay respectively, and bear no resemblance to [[Sandilands (resort)|Sandilands]] in Lincolnshire. Herne Bay's clock tower and adjoining public gardens appear in the story, as do Hampton-on-Sea's jetty, concrete shelter, the beach and the boating lake as it was in 1955. Swalecliffe Avenue appears in the story under the name of Matchbox Lane, and as of 2011 the area of scrub mentioned in the book still exists. Pleasant Cottage (later called Hampton Bungalow) in Swalecliffe Avenue appears in the story as Dilly Dally cottage in Matchbox Lane. Mary Willett's drawings within the book bear little or no resemblance to Herne Bay or Hampton-on-Sea, but the hand-drawn map at the end of the book – possibly by Will Scott – is clearly derived from [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] maps of Hampton-on-Sea. The endpapers-drawing shows an idealised Swalecliffe Avenue. Two names used in the story, Bottle and Sticky, may have been suggested by local Herne Bay names, although the characterisations are fictional. In the 1950s there was an antique shop in Herne Bay High Street called Len Pottle,<ref name="HBTimes-10June2010">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/herne-bay-times-whitestable-uk/mi_8128/is_20100610/girl-loved-beach-tan/ai_n54010465/|title=Bnet|date=10 June 2010|work=Herne Bay Times: Girl who loved beach will tan people all over|publisher=Northcliffe Newspapers Group Limited|accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> and the caretaker at Hampton Primary School was Mr Stickels.<ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail" /><ref>See hand-drawn map of Hampton-on-Sea based on 1978 OS map: [[:File:Hampton 1978 001b.jpg]]</ref> Chapter headings: The Very Beginning; The Tuckers and the Tanners; Mystery!; And More Mystery!; The Knife; First Clue to Tim; Rings Round Dilly Dally; Surprises; Sticky's Story; The Chase Begins; Big Clue to Mary; The Trail of the Chalk Crosses; Tim Alone; Only One Missing; "I've got it!"; The Case is closed; Map of West Bay, Sandilands.<ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail" />

====Commentary====
The story follows the attempts of five children to clear the name of their friend Sticky by trailing and catching a homeless thief with disagreeable manners; a "ghastly type" to be identified by his brown boots.<ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail-p15">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=Half Term Trail|edition=1|year=1955|publisher=Blackie|location=London|page=15}}</ref> The boots are possibly a reference to the 1931 monologue ''[[Stanley Holloway#Monologues and Music Discography|Brahn Boots]]'' by [[Stanley Holloway]],<ref name="BrahnBoots-lyrics1931">{{cite web|url=http://monologues.co.uk/Brahn_Boots.html|title=Make 'Em Laugh|last=Weston & Lee|year=1931|work=Stanley Holloway: Brahn Boots|accessdate=11 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119040107/http://monologues.co.uk/Brahn_Boots.html#|archive-date=19 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> which was still regularly played on [[BBC Home Service]] radio in the 1950s. The song's lyrics describe the apparent low-class taste of a man clad in brown boots, but he is too modest to say that he has given his good black boots away to the poor; it is really a parable on the subject of unquestioning snobbery. An obvious clue not followed by the children is that the thief initially enters the shop asking for the previous Wednesday's newspaper. The book's publication in 1955 and the timing of the plot during the June [[Academic term#England and Wales|half-term]] holiday possibly indicate the [[Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955|Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act]] of [[1955 in the United Kingdom|6 June 1955]]. If this is so, then the disagreeable man could be taken to be the author's characterisation of [[D. C. Thomson & Co.]], or its cartoonist Bill Holroyd,<ref name="HeraldScotland16mar2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/final-frame-in-a-lifetime-of-dandy-cartoon-creation-1.244709|title=Herald Scotland|date=16 March 2000|work=Final frame in a lifetime of Dandy cartoon creation|publisher=Herald & Times Group|accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> who published children's cartoons such as ''Jack Silver and His Dog Black''.

Spashett in 1963 that he objected to his work being compared with that of Enid Blyton.</ref> In Will Scott's story, the children pursue the brown-booted man unquestioningly, and they are described thus: <blockquote>
". . . and if you'd done something you shouldn't have done they were the last people you'd have liked to have looking at you. They looked really dangerous."<ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail-p97">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=Half Term Trail|edition=1|year=1955|publisher=Blackie|location=London|page=97}}</ref>
</blockquote> The children douse the brown-booted man with red paint at the end; this could be understood as a symbolic killing as the paint is blood-coloured. We never find out what has driven him to steal or why he is bad-tempered. This aspect suggests that the apparently simple children's tale has a moral depth which is possibly intended to undermine its own plot and thus to bring into question the moral basis of some other children's detective tales of the era.<ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail" /><ref>This was commented on in the comic strip ''[[Jack Black (Viz)|Jack Black]]'' in [[Viz (comic)]]</ref>

The author intended this to be the thirteenth in ''The Cherrys'' series, but the agent discouraged the idea of a thirteenth novel for children, and the new publisher declined to produce a matching cover for the previous series.<ref name="WS-GtExpedition-1962">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=The Great Expedition |edition=1|year=1962|publisher=University of London Press Ltd|location=London}}<!--|accessdate=2 February 2011--></ref><ref>Told by Will Scott to his neighbour J.

In fact, they found the tracing of an unnamed river to its source a most exciting adventure."<ref name="WS-GtExpedition-1962" /> The story is set near [[Newbury, Berkshire]]. Chapters: 1.
