<blockquote>
"Makers of Light, when originally produced by the 47 Workshop made so deep an impression that later it was played at the Neighborhood Playhouse, New York City. Here it was again praised for its sincerity, subtle characterization of the chief figures and its power. Given at the Little Theater, Clevland, in the winter of 1924, it was revived the following autumn." -Professor George P. Barker

The dedication to the Makers of Light reads, ''"To my father; For his affection in spite of disapproval, his loyalty in spite of disbelief."''
