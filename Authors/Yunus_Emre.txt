'''Yunus Emre''' ({{IPA-tr|juˈnus emˈɾe}}) also known as '''Derviş Yunus''' (Yunus the [[Dervish]]) (1238–1328) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[folk poetry|folk poet]] and [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[mysticism|mystic]] who greatly influenced [[Turkish culture]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Yunus-Emre |title=Encyclopædia Britannica (2007) |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=2015-11-13}}</ref> His name, ''Yunus'', is the equivalent to the English name ''[[Jonah (given name)|Jonah]]''. He wrote in [[Old Anatolian Turkish]], an early stage of [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The UNESCO General Conference unanimously passed a resolution declaring 1991, the 750th anniversary of the poet's birth, International Yunus Emre Year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rapture and Revolution|last=Halman|first=Talat|publisher=Syracusa University Press, Crescent Hill Publications|year=2007|pages=316}}</ref>

==Biography==
{{Sufism|Notable early}}
Yunus Emre has exercised immense influence on [[Turkish literature]] from his own day until the present, because Yunus Emre is, after [[Ahmed Yesevi]] and [[Sultan Walad]], one of the first known poets to have composed works in the spoken [[Turkish language|Turkish]] of his own age and region rather than in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. His diction remains very close to the popular speech of the people in Central and Western [[Anatolia]]. This is also the language of a number of anonymous folk-poets, folk-songs, fairy tales, riddles (''tekerlemeler''), and proverbs. Yunus Emre was a [[Sunni]] Muslim.<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSHFDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1670|title=Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia|page=1670|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2017|isbn=9781610692175}}</ref> 

Like the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'', an older and anonymous [[Central Asia]]n epic, the Turkish folklore that inspired Yunus Emre in his occasional use of ''tekerlemeler'' as a poetic device had been handed down orally to him and his contemporaries. This strictly oral tradition continued for a long while.<ref>Edouard Roditi. "Western and Eastern Themes in the Poetry of Yunus Emre", ''Journal of Comparative Poetics'', No. 5, The Mystical Dimension in Literature (Spring, 1985), p. 27</ref> Following the [[Mongol Empire|Mongolian]] invasion of [[Anatolia]], facilitated by the [[Sultanate of Rûm]]'s defeat at the 1243 [[Battle of Köse Dağ]], Islamic mystic literature thrived in Anatolia; Yunus Emre became one of its most distinguished poets. The poetry of Yunus Emre — despite being fairly simple on the surface — evidences his skill in describing quite abstruse mystical concepts in a clear way. He remains a popular figure in a number of countries, stretching from [[Azerbaijan]] to the [[Balkans]], with seven different and widely dispersed localities disputing the privilege of having his tomb within their boundaries. Yunus Emre's most important book is ''Risaletu’n Nushiyye''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enkucuk.com/yunus-emrenin-eserleri/|title=Yunus Emre'nin Eserleri|date=2018-01-21|website=Enkucuk.com|language=tr|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>

His poems, written in the tradition of [[Turkish folk literature|Anatolian folk poetry]], mainly concern [[divine love]] as well as [[Predestination in Islam|human destiny]]:
