His parents were [[alcoholics]], though his mother achieved [[sobriety]]. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a [[clerk]] at the Wellpinit Trading Post, and had some other jobs.<ref name="About Alexie" />

Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging, as he was constantly teased by other kids and endured abuse he described as "torture" from white [[nun]]s who taught there. They called him "The Globe" because his head was larger than usual, due to suffering hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and [[bedwetting]]; he had to take strong drugs to control them.<ref name="About Alexie" /><ref name="Authors & Artists">{{cite journal|title=Sherman Alexie |journal=Authors and Artists for Young Adults |year=1999 |volume=28 |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&disableHighlighting=false&prodId=BIC1&action=e&windowstate=normal&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1603000488&mode=view&userGroupName=iulib_iupui&jsid=f86b6cba6316c44135ea18270477b862 |access-date=2012-04-08 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males.<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals.<ref name="Alexie Encyclopedia">{{cite journal|title=Sherman Alexie |journal=Encyclopedia of World Biography |year=1998 |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&disableHighlighting=false&prodId=BIC1&action=e&windowstate=normal&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CA148411809&mode=view&userGroupName=iulib_iupui&jsid=44a2dc07cadd1e9faa807374a9050e8b |access-date=2012-04-08 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Education===
In order to better his education, Alexie decided to leave the reservation and attend high school in [[Reardan, Washington]].,<ref name="About Alexie" /> 22 miles from the reservation, and where Alexie was the only Native American student.<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> He excelled at his studies and became a star player on the [[basketball]] team, the [[Reardan High School]] Indians.<ref name="About Alexie" /> He was elected [[class president]] and was a member of the [[debate team]].<ref name="About Alexie" />

His successes in high school won him a scholarship in 1985 to [[Gonzaga University]], a Roman Catholic university in [[Spokane]].<ref name="About Alexie" /><ref name="Authors & Artists" /> Originally, Alexie enrolled in the [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] program with hopes of becoming a doctor,<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> but found he was squeamish during dissection in his anatomy classes.<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> Alexie switched to law, but found that was not suitable, either.<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> He felt enormous pressure to succeed in college, and consequently, he began drinking heavily to cope with his [[anxiety]].<ref name="Artists 2011">{{cite journal|title=Sherman Alexie |journal=Authors and Artists for Young Adults |year=2011 |volume=85 |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&disableHighlighting=false&prodId=BIC1&action=e&windowstate=normal&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1603001902&mode=view&userGroupName=iulib_iupui&jsid=02b81ec66e363278407e6feeee50736 |access-date=2012-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Unhappy with law, Alexie found comfort in literature classes.<ref name="Authors & Artists" />

In 1987, he dropped out of Gonzaga and enrolled in [[Washington State University]] (WSU),<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> where he took a creative writing course taught by [[Alex Kuo]], a respected poet of Chinese-American background. Alexie was at a low point in his life, and Kuo served as a mentor to him.<ref name="DLB 278" /> Kuo gave Alexie an anthology entitled ''Songs of This Earth on Turtle's Back'', by [[Joseph Bruchac]]. Alexie said this book changed his life as it taught him "how to connect to non-Native literature in a new way".<ref name="DLB 278" /><ref name="Authors & Artists" /><ref name="Sherman Alexie Interview">{{cite web|title=A Conversation With Sherman Alexie|url=http://bluemesareview.org/issues/issue-26/a-conversation-with-sherman-alexie/|work=Blue Mesa Review|date=December 6, 2012| access-date=2013-04-02 }}</ref> He was inspired by reading works of poetry written by Native Americans.<ref name="DLB 278" />

With his new appreciation of poetry, Alexie started working on what was published as his first collection, ''[[The Business of Fancydancing|The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems]]'', published in 1992 through Hanging Loose Press.<ref name="DLB 278" /><ref name="Official Sherman Alexie website">[http://www.fallsapart.com/biography.html Official Sherman Alexie website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602092035/http://www.fallsapart.com/biography.html |date=June 2, 2011 }}</ref> With that success, Alexie stopped drinking and quit school just three credits short of a degree. However, in 1995, he was awarded a bachelor's degree from [[Washington State University]].<ref name="Authors & Artists" />

===Today===
In 2005, Alexie became a founding board member of [[Longhouse Media]], a non-profit organization that is committed to teaching filmmaking skills to Native American youth and using media for cultural expression and social change.  Alexie has long supported youth programs and initiatives dedicated to supporting at-risk Native youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longhousemedia.org/about.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702054102/http://longhousemedia.org/about.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 2, 2010|title=About Us: What is Longhouse Media?|website=Longhouse Media|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref>On February 28, 2018, Alexie published a statement regarding accusations of sexual harassment against him by several women, including author Litsa Dremousis, with whom he had a consensual affair in the past and who claimed numerous women had spoken to her about Alexie's behavior.[17] Alexie admitted he had "harmed" other people besides Dremousis. Dremousis' response initially appeared on her Facebook page and was subsequently reprinted in The Stranger on March 1, 2018.[18]

==Sexual harassment allegations ==

==Literary works==
[[File:Red-ink-alexie-matsunaga-2016-3730 (27727653451).jpg|thumb|Alexie reading at the launch of the [[RED INK International Journal of Indigenous Literature, Art, and Humanities]], at [[Arizona State University]] in 2016]]
Alexie's stories have been included in several short story anthologies, including ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' 2004, edited by [[Lorrie Moore]]; and ''[[Pushcart Prize]]'' XXIX of the Small Presses. Additionally, a number of his pieces have been published in various literary magazines and journals, as well as online publications.

===Themes===
Alexie's poetry, short stories and novels explore themes of despair, poverty, violence and alcoholism among the lives of Native American people, both on and off the reservation. They are lightened by wit and humor.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> According to Sarah A. Quirk from the ''Dictionary of Library Biography,'' Alexie asks three questions across all of his works: "What does it mean to live as an Indian in this time?  What does it mean to be an Indian man? Finally, what does it mean to live on an Indian reservation?"<ref name="DLB 278" />  The protagonists in most of his literary works exhibit a constant struggle with themselves and their own sense of powerlessness in white American society.<ref name="Artists 2011" />

===Influences===
Alexie's writings are meant to evoke sadness, but at the same time, he uses humor and pop culture that leave the readers with a sense of respect, understanding, and compassion.<ref name="Artists 2011" />  Alexie's influences for his literary works do not rely solely on traditional Indian forms. He "blends elements of popular culture, Indian spirituality, and the drudgery of poverty-ridden reservation life to create his characters and the world they inhabit," according to Quirk.<ref name="DLB 278" /> Alexie's work is laced with often startling humor. According to Quirk, he does this as a "means of cultural survival for American Indians&mdash;survival in the face of the larger American culture's stereotypes of American Indians and their concomitant distillation of individual tribal characteristics into one pan-Indian consciousness."<ref name="DLB 278" />

===Arizona HB 2281===
In 2012, [[Ethnic studies#Arizona ban|Arizona's HB 2281]] removed Alexie's works, along with those of others, from Arizona school curriculum. Alexie's response:

{{quote|Let's get one thing out of the way: Mexican immigration is an oxymoron. Mexicans are indigenous. So, in a strange way, I'm pleased that the racist folks of Arizona have officially declared, in banning me alongside Urrea, Baca, and Castillo, that their anti-immigration laws are also anti-Indian. I'm also strangely pleased that the folks of Arizona have officially announced their fear of an educated underclass. You give those brown kids some books about brown folks and what happens? Those brown kids change the world. In the effort to vanish our books, Arizona has actually given them [[Streisand effect|enormous power]]. Arizona has made our books sacred documents now.''<ref>rdsathene, [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/01/1060453/-Sherman-Alexie-Arizona-has-made-our-books-sacred-documents-now# "Sherman Alexie "Arizona has made our books sacred documents now."] ''Daily Kos'', February 1, 2012.</ref>}}

===Poetry===
Within a year of graduating from college, Alexie received the Washington State Arts Commission Poetry Fellowship and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Poetry Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ettlinger |first=Marian |title=Sherman Alexie |url=http://salempress.com/store/samples/survey_american_lit/survey_american_lit_alexie.htm |publisher=Salem Press |access-date=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414135823/http://salempress.com/store/samples/survey_american_lit/survey_american_lit_alexie.htm |archive-date=April 14, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> His career began with the publishing of his first two collections of poetry in 1992, entitled, ''I Would Steal Horses'' and ''The Business of Fancydancing.''<ref name="DLB 278" /> In these poems, Alexie uses humor to express the struggles of contemporary Indians on reservations. Common themes include alcoholism, poverty and racism.<ref name="DLB 278" />  Although he uses humor to express his feelings, the underlying message is very serious.  Alexie was awarded The Chad Walsh Poetry Prize by the [[Beloit Poetry Journal]] in 1995.

''The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems (1992)'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/season/20/spokane-wa/appraisals/1992-sherman-alexie-inscribed-book--201502T07|title=The Business of Fancydancing - Stories and Poems (1992) BOOK APPRAISAL; Ken Sanders Rare Books, Salt Lake City, UT |first=Ken|last=Sanders|work=[[Antiques Roadshow]]|date=June 6, 1992}}</ref> was well received, selling over 10,000 copies.<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> Alexie refers to his writing as "[[fancydancing]],"<ref name="Alexie Encyclopedia" /> a flashy, colorful style of competitive [[Pow wow]] dancing. Whereas older, traditional forms of Indian dance may be ceremonial and kept private among tribal members, the fancydance style was created by Native American veterans from [[World War II]] as a form of public entertainment.<ref name="Alexie Encyclopedia" /> Alexie compares the mental, emotional, and spiritual outlet that he finds in his writings to the vivid self-expression of the dancers.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> Leslie Ullman commented on ''The Business of Fancydancing'' in the ''Kenyon Review,'' writing that Alexie "weaves a curiously soft-blended tapestry of humor, humility, pride and metaphysical provocation out of the hard realities...: the tin-shack lives, the alcohol dreams, the bad luck and burlesque disasters, and the self-destructive courage of his characters."<ref name="Artists 2011" />

Alexie's other collections of poetry include:

===Short stories===
Alexie published his first prose work, entitled ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]],'' in 1993.<ref name="DLB 278" /> The book consists of a series of short stories that are interconnected.  Several prominent characters are explored, and they have been featured in later works by Alexie.  According to Sarah A. Quirk, ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]]'' can be considered a [[bildungsroman]] with dual protagonists, "Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire, moving from relative innocence to a mature level on experience."<ref name="DLB 278" />

''[[Ten Little Indians (Alexie)|Ten Little Indians]]'' (2004) is a collection of "nine extraordinary short stories set in and around the Seattle area, featuring Spokane Indians from all walks of urban life," according to Christine C. Menefee of the ''School Library Journal''.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> In this collection, Alexie "challenges stereotypes that whites have of Native Americans and at the same time shows the Native American characters coming to terms with their own identities."<ref name="Artists 2011" />

''[[War Dances]]'' is a collection of short stories, poems, and short works. It won the 2010 [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]].  The collection, however, received mixed reviews.<ref name="Artists 2011" />

===Novels===
In his first novel, ''[[Reservation Blues]]'' (1995), Alexie revisits some of the characters from ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]].'' Thomas Builds-the-Fire, Victor Joseph, and Junior Polatkin, who have grown up together on the Spokane Indian reservation, were teenagers in the short story collection. In ''Reservation Blues'' they are now adult men in their thirties.<ref name=Klinkenborg>{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg |first=Verlyn |title=America at the Crossroads: Life on the Spokane Reservation |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1100040017&v=2.1&it=r&p=LitRG&sw=w |access-date=2012-04-05 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times Book Review |date=June 18, 1995 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Some of them are now musicians and in a band together. Verlyn Klinkenborg of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a 1995 review of ''[[Reservation Blues]]'': "you can feel Alexie's purposely divided attention, his alertness to a divided audience, Native American and Anglo."<ref name="Klinkenborg" /> Klinkenborg says that Alexie is "willing to risk didacticism whenever he stops to explain the particulars of the Spokane and, more broadly, the Native American experience to his readers."<ref name="Klinkenborg" />

''[[Indian Killer]]'' (1996) is a murder mystery set among Native American adults in contemporary [[Seattle]], where the characters struggle with urban life, mental health, and the knowledge that there is a serial killer on the loose. Characters deal with the racism in the University system, as well as in the community at large, where Indians are subjected to being lectured about their own culture by white professors who are actually ignorant of Indian cultures.<ref name="Artists 2011" />

Alexie's young adult novel, ''[[The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian]]'' (2007) is a coming-of-age story that began as a memoir of his life and family on the Spokane Indian reservation.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> The novel focuses on a fourteen-year-old Indian named Arnold Spirit. The novel is semi-autobiographical, including many events and elements of Alexie's life.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> For example, Arnold was born with hydrocephalus, and was teased a lot as a child. The story also portrays events after Arnold's transfer to Reardan High School, which Alexie attended.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> The novel received great reviews and continues to be a top seller. Bruce Barcott from the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' observed, "Working in the voice of a 14-year-old forces Alexie to strip everything down to action and emotion, so that reading becomes more like listening to your smart, funny best friend recount his day while waiting after school for a ride home."<ref name="Artists 2011" />

''[[Flight (2007 novel)|Flight]]'' (2007) also features an adolescent protagonist. The narrator, who calls himself "Zits," is a fifteen-year-old orphan of mixed Native and European ancestry who has bounced around the foster system in Seattle. The novel explores experiences of the past, as Zits experiences short windows into others' lives after he believes to be shot while committing a crime.<ref name="Artists 2011" />

=== Memoir ===
Alexie's memoir, ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,'' was released by [[Hachette Book Group|Hachette]] in June 2017.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sherman-alexie/you-dont-have-to-say-you-love-me/9780316396776/|title=You Don't Have to Say You Love Me|website=Hachette Book Group|isbn=9780316396776|access-date=2017-06-21|last1=Alexie|first1=Sherman|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> [[Claudia Rowe]] of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote in June 2017 that the memoir "pulls readers so deeply into the author's youth on the Spokane Indian Reservation that most will forget all about facile comparisons and simply surrender to Alexie's unmistakable patois of humor and profanity, history and pathos."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/sherman-alexies-brave-new-memoir-delves-into-his-childhood/|title=Sherman Alexie's brave new memoir delves into his childhood|date=2017-06-19|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}</ref> Alexie cancelled his book tour in support of ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me'' in July 2017 due to the emotional toll that promoting the book was taking. In September 2017, he decided to resume the tour, with some significant changes. As he related to Laurie Hertzel of [[Star Tribune|''The Star Tribune'']], "I’m not performing the book," he said. "I’m getting interviewed. That's a whole different thing." He went on to add that he won't be answering any questions that he doesn't want to answer. "I’ll put my armor back on," he said.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/writer-sherman-alexie-is-back-on-the-road-i-averted-a-crisis/443095923/|title=Writer Sherman Alexie is back on the road: 'I averted a crisis'|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>

===Films===
In 1998 Alexie broke barriers by creating the first all-Indian movie, ''[[Smoke Signals (film)|Smoke Signals]]''.<ref name="Artists 2011" /> Alexie based the screenplay on his short story collection, ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]]'', and characters and events from a number of Alexie's works make appearances in the film.<ref name="Artists 2011" />  ''Smoke Signals'' was directed by Chris Eyre, a [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne-Arapaho]] Indian filmmaker, and the entire production team and cast is Native American.<ref name="Authors & Artists" /> The film tells the story of two young Indians, Victor Joseph ([[Adam Beach]]) and Thomas Builds the Fire ([[Evan Adams]]), who leave the reservation on a road trip to retrieve the body of Victor's dead father ([[Gary Farmer]]).<ref name="Artists 2011" /> During their journey the characters' childhood is explored via flashbacks. The film took top honors at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name="Artists 2011" /> It received an 86% and "fresh" rating from the online film database [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Smoke Signals|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/smoke_signals/|website=Rotten Tomatoes| access-date=2013-04-02 }}</ref>

''[[The Business of Fancydancing]]'', written and directed by Alexie in 2002, explores themes of Indian identity, cultural involvement vs [[blood quantum]], living on the reservation or off it, and other issues related to what makes someone a "real Indian." The title refers to the protagonist's choice to leave the reservation and make his living performing for predominantly-white audiences. [[Evan Adams]], who plays Thomas Builds the Fire in "Smoke Signals", again stars, now as an urban gay man with a white partner. The death of a peer brings the protagonist home to the reservation, where he reunites with his friends from his childhood and youth. The film is unique in that Alexie hired an almost completely female crew to produce the film. Many of the actors improvised their dialogue, based on real events in their lives.  It received a 57% and "rotten" rating from the online Film database Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/search/?search=the%20business%20of%20fancydancing|title = Search Results - Rotten Tomatoes|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>
