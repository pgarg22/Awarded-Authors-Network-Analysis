'''John Abraham Heraud''' (1799–1887) was an English journalist and poet. He published two extravagant epic poems, ''The Descent into Hell'' (1830), and ''The Judgment of the Flood'' (1834). He also wrote plays, and travel books.

== Life ==
He was born in the parish of [[St Andrew's, Holborn]], London, on 5 July 1799. His father, James Abraham Heraud, of [[Huguenot]] descent, was a law stationer, and died at [[Tottenham, Middlesex]], on 6 May 1846, having married Jane, daughter of John and Elizabeth Hicks; she died 2 August 1850. John Abraham, the son, was privately educated, and originally destined for business, but in 1818 began writing for the magazines.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Heraud, John Abraham|volume=26}}</ref>

Heraud had a large circle of literary acquaintances, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Robert Southey]], [[William Wordsworth]], and [[John Gibson Lockhart]].<ref name="DNB"/> Southey was a correspondent, who thought Heraud capable of learning anything, except "how to check his own exuberance in verse", as he wrote to [[Robert Gooch]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Southey|title=The life and correspondence of Robert Southey.

Heraud wrote for the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' and other reviews, and from 1830 to 1833 assisted in editing ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]''.<ref name="DNB"/> There he was sub-editor to [[William Maginn]], taking on literary criticism and philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|author=E. Hough Walter|title=The Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals: 1824–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JIp2-jcacoC&pg=PA450|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=11 September 1972|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-7100-7501-7|pages=450 note 44}}</ref> At this period he was still in partnership with his father, in legal stationery. The partnership was dissolved in 1841, when he went into the trade on his own in the [[Chancery Lane]] area, but unsuccessfully.<ref>Edith Heraud, ''Memoirs of John A. Heraud'' (1898) p. 23; [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsjohnaher00heragoog#page/n28/mode/2up archive.org.]</ref>

With the [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyles]] Heraud was very close. Thomas Carlyle was well aware of Heraud assiduously cultivating favour, and of [[James Fraser (publisher)|James Fraser]]'s opinion that Heraud was "mad as a March hare", writing to Jane Carlyle about him in 1834.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/full/7/1/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01#FN10 |title=carlyleletters.dukejournals.org, TC TO JANE WELSH CARLYLE ; 21 May 1834; DOI: 10.1215/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01; CL 7: 167–178 |access-date=1 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091311/http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/full/7/1/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01#FN10 |archive-date=14 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Heraud edited ''The Sunbeam. A Journal devoted to Polite Literature'', in 1838 and 1839; the ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' from 1839 to 1842; and subsequently the ''Christian's Monthly Magazine''. In 1843 he became a contributor to ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenæum]]'', and later served as its dramatic critic until his retirement in 1868. From 1849 to 1879 he was also the dramatic critic of the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''.<ref name="DNB"/> In 1869 he used that position to call for censorship of ''Formosa'', [[Dion Boucicault]]'s "courtesan play", prompting [[William Bodham Donne]] of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] to tighten up licensing of drama with sexual overtones.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Russell Stephens|title=The Censorship of English Drama 1824–1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ls8CP4MZV9oC&pg=PA86|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=10 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13655-6|pages=86–7}}</ref>

In the late 1840s friends were trying to sort out Heraud's financial problems, amounting to insolvency; a fund-raising committee was formed, with officers [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], [[Thomas Kibble Hervey]] and [[John Westland Marston]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Dickens|title=1850–1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBB4ywGx_IoC&pg=PA142|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=30 June 1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-812617-1|page=142 note 6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Nigel Cross|title=The Common Writer: Life in Nineteenth-Century Grub Street|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qi84AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA67|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=9 June 1988|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-35721-0|page=67}}</ref> On 21 July 1873, on the nomination of [[William Gladstone]], he was appointed a brother of the [[London Charterhouse]], where he died on 20 April 1887.<ref name="DNB"/>

== The Syncretics ==
Heraud was identified as a leading figure in the "Syncretics", a proto-aesthetic group mocked in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and prominent around 1840.<ref name="N629">Nadelhaft, p. 629.</ref> After a few years the excitement around their eclectic approach subsided. A biographer of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who initially took a great interest, has called Heraud in particular a "general failure".<ref name="Allen">{{cite book |author=Gay Wilson Allen |title=Waldo Emerson: A biography |year=1981 |publisher=Viking Press |isbn=978-0670748662 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waldoemerson00gayw/page/408 408] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/waldoemerson00gayw/page/408 }}</ref>

=== The group ===
Other Syncretics were [[Francis Foster Barham]], [[Richard Henry Horne]], and [[John Westland Marston]].<ref name="N629"/> Barham and Heraud founded the Syncretic Society, or Syncretic Association.<ref>Nadelhaft, p. 632.</ref> It grew out of an earlier group round [[James Pierrepont Greaves]], the "Aesthetic Society" or "Aesthetic Institution", based in Burton Street on the north side of [[Bloomsbury]], with a core of Greaves and a few neighbours. Heraud and Barham took over the ''Monthly Magazine'', and it functioned as the organ of the group in the period 1839 to 1841.<ref>Thomson, p. 378.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=J. E. M. Latham|title=Search for a New Eden: James Pierrepont Greaves (1777–1842): The Sacred Socialist and His Followers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6BzfM3zRSMC&pg=PA80|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3809-5|pages=80}}</ref> [[Camilla Toulmin (writer)|Camilla Toulmin]] gained the impression in 1841, visiting Horne, that there was a group of younger and ambitious men in the Syncretics, besides the better-known names.<ref>[[Camilla Dufour Crosland]], ''Landmarks of a Literary Life 1820–1892'' (1893), p. 279; [https://archive.org/stream/landmarksofliter00cros#page/278/mode/2up archive.org.]</ref> For example, the Syncretics took up the ''Festus'' of [[Philip James Bailey]].<ref name="McK">McKillop, p. 762 note 80.</ref>

=== Transatlantic ties ===
The group also found kinship with, and encouragement from, the New England [[transcendentalists]].<ref name="McK"/> [[Bronson Alcott]] corresponded with Greaves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tiffany K. Wayne|title=Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hckauAdkix0C&pg=PA131|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0916-9|page=131}}</ref> He also sent books to Greaves and Heraud; Greaves sent back books including Heraud's ''Lecture on Poetic Genius''.<ref>Wagner p. 304 note 7 and p. 306 note 2.</ref> Approval of the ''Monthly Magazine'' was strong from Alcott, [[Convers Francis]] and [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]]. Heraud published one piece from New England in 1839, an oration by Robert Bartlett. It proved a false start, though. Later in the year the transcendentalists founded their own periodical, ''[[The Dial]]'', along the same lines.<ref>{{cite book |author=Catherine L. Albanese |title=Corresponding Motion: Transcendental religion and the new America |url=https://archive.org/details/correspondingmot0000alba |url-access=registration |year=1977 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-0877220985 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/correspondingmot0000alba/page/98 98–9]}}</ref>

Writing in ''The Dial'' in 1842, Emerson in his article ''English Reformers'' praised Heraud as an interpreter of [[Jakob Boehme]] and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]; and referenced his papers ''Foreign Aids to Self Intelligence'', which had been announced as a three-volume work.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ralph Waldo Emerson|author2=Margaret Fuller|author3=George Ripley|title=The Dial: A Magazine for Literature, Philosophy, and Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/dial02riplgoog|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=1843|publisher=Weeks, Jordan|page=[https://archive.org/details/dial02riplgoog/page/n238 231]}}</ref> Heraud took Emerson to be a disciple of Carlyle, and was contradicted in ''The Present''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Clarence L.

Carlyle in fact disapproved of the group around Heraud and Alcott House, Greaves's project. These included [[John Goodwyn Barmby]], [[Newton Crosland]], Horne, [[Henry Mansel]], and [[James Elishama Smith]].<ref name="Allen"/>

=== Drama activism ===
A series of public lectures by the Syncretic Association started early in 1841. [[Bayle Bernard]] was one of the speakers, and the talks took place in the Suffolk Street Gallery, London.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New monthly belle assemblée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EEFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA184|accessdate=1 April 2013|publisher=Joseph Rogerson|page=184}}</ref> A circumstantial account, ''"Damned" Tragedies'', was given in the July 1842 ''Fraser's Magazine''. Bernard's talk was light-hearted chat about actors, but Heraud and [[Frederick Guest Tomlins]] addressed more serious aspects and limitations of current British theatre, before the weekly series outstayed its welcome at the Gallery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Carlyle|title=Fraser's Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UufUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA93|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=1842|publisher=J. Fraser|pages=93–102}}</ref>

The Syncretics, who included also [[George Stephens (playwright)|George Stephens]], became active in agitation to have unperformed drama staged. The context was the restriction in London to three theatres with patents, and an absence of new [[verse drama]] productions.<ref>Thomson, p. 380.</ref> Not short of ambition, the Dramatic Committee of the Association, through Heraud, pressed for a reformed and poetic theatre, an actors' joint stock company, and the performance of new work, as well as drama schools to elevate taste.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jane Moody|title=Illegitimate Theatre in London, 1770–1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4hXMycHTe0C&pg=PA178|accessdate=3 April 2013|date=30 July 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03986-4|page=178 note 2}}</ref> A failed demonstration, ''Martinuzzi'' of 1841, written by Stephens, led to Heraud in particular being lampooned in ''Punch'', by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].<ref>Nadelhaft, p. 637–8.</ref> The existing theatrical monopoly was, however, abolished by the [[Theatres Act 1843]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=26382|title=Stephens, George|first=John Russell|last=Stephens}}</ref>

Heraud himself wrote dramas and persisted. The tragedy of ''Videna'', based on [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], was acted at the Marylebone Theatre in 1854, with [[James William Wallack]]; and ''Wife or No Wife'' and a version of [[Ernest Legouvé]]'s ''Medea'' were staged later.<ref name="DNB"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The New quarterly review, and digest of current literature|year = 1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1YFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA12|accessdate=1 April 2013|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Westland Marston|title=Our Recent Actors: Being Recollections Critical, And, in Many Cases, Personal, of Late Distinguished Performers of Both Sexes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO8izHOlRsQC&pg=PA4|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=24 May 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-04767-8|page=4 note}}</ref>

== Heraud as poet ==
''Harper's Cyclopædia of British and American poetry'' noted that as a poet, Heraud had been snubbed by the critics, "and not always unjustly". It also repeated the story attributed to [[Douglas Jerrold]], asked by Heraud whether he had seen "his ''Descent into Hell''", and replying that he'd like to.<ref>[[Epes Sargent (poet)|Epes Sargent]], ''Harper's Cyclopædia of British and American Poetry'' (1909) p. 519; [https://archive.org/stream/harperscyclopd01sarg#page/518/mode/2up archive.org.]</ref> Heraud made two attempts at epic grandeur in his poems ''The Descent into Hell'', 1830, and ''The Judgment of the Flood'', 1834. The view of ''[[Chambers's Cyclopædia of English Literature]]'' was that he attempted in poetry what [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] did in art: the vast, the remote, and the terrible. It found his ''Descent'' and ''Judgment'' to be "psychological curiosities" of "misplaced power".<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Carruthers|author-link=Robert Carruthers|title=Chambers's Cyclopædia of English Literature: A History, Critical and Biographical, of British and American Authors, with Specimens of Their Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaMaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=1880|publisher=American Book Exchange|page=42}}</ref> [[George Saintsbury]] put Heraud on a level with [[Edwin Atherstone]], and above [[Robert Pollok]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert F.

He places it with other, earlier attempts to dramatise [[Christian typology]], such as those of [[William Gilbank]] and [[Elizabeth Smith of Birmingham]]. He notes Heraud's familiarity with Coleridge's apologetics, and his reference to Martin in the annotations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert F. Tucker|title=Epic: Britain's Heroic Muse 1790–1910: Britain's Heroic Muse 1790–1910|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXeybhiRmagC&pg=PA281|accessdate=1 April 2013|date=17 April 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-152840-8|pages=281–2}}</ref>

Heraud later wrote a political epic, which remained unpublished. This work was under the influence of [[William James Linton]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Barrimore Smith|title=Radical Artisan: William James Linton 1812–1897|url=https://archive.org/details/radicalartisanwi0000smit|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=1973|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-87471-180-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/radicalartisanwi0000smit/page/93 93]}}</ref>
