==Biography==
Saotome's grandfather was a [[samurai]] of [[Aizu Domain]], and following the defeat of the domain in the [[Boshin War]], immigrated to the United States. However, he later returned to [[Yokohama]] and from there to Shanghai.  Saotomo was born in [[Harbin]], [[Manchuria]] in Northeast China, and thus was raised in [[Manchukuo]]; however, following the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]], he was evacuated to [[Kyushu]] in 1946. He moved to Tokyo in 1948, and attended [[Keio University]]'s Literature Department, but left school before graduating. In 1954, the noted author, [[Yamamoto Shugoro]], agreed to become his tutor.

In 1956, together with other like-minded authors, he formed a [[literary criticism]] group called ''Shosetsu Kaigi'' ("Fiction Conference"), with members supporting each other by reviewing each other's work.  One of the products of this collaboration was his novel ''Kyojin no Ori'', about the [[María Luz Incident]], which was awarded the 60th [[Naoki Prize]] (1968下).<ref name=naoki>{{cite web|url=http://www.bunshun.co.jp/shinkoukai/award/naoki/list.html|language=japanese|title=直木賞受賞者一覧|trans-title=Naoki Prize Winners List|publisher=日本文学振興会|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>
