'''Stanley Jasspon Kunitz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|n|ɪ|t|s}}; July 29, 1905{{spaced ndash}}May 14, 2006) was an American [[poet]]. He was appointed [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] twice, first in 1974 and then again in 2000.<ref>{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1971-1980 | url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1971-1980.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | access-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>

==Biography==
Kunitz was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], the youngest of three children, to Yetta Helen (''née'' Jasspon) and Solomon Z.

His father, a dressmaker of Russian Jewish heritage,<ref name=KimmelmanBTCRH-p323/>  committed [[suicide]] in a public park six weeks before Stanley was born.<ref name=BrahamJ-p65>{{cite book |author=Braham, Jeanne |title=The Light Within the Light |year=2007 |publisher=David R.

Kunitz and his two older sisters, Sarah and Sophia, were raised by his mother, who had made her way from [[Josvainiai|Yashwen]], Kovno, Lithuania by herself in 1890,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Feingold, Norma |author2=Nancy Sadick |name-list-style=amp |title=Water Street: World Within a World |year=1983 |publisher=Worcester Historical Museum |page=17 }}</ref>  and opened a [[dry goods]] store.<ref>{{cite book |author=Magill, Frank Northen |title=Critical Survey of Poetry: English Language Series |year=1992 |publisher=Salem Press |isbn=978-0-89356-838-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/holmmacd0004unse/page/1881 1881] |url=https://archive.org/details/holmmacd0004unse/page/1881 }}</ref>  Yetta remarried to Mark Dine in 1912. Yetta and Mark filed for [[bankruptcy]] in 1912 and then were indicted by the [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]] for concealing assets.  They pleaded guilty and turned over [[United States dollar|USD$]]10,500 to the trustees.<ref>{{cite news|title=Creditors Get Property|newspaper=[[Boston Evening Transcript]]|date=June 28, 1912|page=6}}</ref>  Mark Dine died when Kunitz was fourteen,<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/>  when, while hanging curtains, he suffered a heart attack.<ref>{{citation |author=Goodyear, Dana |title=Profiles: THE GARDENER |page=107 |journal=The New Yorker |volume=79 |issue=21–28 |date=September 1, 2003 }}</ref>

At fifteen, Kunitz moved out of the house and became a butcher's assistant.<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/>  Later he got a job as a cub reporter on [[Telegram & Gazette|''The Worcester Telegram'']], where he would continue working during his summer vacations from college.<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/>

Kunitz graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1926 from [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] with an English major and a philosophy minor,<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/> and then earned a [[master's degree]] in English from Harvard the following year.  He wanted to continue his studies for a doctorate degree, but was told by the university that the Anglo-Saxon students would not like to be taught by a Jew.<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/>

After Harvard, he worked as a reporter for ''The Worcester Telegram'', and as editor for the H. W. Wilson Company in [[New York City]].  He then founded and edited ''[[Wilson Library Bulletin]]'' and started the ''Author Biographical Studies''.<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/>  Kunitz married Helen Pearce in 1930;<ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/> they divorced in 1937.<ref name=OrrG-pxxviii>Orr. p.xxviii.</ref>  In 1935 he moved to New Hope, Pennsylvania and befriended [[Theodore Roethke]].<ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/>  He married Eleanor Evans in 1939; they had a daughter Gretchen in 1950.<ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/> Kunitz divorced Eleanor in 1958.<ref name=OrrG-pxxix>Orr. p.xxix.</ref>

At Wilson Company, Kunitz served as co-editor for ''Twentieth Century Authors'', among other reference works.  In 1931, as Dilly Tante, he edited ''Living Authors, a Book of Biographies''.  His poems began to appear in [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']], ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', and ''[[The Dial]]''.

During [[World War II]], he was drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]] in 1943 as a [[conscientious objector]], and after undergoing basic training three times, served as a noncombatant at Gravely Point, Washington in the Air Transport Command in charge of information and education. He refused a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] and was discharged with the rank of [[staff sergeant]].<ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/>

After the war, he began a peripatetic teaching career at [[Bennington College]] (1946–1949), taking over from Roethke.<ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/> He subsequently taught at the [[State University of New York at Potsdam]] (then the New York State Teachers College at Potsdam) as a full professor (1949–1950; summer sessions through 1954), the [[New School for Social Research]] (lecturer; 1950-1957), the [[University of Washington]] (visiting professor; 1955-1956), [[Queens College]] (visiting professor; 1956–1957), [[Brandeis University]] (poet-in-residence; 1958-1959) and [[Columbia University]] (lecturer in the [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]]; 1963–1966) before spending 18 years as an adjunct professor of writing at Columbia's [[Columbia University School of the Arts|School of the Arts]] (1967–1985). Throughout this period, he also held visiting appointments at [[Yale University]] (1970), [[Rutgers University–Camden]] (1974), [[Princeton University]] (1978) and [[Vassar College]] (1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002462887|title=Marquis Biographies Online|website=search.marquiswhoswho.com}}</ref>

After his divorce from Eleanor, he married the painter and poet [[Elise Asher]] in 1958.<ref>{{citation |title=Elise Asher, 92, Painter-Poet Who Blended Images and Words |author=Saxon, Wolfgang |date=March 13, 2004 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref> His marriage to Asher led to friendships with artists like [[Philip Guston]] and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=OrrG-pxxix/>

Kunitz's poetry won wide praise for its profundity and quality. He was the New York State Poet Laureate from 1987 to 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/newyork.html|work=US State Poets Laureate|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> He continued to write and publish until his centenary year, as late as 2005. Many consider that his poetry's [[symbol]]ism is influenced significantly by the work of [[Carl Jung]]. Kunitz influenced many 20th-century poets, including [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], [[Mark Doty]], [[Louise Glück]], Joan Hutton Landis, and Carolyn Kizer.

For most of his life, Kunitz divided his time between New York City and [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. He enjoyed gardening and maintained one of the most impressive seaside gardens in Provincetown. There he also founded [[Fine Arts Work Center]], where he was a mainstay of the literary community, as he was of [[Poets House]] in Manhattan.

He was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award in Sherborn, Massachusetts in October 1998 for his contribution to the liberation of the human spirit through his poetry.<ref>[http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214172308/http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html |date=2009-02-14 }}</ref>

He died in 2006 at his home in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lehmann-Haupt |first=Christopher |title=Stanley Kunitz, Poet Laureate, Dies at 100 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 16, 2006 }}</ref>  He had previously come close to death, and reflected on the experience in his last book, a collection of essays, ''The Wild Braid: A Poet Reflects on a Century in the Garden''.

==Poetry==
Kunitz's first collection of poems, ''Intellectual Things,'' was published in 1930. His second volume of poems, ''Passport to the War'', was published fourteen years later; the book went largely unnoticed, although it featured some of Kunitz's best-known poems, and soon fell out of print. Kunitz's confidence was not in the best of shape when, in 1959, he had trouble finding a publisher for his third book, ''Selected Poems: 1928-1958.'' Despite this unflattering experience, the book, eventually published by Little Brown, received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]].

|date=}}

His next volume of poems would not appear until 1971, but Kunitz remained busy through the 1960s editing reference books and translating Russian poets. When twelve years later ''The Testing Tree'' appeared, Kunitz's style was radically transformed from the highly intellectual and philosophical musings of his earlier work to more deeply personal yet disciplined narratives; moreover, his lines shifted from [[iambic pentameter]] to a freer [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] based on instinct and breath—usually resulting in shorter stressed lines of three or four beats.

Throughout the 70s and 80s, he became one of the most treasured and distinctive voices in American poetry. His collection ''Passing Through: The Later Poems'' won the [[National Book Award for Poetry]] in 1995.<ref name=nba1995/> Kunitz received many other honors, including a [[National Medal of Arts]], the [[Bollingen Prize]] for a lifetime achievement in poetry, the [[Robert Frost Medal]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s Centennial Medal. He served two terms as Consultant on Poetry for the [[Library of Congress]] (the precursor title to Poet Laureate), one term as Poet Laureate of the United States, and one term as the State Poet of [[New York State|New York]]. He founded the [[Fine Arts Work Center]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], and [[Poets House]] in [[New York City]]. Kunitz also acted as a judge for the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition]].

==Library Bill of Rights==
Kunitz served as editor of the ''[[Wilson Library Bulletin]]'' from 1928 to 1943. An outspoken critic of censorship, in his capacity as editor, he targeted his criticism at librarians who did not actively oppose it. He published an article in 1938 by [[Bernard Berelson]] entitled "The Myth of Library Impartiality". This article led [[Forrest Spaulding]] and the Des Moines Public Library to draft the [[Library Bill of Rights]], which was later adopted by the [[American Library Association]] and continues to serve as the cornerstone document on intellectual freedom in libraries.<ref>McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011).
