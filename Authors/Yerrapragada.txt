'''Errapragada Erranna'''  was a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] poet in the court of King [[Reddi Kingdom|Prolaya Vema Reddy]] (1325–1353). The surname of Erranna was '''Yerrapragada''' or '''Errapregada''', which are epithets of the fair-skinned [[Murugan|Lord Skanda]] in the [[Telugu language]], but became attached to his paternal family due its having notable members with fair or red-skinned complexions. He was honoured with the title ''Prabandha-paramēśvara'' ("Master of historical anecdotes") and ''Śambhudāsuḍu'' ("Servant of Lord Śiva").<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/10/Telugu/Poetry/2%20VaishnavaYaagam.pdf Vaishanava yugamu]</ref>

==Birth and Ancestors==
Errapragada Erranna was born in the village of [[Gudlur]], located in Pakanadu (presently [[Prakasam district]]), and lived in Chadalawada, Prakasam district.  He belonged to the Śrīvatsa-gotra and Āpastamba-sūtra of the [[Niyogi Brahmin|Niyogī Brahma-bandhu]] caste. His father was Errapragada Suranna and mother was Errapragada Potamma.  His grandfather was Errapragada Errapotanna whose name was given to him and his grandmother was Errapragada Peramma. His great-grandparents were Errapragada Bolanna and Errapragada Polamma and his great-great-grandfather was Errapragada Bhimanna.  His family followed the Smārta tradition of the [[Hinduism|Vedic religion]]. Although Erranna was a devotee of Lord [[Shiva|Śiva]], he also worshipped the [[Vishnu|Supreme Personality of Godhead]].

==Contributions==
The [[Sanskrit]] [[Mahabharata]] was translated into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] over a period of several centuries (from the 11th to 14th centuries CE). Erranna was one of the ''[[kavitrayam]]'' ("Trinity of Poets") who rendered the [[Mahabharatam]] from Sanskrit into Telugu. The other two poets were [[Nannaya]] and [[Tikkana]] of the ''[[Andhra Mahabharatam]]'' ("Andhra Mahabharat"). Tikkana translated the remaining books starting from the 4th, leaving the third book titled the ''Aranya Parvamu'' ("Book of the Forest") half-finished, for Erranna to complete. [[Tikkana]] did not touch this part because it was considered to be inauspicious to translate this book, which was left half-finished by [[Nannaya]]. Erranna started the remaining half of the ''Aranya Parvamu'' with the style of Nannaya and ended it with the style of Tikkana as a bridge between the parts translated by Nannaya and Tikkana. Just like Nannaya and Tikkanna, he used half [[Sanskrit]] and half [[Telugu language|Telugu]] in his Telugu translation of the Sanskrit Mahabharata. He translated the ''Harivamsamu''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Errapragada |title=Harivamsamu |date=1926 |publisher=Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons |location=Madras |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.333032/mode/2up |access-date=16 June 2020 |language=te}}</ref> and ''Ramayanamu'' from Sanskrit, dedicating both works to the founder of the Reddy Dynasty, King Prolaya Vemareddy.

''Nrusimhapuranamu'' was his own independent work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Errapragada |title=Nrisimhapuranamu |date=1960 |publisher=Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons |location=Madras |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.329346/mode/2up |access-date=16 June 2020 |language=te}}</ref> Erranna received his inspiration for the Nrusimhapuranam from his grandfather Errapotanna. According to tradition, one day when Erranna was meditating, his grandfather appeared and advised him to write the ''Narisimhapuranamu''. This work was based on the ''Brahmandapuranamu'' and the ''Vishnupuranamu''.

According to the ''Viṣṇu Purāṇa'', King Hiraṇyakaśipu was the powerful demonic sovereign of the Earth millions of year ago at the beginning of the ''[[Yuga Cycle]]''. The subjects of the Earth were described as ''Manavas'' ("descendants of Manu"; "humans"). The subjects of King Indra were described as ''Devatas''. King Hiraṇyakaśipu fought a war with King [[Indra]] and, having emerged victorious, took over the heavenly planets. Under the rule of King Hiraṇyakaśipu, most of the Devatas either "converted to" or disguised themselves as Manavas for the fear of King Hiraṇyakaśipu. Another contemporary of King Hiraṇyakaśipu was also gate keeper of Śvetadvīpa, the Vaikuṇṭha planet in this universe, in a previous life, Śrī-hari who ruled in the ''[[Kshir Sagar|Kṣīra-sāgara]]'' (the "Sea of Milk").
