'''Sir Harold Mario Mitchell Acton''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (5 July 1904 – 27 February 1994) was a British writer, scholar, and [[aesthete]] who was a prominent member of the [[Bright Young Things]]. He wrote fiction, biography, history and autobiography. During his stay in China, he studied the Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry, some of which he translated.

He was born near [[Florence]], Italy, to a prominent Anglo-Italian family. At [[Eton College]], he was a founding member of the [[Eton Arts Society]] before going up to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to read [[Modern Greats]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. He co-founded the avant garde magazine ''The Oxford Broom'' and mixed with many intellectual and literary figures of the age, including [[Evelyn Waugh]], who based the character of Anthony Blanche in ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' partly on him. Between the wars, Acton lived in Paris, London, and Florence, proving most successful as an historian, his ''[[magnum opus]]'' being a 3-volume study of the Medicis and the Bourbons.

After serving as an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] liaison officer in the Mediterranean, he returned to Florence, restoring his childhood home, [[Villa La Pietra]], to its earlier glory. Acton was knighted in 1974 and died in Florence, leaving La Pietra to [[New York University]].

== Early years ==
===Background===
[[File:Villa la pietra 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Villa La Pietra]]]]
Acton was born to a prominent Anglo-Italian-American family of [[Acton baronets#Acton baronets, of Aldenham (1644)|baronets]], later raised to the peerage as [[Baron Acton|Barons Acton of Aldenham]] at Villa La Pietra, his parents' house one mile outside the walls of Florence, Italy. He claimed that his great-great-grandfather was Commodore [[Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet|Sir John Acton]], 6th Baronet (1736–1811), who married his niece, Mary Anne Acton, and who was prime minister of [[Naples]] under [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] and grandfather of the Roman Catholic historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]. This relationship has been disproven; Harold Acton in fact descends from Sir John Acton's brother, General Joseph Edward Acton (1737–1830).<ref>Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 1999, 106th edition, ed. Charles Mosley, vol. 1, p. 28</ref> Both of these brothers served in Italy, and are from the [[Shropshire]] family of Actons.

His father was the successful art collector and dealer [[Arthur Acton]] (1873–1953), the illegitimate son of Eugene Arthur Roger Acton (1836–1895), counsellor to the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.<ref>Armorial Families: A Directory of Gentlemen of Coat Armour, A.

==Career and education==
His early schooling was at Miss Penrose's private school in Florence. In 1913, his parents sent him to [[Wixenford School|Wixenford Preparatory School]] near Reading in southern England,<ref name=WaughGallagher83>[[Evelyn Waugh]], 1983, ''The Essays, Articles and Reviews of Evelyn Waugh,'' Donat Gallagher, Ed., London, LND, GBN: Methuen Limited, {{ISBN|0413503704}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=nlEeAQAAIAAJ], accessed 11 July 2015. ''"Page numbers given inline."''</ref>{{rp|17}} where [[Kenneth Clark]] was a fellow-pupil. By 1916 submarine attacks on shipping had made the journey to England unsafe and so Harold and his brother were sent in September to Chateau de Lancy, an international school near Geneva.  In the autumn of 1917, he went to a 'crammers' at Ashlawn in [[Kent]] to be prepared for [[Eton College|Eton]], which he entered on 1 May 1918. Among his contemporaries at Eton were [[Eric Blair]] (the writer [[George Orwell]]), [[Cyril Connolly]], [[Robert Byron]], [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]], [[Oliver Messel]], [[Anthony Powell]], [[Steven Runciman]], and [[Henry Vincent Yorke|Henry Yorke]] (the novelist [[Henry Green]]).  In his final years at school, Acton became a founding member of the Eton Arts Society, and eleven of his poems appeared in ''The Eton Candle'', edited by his friend Brian Howard.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lancaster |first1=Marie-Jaqueline |title=Brian Howard: Portrait of Failure |date=6 April 2007 |publisher=Green Candy Press |isbn=978-1931160506 |pages=398}}</ref>

===Oxford years===
In October 1923, Acton went up to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] to read Modern Greats at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. It was from the balcony of his rooms in Meadow Buildings that he declaimed passages from ''[[The Waste Land]]'' through a megaphone (an episode recounted in ''Brideshead Revisited,'' through the character Anthony Blanche). While at Oxford, he co-founded the avant garde magazine ''The Oxford Broom'', and published his first book of poems, ''Aquarium'' (1923). Acton was regarded as a leading figure of his day and would often receive more attention in memoirs of the period than men who were much more successful in later life; for example, the Welsh playwright [[Emlyn Williams]] described this encounter with Acton in his autobiography ''George'' (1961):{{quote|1="Bowing with the courtesy of another age and clime, he spoke, an English flawlessly italianated [sic]. 'I do most dreadfully beg your pardons this inclement night – though I have been resident a year, I find it too idiotically difficult to find my way about, I have been round [[Tom Tower|Tom]] like a tee-toe-tum, too too madd-ening – where ''does'' our dear Dean hang out?' He thanked me profusely, raised the bowler with a dazzling smile, and propelled himself Deanward, an Oriental diplomat off to leave a jewelled [[visiting card|carte de visite]]. 'Jesus,' said Evvers, 'what's that?'  'He's ''the'' Oxford aesthete,' I informed him, 'a Victorian, his rooms in Meadow are in lemon yellow and he stands on his balcony and reads his poems through a megaphone to people passing, and he belongs to the [[Hypocrites' Club]] with [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]] and [[Robert Byron]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]] and all that set, they call themselves the Post-War Generation and wear Hearts on their lapels as opposed to the pre-war [[Rupert Brooke]] lot who called themselves Souls. They're supposed to eat new-born babies cooked in wine.'"<ref name="Williams">{{cite book | last=Williams | first=Emlyn | title=George: An Early Autobiography | year=1965 | orig-year=1961 | publisher = New English Library (Four Square) | location = London, LND, GBN  | url=http://papyrocentricperformativity.wordpress.com/words-on-waughs-world/wafted-onto-the-antimacassars/ | access-date = 11 July 2015 | quote=''Page numbers given inline.'' }}</ref>{{rp|260''f''}} }} Williams also described Acton's review of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' in the Oxford student newspaper ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'': "a charming boy's book, we would suggest a cheap edition to fit comfortably into the pocket of a school blazer"; and summarised Acton's modernist approach to literature: "But if one finds the words, my dears, there is beauty in a black-pudding."<ref name="Williams" />{{rp|314}}

===Influence on Waugh===
[[Evelyn Waugh]] peopled his novels with composite characters based upon individuals he knew. Acton is reputed to have inspired, at least in part, the character of "Anthony Blanche" in Waugh's novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1945). In a letter to Lord Baldwin, Waugh wrote, "There is an aesthetic bugger who sometimes turns up in my novels under various names – that was 2/3 Brian [Howard] and 1/3 Harold Acton. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man [than Howard]."<ref name=WaughArmory80>{{cite book |last=Waugh |first=Evelyn | editor=Mark Amory |year=1980 |title=The Letters of Evelyn Waugh |publisher=Orion-[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] |isbn=1857992458 |location=London, LND, GBN | quote=''Page numbers given inline.''}}</ref>{{rp|505}} Waugh also wrote, "The characters in my novels often wrongly identified with Harold Acton were to a great extent drawn from [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dougill |first1=John |year=1998 |title=Oxford in English Literature |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordinenglishl00doug |url-access=registration |quote=wrongly identified with Harold Acton. |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordinenglishl00doug/page/319 319] |isbn=0472107844 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}</ref>

===General strike and after===
In 1926 Acton acted as a ''special constable'' during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]], apolitical as he was, and took his degree. In October he took an apartment in Paris, at 29 Quai de Bourbon, and had his portrait painted by Pavel Tchelitcheff.<ref>Harold Acton, ''Memoirs of an Aesthete'', 1948.</ref> Moving between Paris and London in the next few years, Acton sought to find his voice as a writer. In 1927 he began work on a novel, and a third book of poems, ''Five Saints and an Appendix'', came out early the following year. This was followed by a prose fable, ''Cornelian'', in March. In July Acton acted as Best Man at the wedding of Evelyn Waugh to the Honourable Evelyn Gardner. Waugh's ''Decline and Fall'' bore a dedication to Acton 'in Homage and Affection', but when Acton's own novel – disastrously entitled ''Humdrum'' – appeared in October 1928, it was slated in comparison with ''Decline and Fall'' by critics such as Cyril Connolly.

In the later 1920s Harold frequented the London salon of [[Maud Cunard|Lady Cunard]], where at various times he encountered [[Ezra Pound]], [[Joseph Duveen]] and the Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]]. On visits to Florence he cemented his friendship with [[Norman Douglas]], who wrote an introduction to Acton's translation of a lubricious 18th-century memoir of Giangastone de' Medici, ''The Last of the Medici'', privately printed in Florence in 1930 as part of the Lungarno Series. A fourth collection of poems, ''This Chaos'', was published in Paris by Acton's friend Nancy Cunard, though the Giangastone translation pointed in a more promising direction. History was indeed to prove far more congenial to Acton than poetry. His ''The Last Medici'' (not to be confused with the earlier book of similar title) was published by Faber in 1932, the first of a series of distinguished contributions to Italian historical studies.<ref name=Gumbel96>Andrew Gumbel, 1996, "Shadow of the Last Aesthete," ''The Independent'' (online), 14 April 1996, see [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/shadow-of-the-last-aesthete-1304745.html], accessed 11 July 2015. [Subtitle: "In his Tuscan palazzo, Sir Harold Acton created what he hoped would be an enduring idyll. Two years after his death, the dream has turned sour."]</ref>

One close observer, Alan Pryce-Jones, felt that life in Florence weighed upon Acton with its triviality, for, like his father, he was a hard worker and a careful scholar. The East was an escape.<ref name=PryceJones94>Alan Pryce-Jones, 1994, "Obituary: Sir Harold Acton," ''The Independent'' (online), 28 February 1994, see [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-harold-acton-1397017.html], accessed 11 July 2015.</ref> He took up residence in Peking, as Beijing was then known, which he found congenial. He studied Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry. Between his arrival in 1932 and 1939 he published respected translations of ''[[Peach Blossom Fan]]'' and  ''Modern Chinese Poetry'' (1936), both in collaboration with Ch'en Shih-hsiang ([[:zh:陳世驤 (文學家)|陳世驤]]),<ref>John C. Jamieson, Cyril Birch & Yuen Ren Chao, 1974, "Shih-Hsiang Chen, Oriental Languages, Berkeley (1912–1971), Professor of Chinese and Comparative Literature," at ''University of California, In memoriam, 1974'' (online), pp.&nbsp;20–22, Berkeley CA, USA: Academic Senate, Berkeley Division, [http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00007&toc.depth=1&toc.id= p. 5], accessed 11 July 2015.</ref> and ''Famous Chinese Plays'' (1937) in collaboration with L.C. Arlington. His novel ''Peonies and Ponies'' (1941) is a sharp portrait of expatriate life. He translated ''Glue and Lacquer'' (1941), selected from the 17th century writer [[Feng Menglong]]'s  ''[[Illustrious Words to Instruct the World|Tales to Rouse the World]]'', with a preface by [[Arthur Waley]], the leading scholar-translator and member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]].

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, but Acton did not leave until 1939, when he returned to England and joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as a liaison officer. He served in India and what was then Ceylon, and then after the Liberation in Paris. When the war was over, he returned to Florence. La Pietra had been occupied by German soldiers, but he expeditiously restored it to its proper glory.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/obituaries/sir-harold-acton-is-dead-at-89-prototypic-esthete-of-the-1920-s.html Sir Harold Acton Is Dead At 89; Prototypic Esthete Of The 1920s] John Darnton, New York Times 1 March 1994</ref>

== Literary works ==
<!-- {{expand section|a more thorough rendering, with citations of scholarship, especially of the poetic and historical works (European and Chinese years)|small=no|date=July 2015}} -->
Acton's non-historical works include four volumes of poetry, three novels, two novellas, two volumes of short stories, two volumes of autobiography and a memoir of his friend [[Nancy Mitford]], who was his exact contemporary. His historical works include  ''The Last Medici'', a study of the later Medici Grand Dukes, and two large volumes on the [[House of Bourbon]], rulers of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in the 18th and earlier 19th century, which together may be said to constitute his ''magnum opus''.

After Acton's death, in reply to a magazine article that speculated both about the probable suicide of Acton's brother and about Acton's homosexuality, author [[A. N. Wilson]] remarked, "To call him homosexual would be to misunderstand the whole essence of his being" and that "He was more asexual than anything else".<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> The article, by American writer [[David Plante]], described Acton's time at Oxford as a "virile aesthete-dandy," but noted that while in China during the 1930s Acton's predilection for boys led to a classified government document describing him as a "scandalous debauchee," and prevented the possibility of his serving in the intelligence services there, when war broke out. Plante also described the young men whom Acton welcomed to La Pietra, including Alexander Zielcke, a German photographer and artist who was Acton's lover for the last twenty-five years of his life.<ref name="independent.co.uk">Andrew Gumbel, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/shadow-of-the-last-aesthete-1304745.html Shadow of the Last Aesthete] ''Independent'' 13 April 1996</ref>
