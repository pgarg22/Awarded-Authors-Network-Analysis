'''Philip Glenn Whalen''' (October 20, 1923 – June 26, 2002) was an American [[poet]], [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]], and a key figure in the [[San Francisco Renaissance]] and close to the [[Beat generation]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Portland, Oregon]], Whalen grew up in [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] from age four until he returned to Portland in 1941.<ref>Suiter 2002, pg. 53</ref> He served in the [[US Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. He attended [[Reed College]] on the [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|GI Bill]].   There, he met [[Gary Snyder]] and [[Lew Welch]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1951. He read at the famous [[Six Gallery reading]] in 1955 that marked the launch of the West Coast Beats into the public eye.<ref>Fields 1992, pp. 212</ref> He appears, in barely fictionalized form, as the character "Warren Coughlin" in [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', which includes an account of that reading.<ref name="beatdom">{{cite web|title=Who’s Who: A Guide to Kerouac’s Characters|url=http://www.beatdom.com/?page_id=349|publisher=Beatdom|access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> In ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'' he is called "Ben Fagan".<ref name="beatdom"/> Whalen's poetry was featured in [[Donald Allen]]'s anthology ''[[The New American Poetry 1945-1960]]''.

Whalen's first interest in [[Eastern religion]]s centered on [[Vedanta]].  Upon release from the army in 1946, he visited the Vedanta Society in Portland, but did not pursue this very far, because of the expense of attending their countryside ashram.  [[Tibetan Buddhism]] also attracted him, but he found it "unnecessarily complicated."  In 1952, Gary Snyder lent him books on [[Zen]] by [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|D. T. Suzuki]]. With Snyder, Whalen attended a study group at the [[Jōdo Shinshū|Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist Church]] in Berkeley.<ref>Fields 1992, pp. 214</ref> Ultimately, Zen became his chosen path.<ref>Suiter 2002, pp. 68-70</ref>

Whalen spent 1966 and 1967 in [[Kyoto, Japan]], assisted by a grant from [[the American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and a job teaching English. There, he practiced [[zazen]] daily, and wrote some forty poems and a second novel.<ref name="Suiter 251">Suiter 2002, pg. 251-4</ref>

He moved into the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and became a student of [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]] in 1972.  The following year, he became a monk.  He became head monk of Dharma Sangha, in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 1984.  In 1987, he received transmission from Baker, and in 1991, he returned to San Francisco to lead the [[Hartford Street Zen Center]] until ill health forced him to retire.<ref name="Suiter 251"/>
