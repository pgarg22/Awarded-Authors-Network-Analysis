[[File:Dóczi Lajos 1897-23.JPG|thumb|right|Lajos Dóczi]]
Baron '''Lajos Dóczi''', aka '''Dóczy''' ({{lang-hu|'''Dóczi Lajos, báró'''}}, {{lang-de|'''Ludwig (Louis) Dóczy'''}} (born "'''''[[Dux]]'''''"), 29/30 November 1845, [[Sopron]] (Oedenburg) - 28 August 1918, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Jewish]] (later [[Christians|Christian]]) [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[poet]], [[journalist]]. His father, Adolf Dux, was a [[vintner|wine trader]], and is not to be confused with the writer of the same name, [[Adolf Dux]].

After finishing his preliminary education he studied law in [[Vienna]], joining at the same time the staff of ''[[Die Presse]]''. His political articles, which advocated the "[[Ausgleich]]" (agreement) with Austria, were very favorably received, and on the recommendation of Balthasar Horváth, then [[Minister of Justice]], he was appointed (1868) clerk in the office of the [[prime minister]].

When Count [[Julius Andrássy]] became [[minister of foreign affairs]] (1872) Dóczy accompanied him to Vienna, and was soon appointed "[[Sectionsrath]]", and later "[[Hofrath]]", at the [[Foreign Office]]. In 1899 he was elevated to the rank of [[baron]], and in 1902 retired from public life. He resided in [[Deutschkreutz]] and Budapest.

Dóczy's reputation rests not on the services he rendered to the state, but on his achievements as a dramatic writer and as a translator. ''Csók'' (''The Kiss''), his best-known comedy, which is played in German as well as in Hungarian theaters, gained the prize of the [[Hungarian Academy]] in 1871; the German translation was made by the author himself.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Among his other plays are:
* ''Utolsó Szerelem'' (Last Love), 1879
* ''Széchy Mária'', 1886
* ''Vegyes: Párok'' (Mixed Marriages), 1889
* ''Vera Grófnő'', 1891
* ''Ellinor Királyleány'', tragedy, 1897

Besides these he translated Schauffert's comedy ''Schach dem König'', 1873, and wrote the [[libretto]] to [[Karl Goldmark]]'s ''[[Merlin (Goldmark)|Merlin]]'' and to [[Johann Strauss II.]]'s ''[[Ritter Pázmán]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

His [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] translation of [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' and his German adaptation of [[Imre Madách]]'s ''[[Az ember tragédiája]]'' (German: ''Die Tragödie des Menschen'') were well received.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} His collected poems and novels appeared in 1890. His last work was a Hungarian translation of [[Schiller]]'s poems (1902).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
