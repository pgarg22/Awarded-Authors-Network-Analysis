 }}</ref> His bestselling novel ''Falstaff'', published in 1976, was described by Michael Ratcliffe (writing in ''[[The Times]]'') as "one of the most ambitious and seductive novels of the decade", and went on to win both [[The Hawthornden Prize]] and [[Guardian Fiction Prize]]. The novel was also included in [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[Ninety-Nine Novels|99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939]]'' (1984).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/poet-and-awardwinning-falstaff-novelist-robert-nye-dies-aged-77-34852101.html|title=Poet and award-winning Falstaff novelist Robert Nye dies aged 77|newspaper=belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

==Early life==
Robert Nye was born in [[London]] in  1939.<ref name="Ray">"Nye, Robert (1939-), in Ray, Mohit K (ed.) (2007) ''The Atlantic Companion To Literature In English'', Atlantic, New Delhi, {{ISBN|978-81-269-0832-5}}, p. 402</ref> His father was a civil servant, his mother a farmer's daughter. He attended [[Southend High School for Boys]] and had published his first poem, "Kingfisher", in the ''[[London Magazine]]'' (September 1955; Volume 2, Number 9) by the age of sixteen.<ref name="Ray" /> {{cns|text=He left school in 1955 and did not pursue additional formal study. Nye's poetry has appeared in a number of important literary magazines, including ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' and ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''. The 1964 Fall and Winter issues of the Canadian publication ''[[The Fiddlehead]]'' contained respectively fifteen and eighteen of his poems.|date=July 2018}}

{{cns|text=He was a [[conscientious objector]] during [[National Service]], c 1957-59, and was given exemption from military service conditional upon joining the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] and serving as a medical orderly at St Wulstan's Sanatorium, near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], and then at [[Rochford]] General Hospital in [[Essex]].|date=July 2018}}

At other times between 1955 and 1961 he worked at a variety of jobs: newspaper reporter, milkman, postman and labourer in a market garden.<ref name="Ray" />

Nye married his first wife, Judith Pratt, in 1959.<ref name="Ray" /> In 1961 they moved to a remote cottage in north Wales, where Nye devoted himself full-time to writing.<ref name="Ray" /> There he developed an interest in [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] and [[Celtic legends]], reflected later in his fiction for both adults and children.<ref name="Ray" />

== Writing career ==
His first book, ''Juvenilia 1'' (1961), was a collection of  poems. A second volume, ''Juvenilia 2'' (1963), won the [[Eric Gregory Award]].<ref name="Ray" /> Both volumes were enthusiastically received and [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] described Nye as showing a "precocity unique in this century". This view was supported by [[G. S. Fraser]], who in an article in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' convincingly established an affinity between Nye's early poetry and that of [[Robert Graves]]. To support his continuance as a poet, Nye began to contribute reviews to British literary journals and newspapers. He became the poetry editor for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' in 1967, and served as poetry critic of ''[[The Times]]'' from 1971 to 1996, while also contributing regular reviews of new fiction to ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="Ray" />

Nye started writing stories for children to entertain his three young sons. His children's novel ''Taliesin'' and a collection of stories called ''March Has Horse's Ears'' were published by [[Faber and Faber]] in 1966. When Nye published his first adult novel, ''Doubtfire'' (1967), it was described by [[P. J. Kavanagh]] as "breathless" and "brilliant"; Kavanagh also referred to the author's "love affair with rhythms and language". That same year Nye divorced his first wife. A year later he married Aileen Campbell,<ref name="Ray" /> {{cns|text=an artist, graduate of [[Glasgow School of Art]], subsequently an analytical psychologist (diploma [[C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich]]). She provided the illustrations for ''Bee Hunter: Adventures of Beowulf'' and was an inspiration for some of Nye's most personal poetry of the time (notably "In More's Hotel"). Campbell also designed the masks used in the 1973 performance of one of the author's more unusual projects, ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' (1974). The two moved to [[Edinburgh]], where they lived until 1977. She has also had poetry published in [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] anthologies and other journals, also in [[Antonia Fraser]]'s ''Scottish Love Poems''.|date=July 2018}}

Nye's next publication after ''Doubtfire'' was a return to children's literature, a freewheeling version of ''[[Beowulf]]'' that has remained in print in many editions since 1968. In 1970, Nye published another children's book, ''Wishing Gold'', and received the James Kennaway Memorial Award for his collection of short stories, ''Tales I Told My Mother'' (1969).<ref name="Ray" />

During the early 1970s Nye wrote several plays for [[BBC]] radio, including ''A Bloody Stupid Hole'' (1970), ''Reynolds, Reynolds'' (1971), and a version of ''[[Penthesilea (Kleist)|Penthesilea]]'' by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] (1971).<ref name="Ray" /> He was also commissioned by [[Covent Garden Opera House]] to write an unpublished libretto for [[Harrison Birtwistle]]'s opera, ''[[Kronia]]'' (1970).<ref name="Ray" /> Nye held the position of writer in residence at the [[University of Edinburgh]], 1976–1977, during which time he received the [[Guardian Fiction Prize]], followed by the 1976 [[Hawthornden Prize]] for his novel ''Falstaff''.<ref name="Ray" />

{{cns|text=1978 saw the publication of Nye's ''Merlin'' excursion into the [[Matter of Britain]]. In 1990 Nye's novel ''The Life and Death of My Lord [[Gilles de Rais]]'' was published by [[Hamish Hamilton]] and is considered by many to be the author's masterpiece. The novel reportedly took only sixty days to write but represented the author's final release from a 35-year obsession with the story of [[Joan of Arc]] and her first Marshal of France. The seeds of the book can be found in the poem ''The Mystery of the Siege of Orleans'' first published in 1961 and in Nye's first novel ''Doubtfire''. [[Allan Massie]] reviewing the novel for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' concluded that "''The Life and Death of My Lord Gilles de Rais'' is a work of learning, wit and humanity....its understanding of depravity is extraordinary, the judgement impeccable...It is I think, the book he has worked all his life to write, and it is perfectly done; yes indeed a masterpiece."|date=July 2018}}

{{cns|text=Robert Nye continued to write poetry, publishing ''Darker Ends'' (1969), which launched [[Calder and Boyars]]' "Signature Series", later to include such authors as [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Edward Dahlberg]], and ''Divisions on a Ground'' (1976), and to prepare editions of other poets with whose work he felt an affinity: [[Sir Walter Ralegh]], [[William Barnes]], and [[Laura Riding]]. Nye's own ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 1995. His selected poems, entitled ''The Rain and The Glass'', published in 2005, won the [[Cholmondeley Award]]. His final collection, ''An Almost Dancer'', appeared in 2012. He lived from 1977 in [[County Cork]]. Although his novels have won prizes and been translated into many languages, it is as a poet that he would probably prefer to be remembered. The critic [[Gabriel Josipovici]] described Nye as "one of the most interesting poets writing today, with a voice unlike that of any of his contemporaries."|date=July 2018|reason=}}
