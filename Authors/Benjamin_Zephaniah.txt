He writes that his poetry is strongly influenced by the [[Music of Jamaica|music]] and poetry of Jamaica and what he calls "street politics". His first performance was in church when he was eleven, and by the age of 15, his poetry was already known among Handsworth's [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] and Asian communities.<ref name="Larkin">[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Larkin, Colin]] (1998), ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}</ref>

While living in London, Zephaniah was caught up in the [[1981 England riots|1980s race riots]] and experienced racism on a regular basis:<ref name="Maciuca">{{Cite web|last=Maciuca|first=Andra|date=2019-10-29|title=Benjamin Zephaniah on Nelson Mandela, Bob Marley and race riots|url=https://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/things-to-do/benjamin-zephaniah-about-his-life-at-saffron-hall-5427336|access-date=2021-04-29|website=Saffron Walden Reporter|language=en-UK}}</ref><blockquote>"They happened around me. Back then, racism was very in your face. There was the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] against black and foreign people and the police were also very racist. I got stopped four times after I bought a [[BMW]] when I became successful with poetry. I kept getting stopped by the police so I sold it."</blockquote>

== Written work and poetry ==
Zephaniah became actively involved in a workers' co-operative in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], London, which led to the publication of his first book of poetry, ''Pen Rhythm'' (Page One Books, 1980). Three editions were published. Zephaniah has said that his mission is to fight the dead image of poetry in [[academia]], and to "take [it] everywhere" to people who do not read books, so he turned poetry readings into concert-like performances.<ref name="bio" />

His second collection of poetry, ''The Dread Affair: Collected Poems'' (1985), contained a number of poems attacking the [[British legal system]]. ''Rasta Time in Palestine'' (1990), an account of a visit to the [[Palestinian occupied territories]], contained poetry and travelogue.

Zephaniah was poet in residence at the chambers of [[Michael Mansfield]] QC{{When|date=April 2021}}, and sat in on the inquiry into [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] and other cases, these experiences leading to his ''Too Black, Too Strong'' poetry collection (2001).<ref name="Kellaway" /> ''We Are Britain!''

At one point I was violent. I was never like one of these persons who have a girlfriend, who’d constantly beat them, but I could lose my temper sometimes."

“There was one girlfriend that I had, and I actually hit her a couple of times, and as I got older I really regretted it. It burned my conscience so badly. It really ate at me, you know. And I’m a meditator. It got in the way of my meditation.”</blockquote>Zephaniah's family were Christian but he became a [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] at a young age.<ref>{{cite web|author=Benjamin Zephaniah|title=Has Snoop Dogg seen the Rastafari light, or is this just a midlife crisis?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/snoop-dogg-rastafari|work=The Guardian|date=7 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-02-04|title=Benjamin Zephaniah: 'It is my duty to help and inspire'|url=https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2014/02/04/benjamin-zephaniah-interview|access-date=2021-04-29|website=New Internationalist|language=en}}</ref> He gave up smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in his thirties.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/benjamin-zephaniah-i-dont-want-to-grow-old-alone Benjamin Zephaniah: ‘I don’t want to grow old alone’] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 6 May 2018</ref>
