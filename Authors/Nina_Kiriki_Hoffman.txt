==Profile==

Hoffman started publishing short stories in 1975. Her first nationally published short story appeared in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine in 1983. She has since published over 200 in various anthologies and magazines.

Her short story "A Step Into Darkness" (1985) was one of the winners of the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Writers of the Future]] award and was published in the first of the ''Writers of the Future'' anthologies.

Her second collection of short stories, ''Courting Disasters and Other Strange Affinities'', was nominated for the 1992 [[Locus Award]] for best collection of the year.

Her [[novella]] '"Unmasking", published in 1992 by [[Pulphouse Publishing|Axolotl Press]], was a finalist for the 1993 [[World Fantasy Award]].  Her novella "Haunted Humans" (seen in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', July 1994) was a finalist for the 1995 [[Nebula Award for Best Novella]] and on the same ballot her [[Novella|novelette]] "The Skeleton Key" was shortlisted for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette]]. Her short story "Trophy Wives" won the 2008 [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Science Fiction Awards Watch: 2009 Nebula Awards|url=http://www.sfawardswatch.com/?p=1857}}</ref>

Her first novel, ''The Thread That Binds the Bones'', won the [[Bram Stoker Award]] for first novel.
