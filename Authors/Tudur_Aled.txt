'''Tudur Aled''' (c. 1465 â€“ 1525) was a late medieval [[Welsh language|Welsh]] poet, born in [[Llansannan]], [[Denbighshire]] (Sir Ddinbych). He is regarded as a master of [[cynghanedd]].

==Beginnings==
It is uncertain when Tudur Aled started to write poetry. A remark by him in his elegy to [[Dafydd ab Edmwnd]] suggests that Tudur Aled was his pupil. There are firm references to the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Battle of Blackheath]] (1497). An allusion to the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] (1485) has been suspected in his [[cywydd]] to Sir William Gruffudd the Chamberlain. A reference in an elegy to him by Raff ap Robert suggests that he had a wife and a son, who was a priest.<ref name="DWB" >Dictionary of Welsh Biography [https://biography.wales/article/s-TUDU-ALE-1480 Retrieved 14 March 2017.]</ref>

==Reputation==
Tudur Aled was himself a nobleman and one of the foremost ''Beirdd yr Uchelwyr'' (Poets of the Nobility). His main patrons were the [[William Salesbury|Salisbury]] family of [[Vale of Clwyd|Dyffryn Clwyd]], and [[Rhys ap Thomas]].<ref name="DWB" /> He was one of the instigators of the [[Caerwys]] [[eisteddfod]] of 1523.

During his final illness, Tudur Aled took the habit of Order of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]]. He died in [[Carmarthen]], where he was buried in the Brothers' Court. The event was marked by elegies written by several of his fellow poets. He was known particularly for poems in honour of secular and religious noblemen. His work also reflects the changes at the beginning of the 16th century, which were threatening the future of the [[bard]]ic system.
