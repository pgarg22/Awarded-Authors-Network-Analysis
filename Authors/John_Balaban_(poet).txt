==Biography==
Balaban was born in [[Philadelphia]] to [[Romanian Americans|Romanian immigrant parents]], Phillip and Alice Georgies Balaban.<ref name="baughman"/><ref name="saha">{{cite web|url=http://www.kaurab.com/english/interviews/balaban.html|title=John Balaban Interview|first=Ankur|last=Saha|publisher=KAURAB Online|year=2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref> He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with highest honors in English from [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1966. A [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]] that he received in his senior year at [[Penn State]] allowed him to study [[English literature]] at [[Harvard University]], where he received his [[Master of Arts|A.M.]]<ref name="baughman"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Balaban, John B. 1943– |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/balaban-john-b-1943 |website=Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=February 25, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=John Balaban |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-balaban |publisher=Poetry Foundation |accessdate=February 25, 2019 }}</ref>

Balaban was a [[conscientious objector]] in Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]]. In a moment at Harvard which he writes about in his memoir ''Remembering Heaven's Face'',{{page needed|date=February 2019}} he petitioned his draft board to allow him to drop his student deferment to go to Vietnam with the ''[[International Voluntary Services|International Volunteer Services]]'', where he taught at a university until it was bombed in the [[Tet Offensive]]. He was wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel and evacuated; after his recovery, he continued his alternative service and returned to Vietnam with the ''Committee of Responsibility'' to treat war-injured children.<ref>{{cite web |title=Committee of Responsibility Records, 1966–1978 |url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG151-175/DG173COR.htm |website=Swarthmore College Peace Collection |publisher=Swarthmore College }}</ref>

He left Vietnam in 1969, subsequently testifying on civilian casualties before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee chaired by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Problems Connected with Refugees and Escapees of the Committee on the Judiciary |agency=United States Senate |issue=First Session, Part 1 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|date=June 24–25, 1969}}</ref>

In 1971–72, as the war continued, he returned once again to tape, transcribe, and translate the sung oral poetry known as ca dao, resulting in his ''Ca Dao Viet Nam: Vietnamese Folk Poetry''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Purdy |first1=Gilbert Wesley |title=We Redeem What We May |journal=Jacket |date=August 2003 |issue=23 |url=http://jacketmagazine.com/23/purdy-bal.html |accessdate=September 19, 2007 }}</ref> Balaban's first published collection of his own verse, ''After Our War'' (1974), was a [[Lamont Poetry Selection]] of the [[Academy of American Poets]] and nominated for the [[National Book Award]].

In 1999, he became a founder of the ''[[Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation]]'', which for twenty years led the digital preservation of ancient texts in Vietnam. In 2000, he released ''Spring Essence'', a collection of poems by [[Hồ Xuân Hương]], an 18th-century poet and the preeminent woman poet of Vietnam. The book included English translations and versions in both the current [[Vietnamese alphabet]] and the historical [[Chữ Nôm]] writing system.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balaban |first1=John |title=Nôm Foundation on Talk Vietnam |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_1mUBUsAwg |website=YouTube }}</ref>

Balaban has written poetry beyond his experiences in Vietnam. His collection ''Locusts at the Edge of Summer: New and Selected Poems'' won the 1998 [[William Carlos Williams Award]].<ref name="Barns">[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ean=9781556591488&displayonly=ITV Interview and information from Barns & Noble], accessed September 19, 2007.</ref> His ''Words for My Daughter'' was a National Poetry Series Selection.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Poetry Series 1990 |url=https://nationalpoetryseries.org/books/words-for-my-daughter/ |website=The National Poetry Series |accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> In 2006, ''Path, Crooked Path'' was named an Editor's Choice by Booklist and Best Book of Poetry by ''Library Journal.''

In 2008, he was awarded a medal of appreciation from the Ministry of Culture of Vietnam for his leadership in the restoration of the ancient text collection at the National Library.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dunn |first1=Nash |title=Rescuing a Script from Extinction |url=https://news.chass.ncsu.edu/2016/05/12/rescuing-a-script-from-extinction/ |website=Humanities and Social Sciences News |publisher=NC State University |accessdate=February 25, 2019 }}</ref>
