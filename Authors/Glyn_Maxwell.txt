'''Glyn Maxwell''' (born 1962) is a British poet, playwright, novelist, [[Libretto|librettist]], and lecturer.

==Early life==
Of primarily Welsh heritage — his mother Buddug-Mair Powell (b. 1928) acted in the original stage show of [[Dylan Thomas]]'s ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1956 — Maxwell was born and raised in [[Welwyn Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]].

His father James Maxwell (1928-2016) was an industrial chemist. Maxwell has two brothers, Alun (b. 1960), and David (b. 1964). His cousin [[Kerry Lee Powell]] is a noted Canadian writer.

He studied English at [[Worcester College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. He began an MLitt there but dropped out. In 1987 he moved to America to study poetry and drama with [[Derek Walcott]] at [[Boston University]]. He returned to the UK and began publishing poetry in the 1990s.

After his marriage and the birth of his daughter Alfie in 1997, he moved with his family to the USA, living and teaching at first in Amherst, Massachusetts, and then in New York City. He returned to the UK in 2006.

In the years 1991, 1993 and 1995, Maxwell staged performances of his plays in his parents' garden in [[Welwyn Garden City]]. These were featured in the national press and on radio.

==Poetry==
His three earliest collections of poetry, ''Tale Of The Mayor's Son'' (1990), ''Out of the Rain'' (1992), ''Rest For The Wicked'' (1995) are collected as ''The Boys at Twilight: Poems 1990-1995'' (2000). ''The Nerve'' won the [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]] in 2004. All his other collections of poems - ''The Breakage'', ''Hide Now'' and ''Pluto'' - have been shortlisted for either the [[T. S. Eliot Prize|T.S.Eliot]], [[Forward Prizes for Poetry|Forward]], or [[Costa Book Awards|Costa (formerly Whitbread)]] Prizes. He was awarded the [[Society of Authors]]' Cholmondeley Prize for his poetry in 2014.

In 1994 he was named one of the [[New Generation poets]] and he received the [[E. M. Forster Award]] in 1997. His most recent collections are ''One Thousand Nights and Counting: Selected Poems'' and ''Pluto''. His work appears in several anthologies of the best of 20th century poetry.

In 1999 Maxwell left [[Faber and Faber]] as a result of editorial disagreement over his poem ''Time's Fool,'' and his work has since been published by [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] in the UK. In the US he has been published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] and [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux|Farrar Straus Giroux]].
