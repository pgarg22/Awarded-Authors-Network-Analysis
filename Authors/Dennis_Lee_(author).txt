'''Dennis Beynon Lee''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (born August 31, 1939) is a [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]], teacher, editor, and critic born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].<ref name=sorfleet/> He is also a [[children's writer]], well known for his book of children's rhymes, ''[[Alligator Pie]]''.

==Life==
After attending high school at the [[University of Toronto Schools]], Lee received bachelor's and master's degrees in English from the [[University of Toronto]], where he coauthored articles in [[Acta Victoriana]] with [[Margaret Atwood]]. He taught English at the University's [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria College]] from 1963 until 1967, at which time he became 'resource person' for [[Rochdale College]].<ref name="UT index">"[http://www.library.utoronto.ca/canpoetry/lee/index.htm Dennis Lee: Biography]," Canadian Poetry Online. UToronto.ca, Web, March 18, 2011</ref>

Also in 1967, Lee co-founded [[House of Anansi Press]] with [[Dave Godfrey]], and served as its editorial director until 1972. From 1974 to 1979 he was a consulting editor for [[Macmillan of Canada]].<ref name=sorfleet>John R. Sorfleet, "[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/dennis-lee/ Lee, Dennis Beynon]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Hurtig: 1988), 1197</ref>

He was a [[writer in residence]] at [[Trent University]] in 1975, and at the University of Toronto in 1978-1979.

He is married to [[Susan Perly]], a writer and former [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] journalist.<ref>"A poet and an alley cat". ''[[National Post]]'', November 23, 2002.</ref>

==Writing==

In 1967 House of Anansi published Lee's first book of poetry, ''Kingdom of Absence'', "a sequence of 43 [[sonnet]] variations." Lee followed that up the next year with a long meditative poem, "Civil Elegies". (''Civil Elegies and Other Poems'', a revised version of that work collected with some newer poetry, won Lee the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in [[1972 Governor General's Awards|1972]].) <ref name=sorfleet/>

Lee began writing for children as part of his goal of  "Reclaiming language and liberating imagination"; his poems are about the language and activities of the daily lives of children, expanded into the realm of imaginary play and fantasy.<ref name=sorfleet/> His best known work is the rhymed ''Alligator Pie'' (1974).

Lee wrote the lyrics to the theme song of the 1980s television show ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' and, with composer [[Philip Balsam]], many of the other songs for that show.<ref>[https://tv.avclub.com/how-fraggle-rock-taught-kids-about-society-and-communit-1798234944 "How Fraggle Rock taught kids about society and community in 10 episodes"]. ''AV Club - TV'', Myles McNutt, May 12, 2012</ref> A number of the songs were released on the albums ''Fraggle Rock: Music and Magic'', in 1993,<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/fraggle-rock-music-magic-mr0001305503 "Original Soundtrack Fraggle Rock: Music & Magic "].  ''AllMusic'' Review by Peter Fawthrop</ref> and ''Jim Henson's Muppets present Fraggle Rock'', in 1984.<ref name="SteffelSwenson1989">{{cite book|author1=Nancy Oster Steffel|author2=Susan Griffis Swenson|title=Inspiring Young Authors Year-Round: A Handbook for Teachers and Parents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pdQ4ANlip4C|year=1989|publisher=Treetop Pub.|isbn=978-0-9623378-0-2|page=67}}</ref> The second album was nominated for a Grammy Award,<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite book|title=27th Grammy Awards Final Nominations|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT151|date=January 26, 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=151|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> which it won jointly with Shel Silverstein's ''Where the Sidewalk Ends''.<ref>[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SBS19850227.1.6&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 "Turner, Ritchie Top Grammy Winners"]. ''San Bernardino Sun'', February 27, 1985</ref> Balsam and Lee also wrote the songs for the television special ''The Tale of the Bunny Picnic''. Lee is co-writer of the story for the film ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref name="UT index" />

"On the adult level," says ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', "roots and play (including lovemaking) are further explored in Part I of ''he Gods'' (1979). Part 2, ''The Death of Harold Ladoo'' (1976), is an elegy for Lee's friend, a writer murdered in 1973.... The poem also meditates on the roles of mystical epiphanies and of artistic creation in its attempts to come to term with the problems of the contemporary world."<ref name=sorfleet/>

Lee is also the co-editor of ''The University Game'' (1968, with H. Edelman), "in which he calls for freedom from inhibiting educational institutions" a la Rochdale; and the author of ''Savage Fields: An Essay in Literature and Cosmology'' (1977), which "explores the interrelationship between 'earth' and 'world'—i.e. nature and civilization, or instinct and consciousness—all with particular application to a critical analysis of works by [[Michael Ondaatje]] and [[Leonard Cohen]]."<ref name="sorfleet"/>

[[Alasdair Gray]] adapted a line from Lee's poem Civil Elegies into 'Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation' into a slogan Gray has become known by, inscribed on Scottish Parliament's Canongate Wall.<ref>Harry McGrath, Scottish Review of Books, March 28, 2013 https://www.scottishreviewofbooks.org/2013/03/early-days-of-a-better-nation/ Accessed May 11, 2018</ref>

==Recognition==

In addition to his [[1972 Governor General's Awards|1972]] [[Governor General's Award]], Lee twice won the CACL Bronze Medal for a children's book: in 1974 for ''Alligator Pie'', and in 1977 for ''Garbage Delight''. He also won the [[Vicky Metcalf Award]], for body of work for children, in 1986, and the Mr. Christie's Book Award (''for The Ice Cream Store'') in 1991.

In 1993, Lee was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]]. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from Trent University, and won a Toronto Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement.<ref>"[http://www.library.utoronto.ca/canpoetry/lee/awards.htm Dennis Lee: Awards and Honours]," Canadian Poetry Online. Web, March 18, 2011</ref>

In 2001 Lee became Toronto's first [[Poet Laureate]], serving in that position until 2004.<ref>"[http://www.toronto.ca/culture/poet_laureate_dennis_lee.htm Toronto's First Poet Laureate: Dennis Lee (2001-2004)]," City of Toronto, Arts Heritage & Culture - Poet Laureate.
