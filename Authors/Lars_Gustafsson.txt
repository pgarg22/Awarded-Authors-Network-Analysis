'''Lars Erik Einar Gustafsson''' (17 May 1936 – 3 April 2016) was a Swedish poet, novelist, and scholar. Among his awards were the [[:de: Gerard-Bonnier-Preis|Gerard-Bonnier-Preis]] in 2006, the [[Goethe Medal]] in 2009, the [[Thomas Mann Prize]] in 2015, and the [[Nonino#Winners|International Nonino Prize]] in Italy in 2016.

==Life and career==
Gustafsson was born in [[Västerås]], completed his secondary education at the Västerås [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and continued to [[Uppsala University]], where he studied literature, aesthetics, sociology and philosophy. In 1960, he received a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] degree in philosophy. In 1978, he was awarded a PhD in [[theoretical philosophy]] with a dissertation on speech and literature. He later served for four years on the university's board of regents (1994-1998).<ref>Roger Gathman, interview with Gustafsson, ''Austin Chronicle'', February 2000 [https://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2000-02-25/75963/]</ref>

Already by 1960 Gustafsson was publishing novels and poetry regularly. In addition to his literary work, he was editor-in-chief of the renowned literary journal ''Bonniers Litterära Magasin'' from 1962 to 1972 . He soon established international contacts, notably to the German authors in [[Group 47]]. In 1972, through a [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] fellowship he came to West Berlin, where he lived for two years. During this period, he also traveled extensively, among other places to Australia, Singapore, Japan, Israel, and the United States. Throughout his career, he attended and participated in many international academic and cultural events. John Updike described Gustafsson as "the enviably ideal conferee, a red-bearded fish never out of water, loving books, ideas, and discourse equally, and everywhere adept."<ref>[[John Updike]], "No Dearth of Death," in ''Hugging the Shore: Essays and Criticism'' (New York, 1983/2012), p. 504.</ref>

Having been invited to visit the [[University of Texas at Austin]] by its Germanic Studies department in 1972 and again in 1974, and because [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] was his wife's hometown<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2000-02-25/75963/|title=Lone Star Sweden|website=www.austinchronicle.com|accessdate=23 November 2021}}</ref> he moved there in 1983, where he served at first as adjunct professor in Germanic Studies, later as professor, then Distinguished Professor, in the Plan II Honors<ref>Plan II Honors, The University of Texas at Austin. Link:  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject University of Texas at Austin/Plan II Honors]]</ref> program, teaching philosophy and creative writing. He returned to Sweden in 2003 while continuing to hold a research professorship in the University; in 2006, he retired. He lived in [[Stockholm]], spending summers in [[Västmanland County|Västmanland]]. He died at the age of 79 on 3 April 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/lars-gustafsson-dod/ |title=Lars Gustafsson död |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=3 April 2016 |access-date=3 April 2016}}</ref>

Gustafsson was married three times: in 1961 to Madeleine Gustafsson (two children); in 1982 to Alexandra Chasnoff (two children); in 2005 to Agneta Blomqvist. In 1981 Gustafsson [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to [[Judaism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedishenglishtranslation.com/jwriting/gustafsson-b.htm|title=Contemporary Jewish Writing in Sweden -- Lars Gustafsson Bio|website=www.swedishenglishtranslation.com|accessdate=23 November 2021}}</ref>

In May 2009, Lars Gustafsson declared that he would vote for the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] in the upcoming elections for the [[European Parliament]].<ref>

==Writing==
Gustafsson published poetry, novels, short stories, critical essays, and editorials. He gained international recognition as a Swedish writer. By 1990, he had already received a dozen major literary awards including the ''Prix International Charles Veillon des Essais'' in 1983,[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix_européen_de_l%27essai_Charles-Veillon] ''Una Vita per la Letteratura'' in 1989, as well as the Swedish Bellman Prize in 1990. He won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for poetry in 1994. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature (the year is unknown as the Nobel Committee keeps nominations secret for 50 years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/laureates_nominations.html|title=Nobel Committee Nominations|accessdate=23 November 2021}}</ref> Among later awards were the [[:de: Gerard-Bonnier-Preis|Gerard-Bonnier-Preis]] in 2006, the [[Goethe Medal]] in 2009, and the [[Thomas Mann Prize]] in 2015. He won the 2016 [[Nonino#Winners|International Nonino Prize]] in Italy.

Gustafsson's novels and poetry have been translated into fifteen languages, the most often translated being the novels ''The Death of a Beekeeper'' (En biodlares död), ''Bernard Foy's Third Castling'' (Bernard Foys tredje rockad), and ''Afternoon of a Tiler'' (En kakelsättares eftermiddag). [[Harold Bloom]] includes Gustafsson in ''The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages'' (1994, p.&nbsp;557).<ref>Ia Dübois  "Lars Gustafsson (17 May 1936-)," in ''Twentieth-Century Swedish Writers After World War II'', edited by Ann-Charlotte Gavel Adams (2002), p. 117. Series: ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', vol. 257. Online edition accessed 25 Feb. 2018. Gustafsson is listed among eight Scandinavian writers in Bloom's Appendix D: "The Chaotic Age: 20th Century." Bloom later disowned his book's four historical appendices. [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]</ref>

''The Death of a Beekeeper,'' published in 1978, is Gustafsson's best-known novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/news?articleid=558|title=News And Publicity &#124; Bloodaxe Books|website=www.bloodaxebooks.com|accessdate=23 November 2021}}</ref> [[John Updike]] praised it as "a beautiful work, lyrical and bleak, resonant and terse."<ref>[[John Updike|Updike]], ''Hugging The Shore'', p. 505.</ref> Ia Dübois has called it "one of his greatest works."<ref>Dübois, "Gustafsson," p. 123.</ref> Eva Stenskar has written that it "seems so effortless yet lyrical that only an artist at the height of his powers could've produced it."<ref name="auto">Nordic Reach, Number 21, Volume XX</ref> Its main theme is the agony of disease, as it follows Vesslan—a beekeeper who is dying of cancer—through entries he makes on notepads. The book's innovative structure allows Gustafsson to explore identity through its expression in a variety of forms: imagination, memory and even the mundane details of life. The book's central theme is revealed by the repeated motto of the protagonist, "We never give up. We begin anew." Gustafsson himself has described it as "A book about pain. It describes a journey into the center where pain rules—and pain can tolerate no rivals."<ref>Source?</ref> The novel was re-published in 1984 as the last in a five-novel sequence ''Sprickorna i muren'' (The Cracks in the Wall), the other volumes being ''Herr Gustafsson själv'', ''Yllet'', ''Familjefesten'', and ''Sigismund''.

''Bernard Foy's Third Castling'' (1986) is nearly as well known as ''The Death of a Beekeeper''. Its settings are Sweden, Paris, Worpsewede, Germany, and Texas. The overt genre is the detective story, but there are three plots, and Bernard Foy is three separate characters: a Houston rabbi, an old Swedish poet, and a Swedish teenager. Each gradually turns into a character in the writing of the succeeding Foy. Gustafsson said that he was prompted by a “connection to Descartes' dream argument: You start with a story and it proves to be the story of a completely different person who is dreaming up the story which proves to be the story of a third person and it is all written by one or another person.”<ref>Information in this paragraph condensed from ''Austin Chronicle'' interview [https://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2000-02-25/75963/]</ref>

In 1989, Gustafsson ventured into the field of [[science fiction]] and published ''Det sällsamma djuret från norr och andra science-fiction-berättelser''. The book takes place 40,000 years into the future, when humans are extinct and the galaxy is populated by [[artificial intelligence]]s. It is a philosophical exploration of life and existence and can be seen as an homage to [[Stanislav Lem]].

Gustafsson's two major fields of interest interacted from the start of his career. In 2003, he wrote that "sometimes I cannot see any sharp boundary between [my literary work] and [my philosophical work]. I tend to regard myself as a philosopher who has turned literature into one of his tools."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040616084303/http://www.utexas.edu/depts/german/faculty/gustafsson.html Germanic Studies department faculty page, The University of Texas at Austin]</ref> When asked where he finds his inspiration, Gustafsson answered "I listen. I listen and I look. Creativity knows no rules. You can get an idea for a novel from a little something someone says, or just a face you see. A rabbi once told me that when God spoke to Moses in that bush, it wasn't in a thundering voice; it was in a very weak voice. You have to listen carefully for that voice. You have to be very sharp."<ref name="auto"/>

In 2003, ''Yllet'', the second novel in ''The Cracks in the Wall'' (Sprickorna i Muren) series was made into a feature film, directed by Jimmy Karlsson and starring [[Magnus Krepper]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330711/|title=Sprickorna i muren|date=14 February 2003|accessdate=23 November 2021|via=IMDb}}</ref>

While the problem of identity has been the defining theme of Gustafsson's writings, his social criticism often vexed the Swedish cultural elite. As a result, he is seen as a controversial writer in Sweden rather than as one embraced by the establishment.<ref>Dübois, "Gustafsson," p. 117</ref>

In 2016, he received the [[Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fundacjaherberta.com/en/laureate-of-the-international-zbigniew-herbert-literary-award-2016 |title=Laureate of the International Zbigniew Herbert Literary Award |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref>
