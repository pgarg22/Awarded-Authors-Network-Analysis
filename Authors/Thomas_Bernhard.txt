'''Nicolaas Thomas Bernhard''' ({{IPA-de|ˈtoːmas ˈbɛʁnhaʁt|lang}}; 9 February 1931 – 12 February 1989) was an Austrian [[novelist]], [[playwright]] and [[poet]]. Bernhard's body of work has been called "the most significant literary achievement since [[World War II]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/books/review/Peck-t.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Dale|last=Peck|author-link=Dale Peck|title=Book Review – ''My Prizes'' and ''Prose'' by Thomas Bernhard|date=24 December 2010}}</ref> He is widely considered to be one of the most important German-speaking authors of the postwar era.

== Life ==
Thomas Bernhard was born in 1931 in [[Heerlen]] in the Netherlands, where his unmarried mother Herta Bernhard worked as a maid. From the autumn of 1931 he lived with his grandparents in Vienna until 1937 when his mother, who had married in the meantime, moved him to [[Traunstein]], [[Bavaria]], in [[Nazi Germany]]. There he was required to join the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', a branch of the [[Hitler Youth]], which he hated.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/12/25/the-art-of-extinction|title=The Art of Extinction|last=Franklin|first=Ruth|date=18 December 2006|work=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=8 October 2017|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> Bernhard's natural father Alois Zuckerstätter was a carpenter and petty criminal who refused to acknowledge his son.<ref name=":0" /> Zuckerstätter died in Berlin from gas poisoning in an assumed suicide in 1940;<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/magazine/posts/2012/june/feature-thomas-bernhard|title=Feature: Thomas Bernhard|date=24 June 2012|publisher=[[Sydney Theatre Company]]|access-date=8 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> Bernhard never met him.

Bernhard's grandfather, the author {{ill|Johannes Freumbichler|de}}, pushed for an artistic education for him, including musical instruction. Bernhard went to elementary school in [[Seekirchen am Wallersee|Seekirchen]] and later attended various schools in Salzburg including the ''Johanneum'' which he left in 1947 to start an [[apprenticeship]] with a [[grocer]]. [[George Steiner]] describes Bernhard's schooling as "hideous... under a sadistically repressive system, run first by Catholic priests, then by Nazis".<ref name="gs">[https://rhystranter.com/2016/03/29/george-steiner-on-thomas-bernhard-reviews George Steiner on Thomas Bernhard]</ref>

Bernhard's ''Lebensmensch'' (a predominantly Austrian term, which was coined by Bernhard himself<ref>{{cite book|last1=Honegger|first1=Gitta|title=Thomas Bernhard: The Making of an Austrian|publisher=Yale University 2001, p. 59.}}</ref> and which refers to the most important person in one's life) was Hedwig Stavianicek (1894–1984), a woman more than thirty-seven years his senior, whom he cared for alone in her dying days. He had met Stavianicek in 1950, the year of his mother's death and one year after the death of his beloved grandfather. Stavianicek was the major support in Bernhard's life and greatly furthered his literary career. The extent or nature of his relationships with women is obscure. Thomas Bernhard's public persona was asexual.<ref>Honegger, ''Thomas Bernhard,'' pp. 61–63.</ref>
Suffering throughout his teens from lung ailments, including [[tuberculosis]], Bernhard spent the years 1949 to 1951 at the Grafenhof [[sanatorium]]  in [[Sankt Veit im Pongau]]. He trained as an actor at the [[Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]] (1955–1957) and was always profoundly interested in music. His lung condition, however, made a career as a singer impossible. After that he worked briefly as a journalist, mainly as a crime reporter, and then became a full-time writer.  In 1970, he won the [[Georg Büchner Prize]].

In 1978, Bernhard was diagnosed with [[sarcoidosis]].<ref>Liam Hoare. "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/23/thomas-bernhard-was-a-demon-half-brother-reveals-in-bestseller Thomas Bernhard was a 'demon', half-brother reveals in bestseller]". ''The Guardian'', 23 March 2021.</ref> After a decade of needing constant medical care for his lungs, he died in 1989 in [[Gmunden]], [[Upper Austria]]. Although there have been claims that he died by assisted suicide,<ref name=":0" /> contemporaneous obituaries reported, and Bernhard's half-brother, Dr. Peter Fabjan, confirmed that Bernhard had a heart attack. His death was announced only after his funeral.  In his will, which aroused great controversy on publication, Bernhard prohibited any new stagings of his plays and [[publication]] of his unpublished work in Austria; however, in 1999 this was annulled by his heir, Peter Fabjan.<ref name=":1" /> Bernhard's attractive house in Ohlsdorf-Obernathal 2 where he had moved in 1965 is now a museum and centre for the study and performance of his work.

== Work ==
Often criticized in Austria as a ''Nestbeschmutzer'' (one who dirties his own nest) for his critical views, Bernhard was highly acclaimed abroad. Nevertheless, while reviled by some Austrians for his outspoken and harsh views of his homeland, including its Nazi past,<ref name=":1" />  he was, during his lifetime, also highly acclaimed in Austria, winning a number of major awards, and was seen by many as the pre-eminent writer of the time.

His work is most influenced by the feeling of being abandoned (in his childhood and youth) and by his incurable illness, which caused him to see death as the ultimate essence of existence. His work typically features loners' [[monologue]]s explaining, to a rather silent listener, their views on the state of the world, often with reference to a concrete situation and sometimes reported second-hand by the listener. Alongside his serious and pessimistic views, his works also contain some very funny observations on life.<ref name=":0" /> Bernhard is often considered a verbose writer, but [[Andreas Dorschel]] has broadened this view by showing that Bernhard's characters (specifically in ''Das Kalkwerk'') oscillate between excessive speech and highly economical expressions. As Dorschel argues, the two modes produce a series of oppositions with mutually informing sides.<ref>Andreas Dorschel, ‘Lakonik und Suada in der Prosa Thomas Bernhards’, ''Thomas Bernhard Jahrbuch'' 2007/08, pp. 215–233; cf. Simon Walsh in ''Modern Austrian Literature'' 43 (2010), issue 4, p. 100</ref>

Bernhard's main protagonists, often scholars or, as he calls them, ''Geistesmenschen'' (intellectuals), denounce everything that matters to the Austrian in [[contumacy]]-filled tirades against a "stupid populace". He also attacks the state (often called "Catholic-National-Socialist"), generally-respected institutions such as Vienna's [[Burgtheater]], and much-loved artists. His work also continually deals with the isolation and self-destruction of people striving for an unreachable perfection, since this same perfection would mean stagnancy and therefore death. [[Anti-Catholic]] rhetoric is not uncommon.

"Es ist alles lächerlich, wenn man an den Tod denkt" (It's all ridiculous, when one thinks of death) was his comment when he received a minor Austrian national award in 1968, which resulted in one of the many public scandals he caused over the years and which became part of his fame. His novel ''Holzfällen'' (1984), for instance, could not be published for years because of a defamation [[Cause of action|claim]] by a former friend. Many of his plays—above all ''Heldenplatz'' (1988)—were met with criticism from many Austrians, who claimed they sullied Austria's reputation. One of the more controversial lines referred to Austria as "a brutal and stupid nation ... a mindless, cultureless sewer which spreads its penetrating stench all over Europe." ''Heldenplatz'', as well as the other plays Bernhard wrote in these years, were staged at Vienna's famous Burgtheater by the controversial director {{ill|Claus Peymann|de}}.

Even in death Bernhard caused disturbance by his ''[[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumous]] literary [[emigration]]'', as he supposedly called it, by which his will disallowed all publication and stagings of his work within Austria. The International Thomas Bernhard Foundation, established by his executor and half-brother Dr. Peter Fabjan, has since made exceptions, although the German firm of Suhrkamp remains his principal publisher.

The correspondence between Bernhard and his publisher Siegfried Unseld from 1961 to 1989 – about 500 letters – was published in December 2009 at [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], Germany.<ref>[http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/der_briefwechsel_thomas_bernhard_siegfried_unseld-thomas_bernhard_41970.html ''Der Briefwechsel Thomas Bernhard/Siegfried Unseld''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206130610/http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/der_briefwechsel_thomas_bernhard_siegfried_unseld-thomas_bernhard_41970.html |date=6 December 2009 }}, [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], 7 December 2009</ref>
