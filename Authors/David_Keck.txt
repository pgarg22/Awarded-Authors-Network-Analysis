==Biography==
David Keck was born in, and grew up in, [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada.<ref name="davidkeck2.wordpress.com" /> Whilst living in Winnipeg he attended the [[University of Winnipeg]], where he got master's degrees in English Literature, History, and Education.<ref name="davidkeck2.wordpress.com" /> He subsequently moved to the [[Great Britain|UK]] to get a master's degree in [[Creative Writing]] from the [[University of Sussex]].<ref name="davidkeck2.wordpress.com" /> In 2004 he moved to [[New York City]],<ref name="davidkeck2.wordpress.com" /> [[United States of America|America]], to marry Kate Brallier<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/editorial-696/An-Interview-With-David-Keck | title=An Interview with David Keck - McNally Robinson Booksellers}}</ref> (an author herself),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.katebrallier.com/ | title=This Web site coming soon}}</ref> and to teach [[middle school]] in New York's [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]].<ref name="davidkeck2.wordpress.com" />

==Works==
Keck's novels all recount the adventures of protagonist Durand Col,<ref name="tor-forge.com" /> yet there is currently no series name. The first novel in the series was ''In the Eye of Heaven'',<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://davidkeck2.wordpress.com/previews/in-the-eye-of-heaven-preview/ | title=In the Eye of Heaven| date=2007-10-21}}</ref> and was published in the UK in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=david+keck|title=Amazon.co.uk: david keck|website=www.amazon.co.uk|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> and the US and Canada in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=david+keck|title=Amazon.com: david keck|website=www.amazon.com|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=david+keck|title=Amazon.ca: david keck|website=www.amazon.ca|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> by Tor.<ref name="tor-forge.com" /> The novel went through many versions before publication, with fellow Canadian author, [[Steven Erikson]], having a hand in reading and editing the drafts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/181p0.html | title=Interview with David Keck – SFFWorld}}</ref> Keck's writing style has been compared to Erikson, mainly because he likes to go against the grain. He says that he "flinch[es] at an elf who's a dab hand with a longbow. Conventions and clichés: it's all in the smiles and cringes."<ref name="sffworld.com"/>
