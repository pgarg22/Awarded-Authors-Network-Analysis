Born in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], Bear studied English and anthropology at the [[University of Connecticut]] but did not graduate. She worked as a technical writer, stable hand, reporter and held various office jobs. She sold a few stories in the 1990s and began writing seriously in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=April 2006|title=Locus Online: Elizabeth Bear interview excerpts|url=https://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/04Bear.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-03|website=Locus: The Magazine of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Field}}</ref>

Bear's first novel ''[[Hammered (Bear novel)|Hammered]]'' was published in January 2005 and was followed by ''Scardown'' in July and ''Worldwired'' in November of the same year. The trilogy features Canadian Master Warrant Officer Jenny Casey, who is also the main character in the short story "Gone to Flowers". ''Hammered'' won the [[Locus Award for Best First Novel]] in 2006.

''The Chains That You Refuse'', a collection of her short fiction, was published May 2006 by [[Night Shade Books]]. ''Blood and Iron'', the first book in the fantasy series entitled "The Promethean Age", debuted June 27, 2006. She is also a coauthor of the ongoing ''Shadow Unit'' website/pseudo-TV series.

In 2008, she donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at [[Northern Illinois University]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archon.lib.niu.edu/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=380&q=Elizabeth+Bear | title = Elizabeth Bear Papers, 2005- 2011 | publisher = Northern Illinois University | date = 2008-04-18 }}</ref>

She is an instructor at the [[Viable Paradise]] writer's workshop and has taught at [[Clarion West Writers Workshop]].

The opening quote in ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode [[List of Criminal Minds episodes (season 6)|"Lauren" (6.18)]] was a direct quote of the second and third lines of Bear's book ''Seven for a Secret'': "The secret to lying is to believe with all your heart. That goes for lying to yourself even more than lying to another."

She is one of the regular panelists on podcast [[SF Squeecast]], which won the 2012 and 2013 [[Hugo Award]]s for "Best Fancast".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/eaw.cgi?22910 | title = Elizabeth Bear - Award Bibliography | publisher = www.isfdb.org }}</ref>
