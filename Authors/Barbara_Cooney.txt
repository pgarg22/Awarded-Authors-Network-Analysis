'''Barbara Cooney''' (August 6, 1917 – March 10, 2000) was an American writer and illustrator of 110 [[children's books]], published over sixty years. She received two [[Caldecott Medal]]s for her work on ''[[Chanticleer and the Fox (book)|Chanticleer and the Fox]]'' (1958) and ''[[Ox-Cart Man]]'' (1979), and a [[National Book Award]] for ''[[Miss Rumphius]]'' (1982). Her books have been translated into 10 languages.<ref name=hurst/>

For her contribution as a children's illustrator, Cooney was the U.S. nominee in 1994 for the biennial, international [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the highest international recognition for creators of children's books.<ref name=andersen/><ref name=ibby-nominee/>

==Life==
Cooney was born on 6 August 1917 in Room 1127 of the [[Hotel Bossert]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]],<ref name=hurst/> to Russell Schenck Cooney (a stockbroker) and his wife Mae Evelyn Bossert (a painter). She had a twin brother and two younger brothers. Her family moved to Connecticut, where she attended [[Buckley Country Day School]] and later [[Boarding School]]. She started drawing and painting early in life, and was encouraged by her mother but allowed to learn independently.

Cooney graduated from [[Smith College]] with a history degree, but continued working at art, taking classes on etching and lithography at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. She began to make connections in the publishing world. Her first professional illustration was for ''[[Ake and His World]]'' by the Swedish poet [[Bertil Malmberg]], which was published in 1940, a year after she graduated.<ref name=hurst/>

During [[World War II]], Cooney served in the [[Women’s Army Corps]]. Soon after her service, she met and married [[Guy Murchie]] in 1944. They had two children, Gretel and Barnaby. She later divorced. In July 1949 she married Charles Talbot Porter; they had two children together: Phoebe and [[Charlie Porter]].<ref name=hurst/>

Cooney had continued her illustration work. In 1959, she won the Caldecott Medal for ''[[Chanticleer and the Fox (book)|Chanticleer and the Fox]]'', writing and illustrating her version<ref name=caldecott/> of the fable, "[[Chanticleer and the Fox]]." This was developed by [[Chaucer]] in his "[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]." Beginning in her 40s, Cooney frequently traveled, gaining inspiration for illustrations and her writing. At home, she lived in [[Damariscotta, Maine]], in a house built for her by one of her sons.

Among her many books, Cooney illustrated ''[[Ox-Cart Man]]'' (1980), written by American poet [[Donald Hall]], for which she received her second Caldecott Medal.<ref name=caldecott/> In 1975, she illustrated ''[[When the Sky is Like Lace]]''. Written by [[Elinor Lander Horwitz]], the book was selected as a ''[[New York Times]]'' Outstanding Book of the Year. With her book ''[[Miss Rumphius]]'' (1983), which she wrote and illustrated, she won the [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature#Children's Books, 1980 to 1983|National Book Award in category Picture Books]]. That year [[William Steig]] and his ''[[Doctor De Soto]]'' also shared the award.<ref name=nba1983/>

In 1996, Maine Governor [[Angus King]] honored Cooney by proclaiming a day in her name as "Barbara Cooney Day". Her last book, ''[[Basket Moon]]'' (2000), was published six months before her death at home in Damariscotta on March 10, 2000.<ref name=nytimes/>

Portions of her original artwork are being displayed at [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine.

==Style==
Throughout her career, Cooney used a variety of techniques, preferring pen and ink, acrylic paints, and pastels. Her illustrations are often described as [[folk art]]. She most often chose folk stories to illustrate. While many of her books were in black and white, her "heart and soul are in color".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://literati101.blogspot.com/2015/10/day-252-drawing-miss-rumphius-with.html|title=The Guardian Project: Day 252: Drawing Miss Rumphius with Barbara Cooney|last=Unknown|date=2015-10-09|website=The Guardian Project|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>

==Quotes==
*On her mother: 
<blockquote>"She gave me all the materials I could wish for and then left me alone, didn’t smother me with instruction. Not that I ever took instruction very easily. My favorite days were when I had a cold and could stay home from school and draw all day long.... She was an enthusiastic painter of oils and watercolors. She was also very generous. I could mess with her paints and brushes all I wanted. On one condition: that I kept my brushes clean. The only art lesson my mother gave me was how to wash my brushes. Otherwise, she left me alone."</blockquote>

*On Smith College and her art: "I have felt way behind technically; and what I’ve learned I have had to teach myself. To this day, I don’t consider myself a very skillful artist."
*On her travels and learning the spirit of place: 
<blockquote>“It was not until I was in my forties, in the fifth decade of my life, that the sense of place, the spirit of place, became of paramount importance to me. It was then that I began my travels, that I discovered, through photography, the quality of light, and that I gradually became able to paint the mood of place.”</blockquote>

*On receiving the Caldecott Medal in 1959: 
<blockquote>"I believe that children in this country need a more robust literary diet than they are getting.... It does not hurt them to read about good and evil, love and hate, life and death. Nor do I think they should read only about things that they understand.... a man’s reach should exceed his grasp. So should a child’s. For myself, I will never talk down to—or draw down to—children."</blockquote>

*On her favorite works: "Of all the books I have done, 'Miss Rumphius,' 'Island Boy,' and 'Hattie and the Wild Waves,' are the closest to my heart. These three are as near as I ever will come to an autobiography".
