After the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Abramson received widespread attention for his [[Conversation threading|Twitter threads]] alleging collusion between the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] and foreign governments, especially Russia, but also [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], and [[Israel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/twitter-thread-social-media-trend-215539|title=The Rise of the Twitter Thread|last=Heffernan|first=Virginia|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> According to ''The Washington Post'':

In November 2018, Abramson published the ''New York Times'' bestselling book ''Proof of Collusion'' (Simon & Schuster), which sought to establish "proof of collusion in the Trump-Russia case."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2018/12/02/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/?action=click&contentCollection=Books&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&region=Body&module=CompleteListLink&version=Nonfiction&pgtype=Reference|title=Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction NYT Bestsellers for December 2, 2018.|website=www.nytimes|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the book "spirited, thorough, and thunderously foreboding."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/seth-abramson/proof-of-collusion/|title=Review: Proof of Collusion: How Trump Betrayed America, by Seth Abramson|website=Kirkus Reviews|language=en|access-date=2021-05-17}}</ref> A contrary view appeared in the ''Herald'' (Scotland), noting that "suggestive juxtapositions notwithstanding, we end up with something closer to the Scottish 'not proven' verdict with its unique mix of moral conviction of guilt and inability to conclusively prove the case."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/17318965.review-proof-of-collusion-how-trump-betrayed-america-by-seth-abramson/|title=Review: Proof of Collusion: How Trump Betrayed America, by Seth Abramson|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>

In October 2020, Abramson, former ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' contributing editor [[Thomas Morton (journalist)|Thomas Morton]], and Connect3 Media (a division of [[Cineflix]]) published a ten-episode, limited-series pre-election podcast, ''Proof: A Pre-election Podcast Special'', to summarize key aspects of the "Proof" book trilogy. Abramson thereafter launched a [[Substack]] publication entitled ''Proof''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sethabramson.substack.com|title=Proof|website=Substack|language=en|access-date=2021-05-19}}</ref>

===Creative writing and editorship===
Abramson has published a number of poetry books and anthologies. ''[[Colorado Review]]'' called ''Northerners'', Abramson's second collection of poetry, "alternately expansive and deeply personal...of crystalline beauty and complexity," terming Abramson "a major American voice,"<ref>''Northerners'' (review), ''Colorado Review''. [http://coloradoreview.colostate.edu/reviews/northerners/]</ref> and ''[[Notre Dame Review]]'' echoed the sentiment.<ref>"From Ruin to Rebirth," ''Notre Dame Review''. [http://ndreview.nd.edu/assets/60036/ripatrazone_review.pdf]</ref>

Abramson and poet [[Jesse Damiani]] have been series co-editor of the annual anthology of innovative verse, ''Best American Experimental Writing'', since its inception with Omnidawn in 2012.<ref>"Best American Experimental Writing Anthology Announced," The Poetry Foundation (November 12, 2012).

[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wespress/bax/]</ref>

===The MFA Research Project===
Between 2007 and 2014, Abramson authored ''The MFA Research Project'' (MRP), a website that published indexes of creative writing Master of Fine Arts (MFA) programs based on surveys and other data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mfaresearchproject.wordpress.com/|title=Protected Blog ' Log in|website=mfaresearchproject.wordpress.com|access-date=22 June 2018}}</ref> Indexes appearing on the MRP included ordered listings of program popularity, funding, selectivity, fellowship placement, job placement, student-faculty ratio, application cost, application response times, application and curriculum requirements, and foundation dates. The MRP also published surveys of current MFA applicants and various creative writing programs. 

''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' termed the ''Poets & Writers'' national assessment methodology "comprehensive" and "the only MFA ranking regime."<ref>"What Defines a Successful Post-M.F.A.

[http://chronicle.com/blogs/arts/m-f-a-application-season-etiquette/29172]</ref> Writing for ''The Cambridge Companion to American Poetry Since 1945'', [[Hank Lazer]] described Abramson's project as "a daring and data-rich endeavor."<ref>"American Poetry and Its Institutions," ''The Cambridge Companion to American Poetry Since 1945'' (February 8, 2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nKMQ5b0VKz0C&pg=PA160&dq=cambridge+companion+lazer+%22daring+and+data-rich%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tilQU4W3DIaKyASZhYLQBQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=cambridge%20companion%20lazer%20%22daring%20and%20data-rich%22&f=false]</ref> ''[[The Missouri Review]]'' observed that Abramson, along with novelist [[Tom Kealey]], "had done a tremendous amount of work to peel back the layers of MFA programs and get applicants to make informed decisions."<ref>"The MFA Degree: A Bad Decision?", ''The Missouri Review'' (August 29, 2011).

The data was not without its critics. In September 2011, a critical open letter signed by professors from undergraduate and graduate creative writing programs was published.<ref>"Creative Writing Profs Dispute Their Ranking.

The magazine's Editorial Director Mary Gannon said of Abramson, the rankings' primary researcher, that he "has been collecting data about applicants' preferences and about MFA programs for five years, and we stand behind his integrity."<ref name="pw.org">{{cite news|url=http://www.pw.org/content/poets_and_writers_responds_to_open_letter|title=Poets & Writers Responds to Open Letter|date=13 September 2011|work=Poets & Writers|access-date=13 September 2011}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Poetry===
''Publishers Weekly'' describes Abramson as "serious and ambitious... uncommonly interested in general statements, in hard questions, and harder answers, about how to live."<ref>''Northerners'', Publishers Weekly (Review). [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-930974-96-8]</ref> Abramson won the 2008 J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize from ''[[Poetry magazine|Poetry]]''. Editor [[Don Share]] said of Abramson's "What I Have," "The poem absorbs certain details but doesn't fasten upon them the way poets are tempted to do; it's not adjectival, it's not descriptive, it's not painting a kind of canvas with scenery on it, and yet those details are really fascinating."<ref>"You're Always Moving Toward Silence," ''Poetry'' (March 2009 Poetry Foundation Podcast). [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/audioitem.html?id=727]</ref>

===Journalism===
In 2019, a ''[[Playboy]]'' interviewer said "Abramson helped pioneer the literary form of the [[Twitter]] 'thread'" and, speaking of his 2018 book ''Proof of Collusion'', credited "the eccentric New Hampshirite" for "his meticulous attention to the evidence of Trumpworld's alleged collusion with the Kremlin."<ref name=":2">Interview with Seth Abramson. ''Playboy'' (March 2019). [https://www.playboy.com/read/playboy-interview-with-seth-abramson]</ref> His style of writing was described by ''Playboy'' as "left-brained [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]."<ref name=":2"/> Avi Selk of ''The Washington Post'' wrote, prior to the publication of ''Proof of Collusion'', that Abramson became "virally popular by reframing a complex tangle of public reporting on the Russia scandal into a story so simple it can be laid out in daily tweets", that his analyses on social media exhibit "many leaps", and that his sources there "range in quality".<ref>"People can't stop reading a professor's theory of a Trump-Russia conspiracy," ''The Washington Post'' (December 6, 2017) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/12/06/people-cant-stop-reading-a-professors-theory-of-a-trump-russia-conspiracy-true-or-not/]</ref>
