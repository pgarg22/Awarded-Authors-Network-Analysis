'''Francis Reginald Scott''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|QC|FRSC|FBA}} (1899–1985), commonly known as '''Frank Scott''' or '''F.&nbsp;R. Scott''', was a [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]], intellectual, and constitutional scholar. He helped found the first Canadian [[Social democracy|social democratic]] party, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], and its successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. He won Canada's top literary prize, the [[Governor General's Award]], twice, once for poetry and once for non-fiction. He was married to artist [[Marian Dale Scott]].

==Life and work==
Scott was born on August 1, 1899, in [[Quebec City]], the sixth of seven children. His father was [[Frederick George Scott]], "an [[Anglican]] priest, minor poet and staunch advocate of the civilizing tradition of imperial Britain, who instilled in his son a commitment to serve mankind, a love for the regenerative balance of the Laurentian landscape and a firm respect for the social order."<ref name=richardson>Keith Richardson, "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0007227 Scott, Francis Reginald (Frank)]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1961.</ref> He witnessed the riots in the city during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]].

Completing his undergraduate studies at [[Bishop's University]], in [[Lennoxville, Quebec|Lennoxville]], [[Quebec]], Scott went to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] and was influenced by the [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] ideas of [[R.&nbsp;H. Tawney]] and the [[World Student Christian Federation|Student Christian Movement]].

Scott returned to Canada, settled in [[Montreal]] and studied law at [[McGill University]], eventually joining the [[McGill University Faculty of Law|law faculty]] as a professor. While at McGill, Scott became a member of the [[Montreal Group]] of [[modernist poetry|modernist poets]], a circle that also included [[Leon Edel]], [[John Glassco]], and [[A.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;M. Smith]].<ref name="irvine">Dean Irvine, "[http://www.answers.com/topic/montreal-group Montreal Group]," ''Oxford Companion to Canadian History''. Answers.com, Web, March 25, 2011.</ref>
Scott and Smith became lifelong friends.<ref name=richardson/> Scott  contributed to the ''McGill Daily Literary Supplement'', which Smith edited; when that folded in 1925, he and Smith founded and edited the ''McGill Fortnightly Review''. After the ''Review'' folded, Scott helped found and briefly co-edited ''The Canadian Mercury''.<ref>Dean Irvine, "[http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/7691/Montreal-Group.html Montreal Group]," ''Encyclopedia of Canadian History'', JRank.org. Web, March 15, 2011.</ref> Scott, assisted by Smith and [[Leo Kennedy]], also anonymously edited the modernist poetry anthology ''[[New Provinces (poetry anthology)|New Provinces]]'' (in which he published ten poems), which was published in 1936.<ref>Michael Gnarowski, "[http://www.encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0005706 New Provinces: Poems of Several Authors]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Hurtig: Edmonton, 1988), 1479.</ref>

Wright, MP for [[Melfort (electoral district)|Melfort]]; and Frank Scott, National Chairman.]]
The [[Great Depression]] greatly disturbed Scott; he and the historian [[Frank Underhill]] founded the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] (LSR) to advocate [[socialist]] solutions in a Canadian context. Through the LSR, Scott became an influential figure in the [[Socialism in Canada|Canadian socialist]] movement. He was a founding member of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) and a contributor to that party's [[Regina Manifesto]]. He also edited a book advocating ''Social Planning for Canada'' (1935).<ref name=richardson/> In 1943, he co-authored ''Make This Your Canada'', spelling out the CCF national programme, with [[David Lewis (Canadian politician)|David Lewis]]. Scott was elected national chairman of the CCF in 1942, and would serve until 1950.<ref name=richardson/>

In March 1942 Scott co-founded a literary magazine, ''Preview'', with the Montreal poet [[Patrick Anderson (poet)|Patrick Anderson]]. Like the earlier Montreal Group publications, "''Preview's'' orientation was [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]]; its members looked largely towards the English poets of the 1930s for inspiration."<ref name=woodcock>George Woodcock, "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0005811 Northern Review]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1515.</ref>

In 1950–1951 Scott cofounded Recherches sociales, a study group concerned with the French–English relationship. He began translating French-Canadian poetry.<ref name=richardson/>

In 1952 he served as a [[United Nations]] technical assistance resident representative in [[Burma]], helping to build a socialist state in that country.<ref name=richardson/>

During the 1950s, Scott was an active opponent of the [[Maurice Duplessis|Duplessis]] regime in Quebec and  went to court to fight the [[Padlock Law]].  He also represented Frank Roncarrelli, a [[Jehovah's Witness]], in ''[[Roncarelli v Duplessis]]'' all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] a battle that Maurice Duplessis lost.

Scott began translating French-Canadian poetry, publishing ''[[Anne Hébert]] and [[Saint-Denys Garneau]]'' in 1962. He edited ''Poems of French Canada'' (1977), which won the [[Canada Council]] prize for translation.

[[File:Funeral monument F.R. Scott.jpg|thumb|Scott's funeral monument in Mount Royal Cemetery.]]
Scott served as dean of law at [[McGill University]] from 1961 to 1964 and served on the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]]. In 1970 he was offered a seat in the [[Senate of Canada]] by [[Pierre Trudeau]] but declined the appointment.  He did, however, support Trudeau's imposition of the [[War Measures Act]] during the [[October Crisis]] that same year.

Scott opposed Quebec's [[Bill 22]] and [[Bill 101]] which established the province within its jurisdiction as an officially unilingual province within an officially bilingual country.

Following his death on January 30, 1985, Scott was interred in [[Mount Royal Cemetery]], Montreal.
