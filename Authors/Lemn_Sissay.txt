Norman Goldthorpe, a social worker assigned to his mother by Wigan Social Services, found foster parents for Sissay while his mother returned to Bracknell to finish her studies.

Goldthorpe named Sissay "Norman" and gave him to foster parents, telling them to treat it as an adoption.<ref name="Internalflight"/> The events are depicted in the play ''Something Dark'' and in BBC documentary ''Internal Flight''.<ref name="Internalflight"/><ref Name="SomethingDark">{{cite book |last=Sissay |first=Lemn |title=Something Dark |url=http://oberonbooks.com/black-history-month/hidden-gems |year=2008 |publisher=Oberon Books |isbn=978-1-84002-843-0 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415083751/http://oberonbooks.com/black-history-month/hidden-gems |archive-date=15 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="ABC">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/airplay/something-dark/4163562 |title=Something Dark by Lemn Sissay |publisher=ABC Radio |date=19 August 2012 |access-date=3 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="Dark">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/malta-events-something-dark.htm |title=Something Dark by Lemn Sissay |publisher=British Council |access-date=3 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505065707/http://www.britishcouncil.org/malta-events-something-dark.htm |archive-date=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His strongly religious foster parents wanted to name him Mark after the Christian [[Mark the Evangelist|evangelist Mark]] and give him their surname, Greenwood.

When Sissay was 12 years old, after his foster parents had had three children of their own, they placed him into a children's home and said neither they nor any of their family would contact him again.<ref name="Parliament"/>

Between the ages of 12 and 17, Sissay was held in a total of four children's homes. With no surrogate family or birth family, upon leaving the care system he was given his birth certificate, showing the name of his mother, Yemarshet Sissay, and his own legal name, Lemn Sissay. He was also given a letter from his files dated 1968, written by his mother to Norman Goldthorpe, pleading for his return. She wrote: "How can I get Lemn back? I want him to be with his own people, his own colour. I don't want him to face discrimination."<ref name="Internalflight"/><ref name="guardian">{{cite news |last=Lemn |first=Sissay |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/30/leaving-care-support-young-people |title=When I left care they said I was a great survivor |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 October 2012 |access-date=3 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Lemn |first=Sissay |title=One Extraordinary Woman in My World Now |url=http://blog.lemnsissay.com/2013/03/08/one-extraordinary-woman-in-my-world-now-yemarshet-sissay/ |website=lemnsissay.com |date=8 March 2013|access-date=3 July 2013}}</ref> From the point of leaving care, he began the search for his mother and took back his real name.<ref name="Internalflight"/><ref Name="SomethingDark"/>

At the age of 17, Sissay used his unemployment benefit money to self-publish his first poetry pamphlet, ''Perceptions of the Pen'', which he sold to striking miners in Lancashire.<ref name="Desert Island Discs">{{cite episode| title= Lemn Sissay| series= [[Desert Island Discs]] | credits= Presenter: Kirsty Young; Interviewed guest: Lemn Sissay; Producer: Cathy Drysdale| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06gthsz| airdate= 11 October 2015| minutes= 24:15| access-date= 13 October 2017 }}</ref> When he was 18 years old he moved from [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]] to the city of [[Manchester]]. At 19 he was a literature development worker at [[Commonword]], a community publishing cooperative in Manchester.

Sissay met his birth mother when he was 21, after a long search. She was working for the UN in the [[Gambia]].<ref Name="SomethingDark"/>

 |quote  =<poem>
Before we get to know each other 
And sing for tomorrow 
And unearth yesterday 
So that we can prepare our joint grave 
You should know that I have no family, 
Neither disowned nor distanced – none.

No birthdays nor Christmas, 
No telephone calls. It's been that way 
Since birth for what it's worth 
No next of skin.
</poem>

Sissay released his first book of poetry in 1988 at the age of 21, and since the age of 24 he has been a full-time writer, performing internationally. In 1995, he made the BBC documentary ''Internal Flight'' about his life. His 2005 drama ''Something Dark'' deals with his search for his family, and was adapted for [[BBC Radio 3]] in 2006, winning the UK [[Commission for Racial Equality]]'s Race in the Media Award (RIMA).<ref name="Internalflight"/><ref Name="SomethingDark"/>

In 2007, Sissay was appointed artist-in-residence at London's [[Southbank Centre]]. He was the official poet of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]], has worked with the [[British Council]] and is a patron of the Letterbox Club, supporting children in care.

Sissay's television appearances include ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' and the BBC's series ''[[Grumpy Old Men (TV series)|Grumpy Old Men]]''. As a radio broadcaster he makes documentaries for the BBC. He is a regular contributor on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s programme ''[[Saturday Live (radio series)|Saturday Live]]'', which in 2008 was nominated for two [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Awards]]. He also contributes to the BBC's ''Book Panel''.

In 2015, Sissay became the patron of [[ALL FM]] 96.9 Community Radio in Manchester, and he said: "I've always loved All Fm, partly because it's such diverse radio (with shows in Urdu, Polish, Somali, Persian, Cantonese and more), but also because it played 'Architecture' (Bertallot & Mo-Dus Remix), which I'd lost and the All Fm DJ sent me a copy." Sissay's poems are read frequently on All Fm and one of its older presenters, Li, aged 84, translated and read his poem "Invisible Kisses" in [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] and English. She said: "I love his poetry because it is so moving and not skin-deep."{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In June 2015, Sissay was elected as chancellor of the [[University of Manchester]] for a seven-year term<ref name="University of Manchester">{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=14746 |title=Lemn Sissay announced as next University of Manchester Chancellor |publisher=University of Manchester |date=22 June 2015|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> by university staff, registered alumni and members of the General Assembly.

the nature of trust, the strength of unassailable us.</poem>

In January 2016, Sissay wrote an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about the Foundling Museum's "Drawing on Childhood" exhibition in which he noted: "How a society treats those children who have no one to look after them is a measure of how civilised it is. It is scandalous that a prime minister should have to admit, as [[David Cameron]] did last autumn, that the care system 'shames our country' and that [[Ofsted]] should report that there are more councils judged as 'inadequate' than 'good' for their children’s services."<ref name="Guardian 1 January 2016">{{cite news |last= Sissay |first= Lemn | title= Orphans, foundlings and fostering in literature: a child's view of belonging |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/01/drawing-on-childhood-foundlings-museum-exhibition| date= 1 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London| access-date= 2 November 2017 }}</ref> Later that year he became the patron of theatre company 20 Stories High, based in [[Toxteth]], [[Liverpool]], which creates diverse theatre including beatboxing, singing, puppetry and other media.

In the same year, he staged a one-off show, entitled ''The Report'', based on a psychologist's report about Sissay's early life and how it affected him.
