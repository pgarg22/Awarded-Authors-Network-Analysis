'''Charlotte Brontë''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑr|l|ə|t|_|ˈ|b|r|ɒ|n|t|i}}, <small>commonly</small> {{IPAc-en|-|t|eɪ}};<ref>As given by ''Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature'' (Merriam-Webster, incorporated, Publishers: Springfield, Massachusetts, 1995), p. viii: "When our research shows that an author's pronunciation of his or her name differs from common usage, the author's pronunciation is listed first, and the descriptor ''commonly'' precedes the more familiar pronunciation." See also entries on Anne, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, pp. 175–176.</ref> 21 April 1816&nbsp;– 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three [[Brontë family|Brontë sisters]] who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of [[English literature]].

She enlisted in school at Roe Head in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] and [[Anne Brontë|Anne]], at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839, she undertook the role of governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth, where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead, they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although her first novel, ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'', was rejected by publishers, her second novel, ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.

Charlotte Brontë was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855, almost certainly from [[hyperemesis gravidarum]], a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.{{efn|"Hyperemesis", Greek: "overvomiting"; "gravidarum", Latin: "of pregnant females".}}

==Early years and education==
Charlotte Brontë was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street, [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], west of [[Bradford]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the third of the six children of [[Maria Branwell|Maria]] (née Branwell) and [[Patrick Brontë]] (formerly surnamed Brunty), an Irish [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1820 [[Brontë family|her family]] moved a few miles to the village of [[Haworth]], where her father had been appointed [[perpetual curate]] of [[St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth|St Michael and All Angels Church]]. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] and [[Anne Brontë|Anne]], and a son, [[Branwell Brontë|Branwell]], to be taken care of by her sister, [[Elizabeth Branwell]].

In August 1824, Patrick sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth to the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School]] at [[Cowan Bridge]] in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died of [[tuberculosis]] in June 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.

At home in [[Haworth Parsonage]], Brontë acted as "the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cousin|first=John|title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature|year=1910|publisher=E.P. Dutton & Co.}}</ref> Brontë wrote her first known poem at the age of 13 in 1829, and was to go on to write more than 200 poems in the course of her life.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=119}} Many of her poems were "published" in their homemade magazine ''[[Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine]]'', and concerned the fictional world of ''[[Glass Town]]''.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=119}} She and her surviving siblings&nbsp;– Branwell, Emily and Anne&nbsp;– created this shared  world, and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdom in 1827.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=5}}<ref name="fr2">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=David W|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5F_n_qxvHSYC|title=The Brontes of Haworth|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55369-809-8}}</ref> Charlotte, in private letters, called ''Glass Town'' "her 'world below', a private escape where she could act out her desires and multiple identities".<ref name=":1">{{cite web|date=21 April 2016|title=The secret history of Jane Eyre: Charlotte Brontë's private fantasy stories|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/21/the-secret-history-of-jane-eyre-charlotte-brontes-private-fantasy-stories|access-date=6 June 2021|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Charlotte's "predilection for romantic settings, passionate relationships, and high society is at odds with Branwell's obsession with battles and politics and her young sisters' homely North Country realism, none the less at this stage there is still a sense of the writings as a family enterprise".<ref name=":9">{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Patricia|date=1989|title=Review|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/516528|journal=The Review of English Studies|volume=40|issue=158|pages=284|jstor=516528|issn=0034-6551|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

However, from 1831 onwards, Emily and Anne 'seceded' from the ''Glass Town Confederacy'' to create a 'spin-off' called ''[[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]]'', which included many of their poems.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|last=Maye|first=Brian|title=Understanding Emily Brontë: 'Stronger than a man, simpler than a child'|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/understanding-emily-bront%C3%AB-stronger-than-a-man-simpler-than-a-child-1.3570351|access-date=6 June 2021|website=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Price|first=Sandra Leigh|date=17 May 2018|title=Emily Bronte and Me|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/emily-bronte-and-me-20180511-h0zxzc.html|access-date=6 June 2021|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> After 1831, Charlotte and Branwell concentrated on an evolution of the ''Glass Town Confederacy'' called ''Angria''.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=5}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Brontë juvenilia: The History of Angria|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/bront-juvenilia-the-history-of-angria|access-date=7 June 2021|website=The British Library}}</ref> Christine Alexander, a Brontë juvenilia historian,<ref name=":10">{{cite web|last=Plater|first=Diana|date=6 June 2016|title=Professor Christine Alexander and Charlotte Bronte's juvenilia|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/professor-christine-alexander-and-charlotte-brontes-juvenilia-20160603-gpapss.html|access-date=7 June 2021|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> wrote "both Charlotte and Branwell ensured the consistency of their imaginary world.

[[File:Roe Head, Mirfield - geograph.org.uk - 55901.jpg|thumb|Roe Head School, in [[Mirfield]]]]
Between 1831 and 1832, Brontë continued her education at Roe Head in [[Mirfield]], where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents [[Ellen Nussey]] and [[Mary Taylor (women's rights advocate)|Mary Taylor]].{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} In 1833 she wrote a novella, ''The Green Dwarf'', using the name Wellesley. Around about 1833, her stories shifted from tales of the supernatural to more realistic stories.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=8}} She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838. Unhappy and lonely as a teacher at Roe Head, Brontë took out her sorrows in poetry, writing a series of melancholic poems.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=120}} In "We wove a Web in Childhood" written in December 1835, Brontë drew a sharp contrast between her miserable life as a teacher and the vivid imaginary worlds she and her siblings had created.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=120}} In another poem "Morning was its freshness still" written at the same time, Brontë wrote "Tis bitter sometimes to recall/Illusions once deemed fair".{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=120}} Many of her poems concerned the imaginary world of Angria, often concerning [[Byronic hero]]es, and in December 1836 she wrote to the Poet Laureate [[Robert Southey]] asking him for encouragement of her career as a poet. Southey [https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/letter-from-robert-southey-to-charlotte-bronte-12-march-1837 replied], famously, that "Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation." This advice she respected but did not heed.

In 1839, she took up the first of many positions as [[governess]] to families in [[Yorkshire]], a career she pursued until 1841. In particular, from May to July 1839 she was employed by the Sidgwick family at their summer residence, [[Stone Gappe]], in Lothersdale, where one of her charges was John Benson Sidgwick (1835–1927), an unruly child who on one occasion threw the Bible at Charlotte, an incident that may have been the inspiration for a part of the opening chapter of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in which John Reed throws a book at the young Jane.{{sfn|Phillips-Evans|2012|pp=260–261}} Brontë did not enjoy her work as a governess, noting her employers treated her almost as a slave, constantly humiliating her.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=18}}

Brontë was of slight build and was less than five feet tall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bronte.org.uk/the-brontes-and-haworth/family-and-friends/charlotte-bronte |title=Charlotte Brontë; Bronte Parsonage Museum |publisher=Bronte.org.uk |access-date=26 March 2016}}</ref>

==Brussels and Haworth==
[[File:Pensionnat Heger plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque in Brussels, on the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]]]]
In 1842 Charlotte and Emily travelled to [[Brussels]] to <!-- This article is written in British English, in which "enrol" is correct; do not change to "enroll" -->enrol at the boarding school run by [[Constantin Héger]] (1809–1896) and his wife Claire Zoé Parent Héger (1804–1887). During her time in Brussels, Brontë, who favoured the [[Protestant]] ideal of an individual in direct contact with God, objected to the stern [[Catholicism]] of Madame Héger, which she considered a tyrannical religion that enforced conformity and submission to the Pope.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=29}} In return for board and tuition Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the school was cut short when their aunt Elizabeth Branwell, who had joined the family in Haworth to look after the children after their mother's death, died of [[Bowel obstruction|internal obstruction]] in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the school. Her second stay was not happy: she was homesick and deeply attached to Constantin Héger. She returned to Haworth in January 1844 and used the time spent in Brussels as the inspiration for some of the events in ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]''.

After returning to Haworth, Charlotte and her sisters made headway with opening their own boarding school in the family home. It was advertised as "The Misses Brontë's Establishment for the Board and Education of a limited number of Young Ladies" and inquiries were made to prospective pupils and sources of funding. But none were attracted and in October 1844, the project was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|title= Charlotte Bronte: A Fiery Heart|last= Harman |first=Claire |author-link=Claire Harman (writer) |publisher= Vintage |year= 2015|isbn=978-0-30796208-9 |pages= 206–8}}</ref>

==First publication==
In May 1846 Charlotte, Emily, and Anne self-financed the publication of a joint collection of poems under their assumed names Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The pseudonyms veiled the sisters' sex while preserving their initials; thus Charlotte was Currer Bell. "Bell" was the middle name of Haworth's curate, [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]] whom Charlotte later married, and "Currer" was the surname of [[Frances Mary Richardson Currer]] who had funded their school (and maybe their father).<ref name=odnb>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Colin |last=Lee|title= Currer, Frances Mary Richardson (1785–1861)|volume=1|encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6951| access-date= 1 November 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/6951}}</ref> Of the decision to use ''noms de plume'', Charlotte wrote:
{{quote| Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because&nbsp;– without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called "feminine"&nbsp;– we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.<ref>"Biographical Notice of Ellis And Acton Bell", from the preface to the 1910 edition of ''Wuthering Heights''.</ref>}}
Although only two copies of the collection of poems were sold, the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels, continuing to use their ''noms de plume'' when sending manuscripts to potential publishers.

==''The Professor'' and ''Jane Eyre''==
{{main|Jane Eyre}}
[[File:Jane Eyre title page.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the first edition of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'']]
Brontë's first manuscript, 'The Professor', did not secure a publisher, although she was heartened by an encouraging response from [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] of Cornhill, who expressed an interest in any longer works Currer Bell might wish to send.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=14}} Brontë responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847. Six weeks later, ''Jane Eyre'' was published. It tells the story of a plain governess, [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane]], who, after difficulties in her early life, falls in love with her employer, [[Mr Rochester]]. They marry, but only after Rochester's insane first wife, of whom Jane initially has no knowledge, dies in a dramatic house fire. The book's style was innovative, combining Romanticism, [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] with [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[melodrama]], and broke new ground in being written from an intensely evoked first-person female perspective.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=12–13}} Brontë believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in ''Jane Eyre'' she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=13}}

''Jane Eyre'' had immediate commercial success and initially received favourable reviews. [[George Henry Lewes|G. H. Lewes]] wrote that it was "an utterance from the depths of a struggling, suffering, much-enduring spirit", and declared that it consisted of "''suspiria de profundis''!" (sighs from the depths).{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=13}} Speculation about the identity and gender of the mysterious Currer Bell heightened with the publication of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by Ellis Bell (Emily) and ''[[Agnes Grey]]'' by Acton Bell (Anne).{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=15}} Accompanying the speculation was a change in the critical reaction to Brontë's work, as accusations were made that the writing was "coarse",{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=24}} a judgement more readily made once it was suspected that Currer Bell was a woman.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=17}} However, sales of ''Jane Eyre'' continued to be strong and may even have increased as a result of the novel developing a reputation as an "improper" book.<ref>''North American Review'', October 1848, cited in ''The Brontës: The Critical Heritage'' by Allott, M. (ed.), Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974, cited in Miller (p18)</ref> A talented amateur artist, Brontë personally did the drawings for the second edition of ''Jane Eyre'' and in the summer of 1834 two of her paintings were shown at an exhibition by the Royal Northern Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Leeds.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=29}}

==''Shirley'' and bereavements==
In 1848 Brontë began work on the manuscript of her second novel, [[Shirley (novel)|''Shirley'']]. It was only partially completed when the Brontë family suffered the deaths of three of its members within eight months. In September 1848 Branwell died of [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] and [[marasmus]], exacerbated by heavy drinking, although Brontë believed that his death was due to [[tuberculosis]]. Branwell may have had a [[laudanum]] addiction. Emily became seriously ill shortly after his funeral and died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848. Anne died of the same disease in May 1849. Brontë was unable to write at this time.

After Anne's death Brontë resumed writing as a way of dealing with her grief,<ref>Letter from Charlotte to her publisher, 25 June 1849, from {{cite book |title=The Letters of Charlotte Brontë: Volume Two, 1848 – 1851 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=M |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1995}} cited in {{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=19}}</ref> and ''Shirley'', which deals with themes of industrial unrest and the role of women in society, was published in October 1849. Unlike ''Jane Eyre'', which is written in the first person, ''Shirley'' is written in the third person and lacks the emotional immediacy of her first novel,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=19}} and reviewers found it less shocking.  Brontë, as her late sister's heir, [[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall#Suppression|suppressed]] the republication of Anne's second novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', an action which had a deleterious effect on Anne's popularity as a novelist and has remained controversial among the sisters' biographers ever since.<ref>[http://www.mick-armitage.staff.shef.ac.uk/anne/an-novls.html The Novels of Anne Brontë].</ref>

==In society==
In view of the success of her novels, particularly ''Jane Eyre'', Brontë was persuaded by her publisher to make occasional visits to London, where she revealed her true identity and began to move in more exalted social circles, becoming friends with [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], and acquainted with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and G.H. Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father.  Thackeray's daughter, writer [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie]], recalled a visit to her father by Brontë:
{{quote| …two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, with fair straight hair and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed in a little ''[[wikt:barège|barège]]'' dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This then is the authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the books&nbsp;– the wonderful books.  …The moment is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, genius though she may be, Miss Brontë can barely reach his elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially to forward little girls who wish to chatter.  …Everyone waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Brontë retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess… the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all… after Miss Brontë had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him… long afterwards… Mrs Procter asked me if I knew what had happened.  …It was one of the dullest evenings [Mrs Procter] had ever spent in her life… the ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the gloom and the constraint, and how finally, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his club.<ref>Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie. Chapters from Some Memoirs, cited in [[James Runcieman Sutherland|Sutherland, James]] (ed.) ''The Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes''.  OUP, 1975. {{ISBN|0-19-812139-3}}.</ref>}}
Brontë's friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, while not particularly close, was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Brontë after her death in 1855.

==''Villette''==
Brontë's third novel, the last published in her lifetime, was ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', which appeared in 1853. Its main themes include isolation, how such a condition can be borne,<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid Banks|first= L.|title=Path to the Silent Country|publisher= Penguin|year= 1977|page=113}}</ref> and the internal conflict brought about by social repression of individual desire.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=47}} Its main character, Lucy Snowe, travels abroad to teach in a boarding school in the fictional town of Villette, where she encounters a culture and religion different from her own and falls in love with a man (Paul Emanuel) whom she cannot marry. Her experiences result in a breakdown but eventually, she achieves independence and fulfilment through running her own school. A substantial amount of the novel's dialogue is in the French language. ''Villette'' marked Brontë's return to writing from a first-person perspective (that of Lucy Snowe), the technique she had used in ''Jane Eyre''. Another similarity to ''Jane Eyre'' lies in the use of aspects of her own life as inspiration for fictional events,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=47}} in particular her reworking of the time she spent at the ''pensionnat'' in Brussels. ''Villette'' was acknowledged by critics of the day as a potent and sophisticated piece of writing although it was criticised for "coarseness" and for not being suitably "feminine" in its portrayal of Lucy's desires.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=52}}

==Marriage==

Before the publication of ''Villette'', Brontë received an expected proposal of marriage from Irishman [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]], her father's [[curate]], who had long been in love with her.{{sfn|Paddock|Rollyson|2003|p=19}} She initially refused him and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nicholls's poor financial status. Elizabeth Gaskell, who believed that marriage provided "clear and defined duties" that were beneficial for a woman,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=54}} encouraged Brontë to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nicholls's finances. According to [[James Pope-Hennessy]] in ''The Flight of Youth,'' it was the generosity of [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]] that made the marriage possible. Brontë meanwhile was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854 she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married in June.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=54–55}} Her father Patrick had intended to give Charlotte away, but at the last minute decided he could not, and Charlotte had to make her way to the church without him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03n0wsy/p03n0s7x|title=Being the Brontes – Charlotte Bronte's marriage with The Rev.

==Death==

''The Professor'', the first novel Brontë had written, was published posthumously in 1857. The fragment of a new novel she had been writing in her last years has been twice completed by recent authors, the more famous version being ''[[Emma Brown]]: A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Brontë'' by [[Clare Boylan]] in 2003. Most of her writings about the imaginary country Angria have also been published since her death. In 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a belated obituary for her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/obituaries/overlooked-charlotte-bronte.html|title=Overlooked No More: Charlotte Brontë, Novelist Known for 'Jane Eyre'|date=8 March 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Dominus|first1=Susan}}</ref>

==Religion==
The daughter of an Irish [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, Brontë was herself an Anglican. In a letter to her publisher, she claims to "love the Church of England. Her Ministers indeed, I do not regard as infallible personages, I have seen too much of them for that – but to the Establishment, with all her faults – the profane [[Athanasian Creed]] excluded – I am sincerely attached."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Emily |last=Griesinger |title= Charlotte Bronte's Religion: Faith, Feminism, and Jane Eyre |journal=Christianity and Literature |volume=58 |number=1 |date=Autumn 2008|pages=29–59|doi=10.1177/014833310805800103 }}</ref>

In a letter to [[Ellen Nussey]] she wrote: 
{{block quote|If I could always live with you, and "daily" read the [B]ible with you, if your lips and mine could at the same time, drink the same draught from the same pure fountain of Mercy – I hope, I trust, I might one day become better, far better, than my evil wandering thoughts, my corrupt heart, cold to the spirit, and warm to the flesh will now permit me to be.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Emily |last=Griesinger |title= Charlotte Bronte's Religion: Faith, Feminism, and Jane Eyre |journal=Christianity and Literature |volume=58 |pages=29–59 |number=1 |date=Autumn 2008|doi=10.1177/014833310805800103 }}</ref>}}

==''The Life of Charlotte Brontë''==
[[File:CharlotteBrontePortrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by J. H. Thompson at the Brontë Parsonage Museum]]
[[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s biography ''[[The Life of Charlotte Brontë]]'' was published in 1857. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another,{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=57}} and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Brontë's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of "coarseness" that had been levelled at her writing.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=57}} The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Brontë's love for Héger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Brontë's father, widower, and friends.{{sfn|Lane|1953|pp= 178–83}} Mrs Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Brontë, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Brontë's diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage.<ref>[[Juliet Barker]], ''The Brontës''</ref> It has been argued that Gaskell's approach transferred the focus of attention away from the 'difficult' novels, not just Brontë's, but all the sisters', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pp=57–58}}

==Héger letters==
On 29 July 1913 ''[[The Times]]'' of London printed four letters Brontë had written to [[Constantin Héger]] after leaving Brussels in 1844.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=109}} Written in French except for one postscript in English, the letters broke the prevailing image of Brontë as an angelic martyr to Christian and female duties that had been constructed by many biographers, beginning with Gaskell.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=109}} The letters, which formed part of a larger and somewhat one-sided correspondence in which Héger frequently appears not to have replied, reveal that she had been in love with a married man, although they are complex and have been interpreted in numerous ways, including as an example of literary self-dramatisation and an expression of gratitude from a former pupil.{{sfn|Miller|2002|p=109}}

In 1980 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]] (BOZAR), on the site of the Madam Heger's school, in honour of Charlotte and Emily.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Plaque is Unveiled in Brussels to Commemorate the Stay of Charlotte and Emily Brontë at the Pensionnat Heger |journal=Brontë Society Transactions

"At the end of 1839, Brontë said goodbye to her fantasy world in a manuscript called Farewell to Angria. More and more, she was finding that she preferred to escape to her imagined worlds over remaining in reality – and she feared that she was going mad. So she said goodbye to her characters, scenes and subjects. [...] She wrote of the pain she felt at wrenching herself from her 'friends' and venturing into lands unknown".<ref name=":1" />
