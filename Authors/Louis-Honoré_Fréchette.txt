==Early life and education==
Born in [[Lévis, Quebec|Lévis]], [[Lower Canada]], from 1854 to 1860 Fréchette did his classical studies at the [[Séminaire de Québec]], the Collège de Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière and at the Séminaire de Nicolet. He later studied law at [[Université Laval]].

==Career==

In 1864, he opened a lawyer's office in Lévis where he founded two newspapers: ''Le drapeau de Lévis'' and ''La Tribune de Levis''. He exiled himself in Chicago where he wrote ''La voix d'un exilé''.  A number of plays which he wrote during that period were lost in the [[Great Chicago Fire]].

Fréchette returned to Quebec in 1871, where he was a Liberal candidate for Lévis in the provincial elections that year; he was not elected.<ref name="BrownCook1966">{{cite book|author1=George W. Brown|author2=Ramsay Cook|author3=Jean Hamelin|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxK0A0FUvZgC&pg=PA359|year=1966|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-8020-3998-9|page=359}}</ref> However, in 1874 he was elected Member of Parliament in [[Ottawa]]. He served in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1874 to 1878 as the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] member from [[Lévis (electoral district)|Lévis]].He was not re-elected in 1878. After that, he moved to [[Montreal]] where he began writing full-time, having inherited the wealth of his aunt when she died.

He was the first Quebecer to receive the [[Montyon Prizes|Montyon Prize]] of the [[Académie française]] for his collection of poems ''Les Fleurs boréales, les oiseaux de neige'' (1879).

In 1881, he was given an honorary LLD by [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's College, Kingston]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Adelphus Todd|journal=The Week : A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts|date=January 31, 1884|volume=1|issue=9|page=137|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n69/mode/1up|access-date=April 25, 2013}}</ref>  In that same year Fréchette would meet [[Mark Twain]] in Montreal, whose writing he had much admired; indeed the two would remain friends, exchanging works and favorite books.<ref>{{cite magazine|quote=Our national poet, Louis Frechette, a friend of Mark Twain's exchanged books, and commented on each other's work, as if it was of the same quality|magazine=[[Canadian Forum|The Canadian Forum]]|publisher=Survival Foundation|title=Louis Fréchette|editor1=Charles Bruce Sissons|editor2=Richard De Brisay|year=1975|volume=LV|page=8}}</ref> In the following year Twain would toast Fréchette at an American welcoming banquet in [[Holyoke]], joking about his regard for the translation of works that in his fictitious "translation his [Fréchette's] pathetic poems have naturally become humorous, his humorous poems have become sad. Anybody who knows even the rudiments of arithmetic will know that Monsieur Fréchette's poems are now worth exactly twice as much as they were before."<ref>{{cite book|title=Mark Twain Speaking|pages=166–168|editor=Paul Fatout|author=Mark Twain|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=1976|isbn=9781587297199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mkFgXWvUkVoC&pg=PA166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|language=fr|trans-title=Samuel Langhorne Clemens translator; Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (1895-1896) and the disguises of language|title=Samuel Langhorne Clemens traducteur; Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (1895-1896) et les travestissements de la langue|journal=Revue Française d'Études Américaines|date=January 2014|issue=138|pages=40–56|last=Jenn|first=Ronald|doi=10.3917/rfea.138.0040}}</ref>
In 1897 Fréchette was made a Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]]. After his death in 1908, he was entombed at the [[Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery]] in Montreal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Répertoire des personnages inhumés au cimetière ayant marqué l'histoire de notre société|publisher=Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery|location=Montreal|language=fr}}</ref>
