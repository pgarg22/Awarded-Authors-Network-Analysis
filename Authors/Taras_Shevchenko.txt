He was a fellow of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. Though he had never been the member of the [[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]], in 1847 Shevchenko was politically convicted for explicitly promoting the independence of Ukraine, writing poems in the Ukrainian language,  and ridiculing members of the Russian Imperial House. Contrary to the members of the society who did not understand that their activity led to the idea of the independent Ukraine, according to the secret police, he was the champion of independence.<ref name="Orlov report">{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/rizne/kmt03.htm|script-title=uk:Витяг зі справи М.

Taras Shevchenko was born on {{OldStyleDate|9 March|1814|25 February}}{{ref label|idB|Note b|none}} in the village of [[Moryntsi]], Zvenyhorodka county, [[Kiev Governorate|Kyiv Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (today [[Zvenyhorodka Raion]], [[Ukraine]]).

According to the family legends, Taras's forefathers were [[Cossack]]s who served in the [[Zaporizhian Host|Zaporozhian Host]] and had taken part in the Cossack uprisings of the 17th and 18th centuries. Those uprisings were brutally suppressed in [[Cherkasy]], [[Poltava]], Kyiv, Bratslav, and Chernihiv disrupting normal social life for many years afterwards. Most of the local population were then enslaved and reduced to poverty.

In 1816 Shevchenko family moved back to the village of Kyrylivka (today Shevchenkove) in Zvenyhorodka county, where Taras' father, Hryhoriy Ivanovych, had been born.<ref>Documents and materials, 4</ref> Taras spent his childhood years in the village.

For almost two and a half years, from fall of 1828 to start of 1831, Shevchenko stayed with his master in Vilno ([[Vilnius]]).<ref name="Osnova 1862. Book 3. 10"/><ref>Works.

In the same city Shevchenko could also have witnessed the [[November Uprising]] of 1830. From those times Shevchenko's painting "Bust of a Woman"<ref>Works in 10 volumes. Vol.7. Book 1. 1</ref> survived. It indicates almost professional handling of the pencil.

After moving from Vilno to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1831, Engelgardt took Shevchenko along with him.<ref>Chalyi, M. ''Life and works of T.Shevchenko''. 22</ref><ref>Zhur, P. ''Shevchenkovite Petersburg''. 30</ref><ref>Saint Petersburg Herald. February 9, 1831</ref> To benefit from the art works (since it was prestigious to have one's own "chamber artist"), Engelgardt sent Shevchenko to painter [[Vasiliy Shiriayev]] for four-year study. From that point and until 1838 Shevchenko lived in the Khrestovskyi building (today Zahorodnii prospekt, 8) where Shiriayev rented an apartment.<ref name="Works in 10 volumes. Vol.5. 188"/><ref>Zhur, P. ''Shevchenkovite Petersburg''. 47</ref> In his free time at night, Shevchenko visited the [[Summer Garden]] where he portrayed statues.

In his novel "Artist" Shevchenko described that during the pre-academical period he painted such works as "Apollo Belvedere", "Fraklete", "[[Heraclitus]]", "Architectural barelief", "Mask of Fortune".<ref name=vol7_book2/><ref>Works in 10 volumes.

===Out of serfdom===
In Saint Petersburg Shevchenko met Ukrainian artist [[Ivan Soshenko]], who introduced him to other compatriots such as [[Yevhen Hrebinka]] and [[Vasyl Hryhorovych]], and to Russian painter [[Alexey Venetsianov]]. Through these men Shevchenko also met famous painter and professor [[Karl Briullov]], who donated his portrait of [[Russian Literature|Russian poet]] [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] as a lottery prize. Its proceeds were used to buy Shevchenko's freedom on 5 May 1838.<ref name="EoU"/>

Shevchenko was accepted as a student into the Academy of Arts in the workshop of [[Karl Briullov]] in the same year. The following year he became a resident student at the ''[[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts|Association for the Encouragement of Artists]]''. During annual examinations at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], Shevchenko won the silver medal for landscape painting. In 1840 he again received the silver medal, this time for his first oil painting, ''[[The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/shevchenko/docum02.htm|title=Документи 1-101.

Shevchenko began writing poetry while still being a serf, and in 1840 his first collection of poetry, ''[[Kobzar (book)|Kobzar]]'',<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://kobzar.ua/site/intro|title=Портал Шевченка|website=kobzar.ua}}</ref>  was published. According to [[Ivan Franko]], a renowned Ukrainian poet in the generation after Shevchenko, "[''Kobzar''] was "a new world of poetry. It burst forth like a spring of clear, cold water, and sparkled with a clarity, breadth and elegance of artistic expression not previously known in Ukrainian writing".

In 1841, the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|Haidamaky]]'' was released.<ref name="auto"/> In September 1841, Shevchenko was awarded his third silver medal for ''The Gypsy Fortune Teller''. Shevchenko also wrote plays. In 1842, he released a part of the tragedy ''Mykyta Haidai'' and in 1843 he completed the drama ''Nazar Stodolia''.

While residing in Saint Petersburg, Shevchenko made three trips to [[Ukraine]], in 1843, 1845, and 1846. The difficult conditions Ukrainians had made a profound impact on the poet-painter. Shevchenko visited his siblings, still enserfed, and other relatives. He met with prominent Ukrainian writers and intellectuals [[Yevhen Hrebinka]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]], and [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]], and was befriended by the princely [[Repnin]] family, especially Varvara.

In 1844, distressed by the condition of Ukrainian regions in the [[Russian Empire]], Shevchenko decided to capture some of his homeland's historical ruins and cultural monuments in an album of etchings, which he called ''[[Picturesque Ukraine]]''. Only the first six etchings were printed because of the lack of means to continue.<ref name="auto"/>
An album of watercolors from historical places and pencil drawings was done in 1845.<ref name="auto"/>

===Exile===

On 22 March 1845, the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title of a non-classed artist. He again travelled to Ukraine where he met with historian [[Nikolay Kostomarov]] and other members of the [[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]], a clandestine society also known as ''Ukrainian-Slavic society''<ref name="Orlov report"/> and dedicated to the political [[liberalization]] of the Empire and its transformation into a [[federation]]-like polity of Slavic nations.<ref name="Orlov report"/> Upon the society's [[oppression|suppression]] by the authorities, Shevchenko's wrote a poem "Dream", that was confiscated from the society's members and became one of the major issues of the scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/shevchenko/shev128.htm|script-title=uk:Сон|trans-title=The Dream|language=uk|publisher=Litopys|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219181841/http://litopys.org.ua/shevchenko/shev128.htm|archive-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>

Shevchenko was arrested together with the members of the society on 5 April 1847.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/russian-and-eastern-european-literature-biographies/taras-grigoryevich | title = Taras Shevchenko |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography |publisher=The Gale Group | date = 2004}}</ref> Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] read Shevchenko's poem, "Dream". [[Vissarion Belinsky]] wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy appearance and facial [[tic]]s, which she had developed fearing the [[Decembrist Uprising]] and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated "I suppose he had reasons not to be on terms with me, but what has she done to deserve this?"<ref>{{cite book|last=Belinsky|first=Vissarion|author-link=Vissarion Belinsky|url=http://litopys.org.ua/shevchenko/belinsky.htm|script-title=ru:Письмо В.

While under investigation, Shevchenko was imprisoned in [[Saint Petersburg]] in casemates of the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|3rd Department of Imperial Chancellery]] on Panteleimonovskaya Street (today Pestelia str., 9). After being convicted, he was exiled as a [[Private (rank)|private]] to the Russian military garrison in [[Orenburg]]<ref name="Orlov report"/> at [[Orsk]], near the [[Ural Mountains]].

[[File:Shevchenko-Dalismen.jpg|thumb|Dalismen-mule-village, 1851]]

Next year in 1848, he was assigned to undertake the first Russian naval expedition of the [[Aral Sea]] on the ship "Konstantin", under the command of Lieutenant Butakov. Although officially a common private, Shevchenko was effectively treated as an equal by the other members of the expedition. He was tasked to sketch various landscapes around the coast of the Aral Sea. After an 18-month voyage (1848–49) Shevchenko returned with his album of drawings and paintings to Orenburg. Most of those drawings were created for a detailed account about the expedition. Nevertheless, Shevchenko created many unique works of art about the Aral Sea nature and Kazakhstan people at a time when Russian conquest of Central Asia had begun in the middle of the nineteenth century.<ref>

He was then sent to one of the worst penal settlements, the remote fortress of [[Fort Shevchenko|Novopetrovsk]] at Mangyshlak Peninsula, where he spent seven terrible years. In 1851, at the suggestion of fellow serviceman [[Bronisław Zaleski]], lieutenant colonel Mayevsky assigned him to the Mangyshlak (Karatau) geological expedition. In 1857 Shevchenko finally returned from exile after receiving amnesty from a new emperor, though he was not permitted to return to St. Petersburg and was forced to stay in [[Nizhniy Novgorod]].

In May 1859, Shevchenko got permission to return to [[Ukraine]]. He intended to buy a plot of land close to the village [[Pekari]]. In July, he was again arrested on a charge of [[blasphemy]], but then released and ordered to return to St. Petersburg.<ref name=rodovid />

===Death===
Taras Shevchenko spent the last years of his life working on new poetry, paintings, and engravings, as well as editing his older works.  After difficult years in exile, however, his illnesses took their toll upon him. Shevchenko died in Saint Petersburg on 10 March 1861.

He was first buried at the [[Smolensk Cemetery]] in Saint Petersburg. However, fulfilling Shevchenko's wish, expressed in his poem "Testament" (''"Zapovit"''), to be buried in [[Ukraine]], his friends arranged the transfer of his remains by train to Moscow and then by horse-drawn wagon to his homeland. Shevchenko was re-buried on 8 May on the ''[[Chernecha hora]]'' (Monk's Hill; today [[Taras Hill]]) near the [[Dnipro River]] and [[Kaniv]].<ref name="EoU"/> A tall mound was erected over his grave, now a memorial part of the Kaniv Museum-Preserve.

Dogged by terrible misfortune in love and life, the poet died seven days before the [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|1861 emancipation of serfs]] was announced. His works and life are [[Legacy of Taras Shevchenko|revered by Ukrainians throughout the world]] and his impact on [[Ukrainian literature]] is immense.

==Poetic works==
{{Expand section|date=June 2020}}
237 poems were written by Taras Shevchenko but only 28 of these were published in the [[Russian Empire]] and other 6 in the [[Austrian Empire]] over his lifetime.

===Example of poetry: "Testament" (''Zapovit'')===
Shevchenko's  "Testament", (''Zapovit'', 1845), has been translated into more than 150 languages and set to music in the 1870s by H. Hladky.

{{lang|uk|
Як умру, то поховайте
Мене на могилі,
Серед степу широкого,
На Вкраїні милій,
Щоб лани широкополі,
І Дніпро, і кручі
Було видно, було чути,
Як реве ревучий.
Як понесе з України
У синєє море
Кров ворожу... отоді я
І лани, і гори —
Все покину і полину
До самого Бога
Молитися... а до того
Я не знаю Бога.
Поховайте та вставайте,
Кайдани порвіте
І вражою злою кров'ю
Волю окропіте.
І мене в сiм'ї великій,
В сiм'ї вольній, новій,
Не забудьте пом'янути
Незлим тихим словом.

When I die, then make my grave
High on an ancient mound,
In my own beloved Ukraine,
In steppeland without bound:
Whence one may see wide-skirted wheatland,
Dnipro's steep-cliffed shore,
There whence one may hear the blustering
River wildly roar.
Till from Ukraine to the blue sea
It bears in fierce endeavour
The blood of foemen — then I'll leave
Wheatland and hills forever:
Leave all behind, soar up until
Before the throne of God 
I'll make my prayer. For till that hour
I shall know naught of God.
Make my grave there — and arise,
Sundering your chains,
Bless your freedom with the blood
Of foemen's evil veins!
Then in that great family,
A family new and free,
Do not forget, with good intent
Speak quietly of me.

When I am dead, bury me
In my beloved Ukraine,
My tomb upon a grave mound high
Amid the spreading plain,
So that the fields, the boundless steppes,
The Dnieper's plunging shore
My eyes could see, my ears could hear
The mighty river roar.
When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears
Into the deep blue sea
The blood of foes ... then will I leave
These hills and fertile fields—
I'll leave them all and fly away
To the abode of God,
And then I'll pray .... But until that day
I know nothing of God.
Oh bury me, then rise ye up
And break your heavy chains
And water with the tyrants' blood
The freedom you have gained.
And in the great new family,
The family of the free,
With softly spoken, kindly word
Remember also me.

==Artwork==
{{Expand section|date=June 2020}}

835 works survived into modern times in original form and partly in [[printmaking|prints]] engraved on [[metal]] and [[wood]] by Russian and other foreign engravers, while some works survived as copies done by painters while Shevchenko still lived. There is data on over 270 more works which were lost and have not been found yet. Painted and engraved works at the time of completion are dated 1830-1861 and are territorially related to Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. The genres are - portraits, compositions on mythological, historical and household themes, architectural landscapes and scenery. The techniques used for that were [[oil painting]] on canvas, [[watercolor painting|watercolor]], [[Sepia (color)|sepia]], [[India ink|inking]], lead pencil, as well as etching on separate sheets of white, colored and tinted paper of different sizes and in five albums. A significant part of Shevchenko's artistic heritage consists of completed paintings, however there are also [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]], etudes and [[Drawing|outlines]] which are no less valuable for understanding Shevchenko's methods and artistic path. Of all Shevchenko's paintings only a small part has any authorial signatures or inscriptions and even smaller part has dates.

==Family==
Shevchenko never married. He had six siblings and at least three step-siblings, of whom only Stepan Tereshchenko (1820?–unknown) is known. Some sources connect him to the [[Tereshchenko family]] of Ukrainian industrialists.<ref name="rodovid">{{Cite web|url=https://uk.rodovid.org/wk/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81:56809|title=Тарас Григорович Шевченко нар. 9 березня 1814 пом. 10 березня 1861 - Родовід|website=uk.rodovid.org}}</ref>

===Impact===
Taras Shevchenko's writings formed the foundation for the modern [[Ukrainian literature]] to a degree that he is also considered the founder of the modern written [[Ukrainian language]] (although [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]] pioneered the literary work in what was close to the [[modern Ukrainian language|modern Ukrainian]] in the end of the 18th century).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Shevchenko's poetry contributed greatly to the growth of Ukrainian national consciousness, and his influence on various facets of Ukrainian intellectual, literary, and national life is still felt to this day. Influenced by [[Romanticism]], Shevchenko managed to find his own manner of poetic expression that encompassed themes and ideas germane to Ukraine and his personal vision of its past and future.

In view of his literary importance, the impact of his artistic work is often missed, although his contemporaries valued his artistic work no less, or perhaps even more, than his literary work. A great number of his pictures, drawings and etchings preserved to this day testify to his unique artistic talent. He also experimented with photography and it is little known that Shevchenko may be considered to have pioneered the [[etching (art)|art of etching]] in the Russian Empire (in 1860 he was awarded the title of [[Academician]] in the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] specifically for his achievements in etching.)<ref name=Zerkalo147>{{cite journal|first1=Paola|last1=Utevskaya|author2=Dmitriy Gorbachev|url=http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/147/12494/|script-title=ru:'Он мог бы понять самого Пикассо'|trans-title=He could have understood Picasso himself|language=ru|journal=Zerkalo Nedeli|publisher=zerkalo-nedeli.com|volume=30|issue=147|date=August 1997|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118123113/http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/147/12494/|archive-date=18 January 2005|df=dmy}}</ref>

Shevchenko, who himself was born a [[serf]] and suffered tremendously for his political views in opposition to the established order of the Empire, was presented in the Soviet times as an internationalist who stood up in general for the plight of the poor classes exploited by the reactionary political regime rather than the vocal proponent of the Ukrainian national idea.

This view is significantly revised in modern independent Ukraine, where he is now viewed as almost an iconic figure with unmatched significance for the Ukrainian nation, a view that has been mostly shared all along by the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] that has always revered Shevchenko.

He inspired some of the protestors during the [[Euromaidan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ayres|first=Sabra|title=In divided Ukraine, inspiration from a poet of the underdog|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0309/In-divided-Ukraine-inspiration-from-a-poet-of-the-underdog-video|access-date=15 March 2014|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=March 9, 2014}}</ref>

====Contribution to literature====
Some of Shevchenko's prose (a novel, diary, plays "Nazar Stodolya" and "Nikita Gayday", many letters), as well as some of his poems{{which|date=July 2014}} were written in Russian, because that was the only language spoken then. Speaking Ukrainian or writing in Ukrainian would result in exile or even death.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Uzhankov|first1=Alexander|title=Шевченко – русский писатель?|journal=Stoletije|date=11 February 2009|url=http://www.stoletie.ru/print.php?ID=21126}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kosmeda|first1=T.A.|title=Дневник Т.Г.

==Monuments and memorials==
{{Main|Taras Shevchenko's legacy}}

There are many monuments to Shevchenko throughout Ukraine, most notably at his memorial in [[Kaniv]] and in the center of [[Kyiv]], just across from the [[Kyiv University]] that bears his name. The [[Kyiv Metro]] station, [[Tarasa Shevchenka (Kyiv Metro)|Tarasa Shevchenka]], is also dedicated to Shevchenko. Among other notable monuments to the poet located throughout Ukraine are the ones in [[Kharkiv]] (in front of [[Shevchenko Park (Kharkiv)|Shevchenko Park]]), [[Lviv]], [[Luhansk]] and many others.

The first statues of Shevchenko were erected in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of their [[Ukrainization]]-policies.<ref name=TSs540725>{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/29540725.html 100 years ago the first monument to Taras Shevchenko was built for the Hetmanate], [[Radio Svoboda]] (14 October 2018)</ref> The first one was revealed in [[Romny]] on 27 October 1918 when the city was located in the [[Ukrainian state]].<ref name=TSs540725/> The following were erected in [[Moscow]] (29 November 1918) and [[Petrograd]] (1 December 1918).<ref name=TSs540725/> The monuments in Moscow and Petrograd did not survive because they were made of inferior materials.<ref name=TSs540725/> The concrete statue in Romny also began to decay, but was remade in [[bronze]] and re-unveiled in 1982.<ref name=TSs540725/> The original Romny statue is currently located in [[Kyiv]]'s [[Andriyivskyy Descent]].<ref name=TSs540725/>

After Ukraine gained its independence in the wake of the [[Soviet collapse|1991 Soviet Collapse]], some Ukrainian cities replaced their statues of [[Lenin]] with statues of Taras Shevchenko<ref>{{cite book|first=Catherine |last=Wanner|title=Burden of Dreams: History and Identity in Post-Soviet Ukraine|publisher= [[Penn State Press]]|year= 1998|isbn=0271042613|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k44rN1V8W90C&q=Burden+of+Dreams:+History+and+Identity+in+Post-Soviet+Ukraine&pg=PP1}}</ref> and in some locations that lacked streets named to him, local authorities renamed the streets or squares to Shevchenko. There is also a bilingual Taras Shevchenko high school in [[Sighetu Marmatiei]], Romania.

Although the relationship between Ukraine and Russia is currently tense, there is still a monument erected in his name in the city of [[Saint Petersburg]], which was rebuilt with the new materials, replacing the old one in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoukes.com/shevchenkomuseum/monuments.htm|title=Taras Shevchenko Museum - Monuments to Shevchenko around the world|website=www.infoukes.com}}</ref>

Outside of Ukraine and the former [[USSR]], monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in many countries, usually under the initiative of local [[Ukrainian diaspora]]s. There are several memorial societies and monuments to him throughout Canada and the United States, most notably the [[Taras Shevchenko Memorial|monument in Washington, D.C.]], near [[Dupont Circle]]. The granite monument was carved by Vincent Illuzzi of Barre, Vermont. The Washington, D.C. monument was designed by Ukrainian Canadian sculptor Leo Mol & architect Radoslav Zhuk There is also a monument in [[Soyuzivka]] in New York State,  Tipperary Hill in [[Syracuse, New York]], a park is named after him in [[Elmira Heights, New York|Elmira Heights, N.Y.]] and a street is named after him in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. There is also a Taras Shevchenko Park in Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A section of [[Connecticut Route 9]] that goes through [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] is also named after Shevchenko.
There is a statue of Taras Shevchenko at Ukraine Square in [[Curitiba, Brazil]]. A monument to Shevchenko was put up in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] on May 21, 2015.<ref name="HKVZAGREB">[http://www.hkv.hr/izdvojeno/komentari/dvidmarovic/20409-u-zagrebz-21-svibnja-2015-otkrivena-spomen-bista-tarasa-sevcenka.html "A monument to Taras Shevchenko unveiled in Zagreb on May 21st"], HKV</ref>
