'''George Stepney''' (1663 â€“ 15 September 1707) was an [[United Kingdom|English]] [[poet]] and [[diplomat]].

Stepney was the son of [[George Stepney (senior)|George Stepney]], groom of the chamber to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and was born at [[Westminster]]. He was admitted on the foundation of [[Westminster School]] in 1676, and in 1682 became a scholar of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], becoming a fellow of his college in 1687.<ref>{{acad|id=STPY682G|name=Stepney, George}}</ref>

Through his friend [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Charles Montagu]], afterwards [[Earl of Halifax]], he entered the diplomatic service, and in 1692 was sent as [[List of diplomats from the United Kingdom to Prussia|envoy]] to [[Brandenburg]]. He represented [[William III of England|William III]] at various other [[Germany|German]] courts, and in 1702 was [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Austria|sent]] to [[Vienna]], where he had already acted as envoy in 1693. In Nov 1697 he was elected a [[fellow of the Royal Society]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27stepney%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=21 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1705 [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] requested Stepney's withdrawal on the grounds of his alleged favouritism towards the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] insurgents, but the demand was taken back at the request of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], who had great confidence in Stepney. He was, nevertheless, [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands|removed]] in 1706 to [[The Hague]]. In the following year he returned to England in the hope of recovering from a severe illness, but died in [[Chelsea, London]], and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].

Stepney had a full and accurate knowledge of German affairs, and was a great letter-writer. Among his correspondents was [[Gottfried Leibniz]], with whom he was on friendly terms. Much of his official and other correspondence is preserved in the letters and papers of Sir [[John Ellis (Harwich MP)|John Ellis]] ([[British Library]] Add MS 28875-28956), purchased from the [[Thomas Augustus Wolstenholme Parker, 6th Earl of Macclesfield|Earl of Macclesfield]] in 1872, and others are available in the record office. He contributed a version of the [[Satire VIII|eighth satire]] of [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] to the translation (1693) of the satires by [[John Dryden]] and others. [[Samuel Johnson]], who included him in his ''Lives of the Poets'', called him a very licentious translator, and remarked that he did not recompense his neglect of the author by beauties of his own.
