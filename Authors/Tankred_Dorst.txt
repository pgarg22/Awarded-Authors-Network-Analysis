'''Tankred Dorst''' (19 December 1925 – 1 June 2017) was a [[Germany|German]] [[playwright]] and [[storytelling|storyteller]].<ref name="Sheppard1989">{{cite book |last=Sheppard |first=Richard |title=Tankred Dorst's Toller: a case-study in reception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_85bAAAAMAAJ |access-date=11 April 2011 |date=1 March 1989 |publisher=Lochee Publications |isbn=978-0-947584-93-1}}</ref><ref name="Sebald1988">{{cite book|last=Sebald|first=Winfried Georg|title=A Radical stage: theatre in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvVbAAAAMAAJ|access-date=11 April 2011|year=1988|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-0-85496-038-5|pages=64–|chapter=5}}</ref>

Dorst lived and worked in [[Munich]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Dultz |first=Sabine |date=2 June 2017 |title=Tankred Dorst: Der selbstbewusst Bescheidene |url=https://www.merkur.de/kultur/tankred-dorst-selbstbewusst-bescheidene-8372876.html |work=[[Merkur]] |location=Munich |language=de |access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref> His farces, parables, one-act-plays and adaptations were inspired by the theatre of the absurd and the works of [[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco]], [[Jean Giraudoux|Giraudoux]] and [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]. His monumental drama ''Merlin oder das wüste Land'', which was premiered in 1981 in [[Düsseldorf]], has been compared to [[Goethe]]'s ''Faust''. Some critics see it as the first major drama of the 1980s. In his tribute to Tankred Dorst on the occasion of the conferment of the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 1990, [[Georg Hensel]] remarked that Dorst's plays all have a direct connection to the present: "For 30 years Dorst's plays have responded to the great transformations. He has always been a companion to the times."

Dorst first directed the ''[[Ring of the Nibelung]]'' in [[Bayreuth]] in 2006.

==Biography==
Tankred Dorst was born in [[Oberlind]] near [[Sonneberg]], [[Thuringia]].<ref name="ZeitObit" />

Conscripted into the German army as a pupil at the age of 17, he was soon captured and incarcerated as a [[prisoner of war]].<ref name="ZeitObit" /> Until 1947 he remained in British and American hands. By the time he was released from war captivity, his birthplace had become part of the Soviet sector of Germany. He met his family in West Germany and completed his schooling. In 1950 he began studying German literature, art history and theatre in [[Bamberg]] and Munich.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 June 2017 |title=Tankred Dorst ist tot |url=https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/tankred-dorst-dramatiker-und-schriftsteller-mit-91-jahren-gestorben-a-1150232.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |location=Hamburg |language=de |agency=dpa |access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rinke |first=Moritz |date=2 June 2017 |title=Man kann nicht genug vor diesem Theatermann knien |url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/literarischewelt/article165194497/Man-kann-nicht-genug-vor-diesem-Theatermann-knien.html |work=[[Die Welt]] |location=Berlin |language=de |access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref> Through the 1950s he wrote his first plays for the [[marionette]] theatre ''Das Kleine Spiel'', (some together with composer [[Wilhelm Killmayer]]).
