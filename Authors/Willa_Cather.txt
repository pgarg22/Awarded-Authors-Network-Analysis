In 1923, she was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for ''[[One of Ours]]'', a novel set during [[World War&nbsp;I]].

Willa Cather and her family moved from Virginia to Webster County, Nebraska when she was nine years old. The family later settled in the town of Red Cloud. In 1890, at the age of sixteen, Cather graduated from Red Cloud High School.<ref>{{cite web |title=Willa Cather's Biography |url=https://www.willacather.org/willa-cathers-biography |website=Willa Cather Foundation |publisher=Willa Cather Foundation |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref> Shortly after graduating from the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], Cather moved to [[Pittsburgh]] for ten years, supporting herself as a magazine editor and high school English teacher. At the age of 33, she moved to [[New York City]], her primary home for the rest of her life, though she also traveled widely and spent considerable time at her summer residence on [[Grand Manan|Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick]]. She spent the last 39 years of her life with her domestic partner, [[Edith Lewis]], before being diagnosed with breast cancer and dying of a cerebral hemorrhage. She is buried alongside Lewis in a [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire]] plot.

Cather achieved recognition as a novelist of the frontier and pioneer experience. She wrote of the spirit of [[Manifest destiny|those settlers moving into the western states]], many of them European immigrants in the nineteenth century. Common themes in her work include nostalgia and exile. A [[sense of place]] is an important element in Cather's fiction: physical landscapes and domestic spaces are for Cather dynamic presences against which her characters struggle and find community.

=== 1920s ===
As late as 1920, Cather became dissatisfied with the performance of her publisher [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]—''My Ántonia'' received an advertising budget of only $300,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The lady with the Borzoi: Blanche Knopf, Literary Tastemaker Extraordinaire|last=Claridge|first=Laura|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2016|isbn=9780374114251|edition= First|pages=63–65|oclc=908176194}}</ref> they refused to pay for all of the illustrations she commissioned for the book from [[Władysław T.

Knopf]], which had a reputation for supporting its authors through advertising campaigns.<ref name=":0" /> She also liked the look of its books and had been impressed with its edition of ''[[Green Mansions]]'' by [[William Henry Hudson]].<ref name=":0" /> She so enjoyed their style that all her Knopf books of the 1920s—save for one printing of her short story collection ''[[Youth and the Bright Medusa]]''—matched in design on their second and subsequent printings.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ronning |first1=Kari A. |title=Speaking Volumes: Embodying Cather's Works |journal=Studies in the Novel |year=2013 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=519–537 |jstor=23594855 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23594855 |issn=0039-3827}}</ref>

By this time, Cather had been firmly established as a major [[American literature|American writer]], receiving the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1923 for her World War I-based novel, ''[[One of Ours]]''.<ref name=":0" /> She followed this up with the popular ''[[Death Comes for the Archbishop]]'' in 1927, selling 86,500 copies in just two years,<ref name="canonical30s">{{cite journal |last1=Jaillant |first1=Lise |title=Canonical in the 1930s: Willa Cather's "Death Comes for the Archbishop" in the Modern Library Series |journal=Studies in the Novel |year=2013 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=476–499 |jstor=23594853 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23594853 |issn=0039-3827}}</ref> and which has been included on the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] of the twentieth century.<ref name=":0" /> Two of her three other novels of the decade—''[[A Lost Lady]]'' and ''[[The Professor's House]]''—elevated her literary status dramatically. She was invited to give several hundred lectures to the public, earned significant royalties, and sold off the movie rights to ''A Lost Lady''. Her other novel of the decade, the 1926 ''[[My Mortal Enemy]]'', received no widespread acclaim—and in fact, neither she nor her partner, Edith Lewis, made significant mention of it later in their lives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vanderlaan |first1=Kim |title=Sacred Spaces, Profane "Manufactories": Willa Cather's Split Artist in The Professor's House and My Mortal Enemy |journal=Western American Literature |year=2011 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=4–24 |doi=10.1353/wal.2011.0035|s2cid=144199893 }}</ref>

Despite her success, she was the subject of much criticism, particularly surrounding ''One of Ours''. Her close friend, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]], saw the novel as a betrayal of the realities of war, not understanding how to "bridge the gap between [Cather's] idealized war vision ... and my own stark impressions of war as ''lived''."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garvelink |first1=Lisa Bouma |title=Willa Cather's Voyage Perilous: A Case for One of Ours |journal=Women's Studies |date=October 2004 |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=907–931 |doi=10.1080/00497870490503851|s2cid=145563235 }}</ref> Similarly, [[Ernest Hemingway]] took issue with her portrayal of war, writing in a 1923 letter: "Wasn’t [the novel’s] last scene in the lines wonderful? Do you know where it came from? The battle scene in ''[[The Birth of a Nation|Birth of a Nation]]''. I identified episode after episode, Catherized.

=== 1930s ===
By the 1930s, an increasingly large share of critics began to dismiss her as overly romantic and nostalgic, unable to grapple with contemporary issues:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clere |first1=Sarah E. |title=Troubling Bodies in the Fiction of Willa Cather |date=2011 |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |page=5}}</ref> [[Granville Hicks]], for instance, charged Cather with escaping into an idealized past to avoid confronting these matters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Granville |title=The Case against Willa Cather |journal=The English Journal |year=1933 |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=703–710 |doi=10.2307/804321 |jstor=804321 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/804321 |issn=0013-8274}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Brien |first1=Sharon |title=Becoming Noncanonical: The Case Against Willa Cather |journal=American Quarterly |year=1988 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=110–126 |doi=10.2307/2713144 |jstor=2713144 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713144 |issn=0003-0678}}</ref> And it was particularly in the context of the hardships of the [[Great Depression]] in which her work was seen as lacking social relevance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Old |first1=James Paul |title=Making Good Americans: The Politics of Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop |journal=Perspectives on Political Science |date=January 2, 2021 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=52–61 |doi=10.1080/10457097.2020.1830673|s2cid=225123832 }}</ref> Similarly, critics—and Cather herself<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Urgo |first1=Joseph |title=Review of Willa Cather and Material Culture: Real-World Writing, Writing the Real World |journal=South Atlantic Review |year=2005 |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=182–186 |jstor=20064654 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20064654 |issn=0277-335X}}</ref>—were disappointed when her novel ''A Lost Lady'' was made into [[A Lost Lady (1934 film)|a film]]; the film had little resemblance to the novel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Melcher |first1=E. de S. |title=Willa Cather Novel Loses Much in the Screen Story |work=Evening Star (Washington, D.C.) |date=November 17, 1934 |page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=C. |first1=E.N. |title=Literary Topics |work=Hartford Courant |date=September 5, 1934 |page=8}}</ref>

During the summer of 1940, Cather and Lewis went to Grand Manan for the last time, and Cather finished her final novel, ''[[Sapphira and the Slave Girl]]'', a book much darker in tone and subject matter than her previous works.{{r|Woodress|page=483}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walton |first1=David |title=Putting Cather into Perspective |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=March 4, 1990 |page=3-J}}</ref> While Sapphira is understood by readers as lacking a moral sense and failing to evoke empathy,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Salas |first1=Angela M. |title=Willa Cather's Sapphira and the Slave Girl: Extending the Boundaries of the Body |journal=College Literature |year=1997 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–108 |jstor=25112300 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25112300 |issn=0093-3139}}</ref> the novel was a great critical and commercial success, with an advance printing of 25,000 copies.<ref name="canonical30s" /> It was then adopted by the [[Book of the Month Club]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Sensational Autobiography Chosen |work=The Times Dispatch (Richmond, Virginia) |date=December 8, 1940 |page=76}}</ref> which bought more than 200,000 copies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaap |first1=James A. |title=Breaking Fresh Ground: New Releases from the Willa Cather Edition |journal=Resources for American Literary Study |year=2009 |volume=34 |pages=215–222 |doi=10.7756/rals.034.009.215-222 |jstor=26367245 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26367245 |issn=0048-7384}}</ref> Her final story, "[[The Best Years (story)|The Best Years]]",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cather |first1=Willa |title=Youth and the Bright Medusa: The Willa Cather Scholarly Edition |date=2009 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |url=https://cather.unl.edu/writings/books/0021}}</ref> intended as a gift for her brother,<ref name="autobio">{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Cheryll |title=Willa Cather : family, community, and history (the BYU symposium) |date=1990 |publisher=Brigham Young University, Humanities Publications Center |isbn=0842522999 |page=52 |chapter=Cather's Homecomings}}</ref> was retrospective.

Although an inflamed tendon in her hand hampered her writing, Cather managed to finish a substantial part of a novel set in Avignon, France. Her remaining papers reveal that she had titled the unfinished manuscript ''[[Hard Punishments]]'' and placed it in the 14th century during the papal reign of [[Antipope Benedict XIV]].{{r|Lee1990|page=371}} She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cather |first1=Willa |title=Women's History Month |url=https://www.amacad.org/archives/gallery/womens-history-month |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |access-date=February 3, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> That same year, she executed a will that prohibited the publication of her letters and dramatization of her works.<ref name="obscurerecord" /> In 1944, Cather received the gold medal for fiction from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|National Institute of Arts and Letters]], a prestigious award given for an author's total accomplishments.<ref>{{cite news |title=MISS CATHER WINS INSTITUTE AWARD |work=The New York Times |date=January 28, 1944 |page=13}}</ref>

Cather's relationship with Lewis began in the early 1900s. They lived together in a series of apartments in New York City from 1908 until Cather's death in 1947.

Beginning in 1922, Cather spent summers on the island of [[Grand Manan]] in [[New Brunswick]], where she bought a cottage in [[Whale Cove, New Brunswick|Whale Cove]] on the [[Bay of Fundy]].

And you could almost have done it as yourself—a woman could love her in that same protecting way—a woman could even care enough to wish to take her away from such a life, by some means or other. But oh, how close—how tender—how true the feeling is!"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jewett |first1=Sarah Orne |editor1-last=Fields |editor1-first=Annie |title=Letters of Sarah Orne Jewett |date=1911 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin company |pages=246–7}}</ref>}} Cather was also influenced by the work of [[Katherine Mansfield]],<ref name="affect" /> praising in an essay Mansfield's ability "to throw a luminous streak out onto the shadowy realm of personal relationships."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cather |first1=Willa |title=Not Under Forty |year=1936 |publisher=Alfred A.

Cather's high regard for the immigrant families forging lives and enduring hardships on the Nebraska plains shaped much of her fiction. As a child, she visited immigrant families in her area and returned home in "the most unreasonable state of excitement," feeling that she "had got inside another person's skin."{{r|bennet|pp=169–170}} Following a trip to Red Cloud in 1916, Cather decided to write a novel based on the events in the life of her childhood friend [[Annie Sadilek Pavelka]], a [[Bohemia]]n girl who became the model for the title character in ''My Ántonia''.<ref name="possession"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Richard C. |title=First Loves: Willa Cather's Niel Herbert and Ivan Turgenev's Vladimir Petrovich |journal=Studies in American Fiction |year=1989 |volume=17 |issue=1 |page=81 |doi=10.1353/saf.1989.0007|s2cid=161309570 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=MURPHY |first1=DAVID |title=Jejich Antonie: Czechs, the Land, Cather, and the Pavelka Farmstead |journal=Great Plains Quarterly |year=1994 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=85–106 |jstor=23531597 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23531597 |issn=0275-7664}}</ref> Cather was likewise fascinated by the French-Canadian pioneers from [[Quebec]] who had settled in the Red Cloud area while she was a girl.<ref name="neighbors">Danker, Kathleen (Winter 2000).

During a brief stopover in Quebec with Edith Lewis in 1927, Cather was inspired to write a novel set in that French-Canadian city. Lewis recalled: "From the first moment that she looked down from the windows of the [Chateau] Frontenac [Hotel] on the pointed roofs and [[Norman architecture|Norman]] outlines of the town of Quebec, Willa Cather was not merely stirred and charmed—she was overwhelmed by the flood of memories, recognition, surmise it called up; by the sense of its extraordinary French character, isolated and kept intact through hundreds of years, as if by a miracle, on this great un-French continent."{{r|Woodress|pages=414–15}} Cather finished her novel ''Shadows on the Rock'', a historical novel set in 17th-century Quebec, in 1931;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haller |first1=Evelyn |title="Shadows On The Rock": A Book in American English Ezra Pound Gave His Daughter That She Might Learn His Mother Tongue And More |journal=Paideuma |year=2010 |volume=37 |pages=245–265 |jstor=24726727 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24726727 |issn=0090-5674}}</ref> it was later included in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944.<ref>Canby, Henry Seidel.

<blockquote>She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[James Joyce]], whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Curtin |first1=William M. |title=Willa Cather: Individualism and Style |journal=Colby Library Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=1–21 |url=https://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1911&context=cq|date=June 1968}}</ref></blockquote>

The English novelist [[A. S.
