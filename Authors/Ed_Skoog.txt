Skoog's debut collection, ''Mister Skylight'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2009), is an alert to disasters and to the hope of rescue. Interior dramas of the self play out in a clash of poetic traditions, exuberant imagery, and wild metaphor. His second book of poems, ''Rough Day'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2013), a 2013 Lannan Literary Selection,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lannan.org/programs/literary/|title = Lannan Foundation}}</ref> finds unity in a fixation on American events and landscapes. His newest collection, ''Run the Red Lights'', balances the domestic and private with the exhilaration of public performance.

He is the judge for the 2019 Burnside Review Press Book Award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://burnsidereview.org/book-guidelines/|title=Book Guidelines - Burnside Review|date=2013-07-30|work=Burnside Review|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>
