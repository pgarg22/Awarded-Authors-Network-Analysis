'''Philip Levine''' (January 10, 1928 – February 14, 2015) was an American poet best known for his poems about working-class Detroit. He taught for more than thirty years in the English department of [[California State University, Fresno]] and held teaching positions at other universities as well. He served on the Board of Chancellors of the [[Academy of American Poets]] from 2000 to 2006,<ref name=awards/> and was appointed [[Poet Laureate of the United States]] for 2011–2012.<ref name="CMcGrath">{{cite web| author=Charles McGrath|title=Voice of the Workingman to Be Poet Laureate| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/books/philip-levine-is-to-be-us-poet-laureate.html?_r=1&hp|work=[[The New York Times]]| date=August 9, 2011| access-date=August 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179090# ] Poetry Foundation website February 15, 2015</ref>

==Biography==
Philip Levine grew up in industrial [[Detroit]], the second of three sons and the first of [[identical twin]]s of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrant parents. His father, Harry Levine, owned a used auto parts business,<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-28/news/ls-13844_1_philip-levine| title= The Poet of the Night Shift: Literature: For Philip Levine, it was not a long trip from factory work to writing some of America's best poetry| newspaper= The Los Angeles Times| date=December 28, 1994| author= Russel Frank| access-date=August 15, 2011}}</ref> his mother, Esther Priscol (Pryszkulnik) Levine, was a bookseller.<ref name="CBuckley"/> When Levine was five years old, his father died.<ref name="DGioia"/> While growing up, he faced the [[anti-Semitism]] embodied by [[Father Coughlin]], the pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] radio priest.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/american-jewish-poet-phillip-levine-named-u-s-poet-laureate-1.378041| title=American-Jewish poet Phillip Levine named U.S. Poet Laureate| newspaper=[[Haaretz]]| date=August 10, 2011| access-date=August 15, 2011}}</ref> 
In high school, a teacher told him, “You write like an angel.

[[Detroit Central High School]] graduated him in 1946, and he went to college at Wayne University (now [[Wayne State University]]) in Detroit, where he began to write poetry, encouraged by his mother, to whom he dedicated the book of poems ''The Mercy''.<ref name="LevineHirsch">{{cite web| url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/16177| title=The Unwritten Biography: Philip Levine and Edward Hirsch in Conversation| author=Edward Hirsch and Philip Levine| publisher=American Poet| year=1999 | access-date=August 15, 2011}}</ref> Levine earned his [[A.B.]] in 1950 and went to work for [[Chevrolet]] and [[Cadillac]] in what he called "stupid jobs."<ref name="CMcGrath"/> The work, he later wrote, was “so heavy and monotonous that after an hour or two I was sure each night that I would never last the shift.”<ref name="The Poet of the Assembly Line"/>

He married his first wife, Patty Kanterman, in 1951.

He returned to the University of Iowa teaching technical writing, and completed his [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in 1957.<ref name="DGioia"/> The same year, he was awarded the Jones Fellowship in Poetry at [[Stanford University]]. In 1958, he joined the English department at [[California State University Fresno|California State University, Fresno]], where he taught until his retirement in 1992.

Levine and his wife had made their homes in [[Fresno]] and [[Brooklyn Heights]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2011/08/09/2494078/fresnos-philip-levine-named-nations.html| title=Fresno's Philip Levine named nation's poet laureate| author=Donald Munro| newspaper=The Fresno Bee| date= August 9, 2011| access-date=August 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>Kan, Elianna.

"In the spring of 2012, Philip Levine delivered a lecture at the Library of Congress called “My Lost Poets,” marking the end of his tenure as the eighteenth U.S. poet laureate.... I arrived at his home on Willow Street in Brooklyn Heights just as he and his wife, Franny, were finishing lunch."</ref> He died of pancreatic cancer on February 14, 2015, age 87.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/arts/philip-levine-former-us-poet-laureate-who-won-pulitzer-dies-at-87.html?_r=0|title=Philip Levine, U.S. Poet Laureate Who Won Pulitzer, Dies At 87|work=[[New York Times]].com|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

==Work==
The familial, social, and economic world of twentieth-century Detroit is one of the major subjects of Levine's work.<ref name="obit">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2025706198_apxobitphiliplevine.html|title=Poet laureate Philip Levine dies at age 87|publisher=[[Seattle Times]].com|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref> His portraits of working class Americans and his continuous examination of his Jewish immigrant inheritance (both based on real life and described through fictional characters) has left a testimony of mid-twentieth century American life.<ref name="obit"/>
 
Levine's working experience lent his poetry a profound skepticism with regard to conventional American ideals. In his first two books, ''On the Edge'' (1963) and ''Not This Pig'' (1968), the poetry dwells on those who suddenly become aware that they are trapped in some murderous processes not of their own making.<ref name="Fresno">{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2015/02/15/4380529_philip-levine-former-us-poet-laureate.html?rh=1|title=Philip Levine, former U.S. poet laureate and Fresno State professor, dead at 87|publisher=Fresno Bee.com|access-date=February 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215220944/http://www.fresnobee.com/2015/02/15/4380529_philip-levine-former-us-poet-laureate.html?rh=1|archive-date=February 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1968, Levine signed the “[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]” pledge, vowing to refuse to make tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>“Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>

In his first two books, Levine was somewhat traditional in form and relatively constrained in expression.<ref name="obit"/> Beginning with ''They Feed They Lion'', typically Levine's poems are free-verse monologues tending toward [[trimeter]] or [[tetrameter]].<ref name="Levine80"/> The music of Levine's poetry depends on tension between his line-breaks and his syntax. The title poem of Levine's book ''1933'' (1974) is an example of the cascade of clauses and phrases one finds in his poetry.<ref name="obit"/> Other collections include ''The Names of the Lost'', ''A Walk with Tom Jefferson'', ''New Selected Poems,'' and the National Book Award-winning ''What Work Is''.<ref name="obit"/>

On November 29, 2007 a tribute was held in New York City in anticipation of Levine's eightieth birthday.<ref name="Levine80">{{cite web|url=http://www.albanypoets.com/2007/11/celebrating-philip-levines-80th/|publisher=Albany Poets.com|title=Celebrating Philip Levine's 80th|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref> Among those celebrating Levine's career by reading Levine's work were [[Yusef Komunyakaa]], [[Galway Kinnell]], [[E. L. Doctorow]], [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], [[Jean Valentine]] and [[Sharon Olds]].<ref name="Levine80"/> Levine read several new poems as well.<ref name="Levine80"/>

Near the end of his life, Levine, an avid jazz aficionado, collaborated with jazz saxophonist and composer Benjamin Boone [http://www.benjaminboone.net] on the melding of his poetry and narration with music. The resulting CD, “The Poetry of Jazz” (Origin Records 82754), was released posthumously on March 16, 2018. It contains fourteen of Levine's poems and performances by Levine and Boone as well as jazz greats Chris Potter, Greg Osby, and Tom Harrell .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/joshua-tehee/article192000799.html|title=Philip Levine's Jazz Poetry Mashup Will Finally Get Released Next Year|publisher=[[Fresno Bee]].com|access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/02/20/at-87-poet-laureate-philip-levine-jazzed-it-up/|title= At 87, Poet Laureate Philip Levine Jazzed It Up|publisher=[[KQED Inc.|KQED]].org | access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref>
