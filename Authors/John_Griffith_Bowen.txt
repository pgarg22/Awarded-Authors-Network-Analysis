'''John Griffith Bowen''' (5 November 1924 – 18 April 2019) was a British playwright and novelist.<ref>Tim Woods (2001) "Who's Who of Twentieth Century Novelists", {{ISBN|0-415-16506-7}}</ref>

==Early life==
John Bowen was born in [[Calcutta]], [[British India|India]], to Ethel (née Cook) and Hugh Bowen; his father was the manager of the Shalimar Print Works in Gobariah. John Bowen's grandfather was an Inspector of Police in Calcutta. At the age of five and a half he was placed on a boat in Bombay and sent back to Britain where he was brought up by his uncle Donald and aunt Dolly in Whitehaven. Bowen was sent to board at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, [[Crediton]] in Devon, where he developed an interest in literature and drama.

In 1939, his mother returned to England with her three younger children, Patricia (b. 1926) and twins Daphne and David (b. 1930), and rented a house near Crediton. In 1940, having read about the bombing of Britain in ''[[The Times of India]]'', Bowen’s father sent a cable to his wife saying "Bring the children out", though no bombs had fallen in or near Crediton. The whole family returned to India, where Bowen spent an unhappy year living in the YMCA in Calcutta and working in a semi-clerical job. Eventually he told his father that when the war was over, he wanted to go to university at either [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and that he had better acquire some sort of qualification. So, in 1941 he left his job and went to study at the Jesuit-run North Point College in Darjeeling, where he was awarded the Intermediate Arts degree of the [[University of Calcutta]].

At the age of 18, much to his chagrin, he was drafted into the army, and during the latter part of [[World War II]], served as a captain in the [[Mahratta Light Infantry]] until 1947, serving as a Railway Transport Officer in transhipment stations in Bengal.

In 1948, he returned to Britain to study at the University of Oxford (at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]] and [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=Bowen, John Griffith|work=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who 2009]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2008|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U8267|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref> where he gained an MA in modern history, and edited the university magazine, ''[[The Isis Magazine|Isis]]''. After graduating, Bowen won a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] and spent a year teaching and hitch-hiking through the USA.

==Writing career==
===Advertising and early theatre work===
Bowen returned to Britain in 1953, moved to London and spent three years as an assistant editor on ''[[The Sketch]]'' magazine. He then turned to advertising, and while working at [[J. Walter Thompson]] (1956-58), he was part of the team that launched the successful marketing campaign for [[Rowntree's]] "Have a break, have a Kit-Kat", which is still used to advertise the product. It was during this period that he wrote his first three novels, two of which were published by [[Faber & Faber]]: ''The Truth Will Not Help Us'' (1956) is about a political witch-hunt; ''After the Rain'' (1958, later [[After the Rain (play)|adapted for the stage]]) is set in the future and following a group of people attempting to survive a flood; and ''The Centre of the Green'' (1959) focuses on a family torn apart by their son’s marital infidelity. ''After the Rain'' was performed at the [[Duchess Theatre]] in London and the [[John Golden Theatre]] on Broadway in 1967, starring [[Alec McCowen]] in the lead role.

===1960s and 70s television heyday===
In 1960, after leaving the comfort of the full-time job, Bowen and fellow advertising copywriter Jeremy Bullmore began writing together using the joint pseudonym of Justin Blake. Their character, Garry Halliday was picked up by the [[BBC]], who commissioned them to write a children’s adventure serial for television which starred [[Terence Longdon]] in the title role. Halliday was a pilot (not unlike [[Biggles]]) who found himself solving crimes and overcoming villains. The three TV series became immensely popular and spawned five spin-off novels.

From the early 1960s, Bowen focused on writing for television, including contributions to series such as ''Front Page Story'' (1965), ''[[The Power Game]]'' (1966) and seven episodes of the 13-part thriller ''[[The Guardians (British TV series)|The Guardians]]'' (1971). Bowen continued writing and producing for many long-running drama strands on both the BBC and ITV throughout the 1970s, including ''[[ITV Play of the Week]]'', ''[[Armchair Thriller]]'', the same network's ''[[Playhouse (British TV series)|Playhouse]]'' and ''[[Weekend Playhouse]]''. He also adapted Shakespeare’s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' as ''[[Heil Caesar]]'' in 1973 and wrote a television remake for [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] of the film ''[[Brief Encounter (1974 film)|Brief Encounter]]'' (1974), which starred [[Richard Burton]] and [[Sophia Loren]].

''[[Play for Today]]'' teleplays include "[[Robin Redbreast (TV play)|Robin Redbreast]]" (1970), "[[Play For Today#The Emergency Channel|The Emergency Channel]]" (1973) and "[[Play For Today#A Photograph|A Photograph]]" (1977). The element of folk horror in ''Robin Redbreast'' and ''The Photograph'' was also seen in his teleplays "A Woman Sobbing" for ''[[Dead of Night (TV series)|Dead of Night]]'' (1972) and two entries in the ''[[A Ghost Story for Christmas]]'' strand; "[[The Treasure of Abbot Thomas]]" (1974) and "[[The Ice House (short film)|The Ice House]]" (1978).<ref name=guardianobit>{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/29/john-bowen-obituary|title=John Bowen obituary|work=The Guardian|date=29 April 2019|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref>

Bowen continued to be a prolific writer for the stage. ''I Love You, Mrs. Patterson'' (1964) concerned the romantic entanglement of a student and his teacher’s wife, and ''Little Boxes'' (1968) consisted of two one-acts, the first about aging vaudevillians and the second about the attempts of a young lesbian couple to conceal their affair. ''The Disorderly Women'' (1969) was a modernization of [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. ''The Corsican Brothers'' (1970) was based on the story by [[Alexandre Dumas père|Alexandre Dumas ''père'']], and the production at the [[Greenwich Theatre]] starred Bowen's partner David Cook alongside [[Gerald Harper]].

===1980s and 90s===
Bowen returned to writing novels in the 80s: ''Squeak'' (1983) written from the point of view of a pigeon Bowen and David Cook had tended from a chick; ''The McGuffin'' (1984) - a [[Hitchcockian]] thriller - was dramatised for television in 1986 by Michael Thomas; ''The Girls'' (1986) is a dark story of village life set near his rural Warwickshire home.

In the mid 1990s, the BBC commissioned Bowen and David Cook to create the TV detective drama ''[[Hetty Wainthropp Investigates]]'', based on Cook's 1988 novel ''Missing Persons''. The character of Hetty Wainthropp was loosely based on Cook's mother, Beatrice, and was portrayed by [[Patricia Routledge]] alongside [[Derek Benfield]] as her long-suffering husband Robert, and [[Dominic Monaghan]] as her sleuthing side-kick, Geoffrey.

==Personal life==
In 1963, he met the actor [[David Cook (writer)|David Cook]], who had been cast in a minor speaking role in one of Bowen's television plays. Bowen and Cook began a romantic relationship which lasted for 52 years; the couple split their time between the flat they shared in South Kensington and their cottage in rural Warwickshire. Largely thanks to Bowen's encouragement, Cook also turned to writing and became a successful novelist and screenwriter in his own right. Following David Cook's death from [[pancreatic cancer]] in September 2015, Bowen remained in their Warwickshire home, cared for by Cook's nephew and his husband. Bowen died on 18 April 2019, aged 94.<ref name=guardianobit/>
