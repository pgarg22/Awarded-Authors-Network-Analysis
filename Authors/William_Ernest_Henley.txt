'''William Ernest Henley''' (23 August 1849{{snd}}11 July 1903) was a British poet, writer, critic and editor in late [[Victorian England]]. Though he wrote several books of poetry, Henley is remembered most often for his 1875 poem "[[Invictus]]". A fixture in London literary circles, the one-legged Henley was also the inspiration for [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s character [[Long John Silver]] (''[[Treasure Island]],'' 1883), while his young daughter [[Margaret Henley]] inspired [[J. M. Barrie]]'s choice of the name Wendy for the heroine of his play ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904).<ref name="MehewOxfordDNB" /><ref>Green, Lancelyn Rogers. ''Fifty Years of Peter Pan.'' P. Davies, 1954. p. 36.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Henley was born in [[Gloucester]] on 23 August 1849, to mother, Mary Morgan, a descendant of poet and critic [[Joseph Warton]], and father, William, a bookseller and stationer. William Ernest was the oldest of six children, five sons and a daughter; his father died in 1868.<ref name="biosketch">{{cite web|last1=Diniejko|first1=Andrzej|title=William Ernest Henley: A Biographical Sketch|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/henley/introduction.html|publisher=The Victorian Web|access-date=9 November 2016|date=19 July 2011}}</ref>

Henley was a pupil at [[the Crypt School]], [[Gloucester]], between 1861 and 1867. A commission had recently attempted to revive the school by securing as headmaster the brilliant and academically distinguished [[Thomas Edward Brown]] (1830–1897).<ref name="biosketch" /> Though Brown's tenure was relatively brief (c. 1857–1863), he was a "revelation" to Henley because the poet was "a man of genius{{mdash}}the first I'd ever seen".<ref name="Connell" /> After carrying on a lifelong friendship with his former headmaster, Henley penned an admiring obituary for Brown in the ''New Review'' (December 1897): "He was singularly kind to me at a moment when I needed kindness even more than I needed encouragement".<ref name=Connell>John Connell, 1949, ''W. E. Henley'', London:Constable, page numbers as indicated.</ref>{{rp|31}} Nevertheless, Henley was disappointed in the school itself, considered an inferior sister to the [[King's School, Gloucester|Cathedral School]], and wrote about its shortcomings in a 1900 article in ''[[The Pall Mall Magazine]]''.{{sfn|James|1911|p=270}}

Much later, in 1893, Henley also received an LLD degree from the [[University of St Andrews]]; however two years after that he failed to secure the position of Professor of English literature at the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-33817|title=Henley, William Ernest (1849–1903)|last=Ernest|first=Mehew|date=25 May 2006|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/33817}}</ref>

== Health issues and Long John Silver ==
[[File:Portrait of William Ernest Henley.jpg|thumb|left|250px|William Ernest Henley]]
From the age of 12, Henley suffered from [[tuberculosis]] of the bone that resulted in the amputation of his left leg below the knee in 1868–69.<ref name="Connell" />{{rp|35}}<ref name="MehewOxfordDNB">{{cite ODNB|last1=Mehew|first1=Ernest|title=William Ernest Henley, (1849–1903)," in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' [2004 Ed.], Oxford, UK|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/33/101033817/|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref><ref>Connell, op. cit., dates this as 1865, but Mehew, op. cit. suggests 1868–69, in the period when Henley was being treated in [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London.</ref> The early years of Henley's life were punctuated by periods of extreme pain due to the draining of his tuberculosis [[abscess]]es. However, Henley's younger brother Joseph recalled how after draining his joints the young Henley would  "Hop about the room, laughing loudly and playing with zest to pretend he was beyond the reach of pain".<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Poets, 1880–1914.

''Dreams of Exile: Robert Louis Stevenson''. Macmillan, 1993, p. 86.</ref>

Frequent illness often kept Henley from school, although the misfortunes of his father's business may also have contributed. In 1867, Henley passed the Oxford Local Schools Examination. Soon after passing the examination, Henley moved to London and attempted to establish himself as a journalist.<ref name="Connell" />{{rp|35}} His work over the next eight years was interrupted by long stays in hospitals, because his right foot had also become diseased.<ref name="EC04">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Edward|date=April 2004|journal=Yale University Library Gazette|volume=78|issue=3/4|pages=128–150|jstor=40859569|title=The Second Series of W.

== Physical appearance ==
Throughout his life, the contrast between Henley's physical appearance and his mental and creative capacities struck acquaintances in completely opposite, but equally forceful ways. Recalling his old friend, Sidney Low commented, "... to me he was the startling image of Pan come to Earth and clothed—the great god Pan...with halting foot and flaming shaggy hair, and arms and shoulders huge and threatening, like those of some Faun or Satyr of the ancient woods, and the brow and eyes of the Olympians."<ref>Low, Sidney. "Some Memories and Impressions – William Ernest Henley". ''The Living Age (1897–1941)'', vol. 239, no. 3093, 1903, p. 150.</ref> After hearing of Henley's death on 13 July 1903, the author [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] recorded his physical and ideological repugnance to the late poet and editor in his diary, "He has the bodily horror of the dwarf, with the dwarf's huge bust and head and shrunken nether limbs, and he has also the dwarf malignity of tongue and defiant attitude towards the world at large. Moreover, I am quite out of sympathy with Henley's deification of brute strength and courage, things I wholly despise."<ref>Blunt, Wilfrid Scawen. ''My Diaries: 1888–1900.'' pt. 2. 1900–1914. A. A. Knopf, 1921, p. 63.</ref>

== Personal life ==
Henley married Hannah (Anna) Johnson Boyle (1855–1925) on 22 January 1878. Born in [[Stirling]], she was the youngest daughter of Edward Boyle, a mechanical engineer from [[Edinburgh]], and his wife, Mary Ann née Mackie.<ref name="MehewOxfordDNB" /><ref>Parish: ''Edinburgh St Mary''; ED: ''45''; p: ''8''; Line: ''18''; Roll: ''CSSCT1861_126.''

Margaret was a sickly child, and became immortalised by [[J. M. Barrie]] in his children's classic, ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]].''<ref name="Winn12">Christopher Winn (2012).

After Robert Louis Stevenson received a letter from Henley labelled "Private and Confidential" and dated 9 March 1888, in which the latter accused Stevenson's new wife [[Fanny Stevenson|Fanny]] of plagiarising his cousin [[Katharine de Mattos]]' writing in the story "The Nixie",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://robert-louis-stevenson.org/friends/|title=Friends {{!}} Robert Louis Stevenson|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>  the two men ended their friendship, though a correspondence of sorts did resume later after mutual friends intervened.<ref>''The Selected Letters of W.

==Hospital poems==
As Andrzej Diniejko notes, Henley and the "Henley Regatta" (the name by which his followers were humorously referred) "promoted [[Literary realism|realism]] and opposed [[Decadence]]" through their own works, and, in Henley's case, "through the works... he published in the journals he edited."<ref name="biosketch" /> Henley published many poems in different collections including ''In Hospital'' (written between 1873 and 1875) and ''A Book of Verses'', published in 1891.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Book of Verses|last=Henley|first=William Ernest|publisher=Schribner and Welford|year=1891}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/henley/inhospital/contents.html|title=In Hospital|last=Henley|first=William Ernest|date=1873–1875|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref> He is remembered most for his 1875 poem "[[Invictus]]", one of his "hospital poems" that were composed during his isolation as a consequence of early, life-threatening battles with [[tuberculosis]]; this set of works, one of several types and themes he engaged during his career, are said to have developed the artistic motif of the "poet as a patient" and to have anticipated modern poetry "not only in form, as experiments in free verse containing abrasive narrative shifts and internal monologue, but also in subject matter."<ref name="biosketch" />

Forming the subject matter of the "hospital poems" were often Henley's observations of the plights of the patients in the hospital beds around him. Specifically the poem "Suicide" depicts not only the deepest depths of the human emotions, but also the horrid conditions of the working class Victorian poor in Britain.  As Henley observed firsthand, the stress of poverty and the vice of addiction pushed a man to the brink of human endurance. In part, the poem reads:<poem>Lack of work and lack of victuals,
A debauch of smuggled whisky,
And his children in the workhouse
Made the world so black a riddle
That he plunged for a solution;
And, although his knife was edgeless,
He was sinking fast towards one,
When they came, and found, and saved him.<ref name=":2" /></poem>

==Publishing career==
After his recovery, Henley began by earning his living as a journalist and publisher. The sum total of Henley's professional and artistic efforts is said to have made him an influential voice in late [[Victorian England]], perhaps with a role as central in his time as that of [[Samuel Johnson]] in the eighteenth century.<ref name="biosketch" /> As an editor of a series of literary magazines and journals, Henley was empowered to choose each issue's contributors, as well as to offer his own essays, criticism, and poetic works; like Johnson, he said to have "exerted a considerable influence on the literary culture of his time."<ref name="biosketch" />

For a short period in 1877 and 1878, Henley was hired to edit ''[[The London Magazine]]'',  "which was a society paper",<ref name="White1888" /> and "a journal of a type more usual in Paris than London, written for the sake of its contributors rather than of the public."{{sfn|James|1911|p=270}} In addition to his inviting its articles and editing all content, Henley anonymously contributed tens of poems to the journal, some of which were described by contemporaries as "brilliant" (later published in a compilation by [[Gleeson White]]).<ref name="White1888">{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Gleeson|title=Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &c.: Selected with Chapter on the Various Forms (William Sharp, Gen. Series Ed.)|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45736/45736-h/45736-h.htm|access-date=8 May 2015|pages=xix, 16–22, 77–82, 139–141, 169–173, 221, 251–253, 288–290|date=1888}}</ref> In his selection White included a considerable number of pieces from London, and only after he had completed the selection did he discover that the verses were all by one hand, that of Henley. In the following year, H. B. Donkin, in his volume ''Voluntaries For an East London Hospital'' (1887), included Henley's unrhymed rhythms recording the poet's memories of the old Edinburgh Infirmary. Later, [[Alfred Nutt]] published these and others in his ''A Book of Verse''.{{sfn|James|1911|p=270}}

In 1889, Henley became editor of the ''[[Scots Observer]]'', an Edinburgh journal of the arts and current events. After its headquarters were transferred to London in 1891, it became the ''[[National Observer (UK)|National Observer]]'' and remained under Henley's editorship until 1893. The paper had almost as many writers as readers, as Henley said, and its fame was confined mainly to the literary class, but it was a lively and influential contributor to the literary life of its era. Serving under Henley as his assistant editor, "right-hand-man", and close friend was [[Charles Whibley]].<ref>Hughes, Linda K. ''Rosamund Marriott Watson, Woman of Letters.'' Ohio University Press, 2005. P. 81.</ref> The journal's outlook was conservative and often sympathetic to the growing imperialism of its time. Among other services to literature, it published [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]'' (1890–92).{{sfn|James|1911|p=270}}

==Death==
In 1902, Henley fell from a railway carriage. This accident caused his latent tuberculosis to flare up, and he died of it on 11 July 1903, at the age of 53, at his home in [[Woking]], Surrey. After cremation at [[Woking Crematorium|the local crematorium]] his ashes were interred in his daughter's grave in the churchyard at Cockayne Hatley in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="MehewOxfordDNB" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/fletcher/henley/bio.htm|title=West Chester University}}</ref> At the time of his death Henley's personal wealth was valued at £840.<ref name="MehewOxfordDNB" /> His widow, Anna, moved to 213 West Campbell-St, Glasgow, where she lived until her death.<ref>Ancestry.com.

==Legacy==
During his lifetime Henley had become fairly well known as a poet. His poetry had even made its way to the United States, inspiring several different contributors from across the country to pen articles about him. In 1889 the [[Chicago Tribune|''Chicago Daily Tribune'']] ran an article about the promise that Henley showed in the field of poetry.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A New Poet of Promise|date=1889|work=The Chicago daily Tribute}}</ref> After Henley's death in 1903 an acquaintance in Boston wrote a piece about her impression of Henley, saying of him, "There was in him something more than the patient resignation of the religious sufferer, who had bowed himself to the uses of adversity. Deep in his nature lay an inner well of cheerfulness, and a spontaneous joy of living, that nothing could drain dry, though it dwindled sadly after the crowning affliction of his little daughter's death."<ref>Low, Sidney. [https://search.proquest.com/docview/90224255 "William Ernest Henley."] ''The Living Age (1897–1941)'', vol. 239, no. 3093, 17 October 1903, pp. 150.</ref> Henley was known as a man of inner resolve and character that transferred into his works, but also made an impression on his peers and friends. The loss of his daughter was a deeply traumatising event in Henley's life but did not truly dampen his outlook on life as a whole.

While it has been observed that Henley's poetry "almost fell into undeserved oblivion,"<ref name="biosketch" /> the appearance of "[[Invictus]]" as a continuing popular reference and the renewed availability of his work, through online databases and archives have meant that Henley's significant influence on culture and literary perspectives in the late-[[Victorian literature|Victorian]] period is not forgotten.

"Invictus" has been cited by [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] terrorists as a justification for their actions, including the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995,<ref>'McVeigh's Final Statement', 'The Guardian', 11 June 2001. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/mcveigh.usa1</ref> and the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in New Zealand in 2019.<ref>'When poems of resistance get twisted for terrorism' 'The Atlantic', 16 March 2019. https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/new-zealand-shooting-manifesto-poems-dylan-thomas/585079/</ref>

==Works==

===Editions===
* ''[[The London Magazine|The London]]'', 1877–78, "a society paper" Henley edited for this short period, and to which he contributed "a brilliant series of… poems" which were only later attributed publicly to him in a published compilation from Gleeson White (see below).<ref name=White1888/>
* In 1890, Henley published ''Views and Reviews'', a volume of notable criticisms, which he described as "less a book than a mosaic of scraps and shreds recovered from the shot rubbish of some fourteen years of journalism".<ref>"The Newest Books." ''The Book Buyer.'' Charles Scribner's Sons, 1890, p. 258.</ref> The criticisms, covering a wide range of authors (all English or French save [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]), were remarkable for their insight. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote that he had not received the same thrill of poetry so intimate and so deep since [[George Meredith]]'s "Joy of Earth" and "Love in the Valley": "I did not guess you were so great a magician. These are new tunes; this is an undertone of the true [[Apollo]]. These are not verse; they are poetry."<ref>Stevenson, R.L. to W.E. Henley.

* With [[John Stephen Farmer]], Henley edited a seven volume dictionary of ''[[iarchive:slangitsanalogue01farmuoft/page/n8|Slang and its analogues]]'' (1890–1904).
* Henley did other notable work for various publishers: the ''Lyra Heroica'', 1891; ''A Book of English Prose'' (with [[Charles Whibley]]), 1894; the centenary ''Burns'' (with [[Thomas Finlayson Henderson]]) in 1896–1897, in which Henley's Essay (published separately in 1898) roused considerable controversy. In 1892 he undertook for Alfred Nutt the general editorship of the ''Tudor Translations''; and in 1897 began for the publisher [[William Heinemann]] an edition of [[Lord Byron]], which did not proceed beyond one volume of [[Byron's letters|his letters]].{{sfn|James|1911|p=271}}

===Poetry===
* The poems of ''In Hospital'' are noteworthy as some of the earliest [[free verse]] written in the U.K. . Arguably Henley's best-remembered work is the poem "[[Invictus]]", written in 1875. It is said that this was written as a demonstration of his resilience following the amputation of his foot due to tubercular infection.
* In ''Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &c…'' (1888), compiled by Gleeson White,<ref name="White1888" /> including 30 of Henley's works, a "selection of poems in old French forms."{{sfn|James|1911|p=270}} The poems were mostly produced by Henley while editing ''The London'' in 1877–78, but also included a few works unpublished or from other sources (''Belgravia,'' ''[[The Magazine of Art]]''); appearing were a dozen of his [[ballad]]s, including "Of Dead Actors" and "Of the Nothingness of Things," his [[rondel (poem)|rondel]]s "Four Variations" and "The Ways of Death," ten of his [[Sicilian octave]]s including "My Love to Me" and "If I were King," a [[triolet]] by the same name, three [[villanelle]]s including "Where's the Use of Sighing," and a pair of [[burlesque]]s.<ref name="White1888" /><ref>About the selection of so many of his works, Gleeson White, 1888, op cit., states: "In a society paper, ''The London'', a brilliant series of these poems appeared during 1877-8. After a selection was made for this volume, it was discovered that they were all by one author, Mr. W. E. Henley, who most generously permitted the whole of those chosen to appear, and to be for the first time publicly attributed to him. The poems themselves need no apology, but in the face of so many from his pen, it is only right to explain the reason for the inclusion of so large a number."</ref>
* Editing ''Slang and its analogues'' inspired Henley's two translations of [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballades]] by [[François Villon]] into thieves' slang.
* In 1892, Henley published a second volume of poetry, named after the first poem, "The Song of the Sword" but later re-titled ''London Voluntaries'' after another section in the second edition (1893).{{sfn|James|1911|p=270}}
* ''Hawthorn and Lavender, with Other Verses'' (1901), a collection entirely of Henley's,<ref name="HenleyHawthLav01">William Ernest Henley, 1901, ''Hawthorn and Lavender, with Other Verses'', New York: Harper and Bros.

The third section contains "Three Prologues" associated with theatrical works that Henley supported, including "Beau Austin" (by Henley and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], that played at [[Haymarket Theatre]] in late 1890), "Richard Savage" (by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[H. B. Marriott Watson]] that played at [[Criterion Theatre]] in spring 1891, and "Admiral Guinea" (by again by Henley and Stevenson, that played at [[Avenue Theatre]] in late 1897).

* ''A Song of Speed'', his last published poem two months before his death.{{sfn|James|1911|p=271}}

===Plays===
* During 1892, Henley also published three plays written with Stevenson: ''Beau Austin'', ''Deacon Brodie,'' about a corrupt Scottish deacon turned housebreaker, and ''Admiral Guinea''. ''Deacon Brodie'' was produced in Edinburgh in 1884 and later in London. [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] produced ''Beau Austin'' at the Haymarket on 3 November 1890, and ''Macaire'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's]] on 2 May 1901.{{sfn|James|1911|pp=270–271}}

[[George Butterworth]] set four of Henley's poems to music in his 1912 [[song cycle]] ''[[Love Blows As the Wind Blows]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=Love blows as the wind blows|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/show_poems_in_group.html?CID=268|publisher=The LiederNet Archive|access-date=7 November 2016}}</ref> Henley's poem, "Pro Rege Nostro", became popular during the [[First World War]] as a piece of patriotic verse, containing the following refrain<blockquote>What have I done for you, England, my England?

What is there I would not do, England my own?<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/337/1547.html|title=Pro Rege Nostro|last=Henley|first=William Ernest|date=7 March 2019|website=Bartleby.com}}</ref></blockquote>The same poem and its sentiments have since been parodied by those unhappy with the [[jingoism]] they feel it expresses or the [[propaganda|propagandistic]] use to which it was put during WWI to inspire patriotism and sacrifice in the British public and young men heading off to war.<ref>Reader, J.W. ''At Duty's Call: A Study in Obsolete Patriotism. Manchester University Press,'' 1991, p. 231.</ref> The poem is referenced in the title, "[[England, My England and Other Stories|England, My England]]", a short story by [[D. H. Lawrence]], and also in ''[[England, Their England]],'' a satiric novel by [[A. G. Macdonell]] about 1920s English society.

[[Nelson Mandela]] recited the poem "[[Invictus]]" to other prisoners incarcerated alongside him at [[Robben Island]], some believe because it expressed in its message of self-mastery Mandela's own [[Victorian era|Victorian]] ethic.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Nelson Mandela: A Very Short Introduction | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0191577723 | publisher  = Oxford, UK: [[Oxford University Press|OUP]] | isbn = 978-0192803016 | page = 157 | access-date = 9 May 2015 | quote = Quote: In 'Invictus', taken on its own, Mandela clearly found his [[Victorian era|Victorian]] ethic of self-mastery given compelling expression within the frame of a controlled rhyme scheme supported by strong, monosyllabic nouns. It was only a small step from espousing this poem to assuming a Victorian persona, as he could do in letters to his children. In ways they predictably found alienating, he liked to exhort them to ever-greater effort, reiterating that ambition and drive were the only means of escaping an 'inferior position' in life. | first=Elleke | last=Boehmer | year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = There and Back: Robben Island, 1964–1979 | publisher  = Belleville, South Africa: [[Mayibuye Books]] | isbn = 1868083802 | page = 244 | first=Eddie | last=Daniels | year=1998}}</ref> This historical event was captured in fictional form in the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' (2009), wherein the poem is referenced several times. In that fictionalised account, the poem becomes a central inspirational gift from actor [[Morgan Freeman]]'s Mandela to [[Matt Damon]]'s [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] [[Rugby football|rugby]] team captain [[Francois Pienaar]], on the eve of the underdog Springboks' victory in the post-[[apartheid]] 1995 Rugby World Cup held in South Africa.<ref>''Invictus.'' 2009. Directed by Clint Eastwood. Starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.</ref>

In Chapter Two of her first volume of autobiography, ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' (1969), [[Maya Angelou]] writes in passing that she "enjoyed and respected" Henley's works among others such as [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s and [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s, but had no "loyal passion" for them.

[[Joe Orton]], English playwright of the 1960s, based the title and theme of his breakthrough play ''[[The Ruffian on the Stair]]'', which was broadcast on BBC radio in 1964, on the opening lines of Henley's poem ''Madame Life's a Piece in Bloom'':

:<blockquote>Madam Life's a piece in bloom<br>Death goes dogging everywhere:<br>She's the tenant of the room,<br>He's the ruffian on the stair.</blockquote>
Henley's 1887 ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjjF4KK4SeE Villon's Straight Tip to All Cross Coves]'' (a free translation of [[François Villon|Francoise Villon's]] ''Tout aux tavernes et aux filles''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Farmer-MusaPedestris/villons-straight-tip-to-all-cross-coves.html|title=Villon's Straight Tip To All Cross Coves (Canting Songs)|website=www.fromoldbooks.org|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref>)  was recited by [[Ricky Jay]] as part of his solo show, ''Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants'' (1994). The poem was set to music and release with a video in July 2020 by the folk band [[Stick in the Wheel]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=19 August 2020|title=Stick in the Wheel share video for new single Villon Song|url=https://www.folkradio.co.uk/2020/07/stick-in-the-wheel-video-villon-song/|website=www.folkradio.co.uk|date=25 July 2020}}</ref>
