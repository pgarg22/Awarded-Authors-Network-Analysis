'''Leonardo Sciascia''' ({{IPA-it|leoˈnardo ʃˈʃaʃʃa|-|It-Leonardo Sciascia.oga}}; 8 January 1921 – 20 November 1989) was an [[Italy|Italian]] writer, novelist, essayist, playwright, and politician. Some of his works have been made into films, including ''[[Open Doors (film)|Porte Aperte]]'' (1990; ''Open Doors''), ''[[Illustrious Corpses|Cadaveri Eccellenti]]'' (1976; Illustrious Corpses), ''[[Todo Modo]]'' (also 1976) and ''[[The Day of the Owl (film)|Il giorno della civetta]]'' (1968; ''The Day of the Owl'').

== Biography ==
Sciascia was born in [[Racalmuto]], Sicily. In 1935, his family moved to [[Caltanissetta]], where Sciascia studied under [[Vitaliano Brancati]], who would become his model in writing and introduce him to French novelists. From Giuseppe Granata, future [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] member of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Italian Senate]], Sciascia learned about the [[Age of Enlightenment|French Enlightenment]] and [[American literature]]. In 1944, he married Maria Andronico, an elementary school teacher in Racalmuto. In 1948, his brother committed suicide, an event which profoundly impacted Sciascia.

Sciascia's first work, ''Favole della dittatura'' (''Fables of the Dictatorship''), a satire on [[Italian Fascism|fascism in Italy]], was published in 1950.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/528743/Leonardo-Sciascia|title=Leonardo Sciascia|encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> This was followed in 1952 by ''La Sicilia, il suo cuore'' (''Sicily, its Heart''), his first and only poetry collection, illustrated by [[Emilio Greco]]. The following year Sciascia won the Premio Pirandello, awarded by the Sicilian Region, for his essay "''Pirandello e il pirandellismo''" ("Pirandello and Pirandellism").

In 1954, he began collaborating with literature and [[ethnology]] magazines published by [[Salvatore Sciascia]] in Caltanissetta. In 1956, he published ''Le parrocchie di Regalpetra'' (''The Parishes of Regalpetra''), an autobiographic novel inspired by his experience as an elementary school teacher in his home town. In the same year he moved to teach in Caltanissetta, only to move again to Rome in 1957 where he struck up a lifelong friendship with Sicilian artist, [[Bruno Caruso]]. In the autumn of 1957 he published ''Gli zii di Sicilia'' (''Uncles of Sicily''), which includes sharp views about themes such as the influence of the U.S. and of [[communism]] in the world, and the 19th century [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]].

After one year in Rome, Sciascia moved back to Caltanissetta, in Sicily. In 1961, he published the mystery ''[[The Day of the Owl|Il giorno della civetta]]'' (''The Day of the Owl''), one of his most famous novels, and in 1963, the historical novel ''Il consiglio d'Egitto'' (''The Council of Egypt''), set in 18th-century [[Palermo]]. After a series of essays, in 1965 he wrote the play ''L'onorevole'' (''The Honorable''), a denunciation of the complicities between government and [[Sicilian Mafia|the mafia]]. Another political mystery novel is 1966's ''[[To Each His Own (novel)|A ciascuno il suo]]'' (''To Each His Own'').

The following year Sciascia moved to Palermo. In 1969, he began a collaboration with ''[[Corriere della Sera|Il Corriere della Sera]]''. That same year he published the play ''Recitazione della controversia liparitana dedicata ad A.D.'' (''Recitation of liparitana dispute dedicated to A.D.''), dedicated to [[Alexander Dubček]]. In 1971, Sciascia returned again to mystery with ''[[Equal Danger|Il contesto]]'' (''The Challenge''), which inspired [[Francesco Rosi]]'s movie ''[[Illustrious Corpses|Cadaveri eccellenti]]'' (1976; ''Illustrious Corpses''). The novel created [[Polemic]]s, due to its merciless portrait of Italian politics, as did his novel ''Todo modo'' (1974; ''One Way or Another''), due to its description of Italy's Catholic clergy.

At the 1975 communal elections in Palermo, Sciascia ran as an independent within the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) slate and was elected to the city council. In the same year, he published ''La scomparsa di Majorana'' (''The Disappearance of Majorana''), dealing with the mysterious disappearance of scientist [[Ettore Majorana]]. In 1977, he resigned from PCI, due to his opposition to any dealing with the ''[[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Democrazia Cristiana]]'' (Christian Democratic party). Later, he would be elected to the Italian and European Parliament with the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]].

Sciascia's last works include the essay collection ''Cronachette'' (1985), the novels ''Porte aperte'' (1987; ''Open Doors'') and ''Il cavaliere e la morte'' (1988; ''The Horseman and Death''). He died in June 1989 at Palermo.

== Work summary ==
[[File:Leonardo Sciascia2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sciascia as Member of the Chamber of Deputies, 1979]]
A number of his books, such as ''The Day of the Owl'' (''Il giorno della civetta'') and ''Equal Danger'' (''Il contesto''), demonstrate how the Mafia manages to sustain itself in the face of the [[anomie]] inherent in Sicilian life. He presented a forensic analysis of the kidnapping and assassination of [[Aldo Moro]], a prominent [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]], in his book ''The Moro Affair''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Moro Affair and The Mystery of Majorana|edition=English and Italian; Hardcover|date= 1 January 1987|isbn=978-0856357008|publisher=Carcanet Press}}</ref>

Sciascia's work is intricate and displays a longing for justice, while attempting to show how corrupt Italian society had become and remains. His linking of politicians, intrigue, and [[Sicilian Mafia|the Mafia]] gave him a high profile, which was very much at odds with his private self. This high-profile resulted in his becoming widely disliked for his criticism of [[Giulio Andreotti]], then Prime Minister, for his lack of action to free Moro and answer the demands of the ''[[Red Brigades|Brigate Rosse]]'' (Red Brigades).

In 1979, Sciascia was elected for the Radical Party in the House of Deputies and become a member of the committee of the House for the investigation into Moro's kidnapping, which stated that there was a certain amount of negligence on the part of the Christian Democrat Party in their stance that the state was bigger than a person, and that they would not swap Moro for 13 political prisoners, even though Moro himself had stated that the swapping of innocent people for political prisoners was a valid option in negotiations with terrorists. However, senior members of the party disagreed with this stance and were of the view that Moro had been drugged and tortured to utter these words. Out of this experience, Sciascia wrote an important book.

Sciascia wrote of his unique Sicilian experience, linking families with political parties, the treachery of alliances and allegiances, and the calling of favors that result in outcomes that do not benefit society, but those individuals who are in favor. His books are rarely characterized by a happy ending or by justice for the ordinary man. A prime example of this is ''Equal Danger'' (1973; ''Il Contesto''),<ref>{{cite book|title=Equal Danger|edition=First|publisher= Harper & Row|date=1973|author=Sciascia, Leonardo|language= en|isbn=978-0060138097}}</ref> in which the police's best detective is drafted to Sicily to investigate a spate of murders of judges. Focusing on the inability of authorities to handle such investigation into the corruption, Sciascia's hero is finally thwarted.

His 1984 opus, ''Occhio di Capra''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sciascia |first1=Leonardo |title=Occhio di capra |date=1984 |publisher=Einaudi |location=Torino |isbn=9788806057756 |oclc=797364283 }}</ref> (''Goat's Eye''), is a collection of Sicilian sayings and proverbs gathered from the area around his native village, to which he was intensely attached throughout his life.
