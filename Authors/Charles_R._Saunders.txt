== Life and work ==
Charles Robert Saunders was born on July 3, 1946,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=2021-01-21|title=A Literary Trailblazer's Solitary Death: Charles Saunders, 73|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/books/charles-saunders-dead.html|access-date=2021-01-21|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> in [[Elizabeth, Pennsylvania]], a small town outside [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name="webbio">[http://www.reindeermotel.com/CHARLES/charles_bio.html Saunders, Charles R. "Autobiography" Saunders' official website] accessed June 27, 2011.</ref><ref name="JT"/> He later lived in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]] before going to [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]],<ref name="webbio"/> from which he graduated in 1968 with a degree in [[psychology]].<ref name="webbio"/><ref name="JT"/> Drafted to fight in Vietnam in 1969,<ref name="JT"/> he instead moved to Canada, living in [[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]]<ref name="webbio"/><ref name="JT"/> before a sojourn in [[Ottawa]] of fourteen<ref name="webbio"/> or fifteen years.<ref name="JT"/> In 1985 he moved to [[Nova Scotia]],<ref name="webbio"/><ref name="JT"/> where he lived for the remainder of his life.<ref name="JT"/><ref name="scifidimensions.com"/> Nova Scotia's black community is largely descended from African Americans who went over to the British side during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]; they were given freedom and land in Nova Scotia after those wars ended, and created communities such as [[Africville, Nova Scotia|Africville]].<ref name="scifidimensions.com"/>

Saunders worked as a civil servant and teacher until 1989, when he began a career in journalism.<ref name="JT"/> Poet [[George Elliott Clarke]], who had written a column on Black issues for the ''[[The Daily News (Halifax)|Halifax Daily News]]'' before moving to Ontario, recommended him to editor Doug MacKay, who after meeting Saunders took a chance and hired him.<ref name="JT"/> Saunders worked the night shift as a [[copy editor]]<ref name="scifidimensions.com"/> as well as writing his own weekly column on African-Nova Scotian life,<ref name="JT"/> for which he wrote his thoughts out in [[longhand]] during the day.<ref name="scifidimensions.com"/> He often wrote the paper's unsigned editorials.<ref name="JT"/> He also wrote four non-fiction books about the Nova Scotia black community, including a collection of his columns,<ref name="scifidimensions.com"/> and contributed to ''The Spirit of Africville'' (1992), "a landmark book on the destroyed community."<ref name="JT"/>

When the ''Daily News'' shut down in 2008, Saunders retired. Afterwards he became increasingly isolated. In his last years he lived with little money in a modest apartment on Primrose Street in Dartmouth, N.S., lacking a landline, mobile phone or internet connection. He communicated weekly with friends and colleagues in the wider world using the computers in his local library. In failing health during his last year or so, he confided to few  about his condition. He died in May 2020, but his death was only made public that September.<ref name="JT"/>

''Daily News'' colleagues praising Saunders's journalism include Doug MacKay and Bill Turpin. Authors remembering him as an inspiration or mentor include Troy Wiggins, publisher of ''FIYAH'', Milton Davis, operator of MVmedia and co-editor with Saunders of ''Griots: A Sword and Soul Anthology'', Taaq Kirksey, developer of a television project based on Imaro.<ref name="JT"/>

== Literary career ==
According to Saunders he read his first work of science fiction in 1958, a misremembered novel by [[Andre Norton]]; this he states was what got him into the [[genre]].<ref name="zone-sf.com">{{cite web |title=Adding To The Gumbo Mix: Charles R. Saunders - 2005 Interview |url=http://www.zone-sf.com/crsaunders.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607105724/http://www.zone-sf.com/crsaunders.html |archivedate=2011-06-07}}</ref> (The mutated [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] he recalls in an interview with Amy Harlib was most likely Lura, the giant Siamese cat and companion to the hero Fors in Norton's 1952 novel ''Star Man's Son'' [later reprinted as ''Daybreak 2250 A.D.'' and ''Star Man's Son – 2250 A.D.''].)

Inspired in [[Africa]], he created the fictional continent Nyumbani (which means "home" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]), where the stories of Imaro, his [[sword and sorcery]] series, take place.<ref name="nyumbani">[https://www.blackgate.com/2017/05/30/stories-from-a-ss-griot-nyumbani-tales-by-charles-r-saunders/ Stories from a S&S Griot: Nyumbani Tales by Charles R. Saunders]</ref> In 1974, Saunders wrote a series of short stories for [[Gene Day]]'s [[science fiction fanzine]] ''Dark Fantasy''. The issue of ''Dark Fantasy'' with the first Imaro story found its way to [[Lin Carter]], who included it in his first ''[[The Year's Best Fantasy Stories|Year's Best Fantasy Stories]]'' collection, published by [[DAW Books]] in 1975. This publication brought Saunders' work to the attention of Daw publisher [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who eventually suggested that Saunders turn his Imaro stories into a novel. Six of the novellas originally published by Gene Day in ''Dark Fantasy'' ("Mawanzo", "Turkhana Knives", "The Place of Stones", "Slaves of the Giant Kings", "Horror in the Black Hills", and "The City of Madness") would later be used in his first novel, ''[[Imaro (novel)|Imaro]]'', which was published by Daw in 1981.<ref name="scifidimensions.com">[http://www.scifidimensions.com/May01/charlessaunders.htm May 2001 Sci-Fi Dimensions interview with Amy Harlib] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516234029/http://www.scifidimensions.com/May01/charlessaunders.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

But a lawsuit by the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.|Edgar Rice Burroughs estate]] over a poorly chosen cover quote, ''The Epic Novel of a Black [[Tarzan]]'', caused a one-month delay in shipping as the books had to be reprinted, which led to poor sales. Saunders wrote and sold two more books in the series, ''[[The Quest for Cush]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Trail of Bohu]]'' (1985).<ref name="zone-sf.com"/>

In 2000, author and editor [[Sheree Renée Thomas]] ([[Sheree R. Thomas]]) published Saunders' original short story, "Gimmile's Songs" in [[Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora]] published by [[Warner Aspect]], as well as his original essay, "Why Blacks Should Read (and Write) Science Fiction". This publication reintroduced Saunders' work to a new generation of readers. In 2004, Thomas published his original short story, "Yahimba's Choice" in [[Dark Matter: Reading the Bones]] published by [[Warner Aspect]].

In 2006, [[small press]] [[Night Shade Books]] made a deal with Saunders to publish an updated edition of ''Imaro''. This new edition excludes the novella "Slaves of the Giant-Kings", which Saunders felt held too many parallels to the present day [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name="zone-sf.com"/> In 2008 the second novel in the updated Imaro trilogy ''The Quest for Cush'' was published by Night Shade Books, and the company has decided not to publish any other Imaro novels at this time.

In 2008 Saunders released the related work ''[[Dossouye]]''  through Sword & Soul Media and the online publisher [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]], Dousouye is a [[fix-up]] novel created from the short stories "Agbewe's Sword", "Gimmile's Songs", "Shiminege’s Mask", "Marwe’s Forest", and "Obenga’s Drum", the last previously unpublished. Dossouye herself is a woman warrior inspired by the [[Dahomey Amazons|real-life female warriors]] of the West African [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]]. Her first stories appeared in [[Jessica Amanda Salmonson]]'s ''[[Amazons!]]''<ref name="Paghat">{{Cite web|url=http://www.weirdwildrealm.com/f-goldtempleamazons.html|title=Wild Realm Reviews: Golden Temple Amazons|accessdate=2009-10-08|publisher=Film Reviews at The Weird Wild Realm of Paghat the Ratgirl|date=March 17, 2009 |author=Jessica Amanda Salmonson}}</ref> and [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Sword and Sorceress]]'',<ref>[https://www.blackgate.com/2010/06/08/looking-back-on-the-first-sword-and-sorceress/ Looking Back on the first Sword and Sorceress]</ref> two anthologies designed to increase the number and recognition of female heroes in sword and sorcery fiction. "Agbewe's Sword" was adapted by Saunders himself in the screenplay of the film [[Amazons (1986 film)|Amazons]] (1986).<ref>[https://differentdrumming.com/mistaken-identity Mistaken Indetidy]</ref> In 2009 he released ''The Trail of Bohu'', the third title in the now ongoing Imaro series, through the Sword & Soul Media storefront.<ref name="Ward">{{Cite web|url=http://billwardwriter.com/imaro-the-trail-of-bohu-now-available/|title=Imaro: The Trail of Bohu Now Available|accessdate=October 8, 2009|date=January 24, 2009|author=Bill Ward|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130118005544/http://billwardwriter.com/imaro-the-trail-of-bohu-now-available/|archivedate=January 18, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2009 he released ''[[The Naama War]]'' the fourth and latest Imaro novel through Lulu.<ref>[https://www.blackgate.com/2009/12/30/imaro-the-naama-war-by-charles-saunders/ Imaro: The Naama War by Charles Saunders]</ref> In 2012, he released ''Dossouye: The Dancers of Mulukau'', the second novel of ''Dossouye''.<ref>[https://www.blackgate.com/2012/07/09/dossouye-the-dancers-of-mulukau/ Dossouye: The Dancers of Mulukau]</ref>

In 2017 Saunders released "Nyumbani Tales", a collection of Nyumbani stories that have not yet been republished, among them "Katisa," about Imaro's mother.<ref name="nyumbani"/> In 2018, he published a story of Imaro in the anthology [[The Mighty Warriors]], edited by [[Robert M.
