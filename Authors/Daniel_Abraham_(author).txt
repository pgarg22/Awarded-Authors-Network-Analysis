[[File:Daniel Abraham.jpg|right|thumb|Abraham in 2006]]
=== ''Hunter's Run'' ===
In September 2007, [[Eos Books]] published the science fiction novel ''[[Hunter's Run]]'', a collaboration between Abraham, [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Gardner Dozois]]. The story began as an untitled novella written by Dozois and submitted to Martin for critique in 1977.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://www.omnivoracious.com/2008/01/what-do-you-get.html|title=Hunter's Run Explored: An Interview with Daniel Abraham, Gardner Dozois, and George R.R.

In 2002, Martin and Dozois decided to bring in a third author to finish the novella, asking Abraham to overhaul the 20,000 word manuscript and write an ending.<ref name=":10" /> The resulting novella, "Shadow Twin", was released online on ''[[Sci Fiction]]'' in 2004, and later reprinted in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' and published as a chapbook by [[Subterranean Press]]. The novel version was suggested by Martin,<ref name=":11" /> and retitled ''Hunter's Run'' to avoid confusion with the novella version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2007/10/interviews/interview-daniel-abraham/|title=Interview {{!}} Daniel Abraham - A Dribble of Ink|date=2007-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> The writers "threw everything out"<ref name=":10" /> to write the novel, each doing passes on the manuscript, with Dozois putting the finishing touches to the novel.<ref name=":11" />

=== ''The Expanse'' ===
{{Main|The Expanse (novel series)}}In 2011, Abraham launched a new science fiction series, ''The Expanse'', co-authored with Ty Franck under the joint pseudonym [[James S. A. Corey]]. The books are based on a [[role-playing game]] set up by Franck, who had developed a science fiction universe that spanned the solar system.<ref name=":8" /> After Franck moved to [[New Mexico]] and became part of the science fiction writing community, he set up several campaigns of the game, one that included Abraham as a player.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/46795-an-unapologetic-embrace-of-sentiment-pw-talks-with-james-s-a-corey.html|title=An Unapologetic Embrace of Sentiment: PW Talks with James S.A. Corey|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> Abraham was impressed by the amount of research and world-building Franck had done and asked to write a novel set in the game's universe. Franck agreed and decided to split the proceeds of the book with Abraham for his part in writing from Franck's notes and outline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/interview-james-s-corey/|title=Interview: James S.A.

Its sequel, ''[[Caliban's War]]'', was published in June 2012.
