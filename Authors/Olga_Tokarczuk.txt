Her works include ''[[Primeval and Other Times]]'', ''[[Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead]]'', and ''[[The Books of Jacob]]''.

Since 1998, she has lived between [[Krajanów]] and Wrocław, in [[Lower Silesia]]. Her home in Krajanów near [[Nowa Ruda]] is located in the [[Sudetes]] mountains at the multi-cultural [[County of Kladsko|Polish-Czech borderland]]. The locale has influenced her literary work;<ref name=":2" /> the novel ''[[House of Day, House of Night]]'' (1998) touches on life in the adopted home, and the action of ''[[Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead]]'' (2009) takes place in the picturesque [[Kłodzko Valley]]. In 1998, together with her first husband, Tokarczuk founded the Ruta [[Small press|publishing house]], which operated until 2004.<ref name=":4" /> She was an organizer of the International Short Story Festival, which inaugurated in Wrocław in 2004. As a guest lecturer, she conducted prose workshops at universities in [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]] and [[University of Opole|Opole]]. Tokarczuk joined the editorial team of ''[[Krytyka Polityczna]]'' (Eng. ed. ''Political Critique''), a magazine as well as large pan-regional network of institutions and activists, and currently serves on the [[Board of directors|Board of trustees]] of its academic and research unit – Institute for Advance Study in Warsaw.

===Literary career===
Olga Tokarczuk's first book was published in 1989, a collection of poems entitled ''Miasta w lustrach'' (Cities in Mirrors).<ref name=wiacek>{{cite journal |last=Wiącek |first=Elżbieta |title=The Works of Olga Tokarczuk: Postmodern aesthetics, myths, archetypes, and the feminist touch |url=http://womenswriting.fi/files/2009/11/10_wiacek.pdf |journal=Poland Under Feminist Eyes |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages=134–155 |access-date=2 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021112511/http://womenswriting.fi/files/2009/11/10_wiacek.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Her debut novel, ''Podróż ludzi księgi'' (The Journey of the Book-People), was published in 1993. A [[parable]] on two lovers' quest for the "secret of the Book" – a metaphor for the meaning of life – is set in 17th century, and portrays an expedition to a monastery in the [[Pyrenees]] on the trail of a book which reveals the mystery of life, ending with an ironic twist. It was well received by critics, and won Polish Publisher’s Prize for best debut.<ref>{{cite news |title="Księgi Jakubowe" z najważniejszym francuskim wyróżnieniem dla przekładu literackiego |url=https://www.tvn24.pl/kultura-styl,8/ksiegi-jakubowe-olgi-tokarczuk-nagrodzone-we-francji,951508.html |access-date=10 October 2019 |work=[[TVN24]] |date=10 July 2019 |language=pl}}</ref> Ever since then, Tokarczuk’s novels and short stories have ranked her amongst the top of Polish contemporary writers of prose.

The follow-up novel ''E.E.'' (1995) plays with the conventions of the [[Literary modernism|modernist]] [[Psychological fiction|psychological novel]], and took its title from the initials of its protagonist, the adolescent Erna Eltzner, who develops [[psychic]] abilities. Growing up in a wealthy German-Polish family in the 1920s in [[Wrocław]], which was at that time a German city named Breslau, she allegedly becomes a medium, a fact her mother begins to take advantage of by organizing [[Mediumship|spiritual sessions]]. Tokarczuk introduces the characters of scientists, the psychiatrist-patient relationship, and despite elements of [[Spiritualism|spiritualism]], [[Occult|occultism]] as well as [[gnosticism]], she represents psychological realism and cognitive [[Skepticism|scepticism]]. Katarzyna Kantner, a literary scholar who defended her PhD thesis on the works of Olga Tokarczuk, points out C.G. Jung’s doctoral dissertation 'On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena' as an inspiration."<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Figlerowicz |first1=Marta |title=Rewriting Poland |url=http://bostonreview.net/literature-culture/marta-figlerowicz-olga-tokarczuk |access-date=10 October 2019 |work=Boston Review |date=14 September 2018 }}</ref>

Her third novel, ''[[Primeval and Other Times]]'' (''Prawiek i inne czasy'', Eng. 2010), was published in 1996 and became highly successful. It is set in the fictitious village of Primeval at the very heart of Poland, which is populated by some eccentric, [[archetype|archetypical]] characters. The village, a microcosm of Europe, is guarded by four archangels, from whose perspective the book chronicles the lives of its inhabitants over a period of eight decades, beginning in the year that [[World War I]] broke out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tskymag.com/2010/11/olga-tokarczuks-primeval-and-other-times-reviewed-by-katie-eberhart/|title=Primeval and Other Times: Olga Tokarczuk|last=Eberhart |first=Katie|date=27 November 2010|publisher=TS}}</ref> The book presents the creation of a myth emerging before the reader’s eyes. "This is Primeval: an enclosed snow globe, a world in itself, which it may or may not be possible to ever leave. [...] And yet, as much as the town of Primeval is devastated, over and over, by history, there is also a counter dream, full of creaturely magic and wonder."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tracey|date=2019-01-21|title=Staff Picks: Primeval and Other Times and Flights|url=https://malvernbooks.com/2019/01/21/staff-picks-primeval-and-other-times-and-flights/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-11|website=Malvern Books}}</ref> Translated into many languages, with English version by [[Antonia Lloyd-Jones]], ''Primeval and Other Times'' established Tokarczuk's international reputation as one of the most important representatives of [[Polish literature]] in her generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twistedspoon.com/primeval.html|title=Primeval and Other Times|publisher=Twisted Spoon Press|access-date=11 October 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/05/olga-tokarczuks-novels-against-nationalism|title=Olga Tokarczuk's Novels Against Nationalism|last=Franklin |first=Ruth|work=The New Yorker|date=29 July 2019|access-date=11 October 2019 }}</ref>

After ''Primeval and Other Times'', her work began drifting away from the novel genre towards shorter prose texts and essays. Tokarczuk's next book ''Szafa'' (The Wardrobe, 1997) was a collection of three novella-type stories.

''[[House of Day, House of Night]]'' (''Dom dzienny, dom nocny'', 1998, Eng. 2003), is what Tokarczuk terms the ’constellation novel’, a patchwork of loosely connected disparate stories, sketches, and essays about life past and present in the author's adopted home in Krajanów, which allow various interpretations and enable communication at a deeper, psychological level. Her goal is to make those images, fragments of narrative and motif, merge together only on entering the reader’s consciousness. While some, at least those unfamiliar with [[History of Central Europe|Central European history]], have labeled it Tokarczuk's most "difficult" piece, it was her first book to be published in English, and was shortlisted for the [[International Dublin Literary Award]] in 2004.<ref name="Publications2003">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phhhHT64kIMC&pg=PA545|title=International Who's Who of Authors and Writers 2004|publisher=Europa Publications|year=2003|isbn=978-1-85743-179-7|editor-last=Neale|editor-first=Alison|pages=545}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Marsden|first=Philip|date=2002-10-20|title=Observer review: House of Day, House of Night by Olga Tokarczuk|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/20/fiction.features2|url-status=live|access-date=2018-01-01|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

''House of Day, House of Night'' was followed by a collection of short stories ''Gra na wielu bębenkach'' (Playing on Many Drums, 2001) as well as a book-length non-fiction essay ''Lalka i perła'' (The Doll and the Pearl, 2000), on the subject of [[Bolesław Prus]]' classic novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/polish-author-olga-tokarczuk-wins-man-booker-prize-2018-flights-other-books-5187800/ | title = Olga Tokarczuk wins Man Booker Prize 2018: Other novels by the Polish author | date = 10 October 2019 | access-date = 11 October 2019 | work = [[The Indian Express]] }}</ref> She also published a volume with three modern Christmas tales, together with her fellow writers [[Jerzy Pilch]] and [[Andrzej Stasiuk]] (''Opowieści wigilijne'', 2000).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://vilenica.si/en/vilenica-2008-prize-winner/ | title= Vilenica 2008 Prize Winner | publisher = [[Vilenica International Literary Festival]] | date = 22 May 2008 | access-date =11 October 2019 }}</ref> ''Ostatnie historie'' (The Last Stories) of 2004 is an exploration of death from the perspectives of three generations, while the novel ''Anna in the Tombs of the World'' (2006) was a contribution to the [[Canongate Myth Series]] by Polish publisher [[Znak (association)|Znak]].

In 2009 she published an existential, noir thriller novel ''[[Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead]]'' (''Prowadź swój pług przez kości umarłych'', Eng. 2019), which is not a conventional crime story, transforming into an acid social satire. The main character and narrator is Janina Duszejko, a woman in her 60s living in a rural area at the Polish [[Kłodzko Valley]], eccentric in perception of other humans through [[astrology]] and fond of the poetry of William Blake, from whose work the title of the book is taken. She decides to investigate murders of members of local hunting club, and initially explains these deaths as caused by wild animals in vengeance on hunters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-54133-2 |title=Fiction Book Review: Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk, trans. from the Polish by Antonia Lloyd-Jones |date=14 May 2019 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/21/drive-your-plow-over-the-bones-of-the-dead-review |title=Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk – the entire cosmic catastrophe |last=Perry |first=Sarah |author-link=Sarah Perry |date=21 September 2018 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/drive-your-plow-over-the-bones-of-the-dead/|title=Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead|publisher=Book Marks|date=13 August 2019|access-date=11 October 2019 }}</ref> The novel has become one of the bestsellers in Poland.<ref>{{cite web|date=20 February 2010|title=Bestsellery 2009|trans-title=List of Polish bestsellers 2009|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/436816.html|access-date=18 June 2011|work=Rzeczpospolita|language=pl}}</ref> It was the basis of the [[crime film]] ''[[Spoor (film)|Spoor]]'' (2017) directed by [[Agnieszka Holland]], which won the [[Alfred Bauer Prize]] (Silver Bear) at the [[67th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="awards">{{cite web|date=18 February 2017|title=Prizes of the International Jury|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html|access-date=18 February 2017|work=Berlinale}}</ref> English translation by Antonia Lloyd-Jones earned Tokarczuk second nomination for the Man Booker International Prize.

An epic novel ''[[The Books of Jacob]]'' (2014, Eng. 2021 translated by Jennifer Croft) is a journey over seven borders, five languages, and three major religions. Beginning in 1752 at the historical eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] [[Eastern Galicia|region]], now western Ukraine, it revolves around a controversial 18th [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] religious leader and mystic [[Jacob Frank]] among other historical figures, and winds up near mid-20th-century [[Korolówka]], Poland, where a family of local Jews had hidden from the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Frank, who founded the [[Frankism|Frankist]] [[sect]] fighting for the rights and emancipation of the Jews, encouraged his followers to transgress moral boundaries. The Frankists were persecuted in the Jewish community, including salvation through orgiastic rites.

{{Blockquote
 |text   =  A work of immense erudition with a powerful epic sweep. [...] The thematic richness is impressive. The story of the Frankists, rendered through a series of mythic narratives, is transformed into a universal epic tale of the struggle against rigid thinking, either religious or philosophical, that ostracize and enslave people. An extensive and prolific work that warns against our inability to embrace an environment complex in its diversity, fueling a fanatical sectarianism which ends in disaster. ''The Books of Jacob'', by telling the past with a dazzling virtuosity, helps us to better understand the world in which we live.
}}

In regard to the historical and ideological divides of [[Polish literature]], the book has been characterized as anti-[[Henryk Sienkiewicz|Sienkiewicz]]. It was soon acclaimed by critics and readers alike, but its reception has been hostile in some Polish [[nationalism|nationalist]] circles and Olga Tokarczuk became a target of some internet hate and harassment campaign.<ref name="Nike Award GW">{{cite web |url= http://wyborcza.pl/1,75475,18965980,nagroda-nike-2015-dla-olgi-tokarczuk-ksiegi-jakubowe-ksiazka.html |title=Nagroda Nike 2015 dla Olgi Tokarczuk.

===Literary Heights Festival===
[[File:Olga_Tokarczuk,_Karol_Maliszewski.jpg|thumb|upright|O. Tokarczuk and Karol Maliszewski at the [[Literary Heights Festival]] (2018)|right]]
Since its foundation in 2015, Olga Tokarczuk has become co-host of the annual [[Literary Heights Festival]], which has included events in her village. The festival has a rich programme of cultural events such as educational sessions and workshops, debates, concerts, film screenings as well as various exhibitions.

===Olga Tokarczuk Foundation===
In November 2019, Tokarczuk has established a foundation with a planned wide range of activities related to literature to create progressive intellectual and artistic centre. It was declared that Polish poet [[Tymoteusz Karpowicz]]'s villa in [[Wrocław]] would become its future seat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Talik |first1=Magdalena |title=The Olga Tokarczuk Foundation in the Karpowicz Villa |url=https://www.wroclaw.pl/en/the-olga-tokarczuk-foundation-in-the-karpowicz-villa |access-date=24 May 2020 |issue=27 November 2019 |publisher=Wrocław.pl}}</ref> The writer allocated 10% of her Nobel financial prize to the body and, aside from her, Agnieszka Holland and Ireneusz Grin have joined the Foundation Council. The foundation has started its operations in October 2020 implementing educational programs, organizing writing contests and public debates, funding scholarships for young aspiring writers as well as, also international, residencies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Palacz|first=Andrzej|date=2020-10-05|title=Fundacja Olgi Tokarczuk rusza z działalnością.

In 2015, after the publication of ''The Books of Jacob'', Tokarczuk was criticized by the [[Nowa Ruda]] Patriots association, who demanded that the town's council revoke the writer's [[honorary citizenship]] of Nowa Ruda because, as the association claimed, she had tarnished the good name of the Polish nation. Those people's postulate was supported by [[Senate of Poland|Senator]] Waldemar Bonkowski of the [[Law and Justice]] Party, according to whom Tokarczuk's literary output and public statements are in "absolute contradiction to the assumptions of the Polish historical politics". Tokarczuk asserted that she is the true patriot, not the people and groups who criticize her, and whose alleged [[xenophobic]] and racist attitudes and actions are harmful to Poland and its image abroad.<ref name="I am a patriot" /><ref name="polityka historyczna" /><ref name="Czapliński list otwarty" />

Tokarczuk is the recipient of the 2015 [[Brückepreis]], the 20th edition of the award granted by the "Europa-City [[Zgorzelec]]/[[Görlitz]]". The prize is a joint undertaking of the German and Polish border [[twin cities]] aimed at advancing mutual, regional and European peace, understanding and cooperation among people of different nationalities, cultures and viewpoints. Particularly appreciated by the jury was Tokarczuk's creation of literary bridges connecting people, generations and cultures, especially residents of the border territories of Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic, who have had often different existential and historical experiences. Also stressed was Tokarczuk's "rediscovery" and elucidation of the complex multinational and multicultural past of the [[Lower Silesia]] region, an area of great political conflicts. Attending the award ceremony in Görlitz, Tokarczuk was impressed by the positive and pragmatic attitude demonstrated by the mayor of the German town in regard to the current [[European migrant crisis|refugee and migrant crisis]], which she contrasted with the ideological uproar surrounding the issue in Poland.<ref name="Nagroda Mostu Literackie">{{cite web|date=6 December 2015|title=Międzynarodowa Nagroda Mostu dla Olgi Tokarczuk|trans-title=The International Bridge Prize for Olga Tokarczuk|url=http://www.wydawnictwoliterackie.pl/aktualnosci/1238/Miedzynarodowa--Nagroda-Mostu-dla-Olgi-Tokarczuk/|publisher=[[Wydawnictwo Literackie]]|language=pl}}</ref><ref name="I am a patriot">{{cite web |first=Magda |last=Piekarska|url=http://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/1,142076,19325258,olga-tokarczuk-to-ja-jestem-patriotka-a-nie-nacjonalista-palacy.html|title=Olga Tokarczuk: To ja jestem patriotką, a nie nacjonalista palący kukłę Żyda |trans-title=I am a patriot, not the nationalist who burns an effigy of a Jew |work=Gazeta Wyborcza |language=pl |date=10 December 2015 }}</ref><ref name="Nagroda Mostu Zinfo">{{cite web |url= http://www.zinfo.pl/artykuly/19474|title=Nagroda Mostu dla Olgi Tokarczuk |trans-title=The Bridge Prize for Olga Tokarczuk |publisher=ZINFO |language=pl |date=3 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="Nagroda Mostu">{{cite web|title=Bridge Award|trans-title=|url=https://zgorzelec.eu/zgorzelec-2/miasto/laureaci-nagrody-mostu/#|url-status=live|access-date=21 December 2015|website=Zgorzelec.eu|publisher=Zgorzelec [[City council]]}}</ref>
