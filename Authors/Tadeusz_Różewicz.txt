'''Tadeusz Różewicz''' (9 October 1921 – 24 April 2014) was a Polish poet, playwright, writer, and translator. Różewicz was in the first generation of Polish writers born after Poland regained its independence in 1918, following the [[Partitions of Poland|century of foreign partitions]]. He was born in [[Radomsko]], near [[Łódź]], in 1921. He first published his poetry in 1938. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[Home Army|Polish underground Home Army]]. His elder brother, [[Janusz Różewicz|Janusz]], also a poet, was executed by the [[Gestapo]] in 1944 for serving in the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]]. His younger brother, [[Stanisław Różewicz|Stanisław]], became a noted film director and screenwriter.<ref name="PAP" />

==Biography and career==
Tadeusz Różewicz was the son of Władysław and Stefania Różewicz (née Gelbard, a Jewish convert to Catholicism). After finishing high school, Różewicz enrolled at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. He then served in [[World War II]]. After the war, he moved to [[Gliwice]], where he lived for the following two years. In 1968, he moved to [[Wrocław]], where he lived for the rest of his life.

Różewicz wrote and published fifteen volumes of poetry between 1944 and 1960.<ref name="chomikuj.pl">{{cite web|url=http://chomikuj.pl/Sarmatian/02+-+eBooks/Tadeusz+R*c3*b3*c5*bcewicz|title=Works by Tadeusz Różewicz|date=March 2009|work=Bibliography|publisher=Chomikuj.pl|format=[https://www.webcitation.org/6FKJsP1a5?url=http://chomikuj.pl/Sarmatian/02%2B-%2BeBooks/Tadeusz%2BR%2Ac3%2Ab3%2Ac5%2Abcewicz ''WebCite'' capture]|access-date=22 March 2013}}</ref> [[Czesław Miłosz]] wrote a poem dedicated to Różewicz and his poetry in 1948. Różewicz's debut as a playwright was in 1960, with ''The Card Index'' (''Kartoteka'').

He wrote over a dozen plays and several screenplays. His dramaturgical work continued to be accompanied by volumes of poetry and prose. Some of Różewicz's best known plays, other than ''The Card Index,'' include: ''The Interrupted Act'' (''Akt przerywany'', 1970), ''Birth Certificate'' (''Świadectwo urodzenia'', screenplay to an award-winning film by the same title, 1961), ''Left Home'' (''Wyszedł z domu'', 1965), and ''The White Wedding'' (''Białe małżeństwo'', 1975). His ''New Poems'' collection was nominated for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 2008.<ref name="PAP" />

Różewicz's works have been translated into nearly all major languages.<ref name="bookinstitute">[http://www.bookinstitute.pl/autorzy-detal,literatura-polska,3086,rozewicz-tadeusz.html Tadeusz Różewicz] The Polish Book Institute 2014.</ref> Two of his plays were translated into English and produced at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1965, Karen Cross and Johan Holm directed a series of Różewicz's three short plays, collectively titled ''The Witnesses''. A ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' review of the production reads: The first play, the most abstract, is a string of metaphors meant... to convey a view of man's condition... The second play presents a young married couple at breakfast planning their day. They work very hard at it, as if a night of sleep cuts them off drastically from life and contact must be reestablished. By means of a forced calm, a dedicated attention to trivia, and a patronizing attitude toward other people, they organize the day's activity... The key to the piece is the husband's matter-of-fact account, as he watches at the window, or two children tormenting and then destroying a kitten... The children quite coldly mutilate and murder the animal and the husband blandly but not indifferently reports the event to his wife who isn't listening. In the third play two men facing in opposite directions have a conversation of sorts. Constantly demanding attention of each other, they deliver up monologues of self-revelation which reveal next to nothing and on top of it are not being listened to. Through it all an injured dog suffers an elaborate death agony at the feet of one of the men, whose only response is to intersperse his fatuous self-revelations with bulletins on the progress of the dog's demise."<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. [http://catalog.lamama.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/295 "Work: ''Witnesses, The''". Accessed April 4, 2018.]</ref> In 1972, Mavis Taylor directed a production of Różewicz's ''The Old Woman Broods''. The piece was partially funded by the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] and was performed at the [[College of White Plains]], [[Hudson River Museum]], and [[Community Action Program]] in [[Mamaroneck, New York|Mamaroneck]] in addition to La MaMa's theatre in the [[East Village, Manhattan]].<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.

Różewicz has been regarded as "one of the most versatile and creative continuators of the Polish and international [[avant-garde]]". He was a member of the [[Polish Writers' Union]] and was nominated multiple times for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/tadeusz-rozewicz |title=Tadeusz Różewicz |access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref> In 1987, he received the Golden Wreath at the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]] festival in [[Struga]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. In 2000, Różewicz received Poland's top literary prize, the [[Nike Award]], for his book ''Matka odchodzi'' (''Mother Is Leaving'').

Różewicz died in [[Wrocław]] from natural causes on 24 April 2014 from. He was 92.<ref name="PAP">[http://www.tvn24.pl/zmarl-tadeusz-rozewicz,421470,s.html Zmarł Tadeusz Różewicz (Tadeusz Różewicz passed away)] 24 kwietnia 2014, [[Polish Press Agency]] (PAP).</ref>

Slovenian punk band [[Niet]] used parts of Rozewicz's poem ''Pierwsza miłość'' and recreated it in their 1984 punk balade ''Lep dan za smrt'' (''A Nice Day for Death'').<ref>http://mojcapisek.blogspot.si/2009/06/niet-vs-tadeusz-rozewicz.html</ref> Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] paraphrased a line from Rozewicz's "Draft of a Modern Love Poem" in his 2007 film ''[[Encounters at the End of the World]]'', observing that "For me, the best description of hunger is a description of bread. A poet said that once, I think."<ref>{{cite web|title=Script of Encounters at the End of the World|url=https://www.scripts.com/script/encounters_at_the_end_of_the_world_7644|publisher=scripts.com|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref> In 2008, [[mainstream]] Slovenian band [[Dan D]] remade the Niet's song for what was to become one of the 2008 top hits on Slovenian radio stations.<ref>http://www.rockline.si/podrobnosti-izvajalca/dan-d-491</ref>
