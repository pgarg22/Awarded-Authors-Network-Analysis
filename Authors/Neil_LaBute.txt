==Early life==
LaBute was born in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], the son of Marian, a hospital receptionist, and Richard LaBute, a long-haul truck driver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29LaBute-t.html?pagewanted=2|work=The New York Times|title=Neil LaBute Has a Thing About Beauty|first=Pat|last=Jordan|date=March 29, 2009| access-date=May 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="bookref1"/> LaBute is of [[French Canadian]], English, and Irish ancestry,<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=Bigsby|first=C.W.E.|title=Neil LaBute: stage and cinema|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|pages=2, 235|isbn=0-521-88254-0}}</ref> and was raised in [[Spokane, Washington]]. He studied theater at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), where he joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. At BYU he also met actor [[Aaron Eckhart]], who would later play leading roles in several of his films. He produced a number of plays that pushed the envelope of what was acceptable at the conservative religious university, some of which were shut down after their premieres. However, he also was honored as one of the "most promising undergraduate playwrights" at the BYU theater department's annual awards.<ref>''People in the arts'',

==Career==
===Early career and success===
"Neil LaBute burst onto the American theater scene in 1989 with his controversial debut Filthy Talk for Troubled Times."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/filthy-talk-for-troubled-times-neil-labute/1110906744|title=Filthy Talk for Troubled Times: And Other Plays&#124;Paperback|first=Barnes &|last=Noble|website=Barnes & Noble}}</ref> His interest in the film industry came with a viewing of ''[[The Soft Skin (film)|The Soft Skin]]'' (''La Peau Douce'' 1964), said the director to [[Robert K. Elder]] in a 2011 interview for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1556528256|title=The Film That Changed My Life: 30 Directors on Their Epiphanies in the Dark|first=Robert K.|last=Elder|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|via=Amazon}}</ref>
<blockquote>It exposed me, probably in the earliest way, to "Hey, I could do that." I've never been one to love the camera or even to be as drawn to it as I am to the human aspect of it, and I think it was a film that speaks in a very simple way of here's a way that you can tell a story on film in human terms. It was the kind of film that made me go, "I could do this; I want to tell stories that are like this and told in this way." And so it was altering for me in that way, in its simplicity or deceptive simplicity.<ref>LaBute, Neil. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p2.48. Print.</ref></blockquote>

In 1993, he returned to [[Brigham Young University]] to premiere his play ''[[In the Company of Men]]'', for which he received an award from the [[Association for Mormon Letters]]. He taught drama and film at [[IPFW]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] in the early 1990s where he adapted and filmed the play, shot over two weeks and costing $25,000, beginning his career as a film director. The film won the Filmmakers Trophy at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and major awards and nominations at the [[Deauville Film Festival]], the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay|Independent Spirit Awards]], the Thessaloniki Film Festival, the [[Society of Texas Film Critics Awards]] and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].

''[[In the Company of Men]]'' portrays two businessmen (one played by Eckhart) cruelly plotting to romance and emotionally destroy a deaf woman. His next film ''[[Your Friends & Neighbors]]'' (1998), with an ensemble cast including Eckhart and [[Ben Stiller]], earned an [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|R-rating]] for its portrayal of the sex lives of three yuppie couples in the big city.

His play ''[[Bash: Latter-Day Plays]]'' is a set of three short plays (''Iphigenia in Orem'', ''A Gaggle of Saints'', and ''Medea Redux'') depicting essentially good [[Latter-day Saints]] doing disturbing and violent things.<ref name=nyt/> It ran Off-Broadway at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre in 1999. ''Medea Redux'' is a one-person performance by [[Calista Flockhart]].<ref name=biotimes/><ref name=nyt>Brantley, Ben.

===Early 21st century===
In 2001, LaBute wrote and directed the play ''[[The Shape of Things]]'', which premièred in London, featuring film actors [[Paul Rudd]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]. It was turned into a film in 2003 with the same cast and director. Set in a small university town in the American Midwest, it focuses on four young students who become emotionally and romantically involved with each other, questioning the nature of art and the lengths to which people will go for love. Weisz's character manipulates Rudd's character into changing everything about himself and discarding his friends in order to become more attractive to her. She even pretends to fall in love with him, prompting an offer of marriage, whereupon she cruelly exposes and humiliates him before an audience, announcing that he has simply been an "art project" for her [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] [[thesis]]. Also the same year, he started Pretty Pictures with a first look deal at USA Films.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dana Harris,Cathy|last2=Harris|first2=Dana|last3=Dunkley|first3=Cathy|date=May 14, 2001|title=Pretty shingle inks first-look deal|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/pretty-shingle-inks-first-look-deal-1117799269/|access-date=April 11, 2021|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref>

LaBute's 2002 play ''[[The Mercy Seat (play)|The Mercy Seat]]'' was a theatrical response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref>Salamon, Julie.

Expecting that his family believes that he was killed in the towers' collapse, he contemplates using the tragedy to run away and start a new life with his lover. Starring [[Liev Schreiber]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], the play was a commercial and critical success.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/theater/theater-review-yes-he-survived-sept-11-but-what-s-in-it-for-him.html] Ben Brantley, ''THEATER REVIEW: Yes, He Survived Sep 11, bu What's in It for Him?'', The New York Times, December 19, 2002</ref> While hesitant to term ''The Mercy Seat'' "[[Political drama|political theater]]", Labute said, "I refer to this play in the printed introduction as a kind of emotional terrorism that we wage on those we profess to love." He dedicated this edition to [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]], in response to Hare's "straightforward, thoughtful, probing work".<ref>{{cite news|last=Baitz|first=Jon Robin|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/83/articles/2560|title=Neil Labute|work=[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]]|date=Spring 2003|access-date=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

His next play, ''[[reasons to be pretty]]'', played [[Off-Broadway]] from May 14 to July 5, 2008, in a production by [[MCC Theater]] at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. It went on Broadway in 2009, with previews at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] beginning March 13, and its opening on April 2.

===2010–present===
In 2010, LaBute directed ''[[Death at a Funeral (2010 film)|Death at a Funeral]]'', a remake of a 2007 British film of the same name. It was written by Dean Craig (who also wrote the original screenplay) and starred [[Chris Rock]]. Throughout the decade, various productions of his existing works were mounted as he continued to produce new material. He wrote new scenes and an introduction for the [[Chicago Shakespeare Theater]] production of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] which ran from April 7 to June 6, 2010. LaBute framed the classic play in overtly metatheatrical terms, adding a lesbian romance subplot. His short play, ''The Unimaginable'', premiered as part of the Terror 2010 season at the [[Southwark Playhouse]] in London, UK from October 12–31, 2010.

LaBute's first produced play, ''Filthy Talk for Troubled Times'' (1989) — a series of biting exchanges between two "everyman" characters in a bar – was staged from June 3–5, 2010 by [[MCC Theater]] as a benefit for MCC's Playwrights' Coalition and their commitment to developing new work. LaBute also directed the reading. Originally when it premiered in New York City at the Westside Dance Project, "[legend] has it... that  one unimpressed member of the audience shouted: "Kill the playwright!"" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/filthy-talk-for-troubled-times-at-basic-mountain-edinburgh-festival-qjnx92d7wtk|title=Filthy Talk for Troubled Times at Basic Mountain, Edinburgh Festival|first=Allan|last=Radcliffe|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref>

It ran through March 6. It featured [[Tracee Chimo]], [[David Duchovny]], [[John Earl Jelks]], and [[Amanda Peet]].<ref>[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Coverage_THE_BREAK_OF_NOON_Opening_Night_Curtain_Call_Party_2010] ''The Break of Noon'' Opening Night, broadwayworld.com</ref>

LaBute took part in the [[Bush Theatre]]'s 2011 project ''[[Sixty Six Books]]'', for which he wrote a piece based upon a book of the [[King James Bible]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/biography/writers/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704090950/http://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/biography/writers/ |archive-date=July 4, 2011 }}</ref> In 2012, he joined the Chicago-based storefront theatre company, ''Profiles Theatre'' as a Resident Artist.<ref>[http://www.profilestheatre.org/season.html] ''Season (2012)'' profilestheatre.org</ref> ''The Way We Get By'' opened Off-Broadway at the [[Second Stage Theatre]] on May 19, 2015, starring [[Amanda Seyfried]] and Thomas Sadoski, with direction by Leigh Silverman.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/the-way-we-get-by-with-amanda-seyfried-and-thomas-sadoski-opens-tonight-349363] Olivia Clement, ''The Way We Get By with Amanda Seyfried and Thomas Sadoski Opens Tonight'', playbill.com, May 19, 2015</ref>

In an interview with Screen Comment's Sam Weisberg, he said: "I have had a lot of people direct my material for the theater, but I haven't had anyone do my work on film. I was excited by what would be brought to it. It was great to have someone else in there that you could trust visually and intellectually and emotionally to make something that was respectful of the material but also creative."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weisberg |first1=Sam |title=New York playwright and filmmaker Neil Labute opens up about "Some Girls" |url=https://screencomment.com/2013/06/neil-labute-interview|publisher=Screen Comment}}</ref>

==Critical response==
Critics have responded to his plays as having a [[misanthrope|misanthropic]] tone.<ref>[http://www.broadwayplaypubl.com/IN%20A%20DARK.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704110314/http://www.broadwayplaypubl.com/IN%20A%20DARK.htm |date=July 4, 2008 }}  broadwayplaypubl.com</ref><ref>[http://www.hackwriters.com/shapeofthings.htm]  hackwriters.com</ref><ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5163405] 
npr.org</ref> Rob Weinert-Kendt in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' referred to LaBute as "American theater's reigning misanthrope".<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-08/theater/jailbait-evokes-a-more-human-neil-labute/] ''Jailbait Evokes a More Human Neil LaBute'', Village Voice, April 7, 2009</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that critics labeled him a misanthrope on the release of his film ''[[Your Friends & Neighbors]]'' because of the film's strong misanthropic plot and characters. Britain's ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper in May 2008 dubbed him "America's misanthrope par excellence".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Alice|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/first-night-fat-pig-trafalgar-studios-london-835324.html|title=First Night: Fat Pig, Trafalgar Studios, London|work=[[The Independent]]|date=May 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145356/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/first-night-fat-pig-trafalgar-studios-london-835324.html|archive-date=December 2, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Citing the misanthropic tone of the plot in the films, ''In the Company of Men'', ''Your Friends & Neighbors'' and ''The Shape of Things,'' film critic Daniel Kimmel identified a pattern running through LaBute's work of being that the unlikeable, main antagonists of those three films end up getting away with their lying, scheming and mid-deeds, coming out on top of all the other characters as the real winners of those stories by quoting: "Neil LaBute is a misanthrope who assumes that only callous and evil people, who use and abuse others, can survive in this world." Critics labeled him a [[misogynist]] after the release of ''In the Company of Men''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29LaBute-t.html?pagewanted=3&ref=theater] ''Neil LaBute has a Thing About Beauty'', The New York Times, March 25, 2009</ref>

==Honors==
In 2013, LaBute was named one of the winners of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]' Arts and Letters Awards in Literature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artsandletters.org/press_releases/2013literature.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313042256/http://www.artsandletters.org/press_releases/2013literature.php |archive-date=March 13, 2015 }} ''Press Release''.  artsandletters.org</ref>

==Style==
LaBute's style is very language-oriented. His work is terse, rhythmic, and highly colloquial. His style bears similarity to one of his favorite playwrights, [[David Mamet]]. LaBute even shares some similar themes with Mamet including gender relations, political correctness, and masculinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterpro.com/labute.html|first=Alice|last=Griffin|publisher=TheaterPro.com|title=Neil LaBute|access-date=December 12, 2013}}</ref>
