[[Image:JohnMFord as DrMike ddb176.jpg|thumb|Dr. Mike at [[Minicon]] 38 in 2003]]
'''John Milo "Mike" Ford''' (April 10, 1957 – September 25, 2006) was an American science fiction and [[fantasy]] writer, [[game designer]], and poet.

A contributor to several [[online discussion]]s,<ref name="makl060925"/> Ford composed poems, often improvised, in both complicated forms and [[blank verse]]; he also wrote pastiches and [[parody|parodies]] of many other authors and styles. At [[Minicon]] and other [[science fiction convention]]s he would perform "Ask Dr. Mike", giving humorous answers to scientific and other questions in a lab coat before a whiteboard.<ref name="shetintro" />

==Life==
Ford was born in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], and raised in [[Whiting, Indiana]].<ref name=vezner/> In the mid-1970s he attended [[Indiana University Bloomington]], where he was active in the IU [[science fiction club]] and [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] (using the name Miles Atherton de Grey); while there, he published his first short story "This, Too, We Reconcile" in the May 1976 ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]''.<ref>{{cite book

Ford left IU and moved to New York to work on the newly founded ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'',<ref name=vezner /> where, starting in mid-1978, he published poetry, fiction, articles, and game reviews. Although his last non-fiction appeared there in September 1981, he was tenth most frequent contributor for the 1977–2002 period.<ref name="asim0304"/> About 1990, he moved to [[Minneapolis]].<ref name=vezner /> In addition to writing, he worked at various times as a hospital orderly, computer consultant, [[slush pile]] reader, and [[copy editing|copy editor]].<ref name="makl051225"/>

Ford suffered from complications related to [[diabetes]] since childhood and also had [[kidney|renal]] dysfunction which required [[dialysis]] and, in 2000, a [[kidney transplant]], which improved his quality of life considerably. He was found dead from natural causes in his Minneapolis home on September 25, 2006,<ref name="makl060925"/> by his partner since the mid-1990s, [[Elise Matthesen]].<ref name="vezner"/> He was a prominent member of the ''Friends of the [[Minneapolis Public Library]]'', which established a ''John M. Ford Book Endowment'' after his death with the donations to be used as [[interest]]-generating capital for yearly purchase of new books.<ref name="hyim061002"/>

==Work==
Ford's works were varied in setting and style.<ref name="sleight" /> Several were of the [[Bildungsroman]] (coming-of-age) type: in ''[[Web of Angels]]'', ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', ''Princes of the Air'', ''Growing Up Weightless'', and ''The Last Hot Time'', Ford wrote variations on the theme of growing up, learning about one's world and one's place in it, and taking responsibility for it – which involves taking on the power and wisdom to influence events, to help make the world a better place.

Ford spent part of his career working in other people's universes. His 1983 book ''[[The Klingons: A Sourcebook and Character Generation Supplement|The Klingons]]'' for [[FASA]]'s [[Star Trek: The Role Playing Game|''Star Trek'' role-playing game]] influenced later Paramount productions.<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|121}} He also wrote a comedic novel set in the Star Trek universe called ''[[How Much for Just the Planet?]]'', where the ''Enterprise'' crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet whose unhappy colonists defend their peace in inventive and farcial ways. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage [[music theater|musicals]].<ref name="sleight" /> 

Ford authored the award-winning adventure ''[[The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues]]'' (1985) for [[West End Games]]' ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'' role-playing game.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|189}}

Ford used a variety of styles to suit the world, characters, and situations he chose to write about. Author and critic [[John Clute]] wrote in the 1993  ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' that "two decades into his career, there remains some sense that JMF remains unwilling or unable to create a definitive style or mode; but his originality is evident, a shifting feisty energy informs almost everything he writes, and that career is still young."<ref>Clute, John; Nicholls, Peter (1993). ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. London: Orbit Books.</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2019}}

Ford's was much respected by his fellow writers, editors, critics and fans.<ref name="sleight" /> [[Robert Jordan]], Ford's lifelong close friend, called Ford "the best writer in America – bar none." [[Neil Gaiman]] called Ford "my best critic … the best writer I knew." [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]] said "Most normal people had the slight sense that something large and super-intelligent and trans-human had sort of flown over ... There would be a point where basically the plot would become so knotted and complex he would lose all of us."<ref name=vezner />

After his death, almost all of Ford's work was out-of-print. The rights to his work had reverted to his legal heirs, but no-one had managed to get in touch with them. After an investigation by a journalist, Isaac Butler, Ford's editors at [[Tor Books]] were able to reconnect with his family, and in November 2019 an agreement was reached to reissue all his published works, starting in 2020 with ''The Dragon Waiting.''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2019/11/john-ford-science-fiction-fantasy-books.html |title=The Disappearance of John M.
