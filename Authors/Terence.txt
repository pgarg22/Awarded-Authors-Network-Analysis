'''Publius Terentius Afer''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|ʃ|i|ə|s|,_|-|ʃ|ə|s}}; {{circa|195/185}} – {{circa|159? BC}}), better known in English as '''Terence''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛr|ə|n|s}}), was a [[Roman Africans|Roman African]] [[playwright]] during the [[Roman Republic]]. His comedies were performed for the first time around 170–160 BC. Terentius Lucanus, a Roman [[Roman Senate|senator]], brought Terence to Rome as a slave, educated him and later on, impressed by his abilities, [[manumission|freed]] him. Terence abruptly died, around the age of 25, likely in Greece or on his way back to [[Rome]], due to shipwreck or disease.<ref name="Kamm 2014">{{Cite web|last=Kamm|first=Antony|last2=Graham|first2=Abigail|date=2014|title=THE ROMANS|url=https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9781138776685/chapter8.php|access-date=2020-11-10|website=routledgetextbooks.com}}</ref> He was supposedly on his way to explore and find more plots to base his comedies on. His plays were heavily used to learn to speak and write in [[Latin]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance|Renaissance Period]], and in some instances were imitated by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

One famous quotation by Terence reads: "''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''", or "I am human, and I think nothing human is alien to me."<ref>More literally, "I am a human being; of that which is human, I think nothing estranged from me."</ref>  This appeared in his play ''[[Heauton Timorumenos]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricord  |first= Frederick W. |title= The Self-Tormentor (Heautontimorumenos) from the Latin of Publius Terentius Afer with More English Songs from Foreign Tongues |place=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's  |year=1885 |via= Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/stream/selftormentorhea00rico#page/24/mode/2up |page= 25|access-date= 22 January 2018 }}.

== Biography ==

Terence's date of birth is disputed; [[Aelius Donatus]], in his incomplete ''Commentum Terenti'', considers the year 185 BC to be the year Terentius was born;<ref>''Aeli Donati Commentum Terenti, accedunt Eugraphi Commentum et Scholia Bembina'', ed. Paul Wessner, 3 Volumes, Leipzig, 1902, 1905, 1908.</ref> [[Fenestella]], on the other hand, states that he was born ten years earlier, in 195 BC.<ref>G. D' Anna, ''Sulla vita suetoniana di Terenzio'', RIL, 1956, pp. 31-46, 89-90.</ref> Other scholars have also stated his birth to be in the year 190 BC.<ref>Martin, T.R. (2012). Ancient Rome: From Romulus to Justinian. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> While no one knows for certain, it is likely that it occurred somewhere between the years of 195 BC and 185 BC.

Terence may have been born in or near [[Carthage]] or in [[Greek Italy]] to a woman taken to Carthage as a slave. Terence's [[cognomen]] ''Afer'' suggests he lived in the territory of the Libyan tribe called by the Romans [[Afri]] near Carthage prior to being brought to Rome as a slave.<ref>Tenney Frank, "On Suetonius' Life of Terence." ''The American Journal of Philology'', Vol. 54, No. 3 (1933), pp. 269-273.</ref>

However, it is possible that ancient biographers' reports that Terence was born in Africa are an inference from his name and not independent biographical information.<ref name="OCD">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Brown|first=Peter G. M.|title=Terence|encyclopedia=Oxford Classical Dictionary|edition=4|pages=1440–1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012}}</ref><ref name="goldberg2013">{{cite book|last=Terence|title=Hecyra|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|editor-last=Goldberg|editor-first=Sander M.|pages=10–11}}</ref> This inference is based on the fact that the term was used in two different ways during the republican era. During Terence's lifetime, it was used to refer to non-Carthaginian [[Berber people|Berbers]], with the term ''Punicus'' reserved for the Carthaginians.<ref>H. J. Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'', 1954.</ref> Subsequently, after the [[Third Punic War|destruction of Carthage]] in 146 BC, it was used to refer to anyone from the land of the ''Afri'' (that is, the ancient Roman [[province of Africa]], mostly corresponding to today's [[Tunisia]] and its surroundings). The cognomen ''Afer'' "[[North Africans|[North] African]]" may indicate that Terence hailed from [[ancient Libya]],<ref>[[Michael von Albrecht]], ''Geschichte der römischen Literatur'', Volume 1, Bern, 1992.</ref> and was therefore of [[Berber people|Berber]] descent.<ref>"...the playwright Terence, who reached Rome as the slave of a senator in the second century BC, was a Berber", Suzan Raven, ''Rome in Africa'', Routledge, 1993, p.122; {{ISBN|0-415-08150-5}}.</ref> However, such names did not necessarily denote origin, and there were Romans who had this cognomen who were not Africans, such as [[Domitius Afer]]. Consequently, it is not known with certainty whether Terence was given the cognomen ''Afer'' as denoting his origin, or if it was solely based on later bibliographers' reports based on the terminology of their day.

According to his traditional biography, he was sold to P. Terentius Lucanus,<ref>[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith, William]] (editor); ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2574.html "Lucanus, Terentius"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420033107/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2574.html |date=2011-04-20 }}, [[Boston]], 1870.</ref> a Roman [[Roman Senate|senator]], who educated him and later on, impressed by Terence's abilities, [[manumission|freed]] him. Terence then took the [[Roman naming conventions|''nomen'']] "Terentius," which is the origin of the present form.

Based on the writings of the Roman historian [[Suetonius]], Terence was described to be of "moderate height, slender, and of dark complexion," additionally leaving a daughter who subsequently went on to marry a Roman knight.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Suetonius • Life of Terence|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/de_Poetis/Terence*.html|access-date=2020-11-10|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref> Additionally, Terence was a member of the so-called [[Scipionic Circle]].

When he was about the age of 25, Terence travelled to [[Hellenistic Greece|Greece]] to gather materials for his plays and never returned. It is mostly believed that Terence died during the journey, but this cannot be confirmed. Before his disappearance, he exhibited six comedies which are still in existence. According to some ancient writers, he died at sea due to shipwreck or disease. It is possible, however, that the fateful voyage to Greece was a speculative explanation of why he wrote so few plays inferred from Terence's complaint in ''Eunuchus'' 41–3 about the limited materials at his disposal.<ref name="goldberg2013" />

[[File:Houghton Inc 473 - Terence, Works.jpg|thumb|1496 edition of Terence's ''Works'']]
Like [[Plautus]], Terence adapted [[Greek theatre|Greek plays]] from the late phases of [[Greek comedy|Attic comedy]]. Unlike Plautus though, Terence's way of writing his comedies was more in a simple conversational Latin, pleasant and direct, while less visually humorous to watch.<ref>Knox, P.E., and J.C. McKeown (2013). The Oxford Anthology of Roman Literature. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> It has also been said that Terence made better utilization of his plots than Plautus, and his purer language and characterizations in his comedies can be attributed to the lack of popularity during his day.<ref name="Kamm 2014"/> [[Aelius Donatus]], [[Jerome]]'s teacher, is the earliest surviving commentator on Terence's work. Terence's popularity throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance is attested to by the numerous manuscripts containing part or all of his plays; the scholar [[Claudia Villa]] has estimated that 650 [[manuscript]]s containing Terence's work date from after AD 800. The [[mediaeval]] playwright [[Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] claims to have written her plays so that learned men had a [[Christianity|Christian]] alternative to reading the pagan plays of Terence, while the reformer [[Martin Luther]] not only quoted Terence frequently to tap into his insights into all things human but also recommended his comedies for the instruction of children in school.<ref>See, e.g., in ''Luther's Works: American Edition'', vol. 40:317; 47:228.</ref>

Terence's six plays are:
* [[Andria (comedy)|''Andria'' (''The Girl from Andros'')]] (166 BC)
* [[Hecyra|''Hecyra'' (''The Mother-in-Law'')]] (165 BC)
* [[Heauton Timorumenos|''Heauton Timorumenos'' (''The Self-Tormentor'')]] (163 BC)
* ''[[Phormio (play)|Phormio]]'' (161 BC)
* ''[[Eunuchus]]'' (161 BC)
* [[Adelphoe|''Adelphoe'' (''The Brothers'')]] (160 BC)

The first printed edition of Terence appeared in [[Strasbourg]] in 1470, while the first certain post-antique performance of one of Terence's plays, ''[[Andria (comedy)|Andria]]'', took place in [[Florence]] in 1476. There is evidence, however, that Terence was performed much earlier. The short dialogue ''[[Terentius et delusor]]'' was probably written to be performed as an introduction to a Terentian performance in the 9th century (possibly earlier).

==Cultural legacy==
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Comedies of Terence 55v.jpg|thumbnail|right|Mid-12th century illustrated Latin manuscript of Terence's ''Comedies'' from [[St Albans Abbey]], now held at the [[Bodleian Library]]]]
Due to his clear and entertaining language, Terence's works were heavily used by monasteries and convents during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. [[Scribe]]s often learned Latin through the meticulous copying of Terence's texts. Priests and nuns often learned to speak Latin through reenactment of Terence's plays, thereby learning both Latin and Gregorian chants. Although Terence's plays often dealt with pagan material, the quality of his language promoted the copying and preserving of his text by the church. The preservation of Terence through the church enabled his work to influence much of later Western drama.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holloway|first1=Julia Bolton|title=Sweet New Style: Brunetto Latino, Dante Alighieri, Geoffrey Chaucer, Essays, 1981-2005|date=1993|url=http://www.umilta.net/GodsPlenty.html|access-date=22 October 2014}}</ref>

Pietro Alighieri's Commentary to the ''Commedia'' states that his father took the title from Terence's plays and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] copied out in his own hand all of Terence's ''Comedies'' and Apuleius' writings in manuscripts that are now in the [[Laurentian Library]]. Two of the earliest English comedies, ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' and ''[[John Still#Gammer Gurton's Needle|Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'', are thought to parody Terence's plays. [[Montaigne]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Molière]] cite and imitate him.

Terence's plays were a standard part of the Latin curriculum of the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] period. [[President of the United States]] [[John Adams]] once wrote to [[John Quincy Adams|his son]], "Terence is remarkable, for good morals, good taste, and good Latin...His language has simplicity and an elegance that make him proper to be accurately studied as a model."<ref>''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]'' by [[David McCullough]], Simon and Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 2001. Pg 259. {{ISBN|978-0-684-81363-9}}</ref> American playwright [[Thornton Wilder]] based his novel ''[[The Woman of Andros]]'' on Terence's ''[[Andria (comedy)|Andria]]''.

The works of Terence had often been read not only in Roman schools years after his death, but also in schools around Europe for centuries after due to the proficient and skillful use of language that were in his plays. Terence's works, along with Plautus', were so well appreciated and revered, that even Shakespeare centuries later studied their works in his schooling and certainly knew them through and throughout.<ref>Knox, P.E., and J.C. McKeown. 2013. The Oxford Anthology of Roman Literature. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>

Due to his cognomen Afer, Terence has long been identified with Africa and heralded as the first poet of the African diaspora by generations of writers, including [[Juan Latino]], [[Phyllis Wheatley]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Maya Angelou]]. Two of his plays were produced in [[Denver]] with black actors.

Questions as to whether Terence received assistance in writing or was not the actual author have been debated over the ages, as described in the 1911 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]:''
<blockquote>[In a prologue to one of his plays, Terence] meets the charge of receiving assistance in the composition of his plays by claiming as a great honour the favour which he enjoyed with those who were the favorites of the Roman people. But the gossip, not discouraged by Terence, lived and throve; it crops up in [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], and the ascription of the plays to Scipio had the honour to be accepted by [[Montaigne]] and rejected by [[Diderot]].<ref>{{EB1911 |inline=1|first=William Young |last=Sellar |first2=Ernest |last2=Harrison |wstitle=Terence |volume=26 |page=640}}</ref></blockquote>
