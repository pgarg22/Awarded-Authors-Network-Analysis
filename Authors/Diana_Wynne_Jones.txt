'''Diana Wynne Jones''' (16 August 1934 – 26 March 2011)<ref name=guardian/> was an English novelist, poet, academic, literary critic, and short story writer. She principally wrote [[fantasy]] and [[speculative fiction]] novels for [[children's literature|children]] and [[young adult literature|young adults]]. Although usually described as fantasy, some of her work also incorporates [[science fiction]] themes and elements of [[Literary realism|realism]]. Jones' work often explores themes of [[time travel]] and [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel]] or multiple universes. Some of her better-known works are the [[Chrestomanci]] series, the [[Dalemark Quartet|Dalemark]] series, the three ''[[Howl's Moving Castle|Moving Castle]]'' novels, ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', and ''[[The Tough Guide to Fantasyland]]''.

Jones has been cited as an inspiration and muse for several fantasy and science fiction authors including [[Philip Pullman]], [[Terry Pratchett]], [[Penelope Lively]], [[Robin McKinley]], [[Dina Rabinovitch]], [[Megan Whalen Turner]], [[J.K. Rowling]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], with Gaiman describing her as "quite simply the best writer for children of her generation".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wynne Jones |first1=Diana |title=Reflections |date=April 2012 |publisher=[[David Fickling Books]] |location=Foreword |isbn=978-0062219893 |page=viii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKnjPrGFA2YC&q=%E2%80%9C|access-date=7 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=McKinley |first1=Robin |title=Fame.

She was twice a finalist for the [[Hugo Award]], nominated fourteen times for the [[Locus Award]], seven times for the [[Mythopoeic Award]] (which she won twice), twice for a [[British Fantasy Award]] (won in 1999), and twice for a [[World Fantasy Award]], which she would also win in 2007.

==Early life and marriage==

Jones was born in London, the daughter of Marjorie (née Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were teachers.<ref name=independent /> When war was announced, shortly after her fifth birthday, she was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to Wales, and thereafter moved several times, including periods in the [[Lake District]], in [[York]], and back in London. In 1943 her family finally settled in [[Thaxted, Essex]], where her parents worked running an educational conference centre.<ref name=independent>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/diana-wynne-jones-doyenne-of-fantasy-writers-whose-books-for-children-paved-the-way-for-jk-rowling-2257675.html |title=Diana Wynne Jones: Doyenne of fantasy writers whose books for children paved the way for JK Rowling |last=Butler |first=Charlie |newspaper=The Independent |date=31 March 2011 |access-date=3 June 2013}}</ref> There, Jones and her two younger sisters Isobel (later Professor [[Isobel Armstrong]], the literary critic) and [[Ursula Jones |Ursula]] (later an actress and a children's writer) spent a childhood left chiefly to their own devices. 

After attending [[Friends' School, Saffron Walden]], she studied English at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] in [[Oxford]], where she attended lectures by both [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] before graduating in 1956.<ref name=parsons>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/goingout/2003/03/05/books.shtml |title=Wrestling with an angel |last=Parsons |first=Caron |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=Going Out in Bristol |date=27 March 2003 |access-date=3 June 2013}}</ref> In the same year she married John Burrow, a scholar of [[medieval literature]], with whom she had three sons, Richard, Michael and Colin. After a brief period in London, in 1957 the couple returned to Oxford, where they stayed until moving to [[Bristol]] in 1976.<ref name=independent />

According to her autobiography, Jones decided she was an [[atheist]] when she was a child.<ref name=autobiog/>

==Career==
Jones started writing during the mid-1960s "mostly to keep my sanity", when the youngest of her three children was about two years old and the family lived in a house owned by an Oxford college. Besides the children, she felt harried by the crises of adults in the household: a sick husband, a mother-in-law, a sister, and a friend with daughter.<ref name=changeover/> Her first book was a novel for adults published by Macmillan in 1970, entitled ''Changeover''. It originated as the [[British Empire]] was divesting colonies; she recalled in 2004 that it had "seemed like every month, we would hear that yet another small island or tiny country had been granted independence."<ref name=changeover/> ''Changeover'' is set in a fictional African colony during transition, and begins as a memo about the problem of how to "mark changeover" ceremonially is misunderstood to be about the threat of a terrorist named Mark Changeover. It is a farce with a large cast of characters, featuring government, police, and army bureaucracies; sex, politics, and news. In 1965, when [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesia declared independence unilaterally]] (one of the last colonies and not tiny), "I felt as if the book were coming true as I wrote it."<ref name=changeover>Jones, D. W. (2004). "Introduction: The Origins of Changeover". ''Changeover'' [1970]. London: Moondust Books. {{ISBN|0-9547498-0-4}}.</ref>

Jones' books range from amusing slapstick situations to sharp social observation (''Changeover'' is both), to witty parody of literary forms. Foremost amongst the latter are ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' and its fictional companion-piece ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', which provide a merciless (though not unaffectionate) critique of formulaic sword-and-sorcery epics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books are frequently compared to the works of Diana Wynne Jones. Many of her earlier children's books were out of print in recent years, but have now been re-issued for the young audience whose interest in fantasy and reading was spurred by ''Harry Potter''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/parents/story/0,3605,941676,00.html |title=Wynne-ing ways: Author of the month Diana Wynne Jones |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 April 2003 |author-link=Dina Rabinovitch |last=Rabinovitch |first=Dina |access-date=16 August 2014}}</ref><ref>[[Charles de Lint|de Lint, Charles]] (January 2000).

Jones' works are also compared to those of [[Robin McKinley]] and [[Neil Gaiman]]. She was friends with both McKinley<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robinmckinleysblog.com/2010/09/23/fame-sort-of/ |title=fame. sort of. |author=McKinley, Robin |work=Robin McKinley: Days in the Life* *with footnotes |publisher=Robinmckinleysblog.com |date=23 September 2010 |access-date=16 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116074725/http://robinmckinleysblog.com/2010/09/23/fame-sort-of/ |archive-date=16 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Gaiman, and Jones and Gaiman were fans of each other's work; she dedicated her 1993 novel ''Hexwood'' to him after something he said in conversation inspired a key part of the plot.<ref>Gaiman, Neil [date unknown].

For ''[[Charmed Life (novel)|Charmed Life]]'', the first Chrestomanci novel, Jones won the 1978 [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a once-in-a-lifetime award by ''The Guardian'' newspaper that is judged by a panel of children's writers.<ref name=relaunch/> Three times she was a commended runner-up{{efn|name=HC}} for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book: for ''[[Dogsbody (novel)|Dogsbody]]'' (1975), ''Charmed Life'' (1977), and the fourth Chrestomanci book ''The Lives of Christopher Chant'' (1988).<ref name=ccsu/> She won the [[Mythopoeic Fantasy Award]], children's section, in 1996 for ''[[The Crown of Dalemark]]'' (concluding that series) and in 1999 for ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]''; in four other years she was a finalist for that annual literary award by the [[Mythopoeic Society]].<ref name="SFawards-dwjones"/>{{efn|name=mythopoeic}}

The 1986 novel ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'' was inspired by a boy at a school she was visiting, who asked her to write a book called The Moving Castle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Diana Wynne|title=Howl's Moving Castle|url=https://archive.org/details/howlsmovingcastl00jone|url-access=registration|date=1986|publisher=New York : Greenwillow Books|isbn=9780784824849}}</ref> It was published first by Greenwillow in the U.S., where it was a runner-up for the annual [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award]] in children's fiction.<ref name=bghb/> In 2004, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] made the Japanese-language animated movie ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'', which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Howl's Moving Castle Awards |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/awards?ref_=tt_awd |website=IMDb |publisher=IMDb.com, Inc. |access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref> A version dubbed in English was released in the UK and US in 2005, with the voice of Howl performed by [[Christian Bale]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/fullcredits "Howl's Moving Castle (2004): Full Cast & Crew"].

Jones' book on clichés in fantasy fiction, ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' (nonfiction), has a cult following among writers and critics, despite initially being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history. It was reissued in the UK, and has been reissued in the United States in 2006 by [[Firebird Books]]. The Firebird edition has additional material and a completely new design, including a new [[map]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Tough Guide to Fantasyland by Diana Wynne Jones: 9780142407226 {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/295676/the-tough-guide-to-fantasyland-by-diana-wynne-jones/|access-date=4 August 2020|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

{{efn|name=HC |1=
Today there are usually eight books on the Carnegie shortlist.
According to CCSU, some runners-up through 2002 were Commended (from 1955) or Highly Commended (from 1966); the latter distinction became approximately annual in 1979. There were about 160 commendations of both kinds in 48 years including two for 1975, three for 1977, and six for 1988.

''Fire and Hemlock'' was one of six finalists for the Mythopoeic Award in 1986, when there was a single Fantasy award, and Jones was five times one of four or five finalists in the Children's category after dual fiction awards were introduced in 1992.
