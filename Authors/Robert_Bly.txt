'''Robert Elwood Bly''' (December 23, 1926 – November 21, 2021) was an American poet, essayist, activist and leader of the [[mythopoetic men's movement]]. His best-known prose book is ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' (1990),<ref name=brit>{{cite web |title=Iron John: A Book About Men |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294469/Iron-John-A-Book-About-Men |publisher=[[Britannica.com]] }}</ref> which spent 62 weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]],<ref>{{cite news |title=What Do Men Want?

He won the 1968 [[National Book Award for Poetry]] for his book ''The Light Around the Body''.<ref name=nba1968/>

==Early life and education==
Bly was born in [[Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota]], the son of Alice Aws and Jacob Thomas Bly, who were of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] ancestry.<ref name="johnsen">{{cite web| last =Johnsen| first =Bill| title =The Natural World is a Spiritual House| work =Colloquium on Violence and Religion Annual Conference 2004| publisher =Girardian Reflections on the Lectionary| date =June 2004| url =http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/BJohnsenpaper.pdf| access-date =April 30, 2007| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070704074252/http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/BJohnsenpaper.pdf| archive-date =July 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=PwsRh7n4Q5AC&pg=PA11&dq=%22Jacob+Thomas+Bly+and+Alice+Aws+Bly%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ9_yU3Kz0AhXrm2oFHTl5DzMQ6AF6BAgGEAE]</ref> Following graduation from high school in 1944, he enlisted in the United States Navy, serving two years. After one year at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Minnesota]], he transferred to [[Harvard University]], joining other young persons who became known as writers: [[Donald Hall]], Will Morgan, [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[John Ashbery]], [[Harold Brodkey]], [[George Plimpton]] and [[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]]. He graduated in 1950 and spent the next few years in New York.

Beginning in 1954, Bly studied for two years at the [[University of Iowa]] at the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]], completing a master's degree in fine arts, along with [[W. D. Snodgrass]], [[Donald Justice]], and others. In 1956, he received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Grant]] to travel to [[Norway]] and translate [[Norwegian literature|Norwegian poetry]] into English. While there, he became acquainted with the work of a number of major international poets whose work was barely known in the United States. These included both Norwegians and writers from Spain, Latin America and elsewhere, among them [[Gunnar Ekelof]], [[Harry Martinson]], [[Georg Trakl]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Cesar Vallejo]], [[Rumi]], [[Hafez (poet)|Hafez]], [[Kabir]], and [[Mirabai]]. He also connected with some of his family's relations.

==Personal life==
Bly lived on a farm in Minnesota with his wife Carol (née McLean), whom he married in 1955, and their four children. [[Carol Bly]] was also a writer, winning awards for her short stories and novels. Robert and Carol divorced in 1979. Their daughter [[Mary Bly]] is a professor at [[Fordham University]] and author of romance novels.<ref name="nymag">{{cite web  | last = Garman  | first = Emma  | title =Love's Labors  | publisher = New York Magazine  | date = January 24–31, 2005  | url =http://www.eloisajames.com/articles/05_ny-mag.html  | access-date = February 7, 2007}}</ref> In 1980, Bly married Ruth Counsell.<ref name="johnsen"/> He was the stepfather to her two children.

==Career==
Bly's early collection of poems, ''Silence in the Snowy Fields,'' was published in 1962. Its plain, imagistic style had considerable influence on American verse of the next two decades.<ref>Gioia, Mason, and Schoerke, editors. ''Twentieth-Century American Poetics'', p. 260.</ref> The following year, he published "[[A Wrong Turning in American Poetry]]", an essay in which he argued that the vast majority of American poetry from 1917 to 1963 was lacking in soul and "inwardness" as a result of a focus on impersonality and an objectifying, intellectual view of the world. Bly believed this approach was instigated by the Modernists and formed the aesthetic of most post-World War II American poetry. He criticized the influence of American-born Modernists such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[William Carlos Williams]], and argued that American poetry needed to model itself on the more inward-looking work of European and South American poets like [[Pablo Neruda]], [[César Vallejo]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Antonio Machado]], and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. A ''Selected Poems'' translation of Rilke from the German, with Commentary by Bly, was published in 1981. ''Times Alone, Selected Poems of Antonio Machado'', with facing page Spanish/English translation, was published in 1983.

In 1966, Bly co-founded [[American Writers Against the Vietnam War]] and was among the leaders of the opposition to that war among writers. In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest", ''New York Post'', January 30, 1968.</ref> In his speech accepting the 1968 [[National Book Award]] for ''The Light Around the Body'',<ref name=nba1968>[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1968 "National Book Awards – 1968"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved March 3, 2012. (With acceptance speech by Bly and essay by Patrick Rosal from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)</ref> he announced that he would be contributing the $1000 prize to draft resistance organizations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bly|first=Robert|title=National Book Awards acceptance speech|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_rbly|website=National Book Foundation|access-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref>

During the sixties Bly aided the Bengali [[Hungryalist]] poets who faced anti-establishment trials at [[Kolkata]], India. Bly's 1970 poem, "The Teeth Mother Naked At Last," later collected in his book ''Sleepers Joining Hands'' (1973), is a major contribution to anti-war poetry of the Vietnam War era. During the 1970s, he published eleven books of poetry, essays, and translations. He celebrated the power of myth, [[India]]n [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] poetry, meditation, and storytelling. During the 1980s he published ''Loving a Woman in Two Worlds'', ''The Wingéd Life: Selected Poems and Prose of Thoreau,'' ''The Man in the Black Coat Turns,'' and ''A Little Book on the Human Shadow''.

Perhaps his most famous work is ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' (1990). This became an international bestseller and has been translated into many languages; it is credited with inspiring the [[Mythopoetic men's movement]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Bly has frequently conducted workshops for men, together with [[James Hillman]], [[Michael J. Meade]], and others, as well as workshops for men and women with [[Marion Woodman]]. He maintained a friendly correspondence with [[Clarissa Pinkola Estés]], author of ''Women Who Run With the Wolves''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Bly wrote ''The Maiden King: The Reunion of Masculine and Feminine'' with Marion Woodman. He published a poetry anthology titled ''The Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart'' (1992), with James Hillman and Michael Meade co-editing.

===Great Mother Conference===
In 1975, Bly organized a ''Great Mother Conference''. Throughout the nine-day event, poetry, music, and dance were practiced to examine human consciousness. The conference has been held annually; since 2003 in [[Nobleboro]], Maine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenwald|first1=John |title=John Rosenwald collection of Robert Bly Great Mother Conference materials, 1975-1978, 1980-1984, 1986-1987, 1990-1995, 2001-2002, 2004-2009|url=http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/mss081D.xml#a23|website=University of Minnesota Literary Manuscripts Collections, Manuscripts Division|access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> In the early years, one of its major themes was the goddess or "[[Gender of God|Great Mother]]," as she has been known throughout human history. Much of Bly's collection ''Sleepers Joining Hands'' (1973) is concerned with this theme. In the context of the Vietnam War, a focus on the divine feminine was seen as urgent and necessary. Since that time, the Conference has expanded its topics to consider a wide variety of poetic, mythological, and fairy tale traditions. In the 1980s and '90s there was much discussion among the conference community about the changes which contemporary men were going through, so "The New Father" was added to the Conference title.<ref>[https://greatmotherconference.org/ The Great Mother and New Father Conference: A Conference on the Mythopoetic Connection]</ref> Bly stopped attending after 2010.

==Awards and legacy==
Bly was the [[University of Minnesota]] Library's 2002 Distinguished Writer. He received the [[McKnight Foundation]]'s Distinguished Artist Award in 2000, and the [[Maurice English Poetry Award]] in 2002. He has published more than 40 collections of poetry, edited many others, and published translations of poetry and prose from such languages as [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]], [[Norwegian (language)|Norwegian]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]. His book ''The Night Abraham Called to the Stars'' was nominated for a [[Minnesota Book Award]]. He also edited the prestigious ''Best American Poetry 1999'' (Scribners).

In 2006 the [[University of Minnesota]] purchased Bly's archive, which contained more than 80,000 pages of handwritten manuscripts; a journal spanning nearly 50 years; notebooks of his "morning poems"; drafts of translations; hundreds of audio and videotapes, and correspondence with many writers such as [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], [[Donald Hall]] and [[James Dickey]]. The archive is housed at Elmer L. Andersen Library on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus. The university paid $775,000 from school funds and private donors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pw.org/content/university_minnesota_acquires_robert_bly_archive_775000 |title=University of Minnesota Acquires Robert Bly Archive for $775,000 |last= |first= |date=October 30, 2006 |website=Poets & Writers |access-date=November 21, 2021}}</ref>

In February 2008, Bly was named Minnesota's first [[poet laureate]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/arts/01arts-APOETLAUREAT_BRF.html?ref=arts|title=A Poet Laureate for Minnesota|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 1, 2008 |access-date=March 2, 2008}}</ref> In that year he also contributed a poem and an Afterword to ''From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright''. In February 2013, he was awarded the [[Robert Frost Medal]], a lifetime achievement recognition given by the [[Poetry Society of America]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 23, 2013|title=Announcing the 2013 Frost Medalist, Robert Bly - Poetry Society of America|url=http://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/poetry/blog/announcing_the_2013_frost_medali/|access-date=October 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523104843/http://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/poetry/blog/announcing_the_2013_frost_medali/|archive-date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Translation==
Bly's willingness to collaborate with others is especially evident in his extensive translation work. Working with people knowledgeable about the poet's native language, Bly applies his craft as a poet to creating a non-literal, poetic translation. The poets that interest him most embody his idea of "Leaping Poetry", explained in 1972's ''Leaping Poetry An Idea with Poems and Translations Chosen by Robert Bly''. The poets he chooses in the book as examples of this leaping poetry included [[Federico García Lorca]], Cesar Vallejo, Pablo Neruda, Rainer Maria Rilke and [[Tomas Tranströmer]]. He says:{{qb|quote=My idea, then, is that a great work of art often has at its center a long floating leap, around which the work of art in ancient times used to gather itself like steel shavings around the magnet. But a work of art does not necessarily have at its center a single long floating leap. The work can have many leaps, perhaps shorter. The real joy of poetry is to experience this leaping inside a poem. A poet who is "leaping" makes a jump from an object soaked in unconscious psychic substance to an object or idea soaked in conscious psychic substance. What is marvellous is to see this leaping return in poetry of this century.}}

''News of the Universe: Poems of Twofold Consciousness'' is a collection of poetry from around the world in 1995. In the introductory note Bly explains the book was requested by Sierra Club Books, and was to be poems relating to ecology. He begins the book with seven poems he calls "The Old Position", which are poems from the 18th century which "dismissed nature as defective because it lacks reason". The next part is the "Attack on the Old Position", followed by four more sections, and all non-English poets are translated by Bly. ''The Winged Energy of Delight, Selected Translations'' (2004) includes poets translated in ''Leaping Poetry,'' along with translations from Japanese, Spanish, Arabic and other world poets.

Bly's interest in Eastern ecstatic poetry flowered with the publication in 1971 of ''The Kabir Book, Forty-four of the Ecstatic Poems of Kabir''. It was a compilation of poems previously published in a variety of journals, reviews, and magazines. In 1981, Yellow Moon Press published ''Night and Sleep'', which contained translations of Rumi by [[Coleman Barks]] and Robert Bly. Barks collaborated with John Moyne and his literal Persian translations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/News/2014/March/In-Memoriam-John-Moyne|title=In Memoriam: John Moyne|website=www.gc.cuny.edu|access-date=June 12, 2019}}</ref> Bly worked with translations from the [[Persian language|Persian]] original by [[Arthur John Arberry|A.J. Arberry]] and [[Reynold A. Nicholson]]. A book translating [[Meera|Mirabai]] followed in 2004, co-authored with [[Jane Hirshfield]], with an afterword by John Stratton Hawley. In 2001, ''The Night Abraham Called to the Stars'' published Bly's celebration of the ''[[ghazal]]'', of which the cover flap says "Bly offers Western readers the opportunity to experience the thrilling leaps that the ghazal allows." In 2008, ''The Angels Knocking on the Tavern Door'' gave us thirty poems by Hafez translated by Bly and noted Islamic scholar [[Leonard Lewisohn (Islamic scholar)|Leonard Lewisohn]].

==Thought and the Men's Movement==
Much of Bly's prose writing focuses on what he saw as the particularly troubled situation in which many males find themselves today. He understood this to be a result of, among other things, the decline of traditional fathering which left young boys unguided through the stages of life leading to maturity. He claimed that in contrast with women who are better informed by their bodies (notably by the beginning and end of their [[menstrual cycle]]), men need to be actively guided out of boyhood and into manhood by their elders. Pre-modern cultures had elaborate myths, often enacted as [[rites of passage]], as well as "men's societies" where older men would teach young boys about these gender-specific issues. As modern fathers have become increasingly absent, this knowledge is no longer being passed down the generations, resulting in what he referred to as a Sibling Society.<ref>Bly, Robert (1990), ''Iron John: A Book About Men'', Da Capo Press, p. 97.</ref> The "Absence of the Father" is a recurrent theme in Bly's work and according to him, many of the phenomena of depression, juvenile delinquency and lack of leadership in business and politics are linked to it.

Bly therefore saw today's men as half-adults, trapped between boyhood and maturity, in a state where they find it hard to become responsible in their work as well as leaders in their communities. Eventually they might become weak or absent fathers themselves which will cause this behaviour to be passed down to their children. In his book ''[[The Sibling Society]]'' (1997), Bly argues that a society formed of such men is inherently problematic as it lacks creativity and a deep sense of empathy. The image of half-adults is further reinforced by popular culture which often portrays fathers as naive, overweight and almost always emotionally co-dependent. Historically this represents a recent shift from a traditional patriarchal model and Bly believes that women rushed to fill the gap that was formed through the various [[Counterculture of the 1960s|youth movements during the 1960s]],<ref>''Iron John'', p. 17.</ref> enhancing men's emotional capacities and helping them to connect with women's age-old pain of repression. It has however also led to the creation of "soft males" who lacked the outwardly directed strength to revitalize the community with assertiveness and a certain warrior strength.

In Bly's view, a potential solution lay in the rediscovery of the meanings hidden in traditional myths and fairytales as well as works of poetry. He researched and collected myths that concern male maturity, often originating from the ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' and published them in various books, ''Iron John'' being the best known example.<ref>[http://www.newdimensions.org/search.php?q=robert+bly&Submit=Search New Dimensions Media]. Retrieved January 18, 2011.</ref> In contrast to the continual pursuit of higher achievements, that is constantly taught to young men today, the theme of [[Katabasis#Trip into the underworld|spiritual descent]] (often being referred to by its Greek term ''[[Katabasis|κατάβασις]]'') which is to be found in many of these myths, is presented as a necessary step for coming in contact with the deeper aspects of the masculine self and achieving its full potential. This is often presented as hero, often during the middle of his quest, going underground to pass a period of solitude and sorrow in semi-bestial mode. Bly noticed that a cultural space existed in most traditional societies for such a period in a man's life, in the absence of which, many men today go into a depression and alcoholism as they subconsciously try to emulate this innate ritual.

Bly was influenced by the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] who developed the theory of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], the discrete structures of the [[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]] which emerge as images in dreams, myths, and art. The Powerful King, the Evil Witch and the Beautiful Maiden are, according to Jung, some of the imprints of the [[collective unconscious]] and Bly wrote extensively about their meaning and relations to modern life. As an example and in accordance with Jung, he considered the Witch to be that part of the male psyche upon which the negative and destructive side of a woman is imprinted and which first developed during infancy to store the imperfections of one's own mother. As a consequence, the Witch's symbols are essentially inverted motherly symbols, where the loving act of cooking is transformed into the brewing of evil potions and knitting clothes takes the form of spider's web. The feeding process is also reversed, with the child now in danger of being eaten to feed the body of the Witch rather than being fed by the mother's own body. In that respect, the Witch is a mark of [[developmental disorder|arrested development]] on the part of the man as it guards against feminine realities that his psyche is not yet able to incorporate fully. Fairy tales according to this interpretation mostly describe internal battles played out externally, where the hero saves his future bride by killing a witch, as in "The Drummer" ([[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms tale 193]]). This particular concept is expanded in Bly's 1989 talk "The Human Shadow" and the book it presented.<ref>Bly, Robert (1989). ''The Human Shadow'' [audiobook]. Better Listen (remastered 2009).</ref>

==Criticism==
In an early essay, [[New Formalist]] and [[New Narrative]] poet [[Dana Gioia]] examined the poetry career of Robert Bly, whom Gioia called, "one of the most famous and most influential poets writing in America".<ref name=Gioia2002>''Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture'' (2002), Dana Gioia, pages 147-162. Greywolf Press, 10th Anniversary ed. {{ISBN|978-1555973704}}.</ref> While Gioia praised some of Bly's poetry [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|attacking U.S. involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], he argued that Bly's success had more to do with self promotion than with literary talent. Gioia further called Bly's free verse translations of the work of formal poets, "insensitive to both the sound and nuance of the originals", and accused Bly, by encouraging, "this minimal kind of translation", of having, "done immense damage to [[American poetry]]." In conclusion, Gioia wrote, "Bly insists on being judged as a major poet, but his verse cannot bear the weight of that demand."<ref name=Gioia2002/>
