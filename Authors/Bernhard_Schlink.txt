'''Bernhard Schlink''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɛʁn.haʁt ʃlɪŋk|lang|De-Bernhard Schlink.ogg}}; born 6 July 1944)<ref>{{cite news |date=6 July 2019 |title=Bernhard Schlink: Recht und Moral |url=https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2017043-Bernhard-Schlink-Recht-und-Moral.html |work=[[Wiener Zeitung]] |location=Vienna |language=de |access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref> is a German lawyer, academic, and novelist. He is best known for his novel ''[[The Reader]]'', which was first published in 1995 and became an international bestseller. He won the 2014 [[Park Kyong-ni Prize]].

==Early life==
He was born in Großdornberg, near [[Bielefeld]], to a German father ([[Edmund Schlink]]) and a Swiss mother, the youngest of four children. His mother, Irmgard, had been a theology student of his father, whom she married in 1938. (Edmund Schlink's first wife had died in 1936.) Bernhard's father had been a seminary professor and pastor in the anti-Nazi [[Confessing Church]]. In 1946, he became a professor of dogmatic and ecumenical theology at Heidelberg University, where he would serve until his retirement in 1971. Over the course of four decades, Edmund Schlink became one of the most famous and influential Lutheran theologians in the world and a key participant in the modern Ecumenical Movement.<ref>Matthew L. Becker, "Edmund Schlink (1903–1984),” in Twentieth-Century Lutheran Theologians, ed. Mark Mattes, 195–222 (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &Ruprecht, 2013)</ref> Bernhard Schlink was brought up in [[Heidelberg]] from the age of two. He studied law at [[West Berlin]]'s [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]], graduating in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.authortrek.com/bernhard_schlink_page.html |title=Bernhard Schlink page – biography bibliography interviews essays |publisher=Authortrek.com |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306190243/http://www.authortrek.com/bernhard_schlink_page.html |archivedate=6 March 2014}}</ref>

Schlink became a judge at the Constitutional Court of the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in 1988 and in 1992 a professor for public law and the philosophy of law at [[Humboldt University]], Berlin. He retired in January 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|title=German bestselling author Bernhard Schlink turns 75 {{!}} DW {{!}} 05.07.2019|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-bestselling-author-bernhard-schlink-turns-75/a-49486750|access-date=2021-01-29|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Career==
Schlink studied law at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. He worked as a scientific assistant at the Universities of [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|Darmstadt]], [[Bielefeld University|Bielefeld]] and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfg.de/dfg_magazin/veranstaltungen/ausstellungen/wissen_schafft_kunst/ausstellung_lesung_schlink/index.html|title=DFG – Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – Schriftsteller und Wissenschaftler Bernhard Schlink zu Gast im Bonner Wissenschaftszentrum|website=www.dfg.de|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref> He had been a law professor at the [[University of Bonn]] and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main]] before he started in 1992 at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. His career as a writer began with several [[detective novel]]s with the main character named Selb—a play on the German word for "self"—(the first, ''Self's Punishment'', co-written with {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Popp|de}} being available in the UK). One of these, ''Die gordische Schleife'', won the {{Interlanguage link multi|Glauser Prize|de|3=Friedrich-Glauser-Preis}} in 1989.

In 1995, he published ''[[The Reader]]'' (''Der Vorleser''), a novel about a teenager who has an affair with a woman in her thirties who suddenly vanishes but whom he meets again as a law student when visiting a trial about war crimes. The book became a bestseller both in Germany and the United States and was translated into 39 languages. It was the first German book to reach the No. 1 position in the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]]. In 1997, it won the [[Hans Fallada Prize]], a German literary award, and the Prix [[Laure Bataillon]] for works translated into French.  In 1999 it was awarded the [[Welt-Literaturpreis|''Welt''-Literaturpreis]] of the newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]''.

In 2000, Schlink published a collection of short fiction called ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Flights of Love|de|3=Liebesfluchten}}''.  A January 2008 literary tour, including an appearance in San Francisco for City Arts & Lectures, was canceled due to Schlink's recovery from minor surgery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In 2008, [[Stephen Daldry]] directed a film adaptation of ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]].'' In 2010, his non-fiction political history, ''Guilt About the Past'' was published by Beautiful Books Limited (UK).

{{As of|2008}}, Schlink divides his time between New York and Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-dark-inheritance/2008/02/01/1201801007073.html |title=A dark inheritance |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2 February 2008 |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref> He is a member of [[PEN Centre Germany]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pen-deutschland.de/en/pen-zentrum-deutschland/mitglieder/|title=Members|work=PEN-Zentrum Deutschland|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US}}</ref>
