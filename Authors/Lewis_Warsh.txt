'''Lewis Warsh''' (9 November 1944 – 15 November 2020) was an American poet, visual artist, professor, prose writer, editor, and publisher. He was a principal member of the second generation of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets,;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lewis-warsh|title=Lewis Warsh|date=2018-08-15|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> however, he has said that “no two people write alike, even if they’re associated with a so-called ‘school’ .”<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Is Poetry: Conversations with the American Avant-Garde|last=Kane|first=Daniel|publisher=Teachers & Writers|year=2003|isbn=978-0915924646|location=New York|pages=161}}</ref> Professor of English at [[Long Island University]] and founding director (2007–2013) of their MFA program in creative writing, Warsh lived in Manhattan with his wife, playwright-teacher Katt Lissard, whom he married in 2001.

== Life and Work ==
Warsh was born in [[The Bronx|Bronx]], NY and received his BA and MA in English from [[City College of New York]]. He also attended [[Kenneth Koch]]’s poetry class at the [[The New School|New School]]. He began writing poetry and fiction in his early teens, and first published his poems in the [[Mimeo Revolution|mimeo magazine]] ''Wild Dog'', an issue guest-edited by [[Joanne Kyger]], in 1965. In the summer of 1965 he attended [[Berkeley Poetry Conference|The Berkeley Poetry Conference]] where he met [[Anne Waldman]] at [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan’s]] reading.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Angel Hair Sleeps with a Boy in My Head: The Angel Hair Anthology|publisher=Granary Books|year=2001|isbn=1-887123-50-4|editor-last=Waldman|editor-first=Anne|location=New York|pages=xx|editor-last2=Warsh|editor-first2=Lewis}}</ref> The two married and moved to 33 [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark’s Place]] in the [[Lower East Side]] of New York. It was during that time that the two founded ''Angel Hair'' Magazine and Books, which became a seminal part of the [[Mimeo Revolution|mimeo revolution]]. Warsh and Waldman’s apartment “proved to be a center for the new New York School and the relationship of that coterie to the [[Poetry Project]].”<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=All Poets Welcome: The Lower East Side Poetry Scene in the 1960s|last=Kane|first=Daniel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0520233850|location=Berkeley|pages=[https://archive.org/details/allpoetswelcomel0000kane/page/161 161, 179]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/allpoetswelcomel0000kane/page/161}}</ref> Their apartment also played a part of the “[s]ocial links between musicians and poets throughout the East Village…” Warsh recollects Lou Reed and other Velvet Underground members dropping in to Warsh and Waldman's 33 St. Mark's Place to listen to ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico|The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' for the first time: "And we were living on St. Mark’s Place, which was like the center of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and the [[Electric Circus (nightclub)|Electric Circus]] is up the street, and I have this memory of the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] coming to our apartment … they were saying ‘This is the first time we’ve heard this record,’ and it was the Banana record.”<ref>{{Cite book|title="Do You Have a Band?": Poetry and Punk Rock in New York City|last=Kane|first=Daniel|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780231162975|location=New York}}</ref> Warsh’s community also grew to include [[Ted Berrigan]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], [[Ron Padgett]], [[Bill Berkson]], [[Joe Brainard]] and [[George Schneeman]], among many others. During this time his first books of poems were published —''The Suicide Rates'' (1967), ''Highjacking'' (1968), and ''Moving Through Air'' (1968).

After his breakup with Waldman, Warsh lived in [[Bolinas, California]] from October 1969 to August 1970, where his neighbors included Joanne Kyger, [[Tom Clark (poet)|Tom Clark]], [[Bill Berkson]], [[Bobbie Louise Hawkins]] and [[Robert Creeley]]. In the spring of 1971, he took over the reading series at [[Intersection for the Arts Literary Series|Intersection]] in San Francisco from [[Andrei Codrescu]]. The “series lasted about six months and was many ways a temporary West Coast version of the Poetry Project; Robert Creeley and Ted Berrigan shared a bill, Joe Brainard and Joanne Kyger read together, [[Philip Whalen]] read with Allen [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]], and so on.”<ref name=":0" />

From 1973 to 1974 he lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and co-edited ''The Boston Eagle'' with [[William Corbett (poet)|William Corbett]] and [[Lee Harwood]], before returning to New York in 1974.

Bernadette Mayer and Warsh began living together spring 1975. They initially moved from New York to an old farmhouse in [[Worthington, Massachusetts]] and later to an apartment in [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. During this time their two daughters were born, Marie in 1975 and Sophia in 1977. Also, in 1977 the two decided to start ''United Artists'' Magazine and Books. Warsh wrote: <blockquote>We were living in relative isolation in Lenox, Massachusetts, and editing a magazine put us in touch with poets and friends we had left behind in New York. We managed to buy an inexpensive mimeo machine in Pittsfield and we produced the magazine in the living room of our large apartment on the main street of Lenox. The beauty of mimeographing is that we could control every aspect of production ourselves, that I could stay up all night and produce a new issue by morning if I wanted. The first issue reflects our geographical shift and contains work by ourselves and our immediate neighbors, Clark Coolidge and Paul Metcalf. Our idea was, whenever possible, to publish large amounts of a few poets’ work in each issue, as opposed to one or two poems by a lot of people. Among the regular contributors to subsequent issues were Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, Diane Ward, and Bill Berkson.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fromasecretlocation.com/united-artists/|title=United Artists {{!}}|date=2016-09-08|work=From a Secret Location|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>The mimeo magazine ''United Artists'' published eighteen issues from 1977 to 1983. United Artists Books is still publishing and is now “one of the oldest independent publishing companies in the United States that focuses primarily on publishing books of poetry.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedartistsbooks.com|title=United Artists Books|website=www.unitedartistsbooks.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> In 1979, Warsh and Mayer and family moved to [[Henniker, New Hampshire]], where they taught at [[New England College]], and where their son Max was born.

In 1980 they returned to the Lower East Side in New York, just a few blocks from their close friends [[Alice Notley]] and Ted Berrigan who were living on St. Mark's Place. Also, according to Warsh, many of the young poets around The Poetry Project entered their lives during this time—Gary Lenhart, Greg Masters, [[Eileen Myles]], [[Bob Holman]], Steve Levine, Mitch Highfill, Kim Lyons, Bob Rosenthal, Rochelle Kraut, among others.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=Fall 2012|title=Lewis Warsh: Interview Conducted by Steve Clay|journal=Mimeo Mimeo|volume=7|pages=20}}</ref>

Warsh's teaching career began in 1985 when [[Paul Auster]] recommended him to teach a graduate creative writing course at Long Island University, and [[Siri Hustvedt]] recommended him to teach undergraduate courses at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]]. Between 1985 and 2018 he taught at [[Naropa University]], [[University at Albany, SUNY|SUNY Albany]], Queens College, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], The Poetry Project, [[Bowery Poetry Club|The Bowery Poetry Club]], and Long Island University.

Although Warsh's visual work in collage appeared in print as early as 1973, accompanying his translation of Robert Desnos’ ''Night of Loveless Nights'', it wasn't until 1996 that he completely embraced the medium. “[They] seem a natural if not inevitable extension of his writing, and portray a visual dimension that is sumptuous, alluring and mysterious.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://granarybooks.com/collections/warsh/index.html|title=Lewis Warsh {{!}} Granary Books|website=granarybooks.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref>

Warsh's unpublished novel, ''Delusions of Being Observed,'' was serialized in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]],'' from October 2016 to June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/contributor/lewis-warsh|title=The Brooklyn Rail Contributor - Lewis Warsh|website=brooklynrail.org|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>

== Awards and Honors ==

In 1993 he has also received an Editor's Fellowship Award from the [[Council of Literary Magazines and Presses|Coordinating Council on Literary Magazines]], and a James Shestack award from the [[The American Poetry Review|American Poetry Review]].
