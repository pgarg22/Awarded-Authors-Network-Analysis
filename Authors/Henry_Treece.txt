'''Henry Treece''' (22 December 1911 &ndash; 10 June 1966) was a British [[poet]] and writer who also worked as a teacher and editor. He wrote a range of works but is mostly remembered as a writer of children's [[historical novel]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/50/101050498/ |title=Treece, Henry William (1911–1966), writer and schoolteacher |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603121507/http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/50/101050498/ |archivedate=3 June 2016}}</ref>

==Life and work==
Treece was born in [[Wednesbury]], [[Staffordshire]], and educated at the town's [[grammar school]]. After graduating from the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1933, he went into teaching with his first placement being at [[The King's School, Tynemouth|Tynemouth School]]. In 1939 he married Mary Woodman and settled in [[Lincolnshire]] as a teacher at [[Barton-upon-Humber]] Grammar School. Their son, Richard Treece, became a musician with [[Help Yourself (band)|Help Yourself]] and other rock bands.<ref>Sleevenotes by John Tobler to CD re-release of ''Strange Affair'', ''The Return of Ken Whaley'' and ''Happy Days'' (BGOCD 452)</ref>

He published five volumes of poetry: ''38 Poems'' (London: Fortune Press, 1940), then by Faber & Faber; ''Invitation and Warning'' 1942; ''The Black Seasons'' 1945; ''The Haunted Garden'' 1947; and ''The Exiles'' 1952. He appeared in the 1949 ''The New British Poets: an anthology'' edited by [[Kenneth Rexroth]]; but from 1952 with ''The Dark Island'' he devoted himself to fiction.  His best known are his juvenile historical novels, particularly those set in the [[Viking Age]], although he also wrote some adult historical novels.  Many of his novels are set in transitional periods in history, where more primitive societies are forced to face modernisation, e.g. the end of the Viking period, or the Roman conquest of Britain.  His play ''Carnival King'' (Faber & Faber) was produced at [[Nottingham Playhouse]] in 1953. He also worked as a radio broadcaster.

In [[World War II]] he served as an intelligence officer in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and helped [[John Pudney]] edit ''Air Force Poetry''.<ref>[http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/untoldlives/2015/05/henry-treece-history-in-the-making.html Henry Treece – history in the making] (The British Library Board)</ref>

Other poetry anthologies he was involved with include ''The New Apocalypse'' (1939) with [[J. F. Hendry]] giving its name to the [[New Apocalyptics]] movement; two further anthologies with Hendry followed. He wrote a critical study of [[Dylan Thomas]], called ''Dylan Thomas – Dog among the fairies'', published by Lindsay Drummond, London, in 1949. He and Thomas became estranged over Thomas's refusal to sign up as a New Apocalyptic.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/treece.html|title=Henry Treece biblio|publisher=FantasticFiction     
|accessdate= 2008-02-20}}</ref>

He also wrote ''Conquerors'' in 1932, as a way to reflect on the horrors of war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/i/ebooks/pdf/henry_treece_2012_4.pdf|title=Henry Treece - Poems|website=Poemhunter.com}}</ref>

He edited issues of the magazines ''Transformation'', and ''A New Romantic Anthology'' (1949) with [[Stefan Schimanski]], issues of ''Kingdom Come: The Magazine of War-Time Oxford'' with Schimanski and [[Alan Rook]], as well as ''War-Time Harvest''. ''How I See Apocalypse'' (London, Lindsay Drummond, 1946) was a retrospective statement. Treece died from a heart attack in 1966.

Treece's residency in Barton-upon-Humber is recorded by a blue plaque on East Acridge House, erected by the Civic Society in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bartoncivicsociety.co.uk/plaques.html |title=Barton Civic Society Plaques - East Acridge House |publisher=Barton Civic Society |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>
