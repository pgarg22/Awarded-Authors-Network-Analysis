'''Noel Langley''' (25 December 1911 – 4 November 1980) was a South African-born (later naturalised American) novelist, playwright, screenwriter and director. He wrote the screenplay which formed the basis for the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and is one of the three credited screenwriters for the film. His finished script for the film was revised by [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]], the other credited screenwriters. Langley objected to their changes and lamented the final cut upon first seeing it, but later revised his opinion. He attempted to write a sequel based on ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' using many of the concepts he had added to its predecessor, but this was never released.<ref>Michael Gessel. "Langley's Screenplay for ''Wizard of Oz'' Sequel Discovered." ''[[The Baum Bugle]]'' 42:1 (Spring 1998), pp 14–17.</ref>

==Life and career==
Born on Christmas Day in [[Durban, South Africa]], Noel Langley was the son of [[Durban High School]] headmaster Aubrey Samuel Langley and Dora Agnes Allison.<ref name=Gray>{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Stephen|title=Noel Langley & Co.: Some South Africans in Showbiz Abroad|journal=Current Writing: Text and Reception in Southern Africa|date=2012|volume=24|issue=1|pages=16–26|doi=10.1080/1013929X.2012.645356|s2cid=193246554}}</ref> Noel Langley attended his father's school (Durban High School- KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) until 1930. Noel's relationship with his headmaster father was a strained one as he did not meet his father's expectations. His father, Aubrey Samuel 'Madevu' (the isiZulu word for mustache), was a queer mix of sensitive artist, strict disciplinarian and rugby football enthusiast valued boys who were physically active. It seems that Langley senior rejected his son who was artistically inclined and physically weak (he was barred from sport and cadet drill by his doctor, Dr George Campbell).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jennings|first1=Hubert|title=The D.H.S. story, 1866-1966|date=1966|publisher=Durban High School and Old Boys' Memorial Trust|location=Durban}}</ref> Their relationship was so poor that Noel bragged to Jack Cope (a fellow Natalian, poet and novelist) after his father's death that he had helped kill his father by sending him money for drink.<ref name=Gray />

He then studied at the [[University of Natal]], from which he graduated with a BA in 1934.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Noel-Langley|title=Noel Langley &#124; South African-born novelist and playwright|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> While at University, he began writing plays. His play ''Queer Cargo'' was produced by the Durban Repertory Theatre in 1932. Sailing for England, post-graduation, he by chance met a cousin of [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], the founder of London's [[Wyndham's Theatre]]. ''Queer Cargo'' was subsequently produced at Wyndham's Theatre where it ran for seven months. Langley wrote other plays for the [[West End theatre|West End stage]] in this period, which included ''For Ever'' and ''Farm of Three Echoes''. His first big success came in 1935 with the publication of his first novel, ''Cage Me a Peacock'', a satire set in ancient Rome. This was followed by another novel, ''There's a Porpoise Close Behind Us'', and a children's book, ''[[The Land of Green Ginger]]'', in 1936. Langley began writing for films in the 1930s, helping to write the British films ''[[King of the Damned]]'' and ''[[Secret of Stamboul]].''<ref name=Coan>{{cite news|last=Coan|first=Stephen|title=KZN's very own screen wizard|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global%5B_id%5D=73897|access-date=24 April 2014|newspaper=The Witness|date=22 December 2011}}</ref> Langley then left London for Hollywood, having accepted a seven-year contract as a screenwriter for [[MGM]].<ref name=Gray/>

At MGM, his first credited film was ''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'', a musical based on the [[Maytime (musical)|1917 operetta]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b026365|title=Maytime (1937)|website=BFI}}</ref> In part due to the success of his own children's book ''The Land of Green Ginger'', he was one of the screenwriters chosen for the job of adapting [[L. Frank Baum]]'s children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for film. In 11 days, he provided a 43-page adaptation. Changes he introduced to the story are the inclusion of the actors playing the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], and the [[Cowardly Lion|Lion]] characters as farmworkers in the [[sepia tone]] Kansas sequences as well as changing the color of [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s shoes from silver to ruby.<ref name=Coan/> Langley also introduced Miss Almira Gulch, the [[Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]]'s Kansas counterpart. He then wrote a final draft. However, unbeknownst to him, MGM hired [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] to do rewrites. But, producer [[Arthur Freed]] was displeased with their work and turned the script back over to Langley. Langley disliked their changes and removed many of them. He felt that their version was "so cutesy and oozy that I could have vomited."<ref name=Coan/> The final film was released in August 1939. Langley was dismayed by the end result. He said, "I saw it in a cinema on Hollywood Boulevard at noon and I sat and cried like a bloody child."<ref name=Coan/> However, he amended his opinion when he saw the film for a second time in England during its 1949 re-release: "I thought, 'It’s not a bad picture. Not a bad picture, you know'."<ref name=Coan/>

After [[World War II]], during which he served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]],<ref name=Coan/> Langley worked on many British films. He also co-wrote the hit [[West End theatre|West End]] play ''[[Edward, My Son (play)|Edward, My Son]]'' with [[Robert Morley]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mreCBAAAQBAJ&q=edward+my+son+london+stage+1940-1949&pg=PA308|title=The London Stage 1940-1949: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel|first=J.

In 1964, Langley made a series of tapes for New York radio station [[WBAI]], reading ''The Tale of the Land of Green Ginger'' in its entirety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbai.org/upcomingprogram.php?upcomingid=3130|title=VOICES THAT CHANGE THE WORLD|website=www.wbai.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/pz0673415|title=From the Vault 415: The Land of Green Ginger by Noel Langley &#124; Pacifica Radio Archives|website=www.pacificaradioarchives.org}}</ref> He subsequently edited it down to fit on an LP, which was issued by the listener-sponsored station and offered as a fund-raising premium.  Langley continued to write novels and plays throughout his life. He also wrote short stories for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' and other magazines.

==Personal life==
In 1937, Langley married Naomi Mary Legate in Los Angeles. They had been a couple since his days in South Africa. They later had five children. The couple divorced in California in 1954 and Noel Langley obtained custody of the children. She is believed to have returned to her hometown of [[Pietermaritzburg]].<ref name=Coan/>

Langley married actress Pamela Deeming in 1959.<ref name=Coan/>

In 1961, Langley became a [[naturalised]] US citizen.<ref name=Coan/>

In his later years, Langley worked part-time in [[drug rehabilitation]]. He died in 1980 in [[Desert Hot Springs, California]], United States.<ref name=Gray/>
