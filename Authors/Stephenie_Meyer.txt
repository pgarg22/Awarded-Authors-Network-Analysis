'''Stephenie Meyer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|.|ər}}; née '''Morgan'''; born December 24, 1973) is an American novelist. She is best known for writing the [[vampire literature|vampire romance]] series ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'', which has sold over 100 million copies, with translations into 37 different languages. Meyer was the bestselling author of 2008 and 2009 in the U.S., having sold over 29 million books in 2008,<ref>{{cite news |title=The World's Most Powerful Celebrities: #26 Stephenie Meyer |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/03/forbes-100-celebrity-09-main_slide_27.html |work=Forbes |access-date=July 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719044244/http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/03/forbes-100-celebrity-09-main_slide_27.html |archive-date=July 19, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and 26.5 million in 2009.<ref name="children's">{{cite news|author=Diane Roback|title=Children's Bestsellers 2009: The Reign Continues|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/453747-Children_s_Bestsellers_2009_The_Reign_Continues.php|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=March 22, 2010|access-date=April 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719152011/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/453747-Children_s_Bestsellers_2009_The_Reign_Continues.php|archive-date=July 19, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Meyer received the 2009 Children's Book of the Year award from the British Book Awards for ''Breaking Dawn'', the ''Twilight'' series finale.

An avid young reader, she attended [[Brigham Young University]], marrying at the age of twenty-one before graduating with a degree in English in 1997. Having no prior experience as an author, she conceived the idea for the ''Twilight'' series in a dream. Influenced by the work of [[Jane Austen]] and [[William Shakespeare]], she wrote ''Twilight'' soon thereafter. After many rejections, [[Little, Brown and Company]] offered her a $750,000 three-book deal which led to a four-book series, several spin-off novels and novellas, and [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|a series of commercially successful film adaptations]]. Aside from young adult novels, Meyer has ventured into adult novels with ''[[The Host (novel)|The Host]]'' (2008) and ''The Chemist'' (2016). Meyer has worked in film production and cofounded production company Fickle Fish Films. Meyer produced both parts of ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1|Breaking Dawn]]'' and two other novel adaptations.

Meyer's membership in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) shaped her novels: there are [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Duties and expectations of church members|no drinking, smoking, or explicit sex scenes]], and the characters Edward and Bella in her ''Twilight'' series remain [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Law of chastity|sexually abstinent until marriage]]. Themes consistent with her religion, including [[Agency (LDS Church)|agency]], mortality, temptation, and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], are prominent in her work.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fetters|first=Ashley|date=2012-11-15|title=At Its Core, the 'Twilight' Saga Is a Story About ________|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/11/at-its-core-the-twilight-saga-is-a-story-about/265328/|access-date=2020-07-24|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}</ref> Meyer's work has been criticized for her overly-simplistic writing style, and feminists assert that the novel encourages traditional gender roles and that furthermore, Bella and Edward's romance has signs of an [[abusive relationship]]. Despite this criticism, Meyer considers herself a feminist. Meyer's stories have also received praise and she has acquired a fan following.

Meyer was included on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine's list of the "100 Most Influential People in 2008",<ref name="The 2008 Time 100 Finalists">{{cite news |title=The 2008 Time 100 Finalists |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1725112_1726934_1726935,00.html |access-date=July 23, 2009 |date=April 1, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203011702/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1725112_1726934_1726935,00.html |archive-date=February 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was included in the ''[[Forbes]]'' Celebrity 100 list of the world's most powerful celebrities in 2009, with her annual earnings exceeding $50 million.<ref name=":1" />

Despite Meyer's success, her novels have been highly criticized. ''The New York Times'' called the premise of ''Twilight'' "attractive and compelling"; however, the review continues, "the book suffers at times from overearnest, amateurish writing", indicating that Meyer's relied too much on "telling" rather than "showing" and that there were excessive references to Edward's attractiveness and Bella's swooning.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Spires |first1=Elizabeth |title='Enthusiasm' by Polly Shulman and 'Twilight,' by Stephenie Meyer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/enthusiasm-by-polly-shulman-and-twilight-by-stephenie-meyer.html |access-date=17 October 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=February 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017210504/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/enthusiasm-by-polly-shulman-and-twilight-by-stephenie-meyer.html |archive-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> An article from ''The Guardian'' criticized Bella's character, calling her "a clumsy, selfish nincompoop with the charisma of a boiled potato" and criticized Edward's portrayal as the "perfect little gentleman" who constantly counters Bella's sexual advances.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Russell-Williams |first1=Imogen |title=Twilight vampires?

Furthermore, Riess criticized the "retrogressive gender stereotypes" in Meyer's novels.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=146}}

Originally an online novelized "fan-fiction" of the ''Twilight'' series, the novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' by [[E. L. James]] loosely explores the relationship between the main characters, had they not remained celibate before marriage. Though the publisher claims the novel is "original and no longer based on ''Twilight''", James did not receive copyright authorization to write the novel and some have argued that ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' may be a copyright infringement. Though Meyer has stated that the novel is "too smutty" and does not interest her, she has not filed a copyright claim.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mulligan |first1=Christina |title=The most scandalous part of "Fifty Shades of Grey" isn't the sex and bondage |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/11/the-most-scandalous-part-of-fifty-shades-of-grey-isnt-the-sex-and-bondage/ |access-date=10 October 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010171645/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/11/the-most-scandalous-part-of-fifty-shades-of-grey-isnt-the-sex-and-bondage/ |archive-date=October 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Style and influences==
===Style===
Since the release of ''Twilight'', Meyer has been described as writing with "all plot and no style" and including "very little characterization", and her writing characterized as "fairly"{{sfn|Krohn|2010|p=53}} poor. Meyer's prose lacks a consistent style or voice; for example, her short story "Hell on Earth" is driven more by dialogue alone, in contrast with the ornate descriptions found in the ''Twilight'' series.{{sfn|Blasingame|Deakin|Walsh|2012|p=27}} Meyer relies on detailed expository descriptions in her novels, <ref>{{harvnb|Blasingame|Deakin|Walsh|2012|p=28}}</ref> and on [[active voice]]; she often opens her sentences with the most important information.{{sfn|Blasingame|Deakin|Walsh|2012|pp=29-30}} While a stylistic focus of most novels is character development, Meyer has stated that she intentionally avoided describing her characters in detail, which she believes allows the reader to more easily "step into [their] shoes".<ref>{{citation |last1=Meyer |first1=Stephenie |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Twilight |date=2019 |url=https://stepheniemeyer.com/the-books/twilight/twilight-faq#bella |access-date=28 January 2021}}</ref> In some works such as ''New Moon'', in which Bella is largely on her own, Meyer offers "deeper insight into Bella's psyche" through the chapter titles, rather than the prose itself.{{sfn|Blasingame|Deakin|Walsh|2012|p=68}}

Meyer's work is typically classified as [[melodrama]]. In ''Twilight'', Meyer makes allusions to canonical texts such as the [[Book of Genesis]], ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', and ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]''. Meyer has said that the individual style of each of her novels came from various genres of music she listened to while writing.{{sfn|Krohn|2010|p=49}} A corpus stylistics analysis of the ''Twilight'' saga revealed that much of Meyer's description and characterization revolved around the physical attributes of the characters as shown through eyes, face, and expression. Some of Meyer's most frequent descriptions related to eye color and expression, the juxtaposition of warmth and cold, and the words "black" and "dark". The study authors concluded that the predictability and superficiality of Meyer's descriptions indicate that Meyer's writing style is unexceptional and the success of her novels was related more to clever marketing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cesiri |first1=Daniela |last2=Coccetta |first2=Francesca |title=Narrative Descriptions in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga.

Meyer cites many novels as inspiration for the ''Twilight'' series, including ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' by [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Lucy Maud Montgomery|L. M.

==Recurring themes==
===Agency===
According to professor of American religious history Jana Riess, a prominent theme in Meyer's novels is agency. In ''The Host'', the Seeker believes that she is saving the human race by perfecting and controlling, similar to the Latter-day Saint belief that [[Satan]]'s [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan for human salvation]] was to "save" all souls by removing their [[Agency (LDS Church)|agency]] and ability to [[sin]]. Seeker plays a Satan-like role in the novel, as Meyer attempts to convey the message that the maintenance of agency is crucial.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=142}} Additionally, Meyer's novels contain the themes of opposition. In ''The Host'', Wanda learns that despite the lows and evils of humanity, beauty and pleasure could not be found on her previous planets because darkness did not exist. Wanda learns in the novel that it is only in facing darkness and sorrow, that light and joy could be experienced, echoing a quotation from the [[Book of Mormon]], "It musts needs be that there is an opposition in all things".{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=145}} However, "imprinting" in her ''Twilight'' series, the involuntary formation of a mate relationship, undermines Meyer's prolific theme of free agency.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jepson |first1=Eric W. |title=Saturday's Werewolf: The Doctrine that Makes Stephenie Meyer's Lycanthropes Golden Investigators |url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/157-21-25.pdf |access-date=13 January 2020 |work=Sunstone Magazine |publisher=Sunstone Education Foundation |date=December 2009}}</ref> According to literature and women's studies scholar Natalie Wilson, the juxtaposition between Bella's agency to choose her mate and Jacob, a Native American male's, inability to choose has racial and cultural implications.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=152}}

===Mortality and temptation===
Another theme is overcoming the circumstances and temptations of mortality referred to in the Book of Mormon as overcoming the "natural man" which is exemplified by Meyer's character Edward.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|pp=142-143}} As a vampire, Edward's purpose is to be carnal, killing and feeding on human blood. As led by Carlisle, Edward chooses to give up this life and transcend his circumstances by becoming a "vegetarian", choosing to feed only on animals. He chooses to uphold these values despite the daily temptation which only augments when he meets Bella; he finds her blood nearly irresistible.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=143}} Edward undergoes a transformation in which Bella's trust in Edward allows him to trust his own ability to overcome temptation and keep Bella safe.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=143}} Self-control is a prominent theme in the ''Twilight'' series, the word appears 125 times throughout the novels, as the main characters struggle to control their emotions, attraction, thirst, or jealousy.{{sfn|Morey|2012|p=65}}

===Immortality and eternal life===
Apparent in Meyer's ''Twilight'' series is the theme of the distinction between immortality and eternal life. In Meyer's novels, vampires are immortal and have superhuman gifts and abilities; however, the Cullen family longs for things they cannot have. Their circumstances prevent them from forming meaningful relationships with humans or other vampires, isolating them within their small clan. Furthermore, the couples in the Cullen family are unable to procreate which causes severe bitterness in Rosalie who envies Bella's ability to be pregnant.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=144}} According to Riess, the distinction between eternal life and immortality is represented by Bella, who in ''Breaking Dawn'', has achieved eternal life rather than immortality because she achieved the Mormon tenets of eternal life: immortality and a perfected body, eternal parenthood, and an eternal marriage.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|p=144}} Riess indicates that Bella receives immortality in an act of self-sacrifice rather than self-service as she dies for the birth of her child. Bella is subsequently resurrected in a perfected vampire body. In Mormonism, resurrection occurs in the context of relationships, exemplified by Bella who enjoys her resurrected body in the company of her husband, child, and the rest of the Cullen family.{{sfn|Reiss|2009|pp=144-145}} The titles of the novels serve to reinforce this idea. At the beginning of the series, Bella discusses leaving Phoenix and heading to Forks where she says, "[goodbye] to the sun".{{sfn|Guanio-Uluru|2015|p=177}} The titles of the first three novels: ''Twilight'', ''New Moon'', and ''Eclipse'', serve as natural phenomenon in which the sun is darkened. However, the final novel is titled ''Breaking Dawn'', which symbolizes the beginning of a new day and Bella's transformation into a vampire and subsequent transcendence of her old life.{{sfn|Guanio-Uluru|2015|p=177}}

==Views==
===Religion===
[[File:Mormon-book.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Book of Mormon]] influenced Meyer more than any other book.]]

Despite pressure to include a major sex scene, Meyer was adamant against including graphic sex in her series.<ref name="Grossman3" /> According to Lev Grossman of ''Time'', some of the series' appeal is due to its lack of sex and its eroticizing of [[sexual abstinence|abstinence]].<ref name="Grossman3" /> As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Meyer acknowledges that her faith has influenced her work.

Growing up, Meyer's life and family revolved around The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They were involved in their community and a young Meyer met her future husband at church. She studiously read the Book of Mormon, citing the book as having "the most significant impact on [her] life."<ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2009|pp=22–23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hanks|2009|p=26}}</ref> However, Meyer dislikes when media constantly mentions her religion, claiming that the press does not emphasize the religions of other authors.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bosman |first1=Julie |title=Book Stokes Vampire Fever at Stores' Parties |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/02/books/02meyer.html |access-date=17 October 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=August 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017161651/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/02/books/02meyer.html |archive-date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Feminism===
According to an article from ''The Guardian'', Meyer considers herself a feminist. Meyer has stated that, "the world is a better place when women are in charge." Additionally, she supported the massive success of Catherine Hardwicke, the director of ''Twilight'' and appreciated working with a nearly all-female production for ''Austenland''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cochrane |first1=Kira |title=Stephenie Meyer on Twilight, feminism and true love |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/11/stephenie-meyer-twilight-the-host |access-date=10 October 2019 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |date=March 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819112154/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/11/stephenie-meyer-twilight-the-host |archive-date=August 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meyer has explained that her definition of feminism is the ability for a woman to choose and the definition of anti-feminism is removing the choice, whether it fits gender stereotypes or not, from the woman entirely. She continued that some modern feminists contradict their message of equality for women by limiting or shaming certain women's choices. Furthermore, she stated that women who choose to stay home or have children are particularly criticized and that limitations on what women can do are anti-feminist in nature.<ref name="core">{{cite news |last1=Fetters |first1=Ashley |title=At Its Core, the 'Twilight' Saga Is a Story About ______ |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/11/at-its-core-the-twilight-saga-is-a-story-about/265328/ |access-date=10 October 2019 |work=The Atlantic |date=November 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010223435/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/11/at-its-core-the-twilight-saga-is-a-story-about/265328/ |archive-date=October 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ashcraft|2013|p=22}}</ref> Women's studies scholar Donna Ashcraft argues that Meyer is not a feminist, by definition, because her novels encourage traditional gender roles. However, although Ashcraft qualifies Meyer as traditional or nonfeminist, she clarifies that Meyer is not antifeminist.{{sfn|Ashcraft|2013|p=22}}

However, Meyer has been criticized by [[feminists]] who consider Meyer an [[Antifeminism|antifeminist]] writer. They say that the series romanticizes a physically abusive relationship, pointing to red flags that include Bella's entire life revolving around Edward; never being in control of her own life; being absolutely dependent on Edward's ability to protect her life, her virginity, and her humanity; and the physical injuries Bella suffers from finally consummating her relationship with Edward.<ref name="Salon Magazine">{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2008/07/30/twilight_3/|title=Touched by a vampire|author=Laura Miller|date=July 30, 2008|work=salon.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124011412/http://www.salon.com/2008/07/30/twilight_3/|archive-date=November 24, 2011|access-date=December 3, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Bitch Magazine">{{cite web |author=Christine Seifert |url=http://bitchmagazine.org/article/bite-me-or-dont |title=Bite Me!

Noah Berlatsky of ''The Atlantic'', in contrast, found Meyer's characters to be heroic. He continued that Meyer is a different kind of feminist that values motherhood, romance, and relationships and consequently, her characters lack the autonomy that comes from avoiding investment in relationships.<ref name="noah">{{cite news |last1=Berlatsky |first1=Noah |title=How Could Someone Who Writes About Lovesick Teen Girls Be a Feminist? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/how-could-someone-who-writes-about-lovesick-teen-girls-be-a-feminist/273955/ |access-date=10 October 2019 |work=The Atlantic |date=March 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010223436/https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/how-could-someone-who-writes-about-lovesick-teen-girls-be-a-feminist/273955/ |archive-date=October 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> After being asked in an interview with ''The Guardian'' whether she is anti-abortion, Meyer refused to directly answer the question, insisting that she does not like to talk about politics and that she abhors when celebrities use their popularity to influence voters. Berlatsky argues that her refusal to answer the question was not to avoid revealing her political position, but rather out of "respect for women's lives and women's choices".<ref name="noah" />
