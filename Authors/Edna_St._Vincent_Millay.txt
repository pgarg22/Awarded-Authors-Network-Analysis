'''Edna St. Vincent Millay''' (February 22, 1892 – October 19, 1950) was an American [[lyric poetry|lyrical poet]] and playwright.

Encouraged to read the classics at home, she was too rebellious to make a success of formal education, but she won poetry prizes from an early age, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1923, and went on to use verse as a medium for her feminist activism. She also wrote verse-dramas and a highly-praised opera, ''[[The King's Henchman]]''. Her novels appeared under the name Nancy Boyd, and she refused lucrative offers to publish them under her own name.

Millay was a prominent social figure of New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] just as it was becoming known as a bohemian writer's colony, and she was noted for her uninhibited lifestyle, forming many passing relationships with both men and women. She was also a social and political activist and those relationships included prominent anti-war activists including [[Floyd Dell]], editor of the radical magazine ''[[The Masses]]'', and perhaps [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. She became a prominent feminist of her time; her poetry and her example, both subversive, inspired a generation of American women.

Her career as a poet was meteoric. In 1923 she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer prize in poetry. She became a performance artist super-star, reading her poetry to rapt audiences across the country.{{Sfn|Milford|2001|p=xiv}}

A road accident in middle-age left her a partial invalid and morphine-dependent for years.  Yet near the end of her life, she wrote some of her greatest poetry.

==Early life==
Millay was born in [[Rockland, Maine]], to Cora Lounella Buzelle, a nurse, and Henry Tolman Millay, a schoolteacher who would later become a superintendent of schools. Her middle name derives from [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in [[New York City|New York]], where her uncle's life had been saved just before her birth. The family's house was "between the mountains and the sea where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods."<ref Name = "NYT"/> In 1904, Cora officially divorced Millay's father for financial irresponsibility and domestic abuse, but they had already been separated for some years. Henry and Edna kept a letter correspondence for many years, but he never re-entered the family. Cora and her three daughters – Edna (who called herself "Vincent"), [[Norma Millay Ellis|Norma Lounella]] (born 1893), and Kathleen Kalloch (born 1896) – moved from town to town, living in poverty and surviving various illnesses. Cora travelled with a trunk full of classic literature, including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton|Milton]], which she read to her children. The family settled in a small house on the property of Cora's aunt in [[Camden, Maine]], where Millay would write the first of the poems that would bring her literary fame.

The three sisters were independent and spoke their minds, which did not always sit well with the authority figures in their lives. Millay's grade school principal, offended by her frank attitudes, refused to call her Vincent. Instead, he called her by any woman's name that started with a V.{{sfn|Epstein|2001}} At Camden High School, Millay began developing her literary talents, starting at the school's literary magazine, ''The Megunticook''.  At 14 she won the St. Nicholas Gold Badge for poetry, and by 15, she had published her poetry in the popular children's magazine ''St. Nicholas'', the ''Camden Herald'', and the high-profile anthology ''Current Literature''.

Millay entered [[Vassar College]] in 1913 when she was 21 years old, later than usual. Her attendance at Vassar became a strain to her due to its strict nature. Before she attended the college Millay had a liberal home life that included smoking, drinking, playing gin rummy, and flirting with men. Vassar, on the other hand, expected its students to be refined and live according to their status as young ladies.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=MILLAY|first=VINCENT|title=Edna St. Vincent Millay|date=2005-09-05|work=Lofty Dogmas|pages=248–250|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctvmx3j3j.68|isbn=978-1-61075-244-2}}</ref> She had relationships with many fellow students during her time there and kept scrapbooks including drafts of plays written during the period.{{sfn|Epstein|2001}}<ref>Brinkman, B.

After her graduation from Vassar in 1917, Millay moved to [[New York City]]. She lived in a number of places in [[Greenwich Village]], including a house owned by the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]]<ref name="Nevius">{{cite book | first = Michelle and James | last = Nevius| title = Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City| place = New York| publisher = Free Press| year = 2009}}</ref> and [[75½ Bedford Street]], renowned for being the narrowest<ref name=NYT2>{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Christopher|title=For Rent: 3-Floor House, 9 1/2 Ft.

While establishing her career as a poet, Millay initially worked with the [[Provincetown Players]] on Macdougal Street and the [[Theatre Guild]].

She often went into detail about topics others found [[taboo]], such as a wife leaving her husband in the middle of the night.<ref name=":0"/>

Counted among Millay's close friends were the writers [[Witter Bynner]], [[Arthur Davison Ficke]], and [[Susan Glaspell]], as well as [[Floyd Dell]] and the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], both of whom proposed marriage to her and were refused.<ref name="AAP"/>{{sfn|Milford|2001|pp=[https://archive.org/details/savagebeautylife00milf/page/191 191–192]}} Millay had a way of wrapping men around her finger, even after she rejected them.<ref name=":0"/> Edmund Wilson, for example, spoke of her highly because Millay took his virginity but she rejected his advances and his marriage proposal.  However, he remained a loyal friend.<ref name=":0"/>

==Career==
Millay's fame began in 1912 when, at the age of 20, she entered her poem "[[Renascence (poem)|Renascence]]" in a poetry contest in ''The Lyric Year''.  The poem was widely considered the best submission, and when it was ultimately awarded fourth place, it created a scandal which brought Millay publicity. The first-place winner [[Orrick Johns]] was among those who felt that "Renascence" was the best poem, and stated that "the award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph."  A second-prize winner offered Millay his $250 prize money.<ref name="Dash">{{cite book| first = Joan | last = Dash| title = A Life of One's Own: Three Gifted Women and the Men They Married| url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofonesownthr0000dash | url-access = registration | place = New York| publisher = Harper & Row | year = 1973}}</ref>  In the immediate aftermath of the ''Lyric Year'' controversy, wealthy arts patron Caroline B. Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in [[Camden, Maine]], and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay's education at [[Vassar College]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap7/millay.html |title = Chapter 7: Edna St. Vincent Millay | last = Reuben | first = Paul P |work = PAL: Perspectives in American Literature – A Research and Reference Guide | publisher = CSUSTAN | access-date= July 2, 2012}}</ref>

Millay's 1920 collection ''A Few Figs From Thistles'' drew controversy for its exploration of female sexuality and feminism.<ref>Millay, Edna St. Vincent. [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/esv-millay/figs-thistles.pdf ''A few Figs from Thistles'']</ref> In 1919, she wrote the anti-war play ''Aria da Capo'', which starred her sister Norma Millay at the [[Provincetown Playhouse]] in New York City. Millay won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Poetry in 1923 for "The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver";<ref>Millay, Edna St. Vincent, [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/millay/ballad/ballad.html "The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver"]</ref> she was the third woman to win the poetry prize, after [[Sara Teasdale]] (1918) and [[Margaret Widdemer]] (1919).<ref name = "Pulitzer site">{{Citation | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Poetry | title = Pulitzer | contribution = Poetry | access-date = December 9, 2010}}.</ref>

Millay also wrote short stories for the magazine [[Ainslee's Magazine|Ainslee's]] - but she was a canny protector of her identity as a poet and an [[Aestheticism|aesthete]], and insisted on publishing this more mass-appeal work under a [[pseudonym]], Nancy Boyd.  As her fame grew and she became a household name, the publisher of Ainslee's offered to double her fees if he could use her real name.  She refused.

In January 1921, she went to [[Paris]], where she met and befriended the sculptors [[Thelma Wood]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Herring | first = Phillip | year = 1995 | title = Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes | location = New York | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn = 0-14-017842-2 | page = 158}}</ref> and [[Constantin Brâncuși]], photographer [[Man Ray]], had affairs with journalists George Slocombe and John Carter, and became pregnant by a man named Daubigny. She secured a marriage license but instead returned to New England where her mother Cora helped induce an [[abortion]] with [[alkanet]], as recommended in her old copy of [[''Culpeper's Complete Herbal'']].{{sfn|Milford|2001|pp=234–239}} Possibly as a result, Millay was frequently ill and weak for much of the next four years.

After experiencing his remarkable attentions to her during her illness, in 1923 she married 43-year-old Eugen Jan [[Boissevain family|Boissevain]] (1880–1949), the widower of the labor lawyer and [[war correspondent]] [[Inez Milholland]], a political icon Millay had met during her time at Vassar.{{sfn|Milford|2001|pp=268–275}} A self-proclaimed feminist, Boissevain supported Millay's career and took primary care of domestic responsibilities. Both Millay and Boissevain had other lovers throughout their 26-year marriage. For Millay, one such significant  relationship was with the poet [[George Dillon (poet)|George Dillon]], a student 14 years her junior, whom she met in 1928 at one of her readings at the [[University of Chicago]]. Their relationship inspired the [[sonnet]]s in the collection ''Fatal Interview'' (published 1931).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/edna-st-vincent-millay | title=Edna St. Vincent Millay | publisher=Poetry Foundation | access-date=June 27, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Steepletop main house, Austerlitz, NY.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Main house at Steepletop, where Millay spent the last 25 years of her life]]
In 1925, Boissevain and Millay bought [[Steepletop]] near [[Austerlitz, New York]], which had once been a {{convert|635|acre|ha|adj=on}} blueberry farm.<ref name="Millay Colony history">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.millaycolony.org/history | publisher = [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] | access-date= January 23, 2010}}</ref> They built a barn (from a [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] kit), and then a writing cabin and a tennis court.

They are not really human beings at all."<ref>Bryson, Bill. ''At Home, A Short History of Private Life'', Random House, 2010, p 111</ref>

In the summer of 1936, Millay was riding in a [[station wagon]] when the door suddenly swung open, and Millay “was hurled out into the pitch-darkness...and rolled for some distance down a rocky gully"<ref>Letter from Millay to Ferdinand Earle, September 14, 1940. Quoted in {{harvnb|Milford|2001|p=449}}</ref> The accident severely damaged nerves in her spine, requiring frequent surgeries and hospitalizations, at least daily doses of morphine. Millay lived the rest of her life in "constant pain".{{sfn|Milford|2001|pp=438–449}} Despite this, she was sufficiently alarmed by the rise of [[fascism]] to write against it. During  [[World War I]], Millay had been a dedicated and active [[Pacifism|pacifist]]; however, in 1940 she advocated for the U.S. to enter the war against [[Axis powers|the Axis]] and became an ardent supporter of the war effort.  She later worked with [[Writers' War Board]] to create [[propaganda]], including poetry.<ref>[http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/edna-st-vincent-millay.html "Edna St. Vincent Millay"] ''Vassar Encyclopaedia'', Vassar College</ref> Millay's reputation in poetry circles was damaged by her war work. Merle Rubin noted, "She seems to have caught more flak from the literary critics for supporting democracy than [[Ezra Pound]] did for championing [[fascism]]."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Merle|title=Lyrical, Rebellious And Almost Forgotten |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB999736509740821352|access-date=February 24, 2015 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 6, 2001}}</ref> In 1942 in ''The New York Times Magazine'', Millay mourned the destruction of the Czechoslovak town of [[Lidice]]. [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] forces had razed Lidice, slaughtered its male inhabitants and scattered its surviving residents in retaliation for the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]].  Millay wrote:

<blockquote><poem>The whole world holds in its arms today
The murdered village of Lidice, 
Like the murdered body of a little child.<ref name="NYT"/></poem></blockquote>

In 1943, Millay was the sixth person and the second woman to be awarded the [[Frost Medal]] for her lifetime contribution to American poetry.

Despite the excellent sales of her books in the 1930s, her declining reputation, constant medical bills, and frequent demands from her mentally-ill sister Kathleen meant that for most of her last years, Millay was in debt to her own publisher.{{sfn|Milford|2001|p=442}} Author Daniel Mark Epstein also concludes from her correspondence that Millay developed a passion for [[thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|horse-racing]], and spent much of her income investing in a racing stable of which she had quietly become an owner.{{sfn|Epstein|2001}}

Although her work and reputation declined during the war years, possibly because of a morphine addiction acquired following her accident, she subsequently sought treatment for it and was successfully rehabilitated, with some of her finest work dating from the post-war period. Boissevain died in 1949 of [[lung cancer]], and Millay lived alone for the last year of her life. Her final collection of poems was published posthumously as the volume "Mine the Harvest". The title sonnet recalls her career:

<blockquote><poem>Those hours when happy hours were my estate, —
Entailed, as proper, for the next in line,
Yet mine the harvest, and the title mine —
Those acres, fertile, and the furrows straight,
From which the lark would rise — all of my late
Enchantments, still, in brilliant colours, shine,</poem><ref>{{cite book|title=Mine the Harvest: A collection of new poems|last=Millay|first=Edna St. Vincent|editor-last=Millay Ellis|editor-first=Norma|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1954|location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>

Millay's sister Norma and her husband, the painter and actor Charles Frederick Ellis, moved to Steepletop after Millay's death. In 1973, they established the [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] on seven acres near the house and barn.  After the death of her husband in 1976, Norma continued to run the program until her death in 1986.<ref name="Millay Colony history"/>

The proceeds of the sale were used by the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society to restore the farmhouse and grounds and turn it into a museum. The museum opened to the public in the summer of 2010, and guided tours of Steepletop and Millay's gardens were available from the end of May through the middle of October. Effective November 2018 Steepletop closed to the public due to financial challenges and restoration needs.

Conservation of Millay's birthplace began in 2015 with the purchase of the double-house at 198-200 Broadway, [[Rockland, Maine]]. Built in 1891, Henry T. and Cora B. Millay were the first tenants of the north side, where Cora gave birth to her first of three daughters during a February 1892 squall.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About the Millay House|url=https://millayhouserockland.org/about|url-status=live|website=[[Millay House Rockland]]}}</ref> Identified as the Singhi Double House, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 not as the poet's birthplace, but as a "good example" of the "modest double houses" that made up almost 10% of residences in the largely working-class seaside city between 1837 and the early 1900s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maine Historic Preservation Commission|title=Singhi Double House, Knox County, 1891|url=https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=mhpc_recent_listings&id=1241239&v=article2019|url-status=live}}</ref> When fully restored by 2023, half the house will be dedicated to honoring Millay's legacy with workshops and classes, while the other half will be rented for income to sustain conservation and programs.

Millay lived in nearby [[Camden, Maine]], beginning in 1900, where she is also memorialized. A statue of the poet stands in Harbor Park which shares with Mt.

[[Nancy Milford]] published a biography of the poet in 2001, ''Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay.'' Millay's sister, [[Norma Millay Ellis]] (then her only living relative), offered Milford access to the poet's papers based on her successful biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife, ''Zelda''. Milford also edited and wrote an introduction for a collection of Millay's poems called ''The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay.''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Milford|first=Nancy|title=The Selected Poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=0-375-76123-3|location=New York}}</ref> Milford wrote that "Millay was the first American figure to rival the personal adulation, frenzy even, of Byron, where the poet in his person was the romantic ideal. It was his life as much as his work that shocked and delighted his audiences. Edna Millay was the only American woman to draw such crowds to her. Her performing self made people feel they had seen the muse alive and just within reach."{{Sfn|Milford|2001|p=xiv}}

Millay has been referenced in popular culture, and her work has been the inspiration for music and drama:

In the 1971 ''[[All in the Family]]'' episode "[[List of All in the Family episodes#ep5|Judging Books by Covers]]", the character Archie Bunker erroneously refers to the poet as "Edna St. Louis Millay."

In 1972 the Poem 'Conscientious Objector' by Edna, was put to music by Mary Travers (of Peter, Paul and Mary) on her album 'Morning Glory'.

"My candle burns at both ends;
It will not last the night;
But ah, my foes and oh my friends—
It gives a lovely light!"</poem>

Millay wrote six [[verse drama]]s early in her career, including ''Two Slatterns and a King'' and ''The Lamp and the Bell'', a poem written for [[Vassar College]] about love between women.<ref name="AAP"/> She was commissioned by the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] to write a [[libretto]] for an opera composed by [[Deems Taylor]]. The result, ''[[The King's Henchman]]'', drew on the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'s'' account of [[Edgar the Peaceful|Eadgar, King of Wessex]], and was described as the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera ever to reach the stage. Within three weeks, her publishers had run through four editions of the book.<ref name="NYT"/>
