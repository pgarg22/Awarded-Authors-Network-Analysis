Atwood followed this success with the publication of ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' in 2003, the first novel in a series that also includes ''[[The Year of the Flood]]'' (2009) and ''[[MaddAddam]]'' (2013), which would collectively come to be known as the MaddAddam Trilogy. The apocalyptic vision in the MaddAddam Trilogy engages themes of genetic modification, pharmaceutical and corporate control, and man-made disaster.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Atwood's apocalypses|others=Waltonen, Karma|isbn=978-1322607894|location=Newcasle upon Tyne|oclc=901287105}}</ref> As a work of speculative fiction, Atwood notes of the technology in ''Oryx and Crake'', "I think, for the first time in human history, we see where we might go. We can see far enough into the future to know that we can't go on the way we've been going forever without inventing, possibly, a lot of new and different things."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/margaret-atwood-on-the-science-behind-oryx-and-crake/|title=Margaret Atwood on the Science Behind ''Oryx and Crake''|work=Science Friday|access-date=February 4, 2018}}</ref> She later cautions in the acknowledgements to ''MaddAddam'', "Although ''MaddAddam'' is a work of fiction, it does not include any technologies or bio-beings that do not already exist, are not under construction or are not possible in theory."<ref>{{Cite book|title=MaddAddam : A Novel|author=Atwood, Margaret|isbn=978-0307455482|edition= first United States|location=New York|oclc=825733384|year = 2014}}</ref>

In 2005, Atwood published the novella ''[[The Penelopiad]]'' as part of the [[Canongate Myth Series]]. The story is a retelling of ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]'' from the perspective of [[Penelope]] and a chorus of the twelve maids murdered at the end of the original tale. ''The Penelopiad'' was given a theatrical production in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/scene/theatre/2013/02/22/penelopiad/|title=RMTC's "The Penelopiad" offers an intriguing new take on a familiar tale|publisher=CBC Manitoba|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref>

In 2016, Atwood published the novel ''[[Hag-Seed]]'', a modern-day retelling of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'', as part of [[Penguin Random House]]'s Hogarth Shakespeare Series.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/why-rewrite-shakespeare|title=Why Rewrite Shakespeare?|last=Gopnik|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Gopnik|date=October 10, 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=May 5, 2018|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

In 2008, Atwood published ''[[Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth]]'', a collection of five lectures delivered as part of the [[Massey Lectures]] from October 12 to November 1, 2008. The book was released in anticipation of the lectures, which were also recorded and broadcast on [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-2008-cbc-massey-lectures-payback-debt-and-the-shadow-side-of-wealth-1.2946880|title=The 2008 CBC Massey Lectures, "Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth" {{!}} CBC Radio|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref>

====Chamber opera====
In March 2008, Atwood accepted a [[chamber opera]] commission. Commissioned by [[City Opera of Vancouver]], ''[[Pauline (chamber opera)|Pauline]]'' is set in [[Vancouver]] in March 1913 during the final days of the life of Canadian writer and performer [[Pauline Johnson]].<ref>''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' (March 11, 2008).

==== Graphic fiction ====
In 2016, Atwood began writing the superhero comic book series ''Angel Catbird'', with co-creator and illustrator Johnnie Christmas. The series protagonist, scientist Strig Feleedus, is victim of an accidental mutation that leaves him with the body parts and powers of both a cat and a bird.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/11/490101940/margaret-atwood-plays-with-the-superhero-genre-in-angel-catbird|title=Margaret Atwood Plays With The Superhero Genre In 'Angel Catbird'|publisher=NPR|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> As with her other works, Atwood notes of the series, "The kind of speculative fiction about the future that I write is always based on things that are in process right now. So it's not that I imagine them, it's that I notice that people are working on them and I take it a few steps further down the road. So it doesn't come out of nowhere, it comes out of real life."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/09/492449474/margaret-atwood-i-finally-got-to-do-my-cat-with-wings|title=Margaret Atwood: 'I Finally Got To Do My Cat With Wings'|publisher=NPR|access-date=February 4, 2018}}</ref>

==== Future Library project ====
With her novel ''Scribbler Moon'', Atwood is the first contributor to the [[Future Library project]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/05/27/margaret-atwood-scribbler-moon-future-library/|title=Margaret Atwood submits ''Scribbler Moon'', which won't be read until 2114, to Future Library|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> The work, completed in 2015, was ceremonially handed over to the project on May 27 of the same year.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/margaret-atwood-scribbler-moon-future-library-norway-katie-paterson|title=Into the woods: Margaret Atwood reveals her Future Library book, ''Scribbler Moon''|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=May 27, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> The book will be held by the project until its eventual publishing in 2114.

It's like ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. The texts are going to slumber for 100 years and then they'll wake up, come to life again. It's a fairytale length of time. She slept for 100 years."<ref name=":3" />

====Invention of the LongPen====
In early 2004, while on the paperback tour in Denver for her novel ''Oryx and Crake'', Atwood conceived the concept of a remote robotic writing technology, what would later be known as the [[LongPen]], that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the Internet, thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present. She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, the company shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies. In 2013, the company renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc. In 2021, it is cloud based and offers [[Electronic signature]]-technology. As of May 2021, Atwood is still co-founder and a director of Syngrafii Inc. and holder of various patents related to the LongPen and related technology.<ref name="theguardian.com22">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/06/topstories3.books|title=Atwood sign of the times draws blank|first=Oliver|last=Burkeman|date=March 6, 2006|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref name="investing.businessweek.com22">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks|title=Stocks|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref name="ABSTRACT & PATENT DETAILS22">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipaustralia.com.au/patents/Index.aspx|title=Australian Patents|website=www.ipaustralia.com.au}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.quanser.com/case_study/unotchit/|title=Unotchit|website=Quanser}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.design-engineering.com/motion-control/robotic-arm-extend-authors-signatures-over-cyberspace-10411|title=Robotic arm extend authors' signatures over cyberspace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902020835/http://www.design-engineering.com/motion-control/robotic-arm-extend-authors-signatures-over-cyberspace-10411|archive-date=September 2, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syngrafii.com/about|title=Blending tradition and technology for a more secure world|access-date=16 May 2021}}</ref>

==== Poetry ====
In November 2020 Atwood published ''Dearly,'' a collection of poems exploring absences and endings, ageing and retrospection, and gifts and renewals.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Atwood|first=Margaret|title=Dearly|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1119961/dearly/9781784743895.html|access-date=2020-11-08|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en}}</ref>  The central poem, ''Dearly'', was also published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper along with an essay exploring the passing of time, grief, and how a poem belongs to the reader; this is accompanied by an audio recording of Atwood reading the poem on the newspaper's website.<ref name="The Guardian"/>

== Recurring themes and cultural contexts ==

===Theory of Canadian identity===
Atwood's contributions to the theorizing of Canadian identity have garnered attention both in Canada and internationally. Her principal work of literary criticism, ''[[Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature]]'', is considered somewhat outdated, but remains a standard introduction to [[Canadian literature]] in [[Canadian studies]] programs internationally.<ref name="Moss20062">{{cite book|title="Margaret Atwood: Branding an Icon Abroad" in Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye|last=Moss|first=Laura|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=2006|editor=John Moss|location=Ottawa|page=28|author-link=Laura Moss|editor2=Tobi Kozakewich}}</ref><ref>Chambers, C. M. (1999). A topography for canadian curriculum theory. ''Canadian Journal of Education, 24''(2), 137.</ref><ref>Atwood, M. (July 1, 1999). "Survival, then and now." ''Maclean's, 112'', 54.</ref> The continued reprinting of ''Survival'' by Anansi Press has been criticized as a view-narrowing disservice to students of Canadian literature by some critics, including [[Joseph Pivato]].<ref>[http://canadian-writers.athabascau.ca/english/writers/matwood/survival.php Pivato, Joseph] "Atwood's Survival: A Critique", Canadian Writers, Faculty of Humanities & Social Science, Athabasca University, 1985. Retrieved April 11, 2018.</ref>

In ''Survival'', Atwood postulates that Canadian literature, and by extension Canadian identity, is characterized by the symbol of survival.<ref>{{cite book|title=Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/survivalthematic0000atwo|url-access=registration|last=Atwood|first=Margaret|publisher=Anansi|year=1972|location=Toronto|page=[https://archive.org/details/survivalthematic0000atwo/page/32 32]}}</ref> This symbol is expressed in the omnipresent use of "victim positions" in Canadian literature. These positions represent a scale of self-consciousness and self-actualization for the victim in the "victor/victim" relationship.<ref name="Atwood, M. 1972, 36-422">Atwood, M. (1972), 36–42.</ref> The "victor" in these scenarios may be other humans, nature, the wilderness or other external and internal factors which oppress the victim.<ref name="Atwood, M. 1972, 36-422" /> Atwood's ''Survival'' bears the influence of [[Northrop Frye]]'s theory of [[garrison mentality]]; Atwood uses Frye's concept of Canada's desire to wall itself off from outside influence as a critical tool to analyze Canadian literature.<ref name="Pache20022">{{cite book|title="A Certain Frivolity: Margaret Atwood's Literary Criticism" in Margaret Atwood: Works and Impact|last=Pache|first=Walter|publisher=Anansi|year=2002|editor=Reingard M. Nischik|location=Toronto|page=122}}</ref> According to her theories in works such as ''Survival'' and her exploration of similar themes in her fiction, Atwood considers Canadian literature as the expression of Canadian identity. According to this literature, Canadian identity has been defined by a fear of nature, by settler history, and by unquestioned adherence to the community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Survival : a thematic guide to Canadian literature|author=Atwood Margaret|date=1996|publisher=M & S|isbn=978-0771008320|edition= 1st McClelland & Stewart|location=Toronto, Ontario|oclc=35930298|orig-year=1972}}</ref> In an interview with the [[Scottish national identity|Scottish]] critic Bill Findlay in 1979, Atwood discussed the relationship of Canadian writers and writing to the 'Imperial Cultures' of [[United States|America]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]].<ref>Findlay, Bill (1979), ''Interview with Margaret Atwood', in Bold, Christine (ed.), ''Cencrastus'' No. 1, Autumn 1979, pp. 2 - 6.</ref>

Atwood's contribution to the theorizing of Canada is not limited to her non-fiction works. Several of her works, including ''[[The Journals of Susanna Moodie]]'', ''[[Alias Grace]]'', ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' and ''[[Surfacing (novel)|Surfacing]]'', are examples of what postmodern literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] calls "[[historiographic metafiction]]".<ref name="Howells20062">{{cite book|title="Writing History from The Journals of Susanna Moodie to The Blind Assassin" in Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye|last=Howells|first=Coral Ann|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=2006|editor=John Moss|location=Ottawa|page=111|editor2=Tobi Kozakewich}}</ref> In such works, Atwood explicitly explores the relation of history and narrative and the processes of creating history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Structuralist analysis of Margaret Atwood's novels The Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye, and The Robber Bride |url=http://darhiv.ffzg.unizg.hr/id/eprint/10641/1/2014%20Zeljezic%20diplomski%20-ANG.pdf |access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref>

Among her contributions to Canadian literature, Atwood is a founding trustee of the [[Griffin Poetry Prize]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/about/trustees/|title=Griffin Poetry Prize: The Griffin Trust: Trustees|access-date=June 8, 2014}}</ref> as well as a founder of the [[Writers' Trust of Canada]], a non-profit literary organization that seeks to encourage Canada's writing community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writerstrust.com/About.aspx|title=About Us: The Writers' Trust of Canada|access-date=February 18, 2014}}</ref>

===Feminism===
Atwood's work has been of interest to feminist literary critics, despite Atwood's unwillingness at times to apply the label ''[[Feminism|feminist]]'' to her works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Atwood : feminism and fiction|last=Fiona|first=Tolan|date=2007|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-1435600799|location=Amsterdam|oclc=173507440}}</ref> Starting with the publication of her first novel, ''[[The Edible Woman]]'', Atwood asserted, "I don't consider it feminism; I just consider it social realism."<ref>Kaminski, Margaret, "Preserving Mythologies", ''Margaret Atwood: Conversations'', ed. Earl G. Ingersoll, Princeton, 1990, 27–32.</ref> Despite her rejection of the label at times, critics have analyzed the sexual politics, use of myth and fairytale, and gendered relationships in her work through the lens of feminism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Atwood's fairy-tale sexual politics|last=Rose Wilson|first=Sharon|date=1993|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0585227153|location=Jackson, Mississippi|oclc=44959649}}</ref> She later clarified her discomfort with the label ''feminism'' by stating, "I always want to know what people mean by that word [feminism]. Some people mean it quite negatively, other people mean it very positively, some people mean it in a broad sense, other people mean it in a more specific sense. Therefore, in order to answer the question, you have to ask the person what they mean."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-margaret-atwood-feminism-handmaid-tale-20170424-htmlstory.html|title=Margaret Atwood answers the question: Is 'The Handmaid's Tale' a feminist book?|last=McNamara|first=Mary|website=Los Angeles Times|date=April 24, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> Speaking to ''The Guardian'', she said "<!--It is always – 'What do you mean by the word?' -->For instance, some feminists have historically been against lipstick and letting transgender women into women's washrooms.

In January 2018, Atwood penned the [[op-ed]] "Am I a Bad Feminist?" for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/am-i-a-bad-feminist/article37591823/|title=Am I a bad feminist?|work=The Globe and the Mail|first=Margaret|last=Atwood|date=January 13, 2018|access-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> The piece was in response to social media backlash related to Atwood's signature on a 2016 petition calling for an independent investigation into the firing of [[Steven Galloway]], a former University of British Columbia professor accused of sexual harassment and assault by a student.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42708522|title=Margaret Atwood faces feminist backlash|year=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> While feminist critics denounced Atwood for her support of Galloway, Atwood asserts that her signature was in support of due process in the legal system. She has been criticized for her comments surrounding the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement]], particularly that it is a "symptom of a broken legal system."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/17/margaret-atwood-rips-rape-enabling-bad-feminist-at/ |title=Margaret Atwood rips 'rape-enabling Bad Feminist' attacks over #MeToo scrutiny|work=[[The Washington Times]]|first=Douglas|last=Ernst|date=January 17, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>

In 2018, following a partnership between [[Hulu]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' and women's rights organisation [[Equality Now]], Atwood was honored at their 2018 Make Equality Reality Gala.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/making-equality-reality-gala-margaret-atwood-amandla-stenberg-honored-1166497|title=Margaret Atwood, Amandla Stenberg Honored at Equality Now Gala|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 4, 2018|language=en|access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref> In her acceptance speech she said:

<blockquote>I am, of course, not a real activist—I'm simply a writer without a job who is frequently asked to speak about subjects that would get people with jobs fired if they themselves spoke. You, however, at Equality Now are real activists. I hope people will give Equality Now lots and lots of money, today, so they can write equal laws, enact equal laws and see that equal laws are implemented. That way, in time, all girls may be able to grow up believing that there are no avenues that are closed to them simply because they are girls.<ref name="auto"/></blockquote>

In 2019, Atwood partnered with Equality Now for the release of ''[[The Testaments]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=correspondent|first=Mark Brown Arts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/07/margaret-atwood-to-launch-the-handmaids-tale-sequel-the-testaments-with-live-cinema-broadcast|title=Atwood to launch The Handmaid's Tale sequel with live broadcast|date=March 7, 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=March 5, 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Speculative and science fiction ===
Atwood has resisted the suggestion that ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' are science fiction, suggesting to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2003 that they are [[speculative fiction]] instead: "Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen."<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/26/fiction.margaretatwood|title=Light in the wilderness|last=Potts|first=Robert|date=April 26, 2003|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> She told the [[Book of the Month Club]]: "''Oryx and Crake'' is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper. It contains no intergalactic space travel, no teleportation, no [[Martian]]s."<ref name="langford">[[David Langford|Langford, David]], "Bits and Pieces" [[SFX (magazine)|''SFX'' magazine]] No.&nbsp;107, August 2003 [http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/sfx107.html]</ref> On ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', she explained that science fiction, as opposed to what she herself wrote, was "talking squids in outer space." The latter phrase particularly rankled [[science fiction fandom|advocates of science fiction]] and frequently recurs when her writing is discussed.<ref name="langford" />

In 2005, Atwood said that she does at times write [[social science fiction]] and that ''The Handmaid's Tale'' and ''Oryx and Crake'' can be designated as such. She clarified her meaning on the difference between speculative and science fiction, admitting that others use the terms interchangeably: "For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do&nbsp;... speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand and that takes place on Planet Earth." She said that science fiction narratives give a writer the ability to explore themes in ways that realistic fiction cannot.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/17/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.margaretatwood Atwood, Margaret.

Atwood further clarified her definitions of terms in 2011, stating in response to a discussion with [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] that: "what Le Guin means by 'science fiction' is what I mean by 'speculative fiction', and what she means by 'fantasy' would include what I mean by 'science fiction'."<ref name=atwood-2011>{{cite book |title=In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination |chapter=Introduction |chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/In_Other_Worlds/8hOBecTcjtcC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA7 |pages=6–8 |last=Atwood|first=Margaret |year=2011 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |isbn= 978-0-385-53397-3 }}</ref> She added that genre borders were increasingly fluid, and that all forms of "SF" might be placed under a common larger umbrella.<ref name=atwood-2011/>

=== Animal rights ===
Atwood repeatedly makes observations about the relationship of humans to animals in her works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Real and Imaginary Animals in the Poetry of Margaret Atwood|last=Vogt|first=Kathleen|year=1988|work=Margaret Atwood: Visions and Forms|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=VanSpanckeren, Kathryn; Castro, Jan Garden|isbn=978-0585106298|location=Carbondale|page=164|oclc=43475939}}</ref> A large portion of the [[dystopia]] Atwood creates in ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' rests upon the genetic modification and alteration of animals and humans, resulting in hybrids such as pigoons, rakunks, wolvogs, and Crakers, which function to raise questions on the limits and ethics of science and technology, as well as questions on what it means to be human.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sanderson|first=Jay|title=Pigoons, Rakunks and Crakers: Margaret Atwood's ''Oryx and Crake'' and Genetically Engineered Animals in a (Latourian) Hybrid World|journal=Law and Humanities|volume=7|issue=2|pages=218–239|doi=10.5235/17521483.7.2.218|year=2013|s2cid=144221386}}</ref>

In ''[[Surfacing (novel)|Surfacing]]'', one character remarks about eating animals: "The animals die that we may live, they are substitute people&nbsp;... And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life." Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In ''[[The Edible Woman]]'', Atwood's character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fiancé's experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.<ref name=Adams>Carol J. Adams. 2006. ''The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory''. The Continuum International Publishing Group. pp. 141–142, 152, 195, 197.</ref>

In ''[[Cat's Eye (novel)|Cat's Eye]]'', the narrator recognizes the similarity between a turkey and a baby. She looks at "the turkey, which resembles a trussed, headless baby. It has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is, a large dead bird." In Atwood's ''Surfacing'', a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths.<ref name=Adams />

Atwood is a [[Pescetarianism|pescetarian]]. In a 2009 interview she stated that "I shouldn't use the term vegetarian because I'm allowing myself gastropods, crustaceans and the occasional fish. Nothing with fur or feathers though".<ref>Wright, Laura. (2015). ''The Vegan Studies Project: Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror''.

=== Political involvement ===
Atwood has indicated in an interview that she considers herself a [[Red Tory]] in what she sees as the historical sense of the term, saying that "The Tories were the ones who believed that those in power had a responsibility to the community, that money should not be the measure of all things."<ref>[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]:[https://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/1997/07/visions.html "Margaret Atwood: The activist author of ''Alias Grace'' and ''The Handmaid's Tale'' discusses the politics of art and the art of the con"].

Atwood has strong views on environmental issues, and she and [[Graeme Gibson]] were the joint honorary presidents of the Rare Bird Club within [[BirdLife International]]. Atwood celebrated her 70th birthday at a gala dinner at [[Laurentian University]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. She stated that she had chosen to attend the event because the city has been home to one of Canada's most ambitious environmental reclamation programs: "When people ask if there's hope (for the environment), I say, if Sudbury can do it, so can you. Having been a symbol of desolation, it's become a symbol of hope."<ref>[http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2009/nov/atwood-231109.aspx "Sudbury a symbol of hope: Margaret Atwood"].

In her [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985), all the developments take place near Boston in the United States, now known as Gilead, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape.
