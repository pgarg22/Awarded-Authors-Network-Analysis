=== Influence ===
White had an influence on many writers as a mentor and friend. In her book ''Wild Mind'', the author [[Natalie Goldberg]] credits White with giving her "permission" to be a poet.<ref name="goldberg">{{citation |title=Wild Mind: Living the Writer's Life |first=Natalie |last=Goldberg |authorlink=Natalie Goldberg |year=1990 |publisher=Bantam Books |page=122}}</ref>  Others were influenced by the content of White's poetry.  [[Mark Doty]] credits White as an early influence on his work and has written poetry in his honor.<ref name="doty">{{citation |title=Turtle, Swan and Bethlehem in Broad Daylight: Two Volumes of Poetry |first=Mark |last=Doty |authorlink=Mark Doty |year=1999 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=140}}</ref>  The poet [[Carl Phillips]] has written that White's ''The Salt Ecstasies'' was the first book he read that "spoke with disarming honesty about gay desire, desire generally, sex specifically."  He credits White's book as a "crucial voice" he encountered as he began as a poet.<ref name="Teare">{{citation |title=Coin of the Realm: Essays on the Art and Life of Poetry |first=Carl |last=Phillips |authorlink=Carl Phillips |year=2004 |publisher=Graywolf Press |page=185}}</ref> Poet [[Brian Teare]] has cited White as a major influence, revealing that he made a "pilgrimage" to White's Indianapolis grave while in graduate school.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Perry speaks with LAMBDA Award nominated poet Brian Teare|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4hq3FWVwY|website=Youtube}}</ref>

=== ''James White Review'' ===

Soon after White's death a literary quarterly of gay men's writing was inaugurated under the name ''James White Review''. Each issue contained poetry, prose, photography and other artwork and later issues contained book reviews. It was first published in Minneapolis in 1983, then publication moved to Washington, D.C. in 1998, and continued until 2005 when the [[Lambda Literary Foundation]], its second publisher, stopped publication.  The [[White Crane Institute]] is the current{{when|date=September 2011}} holder of the archives of the review and is considering options for future issues of the review.

=== James White Poetry Prize ===
In the spring of 2008, the White Crane Institute and Phil Willkie announced the establishment of a biennial gay men's poetry prize in honor of White, who was [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]].<ref name="outside">{{citation |title=Outside the Lines |first=Christopher Matthew |last=Hennessy |page=79 |isbn=0-472-09873-X |year=2005 |publisher=Univ. of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor }}</ref>  The White Crane/James White Poetry Prize is a manuscript prize honoring "excellence in Gay Male Poetry."  The judge for the inaugural year of the prize was the poet [[Mark Doty]].
