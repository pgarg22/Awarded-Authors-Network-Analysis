'''Ferdinand Bruckner''' (born '''Theodor Tagger'''; 26 August 1891, in [[Sofia]], [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] &ndash; 5 December 1958, in [[Berlin]]) was an [[Austria]]n-German writer and theater manager. Although his works are relatively rarely revived, ''Krankheit der Jugend'' was put on at the Cottesloe stage of London's [[Royal National Theatre]] in 2009, under the title ''Pains of Youth''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/sites/all/libraries/files/documents/Pains_of_Youth_background_pack%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226231118/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/sites/all/libraries/files/documents/Pains_of_Youth_background_pack%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-26 }}</ref> It was directed by [[Katie Mitchell]] and was met with very mixed reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/6467519/Pains-of-Youth-at-the-National-Theatre-review.html|title = Pains of Youth at the National Theatre, review}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/pains-of-youth-national-theatre-london-1811073.html|title = Pains of Youth, National Theatre, London|date = 29 October 2009}}</ref> Bruckner's play ''Die Rassen'' under the title ''Race'' was revived in 2001, in New York, by the Classical Stage Company. The critic John Simon called it "both scarily suspenseful and heartbreakingly elegant..."  Simon concluded that the play: " comes as close as anything I know to explaining how a cultured nation hurtled into stupefying barbarity."<ref>New York Magazine, March 5, 2001</ref>

==Life==
Bruckner's father was an Austrian businessman and his mother a [[France|French]] translator. After the separation of his parents, he spent time in [[Vienna]] and [[Paris]], and in [[Berlin]] where he began to study music. However, impressed by the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] literary scene in Berlin, in 1916 he moved away from music and devoted himself to poetry. In the following years, he published several poetry collections and in 1917 he began the literary magazine ''Marsyas'' with texts from authors like [[Alfred DÃ¶blin]] and [[Hermann Hesse]]. In 1922, he founded the Berlin Renaissance Theater, whose leadership he gave to [[Gustav Hartung]] in 1928.

In 1929 and 1930 he released the pieces ''Krankheit der Jugend'' (Illness'' of Youth'') und ''Elisabeth von England'' (''Elizabeth of England'') using the [[pseudonym]] ''Ferdinand Bruckner''. Bruckner reviewed some of his own plays under his real name. After the success of these works, he revealed their authorship, although he also changed his name itself in 1946.

In 1933 he emigrated to Paris and worked on the anti-fascist play ''Die Rassen''. In 1936, he moved to the [[United States]], although he achieved little success there. In 1953, twenty years after he left Germany, he returned to [[Berlin]] where he worked as an advisor to the [[Schillertheater|Schiller Theater]]. He also wrote a ''Historiche Dramen.''He died in Berlin on December 5, 1958.
