'''Edmund Mary Bolton''' (c.1575â€“c.1633) was an English [[historian]] and [[poet]] who was born, by his own account, in 1575.

==Life==
Nothing is known of his family or origins, although he referred to himself as a distant relative of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]]. Brought up a [[Roman Catholic]], he was educated at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=BLTN589E|name=Bolton, Edmund}}</ref> Bolton then lived in London at the [[Inner Temple]]. Both at Cambridge and in London, he participated in the literary life of the time. At Cambridge, he met [[John Selden]], [[John Coke]], and others. In London, he wrote occasional verse, contributing poems to ''[[England's Helicon]]'', and [[commendatory verse]]s to [[William Camden]]'s ''Brittania'' and [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]]''. He became a retainer of Villiers, and through the Duke's influence, Bolton secured a small place at the court of [[James I of England|James I]]. Bolton married Margaret Porter, the sister of [[Endymion Porter]], another of the Duke's retinue and a minor poet.

Throughout his life, Bolton was oppressed by scarcity, about which he freely informed his numerous prospective patrons. These included, at one time or another, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Cecil]], [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]], and even [[Edward Alleyn]]. He was caught up in Charles's campaign against [[recusancy]] in 1628; he was imprisoned first in the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and then in [[Marshalsea]], where he languished for want of a person of power to intercede for him.

Bolton was still living in 1633, but he appears to have died in that year or shortly after.

==Proposed Academy==
With the support of Villiers, Bolton advanced a scheme for an [[Proposals for an English Academy|English Academy]]. He proposed a three-part structure. The academy would include learned aristocrats as auxiliary members, and the Lord Chancellor and the two university chancellors as "tutelaries"; but the heart of the enterprise was to be the group of "essentials" who would carry on the work of licensing publications that did not fall under the purview of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and advancing [[antiquarian]] and historical study. James seems to have approved of the proposal, but the plan died with that king.

==Works==
One of the most important of his numerous works is ''Hypercritica'', a short critical treatise begun about 1618 but not finished till 1621 (a date establishable by examination of its manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]], which refers to Bolton's contemporary [[Francis Bacon]] as Viscount St Alban, a title Bacon acquired in that year). This is valuable for its notices of contemporary authors such as [[Ben Jonson]], whom he praises as the greatest English poet; this manuscript was reprinted in [[Joseph Haslewood]]'s ''Ancient Critical Essays'' (vol. ii., 1815). Another important work of his is ''Nero Caesar, or Monarchie Depraved'' (1624), which takes special note of British affairs. Unsurprisingly, Bolton praised the virtues of strong monarchy and asserted the horror of any rebellion, even against unjust authority. In the preface, Bolton hints that James had encouraged the work, and the language of the whole text is a more or less evident bid for the patronage of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. The bid failed.

''Hypercritica'' was a kind of prolegomenon to Bolton's most ambitious project, never completed: an updated history of Britain based on archives and other original sources, free of both the cant of medieval historians and the clumsiness of Tudor chroniclers such as [[John Stow|Stow]]. Like the Academy, this work never materialized, though Bolton continued to work on related projects throughout his life. In the early 1630s, he attempted to interest London's city government in an updated history of the city in English and Latin. After some initial interest, the aldermen balked at the cost (more than 3000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]). Shortly before his death, Bolton gave the manuscript to Selden; it is now lost.<ref>But see T.H. Blackburn, 'Edmund Bolton's "London, King Charles his Augusta, or City Royal",' ''Huntington Library Quarterly'', Vol. 25 no. 4 (August 1962), 315-23, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3816379?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents (at Jstor)].</ref> Also was thought  lost a companion to the work on [[Nero]], a biography of [[Tiberius]]. But it was bought by [[Angelico Aprosio|Aprosio]] a collector from Ventimiglia in the 17th century and then sold to Giacomo Filippo Durazzo  and now is part of the Durazziana.
