== Biography ==
Clarence Major was born on December 31, 1936, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing-biographies/clarence-major|title=Clarence Major 1936–|website=[[Encyclopedia.com]]|date=May 11, 2018|access-date=November 15, 2021}}</ref> and grew up in [[Chicago]], Illinois. As a teenager he started drawing and painting, writing poetry and fiction.

In his early twenties he started publishing his own literary magazine, ''Coercion Review'', which featured poets and writers such as [[Henry Miller]], [[Kenneth Patchen]] and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]. As a teenager Major was influenced by the monumental [[Van Gogh]] Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], February 1 – April 16, 1950.

After a stint in the Air Force he left the Midwest and moved to [[New York City]] in December 1966. His first novel, ''All Night Visitors'', was published in 1969 and his first collection of poems, ''Swallow the Lake'', the following year. He briefly worked as a research analyst for Simulmatics, under the direction of sociologist Dr. Sol Chaneles. Major analyzed news coverage of the 1960s riots. He also did field work on the riots, in [[Detroit]] and [[Milwaukee]], before turning, in 1967, to teaching.

First, he taught in Harlem at the [[New Lincoln School]], in a summer program. He later taught modern American literature courses and creative writing workshops in universities. His first solo exhibition of paintings was at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in the library in the early 1970s. Along with [[John A. Williams]], in 1968, he taught for a stint at Girard College in Philadelphia.<ref name="jrank.org">{{Cite web|title=Clarence Major Biography|url=https://biography.jrank.org/pages/4549/Major-Clarence.html|access-date=October 12, 2020|website=biography.jrank.org|language=en}}</ref>

During this time Major was also giving public readings of his poetry. He served on the editorial staff of several literary periodicals (such as ''Caw!'' and ''The Journal of Black Poetry'') and wrote a regular column for ''American Poetry Review''. He was the first editor of ''American Book Review''. He read his poetry at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], the [[Folger Theatre]] and in universities, theaters and cultural centers.

He joined the Fiction Collective in 1974. Major edited ''High Plains Literary Review'' for several years. On a [[State Department]]-sponsored trip in 1975 he was a participant at the International Poetry Festival in [[Struga]], [[Yugoslavia]], where he read his work with [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]] and other poets from around the world. In 1977, with [[John Ashbery]] and other poets from various countries, Major read at the Poetry International in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands. Although he had been painting all along, after moving to [[California]] in 1989 he showed his paintings more frequently in galleries.

In 1991 Major served as fiction judge for the [[National Book Awards]]. In 1987 he served twice on the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Awards panels; and in 1997–98 he served as judge for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]]. He has judged state-sponsored literary contests in [[Ohio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Washington, Colorado and California.

Major is distinguished professor emeritus of 20th-Century American Literature at the [[University of California at Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.ucdavis.edu/people/cmajor|title=Clarence Major {{!}} Professor Emeritus|publisher=Department of English, UC Davis}}</ref> His literary archives are in the [[Givens Collection of African American Literature]], [[Anderson Library]] of Rare Books and Manuscripts, [[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].
