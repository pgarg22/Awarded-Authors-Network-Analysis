==Publications==
Meriton published two plays in 1658, ''Love and War, a Tragedy'', dedicated to his brother George, and ''The Wandering Lover, a Tragy-Comedie'', which, according to the title-page, had been "acted severall times privately at sundry places by the Author and his friends, with great applause." In the dedication to Francis Wright he mentions that he had also written ''The Severall Affairs, a Comedy'', and ''The Chast Virgin, a Romance'', but that they were only shown to some private friends.<ref name="dnb00"/><ref name="odnb"/>

"Happy certainly", said the contemporary drama critic [[Gerard Langbaine]], "were those men who were not reckoned in the number of his friends." Langbaine described him as "certainly the meanest Dramatick writer that ever England produc'd".<ref name="dnb00"/>
