'''Maffeo Vegio''' ({{lang-la|Maphaeus Vegius}}) (1407–1458) was an [[Italy|Italian]] poet who wrote in [[Latin]]; he is regarded by many as the finest Latin poet of the fifteenth century.

Born near [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], he studied at the [[University of Pavia]], and went on to write some fifty works of both prose and poetry.

His greatest reputation came as the writer of brief [[epic poetry|epics]], the most famous of which was his continuation of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', known variously as the ''Supplementum'' (Supplement) or ''Aeneidos Liber XIII'' (Book 13 of the ''Aeneid''). Completed in 1428, this 600-line poem starts immediately after the end of Virgil's epic, and describes Aeneas's marriage to Lavinia and his eventual deification. It is elegantly written, and its combination of classical learning and piety made it very popular in its day; it was often included in editions of the ''Aeneid'' in the fifteenth and sixteenth-centuries. An electronic text can be found at the [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/vegius.html Latin Library].

Vegio also wrote an epic ''[[Astyanax]]'' (1430), on the death of the son of Hector, prince of Troy, and a four-book epic ''Vellus Aureum'' (the [[Golden Fleece]]) (1431).  During 1436–37 he completed his epic on the life of the [[Christians|Christian]] [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]], the ''Antoniad''.  [[Michael C. J. Putnam]] edited and translated Vegio's ''Short Epics'' for the [[I Tatti Renaissance Library]] (Harvard University Press).

Vegio flattered his way into the papal court, and was made [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in 1443; it was an office he held until his death in 1458.

Some of Vegio's poems were later set as motets by renaissance composers – an example being ''Huc me sidereo'', set by [[Josquin]], [[Jacobus Vaet]], [[Orlando Di Lasso]] and the first motet of [[Adrian Willaert]]'s 1559 ''Musica Nova'' collection.<ref>Orlando Di Lasso,  Complete Motets: Vol.6 Peter Bergquist 1997 – Page xix ""Huc me sidéreo": Gustave Reese ascribes the poem to Maffeo Vegio (or Veggio, 1407–58), a minor Italian humanist.25 The poem was set several times before Lasso, including settings by Josquin, Willaert, and Jacobus Vaet.26"</ref>
