==Life and career==
Adair was born in [[Edinburgh]]{{efn|Most sources give Adair's place of birth as "Edinburgh"; however, one article originally published on the [[British Film Institute]] website<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/reviews/releases/gilbert-adair-that-sinking-feeling-and-gregory's-girl.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323004410/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/reviews/releases/gilbert-adair-that-sinking-feeling-and-gregory's-girl.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 March 2019 |title=One elephant, two elephant: That Sinking Feeling and Gregory's Girl |last=Adair |first=Gilbert |date=Summer 1981 |website=old.bfi.org.uk via the [[Wayback Machine]] |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref> gives his birthplace as [[Kilmarnock]]. Also, the birth of only one Gilbert Adair is recorded for 1944–45 on the [[Scottish Government]] website https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/, and the place of registration is Kilmarnock.}} but from 1968 to 1980 he lived in Paris.<ref name=SJRB/> His early works of fiction included ''[[Alice Through the Needle's Eye]]'' (following ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'') and ''Peter Pan and the Only Children''<ref>[http://neverpedia.com/pan/Peter_Pan_and_the_Only_Children ''Peter Pan and the Only Children''], at Neverpedia.com</ref> (following ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''). He won the [[Author's Club First Novel Award]] in 1988 for his novel ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]''. From 1992 to 1996 he wrote the "Scrutiny" column for ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. During 1998 and 1999 he was the chief film critic of ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', where in 1999 he also wrote a year-long column called "The Guillotine".<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Higgins|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/gilbert-adair--acerbic-astute-and-a-true-cinephile-6275534.html|title=Gilbert Adair – acerbic, astute and a true cinephile|work=[[The Independent]]|date=11 December 2011}}</ref>

In 1995 he won the [[Scott Moncrieff Translation Prize]] for his book ''[[A Void]]'', which is a translation of the French book ''La Disparition'' by [[Georges Perec]]. The original book contains no instances of the letter ''e''; Adair translated it with the same limitation. His works are compared to those of [[Julian Barnes]], [[A. S. Byatt]] and [[Patrick Gale]].{{by whom|date=February 2015}} His book ''Flickers: A History of the Cinema in 100 Images'' was admired by [[David Foster Wallace]].<ref>[[Glenn Kenny]].

The film ''Love and Death on Long Island'' (1997), directed by [[Richard Kwietniowski]], was based on his 1990 novel of the same name. The film ''[[The Dreamers (2003 film)|The Dreamers]]'' (2003) directed by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], with a script by Adair, was based on his book ''The Holy Innocents'', which Adair revised and re-released under the same title as the film. Adair collaborated on the screenplays of several [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] films: ''[[The Territory]]'' (1981), ''[[Klimt (film)|Klimt]]'' (2006) and ''[[A Closed Book (film)|A Closed Book]]'' (2010).<ref name=Sight>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/featuresandinterviews/features/gilbert-adair-rubicon-and-rubik-cube.php "The rubicon and the rubik cube: Exile, paradox and Raúl Ruiz"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417215637/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/featuresandinterviews/features/gilbert-adair-rubicon-and-rubik-cube.php |date=17 April 2012 }}, ''Sight & Sound'', Winter 1981/1982.</ref>

Adair was [[homosexuality|gay]], though he rarely talked about the matter, not wishing to be labelled. "Obviously there are gay themes in a lot of my novels," he said in an interview soon before he died, "but I really wouldn't be happy to be thought of as a 'Gay Writer' ... Being gay hasn't defined my life."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/9031191/Gilbert-Adair.html |title=Gilbert Adair Obituary |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=March 17, 2021}}</ref> At the end of his life, he lived in London. Adair died from a brain haemorrhage on 8 December 2011, at age 66, 13 months after suffering a stroke which blinded him.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/henry-porter-gilbert-adair-on-human-kindness "My dying friend found kindness to be the rule, not the exception"], ''The Observer'', 10 December 2011</ref> He was writing a stage version of ''Love and Death on Long Island'', which was being developed by producers New Gods and Heroes, at the time of his death.<ref name=SJRB/>
