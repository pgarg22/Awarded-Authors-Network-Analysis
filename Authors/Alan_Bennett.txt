'''Alan Bennett''' (born 9 May 1934) is an English actor, author, playwright and screenwriter. He was born in [[Leeds]] and attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], where he studied history and performed with [[the Oxford Revue]]. He stayed to teach and research [[medieval history]] at the university for several years. His collaboration as writer and performer with [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Peter Cook]] in the satirical revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' at the 1960 [[Edinburgh Festival]] brought him instant fame. He gave up academia, and turned to writing full-time, his first stage play, ''[[Forty Years On (play)|Forty Years On]]'', being produced in 1968.

Bennett’s work includes ''[[The Madness of George III]]'' and [[The Madness of King George|its film adaptation]], the series of monologues ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads]]'', [[The History Boys|the play]] and subsequent [[The History Boys (film)|film of]] ''The History Boys'', and audio books, including his readings of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]''.

==Early life==
Bennett was born in [[Armley]] in [[Leeds]].<ref name = "LRB article">{{Cite journal |last = Bennett |first = Alan |year = 2014 |title = Fair Play |url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n12/alan-bennett/fair-play |journal = [[London Review of Books]] |volume = 36 |issue = 12 |pages = 29–30 |access-date = 13 June 2014 }}</ref> The younger son of a [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] butcher, Walter, and his wife Lilian Mary (née Peel), Bennett attended Christ Church, Upper Armley, Church of England School (in the same class as [[Barbara Taylor Bradford]]), and then [[Leeds Modern School]] (now [[Lawnswood School]]).

He learned [[Russian language|Russian]] at the [[Joint Services School for Linguists]] during his [[national service]] before applying for a [[Scholarship Level|scholarship]] at Oxford University. He was accepted by [[Exeter College, Oxford]], from which he graduated with a [[British degree classification|first-class]] degree in history. While at Oxford he performed comedy with a number of eventually successful actors in the [[The Oxford Revue|Oxford Revue]]. He remained at the university for several years, where he served as a junior lecturer of [[Medieval History]] at [[Magdalen College]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Alan Bennett: timeline of the writer's life |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-lady-in-the-van/alan-bennett-timeline/ |access-date=4 January 2019 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> before deciding, in 1960, that he was not suited to being an academic.

==Career==
[[File:Beyond the Fringe original cast.JPG|thumb|Bennett (second left) in ''Beyond the Fringe'' on Broadway {{circa}} 1962]]
In August 1960, Bennett – along with [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Peter Cook]] – gained fame after an appearance at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in the satirical revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', with the show continuing in London and New York. He also appeared in ''[[My Father Knew Lloyd George (TV programme)|My Father Knew Lloyd George]]''. His television comedy sketch series ''[[On the Margin]]'' (1966) was erased; the [[BBC]] re-used expensive videotape rather than keep it in the archives. However, in 2014 it was announced that audio copies of the entire series had been found.<ref>{{cite news |title = Alan Bennett's lost series On The Margin is recovered|date=17 March 2014 | website = [[BBC News Online]] | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26609104}}</ref>

Bennett's first stage play ''[[Forty Years On (play)|Forty Years On]],'' directed by [[Patrick Garland]], was produced in 1968. Many television, stage and radio plays followed, with screenplays, short stories, novellas, a large body of non-fictional prose, and broadcasting and many appearances as an actor.

Despite a long history with both the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and the BBC, Bennett never writes on commission, saying "I don't work on commission, I just do it on spec. If people don't want it then it's too bad."<ref>{{cite web  | last = Seale | first = Jack |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-09-27/heres-one-i-wrote-earlier-alan-bennett-on-denmark-hill |title=Here's one I wrote earlier: Alan Bennett on Denmark Hill |website=[[Radio Times]] |access-date = 2020-02-03 | date = 2014-09-27}}</ref>

His many works for television include his first play for the medium, ''A Day Out'' in 1972,  ''A Little Outing'' in 1977, ''Intensive Care'' in 1982, ''An Englishman Abroad'' in 1983, and ''[[A Question of Attribution]]'' in 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} But perhaps his most famous screen work is the 1988 ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads]]'' series of monologues for television which were later performed at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London in 1992. A second set of six ''Talking Heads'' followed a decade later.

In his 2005 prose collection ''Untold Stories'', Bennett wrote of the mental illness that his mother and other family members suffered.

He wrote ''[[The Lady in the Van]]'' based on his experiences with an eccentric woman called [[Margaret Fairchild|Miss Shepherd]], who lived on Bennett's driveway in a series of dilapidated vans for more than fifteen years. It was first published in 1989 as an essay in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''. In 1990 he published it in book form.  In 1999 he adapted it into a stage play, which starred [[Maggie Smith]] and was directed by [[Nicholas Hytner]]. The stage play includes two characters named Alan Bennett. On 21 February 2009 it was broadcast as a radio play on BBC Radio 4, with Maggie Smith reprising her role and Alan Bennett playing himself. He adapted the story again for a 2015 film, with Maggie Smith reprising her role again, and Nicholas Hytner directing again. In the film [[Alex Jennings]] plays the two versions of Bennett, although Alan Bennett appears in a cameo at the very end of the film.

Bennett adapted his 1991 play ''[[The Madness of George III]]'' for the cinema. Entitled ''[[The Madness of King George]]'' (1994), the film received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations: for Bennett's writing and the performances of [[Nigel Hawthorne]] and [[Helen Mirren]]. It won the award for best art direction.

Bennett's critically acclaimed ''[[The History Boys]]'' won three [[Laurence Olivier Award]]s in 2005, for Best New Play, Best Actor ([[Richard Griffiths]]), and Best Direction ([[Nicholas Hytner]]), having previously won [[Critics' Circle Theatre Awards]] and [[Evening Standard Awards]] for Best Actor and Best Play. Bennett also received the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Theatre.<ref>Jury, Louise.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100223202113/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/historic-night-for-alan-bennett-as-his-new-play-dominates-the-olivier-awards-746003.html "Historic night for Alan Bennett as his new play dominates the Olivier awards"], ''The Independent'', 21 February 2005</ref> ''The History Boys'' won six [[Tony Awards]] on Broadway, including best play, best performance by a leading actor in a play (Richard Griffiths), best performance by a featured actress in a play ([[Frances de la Tour]]) and best direction of a play (Nicholas Hytner). A film version of ''[[The History Boys (film)|The History Boys]]'' was released in the UK in October 2006.

Bennett wrote the play ''[[Enjoy (play)|Enjoy]]'' in 1980. It barely scraped a run of seven weeks at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], in spite of the stellar cast of [[Joan Plowright]], [[Colin Blakely]], [[Susan Littler]], Philip Sayer, [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] (who replaced [[Joan Hickson]] during rehearsals) and, in his first West End role, [[Marc Sinden]]. It was directed by [[Ronald Eyre]].<ref>Shenton, Mark.[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/aug/28/whichflopsareripeforreviv "Which flops are ripe for revival?"] Theatre Blog, ''The Guardian'', 28 August 2008</ref> A new production of ''Enjoy'' attracted very favourable notices during its 2008 UK tour<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/feb/06/alan-bennett-enjoy-theatre Let's enjoy Alan Bennett's revival play for what it is – Daniel Tapper on Alan Bennett's Enjoy] guardian.co.uk, 6 February 2009</ref> and moved to the West End of London in January 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090207142329/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/charlesspencer/4445302/Enjoy-by-Alan-Bennett-at-the-Geilgud-Theatre-review.html Enjoy by Alan Bennett at the Gielgud Theatre, review] ''The Daily Telegraph'', 3 February 2009</ref> The West End show took over £1&nbsp;million in advance ticket sales<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859706.stm Curtain re-opens on Bennett Play] BBC News, 29 January 2009</ref> and even extended the run to cope with demand.<ref>[https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/theatre-news/news/bennetts-enjoy-extends-two-weeks-to-16-may-2009 Bennett's Enjoy extends two weeks to 16 May 2009] London Theatre, 18 February 2009</ref> The production starred [[Alison Steadman]], [[David Troughton]], Richard Glaves, Carol Macready and [[Josie Walker]].

Bennett lived for 40 years on [[Gloucester Crescent, Camden|Gloucester Crescent]] in [[Camden Town]] in London but now lives a few minutes' walk away at [[Primrose Hill]] with his partner Rupert Thomas, the editor of ''[[The World of Interiors]]'' magazine.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/14/theatre3 The Guardian profile: Alan Bennett] ''The Guardian''. 14 May 2004</ref> Bennett also had a long-term relationship with his former housekeeper, Anne Davies, until her death in 2009.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/alan-bennett-reveals-that-his-lover-caf-anne-is-dead-1825391.html Alan Bennett reveals that his lover, 'Café Anne', is dead] ''The Independent'', 22 November 2009</ref>

Bennett is an [[agnosticism|agnostic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-24/alan-bennett-you-have-to-be-careful-about-becoming-an-old-git/|work=[[Radio Times]]|title=Alan Bennett: "You have to be careful about becoming an old git"|date=24 December 2016|access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> He was raised [[Anglican]] and gradually "left it [the Church] over the years".<ref>{{YouTube|wAl74KQ_IZI}}</ref>

In 1988, Bennett declined the award of [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) and in 1996 declined a [[knighthood]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/sir-alan-oh-no-itd-be-like-wearing-a-suit-every-day-1693491.html Playwright who rejected a knighthood says he's probably the last real monarchist left in Britain] ''The Independent'', 31 May 2009</ref>

In September 2005, Bennett revealed that, in 1997, he had undergone treatment for [[colorectal cancer]], and described the illness as a "bore". His chances of survival were given as being "much less" than 50% and surgeons had told him they removed a "rock-bun" sized tumour.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4277976.stm "Alan Bennett reveals cancer fight"], ''BBC News'', 24 September 2005</ref> He began ''Untold Stories'' (published 2005) thinking it would be published posthumously, but his cancer went into remission.

In the autobiographical sketches which form a large part of the book Bennett wrote openly for the first time about his bisexuality. Previously Bennett had referred to questions about his sexuality as like asking a man who has just crawled across the [[Sahara]] desert to choose between [[Perrier]] or [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] mineral water.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3612508/Inside-Bennetts-fridge.html "Inside Bennett's fridge"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 30 October 2004</ref>

In October 2008, Bennett announced that he was donating his entire archive of working papers, unpublished manuscripts, diaries and books to the [[Bodleian Library]], stating that it was a gesture of thanks repaying a debt he felt he owed to the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|British welfare state]] that had given him educational opportunities which his humble family background would otherwise never have afforded.<ref>Kennedy, Maev [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/24/alan-bennett-oxford-university "A small way of saying thank you: Bennett donates his life's work to the Bodleian"], ''The Guardian'', 24 October 2008</ref>–°≈±

In September 2015, Bennett endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s campaign in the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Labour Party leadership election]].

Bennett was made an Honorary Fellow of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], in 1987. He was also awarded a [[D.Litt]] by the [[University of Leeds]] in 1990<ref>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/443/an_evening_with_alan_bennett An evening with Alan Bennett] University of Leeds, 29 October 2007</ref> and an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Kingston University]] in 1996. In 1998 he refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, in protest at its acceptance of funding for a chair from press baron [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/255738.stm "Bennett snubs Oxford over Murdoch chair"], BBC News, 15 January 1999</ref> He also declined a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1988 and a knighthood in 1996.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/07/alan-bennett-birthday-writing?INTCMP=SRCH "Birthday boy" – Blake Morrison salutes Alan Bennett as the writer approaches his 75th birthday] ''The Guardian'', 7 May 2009</ref> He has stated that, although he is not a republican, he would never wish to be knighted, saying it would be a bit like having to wear a suit for the rest of his life.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/frontrow/archive.shtml Featured interview: Alan Bennett In Conversation] ''Front Row'' archive, BBC Radio 4 (Audio, 1 hr)</ref>

In December 2011 Bennett returned to [[Lawnswood School]], nearly 60 years after he left, to unveil the renamed Alan Bennett Library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/alan_bennett_playwright_returns_to_leeds_school_video_1_4048939|title=Alan Bennett: Playwright returns to Leeds school VIDEO}}</ref> He said he "loosely" based ''The History Boys'' on his experiences at the school and his admission to Oxford. Lawnswood School dedicated its library to the writer after he emerged as a vocal campaigner against public library cuts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16110234|title=Alan Bennett warns over tuition fees|work=BBC News}}</ref> Plans to shut local libraries were "wrong and very short-sighted", Bennett said, adding: "We're impoverishing young people."
