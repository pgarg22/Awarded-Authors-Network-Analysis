'''Tove Marika Jansson''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈtuːve ˈjɑːnson|fi|Sv-Tove_Jansson.ogg}}; 9 August 1914 – 27 June 2001) was a [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking Finn]]ish author, novelist, painter, [[illustrator]] and [[comic strip]] author. Brought up by artistic parents, Jansson studied art from 1930 to 1938 in [[Stockholm]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Paris]]. Her first solo art exhibition was in 1943. At the same time, she was writing short stories and articles for publication, as well as creating the graphics for book covers and other purposes. She continued to work as an artist and a writer for the rest of her life.

Jansson wrote the ''[[Moomins|Moomin]]'' books for children, starting in 1945 with ''[[The Moomins and the Great Flood]]''. The next two books, ''[[Comet in Moominland]]'' and ''[[Finn Family Moomintroll]]'', published in 1946 and 1948 respectively, were highly successful in sales, adding to sales of the first book. For her work as a children's writer she received the [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] in 1966.<ref name=andersen/><ref name=ibby-jansson/>

Starting with the semi-autobiographical {{lang|sv|Bildhuggarens dotter}} (''Sculptor's Daughter'') in 1968, Jansson wrote six novels, including the admired<ref name="Westin">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF1gAgAAQBAJ&q=Sommarboken+Boel+Westin&pg=PT324 |title=Tove Jansson - Ord, bild, liv |last=Westin |first=Boel |publisher=Albert Bonniers |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-51-501672-0 |language=sv }}</ref> {{lang|sv|Sommarboken}} (''[[The Summer Book]]''), and five books of short stories for adults.

== Early life ==
[[File:Tove Jansson 1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jansson in 1923]]

Tove Jansson was born in [[Helsinki]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], a part of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time. Her family, part of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] minority of [[Finland]], was an artistic one: her father, [[Viktor Jansson]], was a sculptor, and her mother, [[Signe Hammarsten-Jansson]], was a Swedish-born [[graphic designer]] and illustrator. Tove's siblings also became artists: [[Per Olov Jansson]] became a photographer and [[Lars Jansson (cartoonist)|Lars Jansson]] an author and cartoonist. Whilst their home was in [[Helsinki]], the family spent many of their summers in a rented cottage on an island near [[Porvoo]], {{convert|50|km|abbr=in}} east of Helsinki;<ref name="Liukkonen">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tjansson.htm |title=Tove Jansson |last=Liukkonen |first=Petri |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916102623/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tjansson.htm |archive-date=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> among other things, the [[Söderskär Lighthouse]] island off Porvoo in the [[Gulf of Finland]] has served as an important source of inspiration for her later literature (see ''[[Moominpappa at Sea]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helsinkithisweek.com/story/experience-silence-and-sea-nature-soderskar-lighthouse|title=Söderskär Lighthouse|date=3 July 2019|website=Helsinki This Week}}</ref>

Jansson went to {{lang|sv|[[Läroverket för gossar och flickor]]|italic=no}} in [[Helsinki]] and then studied at [[University College of Arts, Crafts and Design]], in Stockholm in 1930–1933, the Graphic School of the [[Academy of Fine Arts (Finland)|Finnish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1933–1937, and finally at {{lang|fr|L'École d'Adrien Holy|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|L'[[École des Beaux-Arts]]|italic=no}} in Paris in 1938. She displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 1930s and early 1940s, and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943.

At age 14, Jansson wrote and illustrated her first picture book {{lang|sv|Sara och Pelle och [[Neck (water spirit)|näck]]ens [[Cephalopod|bläckfisk]]ar}} (''Sara and Pelle and Neptune's Children'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moomin.com/en/event/villain-moominhouse-archway-words-literary-festival-england/// |title=ArchWay With Words |website=ArchWayWithWords.co.uk |access-date=2017-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129185831/https://www.moomin.com/en/event/villain-moominhouse-archway-words-literary-festival-england/ |archive-date=29 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was not published until 1933.

During the 1930s Jansson made several trips to other European countries. She drew from these for her short stories and articles, which she also illustrated, and which were also published in magazines, periodicals and daily papers. During this period, Jansson also designed many book covers, adverts and postcards. Following her mother's example, she drew illustrations for ''{{ill|Garm (magazine){{!}}Garm|sv|Garm (tidskrift)}}'', an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] Finnish-Swedish [[satirical magazine]].<ref name=biografiakeskus />

== Work ==
===Moomins===
[[File:Finn Family.png|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Finn Family Moomintroll'' (1948)]]

Jansson is principally known as the author of the Moomin books. Jansson created the [[Moomin]]s, a family of [[troll]]s who are white, round and smooth in appearance, with large snouts that make them vaguely resemble [[hippopotamus]]es.

The first Moomin book, ''[[The Moomins and the Great Flood]]'', was written in 1945. Although the primary characters are Moominmamma and Moomintroll, most of the principal characters of later stories were only introduced in the next book, so ''The Moomins and the Great Flood'' is frequently considered a forerunner to the main series. The book was not a success, but the next two installments in the Moomin series, ''[[Comet in Moominland]]'' (1946) and ''[[Finn Family Moomintroll]]'' (1948), brought Jansson some fame. The original title of ''Finn Family Moomintroll'', {{lang|sv|Trollkarlens Hatt}}, translates as ''The Magician's Hat''.

The style of the Moomin books changed as time went by. The first books, written starting just after the Second World War, up to ''[[Moominland Midwinter]]'' (1957), are adventure stories that include floods, comets and supernatural events. ''The Moomins and the Great Flood'' deals with Moominmamma and Moomintroll's flight through a dark and scary forest, where they encounter various dangers. In ''Comet in Moominland'', a comet nearly destroys the Moominvalley (some critics have considered this an allegory of [[nuclear weapons]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Schoolfield |first=George C. |title=A history of Finland's literature |page=572 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-8032-4189-3 }}</ref>). ''Finn Family Moomintroll'' deals with adventures brought on by the discovery of a magician's hat. ''[[The Exploits of Moominpappa]]'' (1950) tells the story of Moominpappa's adventurous youth and cheerfully parodies the [[genre]] of [[memoir]]. Finally, ''[[Moominsummer Madness]]'' (1955) pokes fun at the world of the theatre: the Moomins explore an empty theatre and perform Moominpappa's pompous [[hexameter|hexametric]] [[melodrama]].

In addition to the Moomin novels and short stories, Tove Jansson also wrote and illustrated four original and popular picture books: ''[[The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My]]'' (1952), ''[[Who will Comfort Toffle?]]'' (1960), ''[[The Dangerous Journey]]'' (1977) and ''[[An Unwanted Guest]]'' (1980). As the Moomins' fame grew, two of the original novels, ''Comet in Moominland'' and ''The Exploits of Moominpappa'', were revised by Jansson and republished.

Critics have interpreted various Moomin characters as being inspired by real people, especially members of the author's family, and Jansson spoke in interviews about the backgrounds of, and possible models for, her characters.<ref name="biografiakeskus" />

Pietilä's personality inspired the character Too-Ticky in ''Moominland Midwinter''<ref name="Liukkonen" /><ref name="biografiakeskus" /> and Moomintroll and [[Little My]] have been seen as psychological [[self-portrait]]s of the artist.<ref name="Liukkonen" /><ref name="biografiakeskus" /> Jansson referred to Moomintroll as her alter-ego.<ref name="Karjalainen14">{{cite book |title=Tove Jansson. Work and Love |last=Karjalainen |first=Tuula |publisher=Penguin UK |year=2014 |isbn=9781846148491 }}</ref>

The Moomins, generally speaking, relate strongly to Jansson's own family – they were [[bohemianism|bohemian]] and lived close to nature. Jansson remained close to her mother until her mother's death in 1970; even after Tove had become an adult, the two often traveled together, and during her final years Signe also lived with Tove part-time.<ref name="biografiakeskus" /> Moominpappa and Moominmamma are often seen as portraits of Jansson's parents.<ref name="Liukkonen" /><ref name="biografiakeskus" /><ref name="Karjalainen14" /><ref name="Rahunen">{{cite thesis |last=Rahunen |first=Suvi |date=Spring 2007 |title=Om Översättning av Kulturbunda Element från Svenska till Finska och Franska i Två Muminböcker av Tove Jansson |trans-title=About Translation of Culturally Based Elements from Swedish to Finnish and French in Two Moomin Books by Tove Jansson |url=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:jyu-2007235 |publisher=[[University of Jyväskylä]] |access-date=28 October 2014 }}</ref>

=== Other writing ===
After ''Moominvalley in November'' Tove Jansson stopped writing about Moomins and started writing for adults. Jansson's first foray outside children's literature was ''{{interlanguage link|Bildhuggarens dotter|sv}}'' (''Sculptor's Daughter''), a semi-autobiographical novel published in 1968. After that, she wrote five more novels, including {{lang|sv|Sommarboken}} (''[[The Summer Book]]'') and five collections of short stories. ''The Summer Book'' is the best known of her adult fiction translated into English. It is a work of charm, subtlety and simplicity, describing the summer stay on an island of a young girl and her grandmother. The girl is modelled on her niece, Sophia Jansson; the girl's father on Sophia's father, Lars Jansson; and the grandmother on Tove's mother Signe.<ref name="Westin" />

===Wartime satire in ''Garm'' magazine===
[[File:Tove Jansson cover of Garm magazine October 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of ''[[Garm (magazine)|Garm]]'' magazine, October 1944, lampooning [[Adolf Hitler]] as "self-important and comic"<ref name="McDonagh">{{cite journal |last1=McDonagh |first1=Melanie|date=18 November 2017|title=A chance to see the Moomins' creator for the genius she really was: Tove Janssons<!--sic--> reviewed|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/11/a-chance-to-see-the-moomins-creator-for-the-genius-she-really-was-tove-janssons-reviewed/|journal=The Spectator|issue=November 2017}}</ref>]]

Tove Jansson worked as an illustrator and cartoonist for the Swedish-language [[satirical magazine]] ''[[Garm (magazine)|Garm]]'' from the 1930s to 1953.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ant O’Neill|title=Moominvalley Fossils: Translating the Early Comics of Tove Jansson|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|date=2017|volume=55|issue=2|page=52|doi=10.1353/bkb.2017.0023|issn=0006-7377|url=https://muse-jhu-edu.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/article/656106/pdf}}</ref> One of her [[political cartoon]]s achieved a brief international fame: she drew [[Adolf Hitler]] as a crying baby in diapers, surrounded by [[Neville Chamberlain]] and other great European leaders, who tried to calm the baby down by giving it slices of cake – [[Anschluss|Austria]], [[General Government|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], etc. In the [[Second World War]], during which [[Military history of Finland during World War II|Finland fought against the Soviet Union]], part of the time cooperating with Nazi Germany,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/05/finland-in-world-war-ii/100519/ |title=Finland in World War II|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|date=23 May 2013|magazine=The Atlantic|access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref> her cover illustrations for ''Garm'' lampooned both Hitler and [[Joseph Stalin]]: in one, Stalin draws his sword from his impressively long [[scabbard]], only to find it absurdly short; in another, multiple Hitlers ransack a house, carrying away food and artworks. In ''[[The Spectator]]''{{'}}s view, Jansson made Hitler a preposterous little figure, self-important and comic.<ref name="McDonagh"/>

=== Comic strip artist ===
{{See also|Moomin comic strips}}

Jansson also produced illustrations during this period for the Christmas magazines {{lang|sv|Julen}} and ''Lucifer'' (just as her mother had earlier) as well as several smaller productions. Her earliest comic strips were created for productions including {{lang|sv|Lunkentus}} ({{lang|sv|Prickinas och Fabians äventyr}}, 1929), {{lang|sv|Vårbrodd}} ({{lang|sv|Fotbollen som Flög till Himlen}}', 1930), and {{lang|sv|Allas Krönika}} ({{lang|sv|Palle och Göran gå till sjöss}}, 1933).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lambiek.net/artists/j/jansson_t.htm |title=Comic creator: Tove Jansson |work=lambiek.net |access-date=18 November 2014 }}</ref>

The figure of the Moomintroll appeared first in Jansson's political cartoons, where it was used as a signature character near the artist's name. This "Proto-Moomin", then called Snork or Niisku,<ref name="biografiakeskus" /> was thin and ugly, with a long, narrow nose and devilish tail. Jansson said that she had designed the Moomins in her youth: after she lost a philosophical quarrel about [[Immanuel Kant]] with one of her brothers, she drew "the ugliest creature imaginable" on the wall of their outhouse and wrote under it "Kant". This Moomin later gained weight and a more pleasant appearance, but in the first Moomin book ''[[The Moomins and the Great Flood]]'' (originally {{lang|sv|Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen}}), the Immanuel-Kant-Moomin is still perceptible. The name ''Moomin'' comes from Tove Jansson's uncle, [[Einar Hammarsten]]: when she was studying in [[Stockholm]] and living with her Swedish relatives, her uncle tried to stop her pilfering food by telling her that a "Moomintroll" lived in the kitchen closet and breathed cold air down people's necks.<ref name="biografiakeskus" />

[[File:Tove Jansson 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Jansson in 1956 with moomintroll dolls made by Atelier Fauni]]

In 1952, after ''Comet in Moominland'' and ''Finn Family Moomintroll'' had been translated into English, a British publisher asked if Tove Jansson would be interested in drawing comic strips about the Moomins. Jansson had already drawn a long Moomin comic adventure, {{lang|sv|[[Mumintrollet och jordens undergång]]}} (''Moomintroll and the End of the World''), based loosely on ''Comet in Moominland'', for the Swedish-language newspaper {{lang|sv|[[Ny Tid (Finland)|Ny Tid]]}}, and she accepted the offer. The comic strip ''Moomintroll'', started in 1954 in the London ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]''. Tove Jansson drew 21 long Moomin stories from 1954 to 1959, writing them at first by herself and then with her brother Lars Jansson. She eventually gave the strip up because the daily work of a comic artist did not leave her time to write books and paint, but Lars took over the strip and continued it until 1975.

The series was published in book form in Swedish; books 1 to 6 have been published in English, ''Moomin: The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip''.

=== Painter and illustrator ===
Although she became known first and foremost as an author, Tove Jansson considered her careers as author and painter to be of equal importance. She painted her whole life, changing style from the classical [[impressionism]] of her youth to the highly abstract modernist style of her later years. Jansson displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 1930s and early 1940s, and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943. Despite generally positive reviews, criticism induced Jansson to refine her style such that in her 1955 solo exhibition her style had become less overloaded in terms of detail and content. Between 1960 and 1970 Jansson held five more solo exhibitions.<ref name="biografiakeskus" />

Jansson also created a series of commissioned murals and public works throughout her career, which may still be viewed in their original locations. These works of Jansson's included:
* The canteen at the {{lang|sv|[[Stromberg (company)|Strömberg]]|italic=no}} factory at {{lang|fi|[[Pitäjänmäki]]|italic=no}}, Helsinki (1945)<ref name="biografiakeskus" />
* The Aurora Children's Hospital in Helsinki<ref name="Liukkonen" />
* The {{lang|fi|Kaupunginkellari|italic=no}} restaurant of [[Helsinki City Hall]]<ref name="Liukkonen" /> – Transferred in 1974 to Helsinki Swedish-language Adult Education Centre "Workers' Institute" Arbis and in 2016 to a permanent Jansson exhibition at [[Helsinki Art Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hamhelsinki.fi/en/exhibition/tove-jansson/|title=Tove Jansson|publisher=Helsinki Art Museum|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>
* The {{lang|fi|Seurahuone|italic=no}} hotel at [[Hamina]]<ref name="biografiakeskus" />
* The ''[[Parable of the Ten Virgins|Wise and Foolish Virgins]]'' altarpiece in [[Teuva]] Church (1954)<ref name="biografiakeskus" />
* A number of fairy-tale murals in schools and kindergartens including the kindergarten in [[Pori]] (1984)<ref name="biografiakeskus" />

In addition to providing the illustrations for her own Moomin books, Jansson also illustrated Swedish translations of classics such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/4647022944 |title=Hobbit illustrations|date=2010-05-20 |via=[[Flickr]] |access-date=18 November 2014 }}</ref> and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/4646406897 |title=Hunting of the Snark illustrations |date=2010-05-20 |via=[[Flickr]] |access-date=18 November 2014 }}</ref> and ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/4647020396 |title=Alice in Wonderland illustrations |date=2010-05-20 |via=[[Flickr]] |access-date=18 November 2014 }}</ref> (some used later in Finnish translations as well). She also illustrated her late work, ''[[The Summer Book]]'' (1972).

=== Theatre ===
Several stage productions have been made from Jansson's Moomin series, including a number that Jansson herself was involved in.

The earliest production was a 1949 theatrical version of ''Comet in Moominland'' performed at [[Åbo Svenska Teater]].<ref name="biografiakeskus" />

In the early 1950s, Jansson collaborated on Moomin-themed children's plays with [[Vivica Bandler]]. In 1952, Jansson designed stage settings and dresses for ''Pessi and Illusia'', a ballet by [[Ahti Sonninen]] ({{lang|sv|[[Radio tekee murron]]}}) which was performed at the [[Finnish National Opera]].<ref name="biografiakeskus" /> By 1958, Jansson began to become directly involved in theater as Lilla Teater produced {{lang|sv|Troll i kulisserna}} (''Troll in the [[Wings (theater)|wings]]''), a play with lyrics by Jansson and music composed by [[Erna Tauro]]. The production was a success, and later performances were held in Sweden and Norway.<ref name="Liukkonen" />

In 1974 the first Moomin opera was produced, with music composed by [[Ilkka Kuusisto]].<ref name="Liukkonen" />

Jansson had several male lovers, including the political philosopher [[Atos Wirtanen]], who was the inspiration for the Moomin character Snufkin. However, she eventually "went over to the spook side" as she put it—a coded expression for [[homosexuality]]<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/mamma-of-all-the-moomins-9048361.html |title=Mamma of all the Moomins |date=2014-01-09 |work=[[Evening Standard]] |language=en |access-date=2019-04-07 }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/tove-jansson-life-words-westin-review |title=Tove Jansson: Life, Art, Words by Boel Westin – review |last1=Prideaux |first1=Sue |date=2014-01-15 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=18 November 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.autostraddle.com/the-gay-love-stories-of-moomin-and-the-queer-radicality-of-tove-jansson-431832/ |title=The Gay Love Stories of Moomin and the Queer Radicality of Tove Jansson |date=2018-10-03 |website=[[Autostraddle]] |language=en-US |access-date=2019-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tor.com/2010/05/02/tove-jaanson-out-of-the-closet/ |title=Tove Jansson: Out of the Closet |last=Vanderhooft |first=JoSelle |date=2010-05-02 |website=[[Tor.com]] |language=en-US |access-date=2019-04-07 }}</ref>—and developed a secret love affair with the married theater director [[Vivica Bandler]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tove-jansson-moomins-cartoon_n_59b94115e4b086432b0361c3 |title=Meet The Queer, Anti-Fascist Woman Behind The Freakishly Lovable 'Moomins' |last=Frank |first=Priscilla |date=2017-09-14 |website=[[HuffPost]] |language=en |access-date=2019-04-07 }}</ref>

In 1956 Jansson met her lifelong partner, {{lang|fi|[[Tuulikki Pietilä]]|italic=no}} – or "Tooti", as she was known. In Helsinki they lived separately, in neighbouring blocks, visiting each other privately through an attic passageway. In the 1960s, they built a house on a tiny uninhabited island in the [[Gulf of Finland]], {{convert|100|km}} from Helsinki, where they would escape for the summer months.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=Izabella |date=May 2018 |title=The Party |url=http://izabellascott.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/So-It-Goes_The-Party.pdf |journal=So It Goes |issue=11 }}</ref> Jansson's and Pietilä's travels and summers spent together on the Klovharu island in [[Pellinki]] have been captured on several hours of film, shot by Pietilä.

They would remain partners for forty-five years, until Jansson's death. But, as Westin and Svensson put it, "anyone who lived with Tove Jansson also had to live with her family". Her mother, nicknamed Ham, stayed with Jansson on and off. Even as a teenager, preparing to go away to school, Jansson had worried about her mother. In a letter from 1961, she describes the stress of managing both Tooti and Ham in their "all-female household." She felt that it had become impossible to please one without displeasing the other, and during a time of intense strife she wrote to a friend, "Sometimes I think I hate them both and it makes me feel ill". }}</ref>{{efn|[[Same-sex marriage]] was not [[same-sex marriage in Finland|legalized in Finland]] until 2017.}}

== Cultural legacy ==
The biennial [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] conferred by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Jansson received the writing award in 1966.<ref name=andersen/><ref name=ibby-jansson/>

In 1968, Swedish public TV, [[Sveriges Television|SVT]], made a documentary about Tove called ''Moomins and the Harbor'' (39 min.).<ref>{{Citation |title=Mumin och havet |trans-title=Moomins and the Harbor |url=https://www.oppetarkiv.se/video/2194071/mumin-och-havet |language=sv|access-date=2019-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002509/http://www.oppetarkiv.se/video/2194071/mumin-och-havet |archive-date=6 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Tove Jansson at Dulwich Picture Gallery Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|The first major retrospective exhibition of Jansson's art in the United Kingdom was held at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]], 2017–2018.<ref name="Kennedy2018"/>]]

Jansson's books, originally written in Swedish, have been translated into 45 languages.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hällsten |first=Annika |title=Boksuccé efterlyses |work=[[Hufvudstadsbladet]] |date=22 January 2014 |page=21 }}</ref> After the {{lang|fi|[[Kalevala]]}} and books by [[Mika Waltari]], they are the most widely translated works of [[Finnish literature]].

The [[Moomin Museum]] in [[Tampere]] displays much of Jansson's work on the Moomins. There is also a Moomin theme park named [[Moomin World]] in {{lang|fi|[[Naantali]]|italic=no}}.

Tove Jansson was selected as the main motif in the 2004 minting of a Finnish commemorative coin, the €10 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2004 coinage|Tove Jansson and Finnish Children's Culture commemorative coin]]. The obverse depicts a combination of Tove Jansson portrait with several objects: the skyline, an artist's palette, a crescent and a sailing boat. The reverse design features three Moomin characters. In 2014 she was again featured on a commemorative coin, minted at €10 and €20 values, being the only person other than the former Finnish president {{lang|fi|[[Urho Kekkonen]]|italic=no}} to be granted two such coins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suomenrahapaja.fi/eng/news/Tove_Jansson |title=Another collector coin is minted in honour of Tove Jansson |publisher=[[Mint of Finland]] |date=30 January 2014 |access-date=14 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314104906/http://www.suomenrahapaja.fi/eng/news/Tove_Jansson |archive-date=14 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She was also featured on a [[€2 commemorative coin]] that entered general circulation in June 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suomenrahapaja.fi/eng/news/tove_jansson_special_2_euro |title=Tove Jansson to feature on two-euro commemorative coin |publisher=[[Mint of Finland]] |date=16 May 2014 |access-date=17 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613151657/http://www.suomenrahapaja.fi/eng/news/tove_jansson_special_2_euro |archive-date=13 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
