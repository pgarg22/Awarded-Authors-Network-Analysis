'''Thomas Head Raddall''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC}} (13 November 1903 &ndash; 1 April 1994) was a Canadian writer of history and historical fiction.<ref name=canenc>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/thomas-head-raddall/ Thomas Head Raddall's] entry in [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]</ref>

== Early life ==
Raddall was born in [[Hythe, Kent]], England in 1903, the son of an Army officer, also named [[Thomas Raddall (sport shooter)|Thomas Head Raddall]], and Ellen (née Gifford) Raddall. In 1913 the family moved to [[Nova Scotia]], where his father had taken a training position with the [[Canadian Militia]]. The elder Raddall then saw active service during [[World War I|the First World War]] and was killed in action at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]]  in August 1918.

Raddall attended Chebucto School in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] until 6 December 1917, when the school was converted into a temporary morgue in the wake of the [[Halifax Explosion]]. The Raddall family survived the explosion and Raddall wrote about it in his memoirs, ''In My Time''.

At the age of fifteen, Raddall trained at the [[Canadian School of Telegraphy]] in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and shortly thereafter started working at the age of 18 as a marine telegraph operator for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company.<ref>https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/63970/dalrev_vol27_iss2_pp131_142.pdf?sequence=1</ref>

Raddall's first job was as a wireless operator on seagoing ships, including the [[CS Mackay-Bennett|CS ''Mackay-Bennett'']], and stationed on land at [[Camperdown Signal Station]] and at isolated wireless posts such as [[Sable Island]].<ref>https://memoryns.ca/thomas-head-raddall-fonds</ref> He later took a job as a clerk at a pulp and paper mill in [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]], Nova Scotia, where he began his writing career. There, Raddall came in contact with the master American swindler and fugitive from justice, [[Leo Koretz]], who was using the alias, Lou Keyte.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jobb|first=Dean|title=''Empire of Deception''|url=http://www.empireofdeception.com/04-02.htm}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: ''The Incredible Story of a Master Swindler who Seduced a City and Captivated the Nation''. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill and HarperCollins Canada: New York and Toronto, 2015. ({{ISBN|978-1-61620-175-3}})</ref>

== Career as a writer ==
Raddall was a prolific, award-winning writer. He received [[Governor General's Awards]] for three of his books, ''The Pied Piper of Dipper Creek'' ([[1943 Governor General's Awards|1943]]), ''Halifax, Warden of the North'' ([[1948 Governor General's Awards|1948]]) and ''The Path of Destiny'' ([[1957 Governor General's Awards|1957]]). He was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1971.

Raddall is best known for his historical fiction, but he also published numerous non-fictional historical works. His interest in historical research grew when he was stationed at historical locations as a wireless operator, and he received crucial encouragement and assistance from [[Harry Piers]], Curator of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]], who became his mentor.<ref>Thomas Raddall, ''In My Time'' McClellend and Steward (1976 ), p. 116</ref> Raddall's early works included studies of privateering, civic and marine history, and Canada during the [[War of 1812]]. His history of Halifax, ''Warden of the North'', remains influential.

== Historical preservation and restoration ==
Raddall worked with the Queens County Historical Society, the Historic Sites Advisory Council of Nova Scotia, and the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]]. He played a role in preserving the diary of [[Simeon Perkins]], an early colonial document published in three volumes (the fourth has yet to be published) between 1948 and 1978 by the Champlain Society, and edited by [[Harold Innis]], D. C. Harvey and C. B. Ferguson. Raddall helped to restore and preserve Perkins House Museum, a colonial house built by Simeon Perkins that is now a part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system.

== Legacy ==
An exact replica of Raddall's study, furnished with his possessions, is on view at the Thomas Raddall Research Centre, administered by the Queens County Historical Society, of which Raddall was a founding member in 1929.

His correspondence is housed at the [[Dalhousie University]] Archives, which also runs the Thomas Raddall Electronic Archive Project, currently{{when|date=July 2017}} digitizing his published and unpublished writings.<ref name=Dal-archive>[http://www.library.dal.ca/archives/raddall/index.html Thomas Head Raddall Digital Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202044546/http://www.library.dal.ca/archives/raddall/index.html |date=2 February 2006 }}</ref>
