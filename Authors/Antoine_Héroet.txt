'''Antoine Héroet''', surnamed '''La Maison-Neuve''' (died 1568) was a French [[poet]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] of a family connected with the well known chancellor François Olivier.
His poetry belongs to his early years, for after he had taken orders he ceased to write profane poetry, no doubt because he considered it out of keeping with his calling. He attained the dignity of bishop of Digue.

==Work==
His chief work is ''La Parfaicte Amye'' (Lyons, 1542) in which he developed the idea of a purely spiritual love, based chiefly on the reading of the Italian [[neoplatonism|Neo-Platonists]]. The book aroused great controversy. La Borderie replied in ''L'Amie de cour'' with a description of a very much more human woman, and Charles Fontaine contributed a ''Contr'amye de court'' to the dispute.

Héroet, in addition to some translations from the classics, wrote the ''Complainte d'une dame nouvellement surprise d'amour'', an ''Epistre a François I<sup>er</sup>'', and some pieces included in the now very rare ''Opuscules d'amour par Héroet'', ''La Borderie et autres divins poetes'' (Lyons, 1547). Héroet belongs to the [[Lyon]]nese school of which [[Maurice Scève]] may be regarded as the leader. [[Clément Marot]] praises him, and [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] was careful to exempt him with one or two others from the scorn he poured on his immediate predecessors.
