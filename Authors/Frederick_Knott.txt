'''Frederick Major Paull Knott''' (28 August 1916 – 17 December 2002) was an English playwright and screenwriter known for his complex crime-related plots. Although he was a reluctant writer and completed only a small number of plays in his career, two have become well-known: the London-based stage thriller ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'', later filmed in Hollywood by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and the 1966 play ''[[Wait Until Dark]]'', [[Wait Until Dark (film)|which was adapted to a Hollywood film]] directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. He also wrote the Broadway mystery ''[[Write Me a Murder]]''.

==Life and career==

He became interested in theatre after watching performances of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] works held by the Hankow Operatic Society.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/frederick-knott-137362.html|title=Frederick Knott|date=2002-12-26|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Frederick Knott was descended from a line of wealthy Lancashire mill-owners, and in 1926 his parents sent him to England, where he studied at Sidcott and Oundle School before going up to Cambridge in 1934. An exceptional tennis player (a profession he gave the central character in ''Dial M for Murder''), he became a [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] and in 1937 he was a member of the Oxford-Cambridge tennis team that played the Harvard-Yale squad at Newport. It was only the advent of the Second World War that prevented his competing at Wimbledon. He graduated in 1938, then served during the war in the Artillery as an instructor in signals, ending his service with the rank of major.

He served in the British Army Artillery as a signals instructor from 1939 to 1946, rising to the rank of major, and eventually moved to the United States. He met Ann Hillary in 1952 and married her in 1953; they lived in New York for many years.<ref name=":0" />

Although ''Dial M for Murder'' was a hit on the stage, it was originally a BBC television production. As a theatre piece, it premiered at the Westminster Theatre in Victoria, London in June 1952, directed by John Fernald and starring [[Alan MacNaughtan]] and [[Jane Baxter]]. This production was followed in October by a successful run in New York City at the [[Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre|Plymouth Theater]], where Reginald Denham directed [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], Richard Derr. [[Gusti Huber]]. Knott also wrote the screenplay for the [[Dial M for Murder|1954 Hollywood movie]] which Hitchcock filmed for [[Warner Brothers]] in [[3-D film|3D]], starring [[Ray Milland]] and [[Grace Kelly]], with [[Anthony Dawson]] and [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] reprising their characters from the New York stage production, which had won Williams a [[Tony Award]] for his role as Inspector Hubbard. He previously sold the screen rights to [[Alexander Korda]] for only £1,000. The play was also made into a 1981 TV movie starring [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Angie Dickinson]], as the 1985 film ''Aitbaar in India'', and as ''[[A Perfect Murder]]'' in 1998 with [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]].<ref name=":0" /> Based on the same plot, a Soviet TV film ''Tony Wendice's Mistake'' ([[:ru:Ошибка Тони Вендиса]]) was released in 1981.

In 1960, Knott wrote the stage thriller ''[[Write Me a Murder]]'', produced at the [[Belasco Theatre]] in New York in October 1961. It was directed by [[George Schaefer (director)|George Schaefer]] and included [[Denholm Elliott]] and [[Kim Hunter]] in the cast.

In 1966, Knott's stage play ''[[Wait Until Dark]]'' was produced on Broadway at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]]. The director was [[Arthur Penn]] and the play starred [[Lee Remick]] who received a Tony Award nomination for her performance. Later the same year, [[Honor Blackman]] played the lead in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]]. The film version, also titled ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'' and released in 1967, had [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the lead role. The play ran on Broadway in 2001, featuring [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref name=":0" />

Knott stopped writing plays, choosing to live comfortably on the income from his earlier works. "I don't think the drive was there any more. He was perfectly happy the way things were," said his wife Ann Hillary.<ref name=":0" /> He died in New York City in December 2002.
