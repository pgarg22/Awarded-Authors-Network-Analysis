==Career==
French began writing ''[[Rain Stones]]'', her first book for children, when she was 30 years old, living in a shed and in need of money to register her car. Her editor said it was the messiest and worst-spelt manuscript ever submitted (partly because Jackie was dyslexic, but also because the letter 'E' on her typewriter wasn't working because of droppings left on her keyboard by a wombat), but the book ended up being shortlisted for the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] award for the [[Children's Book of the Year Award: Younger Readers|Younger Readers Book of the Year]] and the NSW Premier's Award.<ref>{{cite web |work=Australian of the Year Awards |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |title=National Finalist Senior Australian of the Year 2015 |url=http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&recipientID=1265 |year=2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Australian Writers' Centre |title=Jackie French: Multi-award-winning author |url=http://www.writerscentre.com.au/community/podcasts/jackie-french-multi-award-winning-author/ }}</ref>

French's books include both fictional, [[Non-fiction novel|factional]] and non-fictional accounts of [[Australian history]] including ''Nanberry: Black Brother White'', ''Tom Appleby'', ''A Day to Remember'', created with Mark Wilson, ''A Waltz for Matilda'', the first in an eight-volume series, ''The Girl from Snowy River'', ''The Road to Gundagai'', ''The Night They Stormed Eureka'' and ''Flood'' and ''Fire'', both created with Bruce Whatley.

Her non-fiction books include the eight-book ''Fair Dinkum History'' series that covers 60,000 years of Australian history and is published by Scholastic<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Scholastic Australia |title=Scholastic Authors and Illustrators, Jackie French |url=http://www.scholastic.com.au/common/books/contributor_profile.asp?ContributorID=549&channel= }}</ref> and ''Let the Land Speak: A history of Australia - how the land created our nation.''<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Radio National]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=Australia |title=Let the land speak: how has the landscape shaped your family history? |date=11 October 2013 |author=Mitchell, Natasha |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/natasha-mitchell/2914164 }}</ref>
