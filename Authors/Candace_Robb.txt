==Biography==

Candace Robb was born in [[North Carolina]], grew up in [[Ohio]], and now lives in [[Seattle, Washington]] with her husband. After an education in Catholic schools, Robb studied and researched medieval history for many years. In an interview, she said, "I did my graduate work in English literature with a strong concentration in medieval and Anglo-Saxon literature and history". After completing her master's degree at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in Ohio, she began the Ph.D. programme but did not complete her dissertation.

Before becoming a novelist, she worked as an editor of scientific publications.

She strives for accuracy of historical events which are the backdrop for her fictional characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/202/300/january/2000/00-05-03/robb.html |title=Interview, Candace Robb |date=29 July 2015 |publisher=January Magazine |access-date=14 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref> [[Kirkus Reviews]] said that "Robb puts the history back into historical mystery".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/candace-robb/the-lady-chapel/ |title=The Lady Chapel |date=25 October 1994 |publisher=Kirkus |access-date=14 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref>
