Shapcott was appointed as [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 2002. She initially accepted the honour but decided to refuse during the period when the British government made preparations to invade Iraq. She wrote to the Cabinet Office saying " I can't possibly accept this." She commented, "I was being diagnosed and treated for cancer, so great public statements weren't on the cards really. I was just too ill."<ref name="CBE">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/27/jo-shapcott-poetry-costa "Jo Shapcott: the book of life" 27 January 2011.] ''Guardian'' Interview after Costa Prize win</ref><ref>[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-104992297 Extract from ''Evening Standard'' article 9 July 2003]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2616063.stm BBC article 31 December 2002, ''Edinburgh boss heads arts honours'']</ref>

In 2016, Shapcott was welcomed as a trustee to [[Griffin Poetry Prize|The Griffin Trust For Excellence In Poetry]].<ref>[http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/announcement-jo-shapcott-and-marek-kazmierski-join-the-board-of-the-griffin-trust-for-excellence-in-poetry/ Announcement: Jo Shapcott and Marek Kazmierski join the board of The Griffin Trust For Excellence In Poetry (16 November 2016)]</ref> In 2019 she was a contributor to ''A New Divan: A Lyrical Dialogue between East and West'' ([[Gingko Library]]). 

== Writing ==
Shapcott has won the [[National Poetry Competition]] twice, in 1985 and 1991. ''Her Book: Poems 1988-1998'' (2000; reprinted 2006) consists of poetry from her three earlier collections: ''Electroplating the Baby'' (1988), which won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for Best First Collection, ''Phrase Book'' (1992), and ''My Life Asleep'' (1998), which won the Forward Poetry Prize (Best Collection).  Together with [[Matthew Sweeney]], she edited ''Emergency Kit: Poems for Strange Times'' (1996), an international anthology of contemporary poetry in English. Her 2002 book ''Tender Taxes'' is a collection of English versions (or translations) of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s French poems. Her 2002 collection of essays ''Elizabeth Bishop: Poet of the Periphery'' was co-edited with Linda Anderson. In 2006, Fiona Samson in ''[[The Guardian]]'' summarised her work: "Shapcott remains overwhelmingly a poet of presence, renegotiating the concrete world with as much brio as her own dancing cow. The consummate openness of this brilliantly intelligent selection extends the possibilities for poetry written in English. It reminds us that she remains a pioneer among contemporary British writers. We should be grateful for her."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview22| title=Poet of presence | author=Fiona Sampson| work=The Guardian| date=29 April 2006 }}</ref>

In 2010, Shapcott published ''Of Mutability'' with [[Faber and Faber]], her first collection for 12 years. The 45 poems explore the nature of change, in the body, within the natural world and inside relationships.<ref>[http://www.faber.co.uk/work/of-mutability/9780571254705/ ''Of Mutability''. Faber website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725181430/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/of-mutability/9780571254705/ |date=2010-07-25 }}</ref> The book of poems was awarded the [[2010 Costa Book Awards|Costa Book of the Year]] for 2010, beating contenders in Fiction, Non-Fiction and other categories.<ref name="guardian">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/25/costa-book-award-jo-shapcott "Jo Shapcott takes Costa book of the year award for Of Mutability"] 25 January 2011 ''Guardian''.</ref> The judges commented that the book was accessible, "very special and unusual and uplifting... The subject matter was so relevant that if any poetry book could capture the spirit of life in 2011, this would be it". Sinclair Mackay in the ''Daily Telegraph'' wrote: "''Of Mutability'', is so especially rich and resonant that it deserves the widest possible readership, even among those who never usually think of reading poems...And there is a dazzling variety of tone and colour and subject throughout - Shapcott's language dances lightly, and often with wit."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8282620/Commentary-Costa-prize-will-help-poetry-reach-new-audience.html "Costa prize will help poetry reach new audience"  ''Daily Telegraph'' 26 January 2011]</ref>

''The Transformers'' is an unpublished collection of public lectures given by Shapcott in 2001 as part of her Professorship at Newcastle.

She has written lyrics or had her poems set to music by composers such as [[Nigel Osborne]], [[Errollyn Wallen]] and [[John Woolrich]]. The American composer [[Stephen Montague]] created the work ''The Creatures Indoors'', from her poetry. It was premiered by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London in 1997.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=6228 Poetry Foundation synopsis of Shapcott]</ref>

She was a judge for the 2014 [[Griffin Poetry Prize]], as well as the 2013 [[Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine]].
