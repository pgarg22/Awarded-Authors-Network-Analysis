==Career==

In May 2007, while he held the position of "writer in residence" at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], his play ''My Child'' premiered there.<ref>''My Child'' by Mike Bartlett, at the Royal Court Theatre; [https://archive.today/20130201122622/http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whatson01.asp?play=476 Royalcourttheatre.com] (accessed 26 February 2008)</ref>

===The National Theatre===
In the summer of 2010 Bartlett's work was staged for the first time at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]. ''[[Earthquakes in London]]'', directed by [[Rupert Goold]], was described by [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in the ''Guardian'' as an "epic, expansive play about climate change, corporate corruption, fathers and children".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/aug/05/earthquakes-in-london-michael-billington|title=Review &#124; Theatre &#124; Earthquakes in London &#124; Cottesloe &#124; Michael Billington|first=Michael|last=Billington|date=5 August 2010|work=The Guardian}}</ref> [[Charles Spencer (journalist)|Charles Spencer]] of the ''Daily Telegraph'' called it "the theatrical equivalent of a thrilling roller coaster ride", delivering "a rush of invention, humour and raw emotion".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/7929004/Earthquakes-in-London-National-Theatre-review.html|title=Earthquakes in London, National Theatre, review|first=Charles|last=Spencer|date=5 August 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

In December 2010, Abingdon School and St Helen and St Katharine School performed the first ever amateur production of Bartlett's play ''Earthquakes in London'', less than three months after it finished its run at the National Theatre. The schools were given special permission to put the play on, as Bartlett is a former pupil of Abingdon. He attended the last night as guest of honour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abingdon.org.uk/earthquakes_in_london_dec10/|title=Abingdon.org.uk}}</ref>

Also in 2010, Bartlett's play ''Love, Love, Love'' was premiered in a touring production. In 2012 it has its London premiere at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]]. [[Michael Coveney]], writing for ''Whatsonstage.com'', called it "one of the most ambitious, and most accomplished, domestic dramas in a long while".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/reviews/theatre/london/E8831336121424/Love,+Love,+Love.html|title=Whatsonstage review of ''Love, Love, Love'', 4 May 2012.|access-date=1 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918024613/http://www.whatsonstage.com/reviews/theatre/london/E8831336121424/Love%2C+Love%2C+Love.html|archive-date=18 September 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2011 Bartlett returned to the National Theatre, this time on its largest stage (the Olivier), with ''[[13 (play)|13]]'', another contemporary epic. In a favourable review in the ''Guardian'', [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] explained, "Bartlett is saying that we live in a Britain where the old tribal loyalties are increasingly irrelevant. The real divide is between a popular protest movement, fed on Facebook and Twitter, that hungers for a change of direction, and an entrenched governmental system that clings precariously to the status quo."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/26/13-review|title=13 – review|first=Michael|last=Billington|date=25 October 2011|work=The Guardian}}</ref> [[Ian Shuttleworth]] of the ''Financial Times'' noted that this was a play in which "sprawl wins out": "Both here and in ''Earthquakes'' Bartlett is groping towards some sense of a need to reconcile the worldly and the numinous. In this society, in the 21st century, that may be an admirable impulse for an individual, but in this case it is not proving a useful approach for a playwright."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c7708cee-ffe7-11e0-ba79-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}</ref>

In 2012 Bartlett adapted ''[[Chariots of Fire (play)|Chariots of Fire]]'' for the stage. It premiered at [[Hampstead Theatre]] before transferring to the West End. He also adapted the [[Euripides]] play ''Medea'', in a touring production he directed himself; it starred [[Rachael Stirling]] in the title role.
===Television and further plays===
Later in 2012, ITV1 premiered the Crime drama [[The Town (2012 TV series)|''The Town'']] starring Andrew Scott (Sherlock) and Martin Clunes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9694231/The-Town-what-Moriarty-did-next.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Dominic | last=Cavendish | title=The Town: what Moriarty did next | date=5 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/06/tv-review-the-town-andrew-scott_n_2249317.html|title=TV REVIEW: Sherlock Star Gets A Mystery Of His Own|date=6 December 2012|website=HuffPost UK}}</ref> Bartlett was subsequently nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award for best "Breakthrough Talent" in the TV Craft category in the 2013 awards in relation to ''The Town''.<ref name="awards.bafta.org"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guru.bafta.org/mike-bartlett-qa|title=Mike Bartlett: Q&A|website=guru.bafta.org}}</ref>

In October 2013 Bartlett won Best New Play at The National Theatre Awards for his play ''Bull'', beating plays from both [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and Tom Wells.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/20/uk-theatre-awards-winners-women|title=UK Theatre awards: women scoop acting prizes|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|date=20 October 2013|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24580389 | work=BBC News | title=This Is My Family musical wins two UK Theatre Awards | date=20 October 2013}}</ref>

In 2014 his play ''King Charles III'' premiered at the Almeida. It subsequently transferred to [[Wyndham's Theatre]] and in January 2015 won the Critics' Circle Award for Best Play of 2014. It premiered in Australia at the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] in April 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2016/king-charles|title=King Charles III by Mike Bartlett|website=Sydney Theatre Company|access-date=6 April 2016}}</ref>

In March 2015 his play ''[[Game (play)|Game]]'' premiered at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London, England.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/08/game-review-mike-bartlett-voyeurs-audience|author-link=Kate Kellaway|first=Kate|last=Kellaway|date=8 March 2015|title=Game review – Mike Bartlett's unnerving drama makes voyeurs of the audience}}</ref>

In April 2015 Bartlett's plays were awarded two additional Olivier Awards, his play ''King Charles III'' won Best New Play, and his play ''Bull'', directed by [[Clare Lizzimore]] and produced by [[Supporting Wall]] at the Young Vic Theatre, won Outstanding Achievement in Affiliate Theatre.

Barlett's five-part television drama series ''[[Doctor Foster (TV series)|Doctor Foster]]'' was broadcast in September and October 2015. The series achieved an average of 9.51 million viewers, and was one of the most viewed television drama series of the year. In addition to being a critical success, the drama won two awards at the [[21st National Television Awards|2016 National Television Awards]] in the categories of ''Best New Drama'' and ''Drama Performance'' for [[Suranne Jones]]. A second series commenced showing in September 2017.

In December 2015, Polly Hill, the Controller of [[BBC]] Drama Commissioning, announced a six 60-minute episode television series entitled ''Press'' that had been written by Bartlett. Commenting about the series, Bartlett said "From exposing political corruption to splashing on celebrity scandal, editors and journalists have enormous influence over us, yet recent events have shown there’s high-stakes and life-changing drama going on in the news organisations themselves. I’m hugely excited to be working with the BBC to make ''Press'', a behind-the-scenes story about a group of diverse and troubled people who shape the stories and headlines we read every day".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/polly-hill-drama-commissions|title=Polly Hill, Controller of BBC Drama Commissioning, announces new slate of drama|work=BBC Media Centre}}</ref> In October 2016, Hill, now the Head of Drama at [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], announced that Bartlett would be returning to the channel for a new project, ''Trauma''. Bartlett described the three-part series to be "about two fathers with very different lives, locked in conflict." The series will begin filming in early summer 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-commissions-four-new-dramas-trauma-girlfriends-white-dragon-and-next-kin|title=ITV commissions four new dramas – Trauma, Girlfriends, White Dragon and Next of Kin|work=ITV Press Centre}}</ref>

In 2016 Bartlett was hired to write an episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'''s [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]].<ref name= "series10">{{cite news |last=Doran |first=Sarah |url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-06-14/doctor-foster-writer-to-pen-an-episode-of-doctor-who-series-10 |title=Doctor Foster writer to pen an episode of Doctor Who series 10 |work=[[Radio Times]] |date=2016-06-14 }}</ref>

On 10 May 2017, the BBC broadcast a TV adaptation of Bartlett's play, ''[[King Charles III (film)|King Charles III]]'', which generated controversy. The reviewer in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave it five stars, calling it "pure televisual gelignite".<ref name="Telegraph 10 May 2017">{{cite news |last= Rees |first= Jasper|title= King Charles III review: a majestic, unmissable drama |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/05/10/king-charles-iii-review-majestic-unmissable-drama/| date= 10 May 2017|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London| accessdate=11 May 2017 }}</ref>
