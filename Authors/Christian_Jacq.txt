'''Christian Jacq''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒak|lang}}; born April 28, 1947) is a French author and [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]]. He has written several novels about [[ancient Egypt]], notably a five book series about [[pharaoh]] [[Ramses II]], a character whom Jacq admires greatly.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, Jacq's interest in Egyptology began when he was thirteen, when he read ''History of Ancient Egyptian Civilization'' by [[Jacques Pirenne]]. This inspired him to write his first novel. By the time he was eighteen, he had written eight books. His first commercially successful book was ''Champollion the Egyptian'', published in 1987. {{As of|2004}}, he has written over fifty books, including several non-fiction books on the subject of Egyptology.

Jacq has a doctorate in Egyptian Studies from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He and his wife later founded the [[Ramses Institute]], which is dedicated to creating a photographic description of Egypt for the preservation of endangered [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites.

Between 1995 and 1997, he published his best-selling five book suite ''Ramsès'', which is today published in over twenty-five countries. Each volume encompasses one aspect of Ramses's known historical life, woven into a fictional tapestry of the ancient world for an epic tale of love, life and deceit.

Jacq's series describes a vision of the life of the pharaoh: he has two vile power-hungry siblings, Shanaar, his decadent older brother, and Dolora, his corrupted older sister who married his teacher. In his marital life, he first has [[Isetnofret]] (Iset) as a mistress (second Great Wife), meets his true love [[Nefertari]] (first Great Wife) and after their deaths, marries [[Maathorneferure|Maetnefrure]] in his old age. Jacq gives Ramses only three biological children: [[Khaemweset|Kha'emweset]], [[Meritamen]] (she being the only child of Nefertari, the two others being from Iset) and [[Merneptah]]. The other "children" are only young officials trained for government and who are nicknamed "sons of the pharaoh".

==Books==
These books are typically classed as historical fiction; many of them delve into the supernatural powers given to the Pharaoh, however, and could be considered fantasy by loose definition.
