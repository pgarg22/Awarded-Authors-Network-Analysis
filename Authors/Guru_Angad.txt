==Biography==
Guru Angad Sahib ji was born with birth name of Lehna in village of Harike in the [[Punjab]] region.<ref name="Mandair2013p35">{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|pages=35–37}}</ref><ref name="Fenech2014p36">{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

At age 16, Guru Angad ji married a Khatri girl named [[Mata Khivi]] in January 1520. They had two sons (Dasu and Datu) and one or two daughters (Amro and Anokhi), depending on the primary sources.<ref name=eos/> The entire family of his father had left their ancestral village in fear of the invasion of [[Babur]]'s armies. After this the family settled at Khadur Sahib, a village by the [[River Beas]] near what is now [[Tarn Taran Sahib|Tarn Taran]].

Before becoming a disciple of Guru Nanak and following the Sikh way of life as Guru Angad ji, Lehna was a religious teacher and priest who followed Hinduism.<ref name="Fenech2014p36"/><ref name="ColeSambhi1995p18">{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&pg=PA18 |year=1995|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4|pages=18–20}}</ref><ref name=eos/> Lehna in his late 20s sought out Nanak, became his disciple, and displayed deep and loyal service to his [[Guru]] for about six to seven years in Kartarpur and renounced the Sanatan way of life.<ref name=eos/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sikka|first1=A.S.|title=Complete Poetical Works of Ajit Singh Sikka|date=2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distribution|page=951}}</ref>

===Selection as successor===
Several stories in the Sikh tradition describe reasons why Lehna was chosen by Guru Nanak over his own sons as his choice of successor. One of these stories is about a jug which fell into mud, and Nanak asked his sons to pick it up. They did not pick it up because it was too dirty or menial a task. Then he asked Lehna, who however picked it out of the mud, washed it clean, and presented it to Guru Nanak full of water.<ref name="Cole 1978 18">{{cite book | last=Cole | first=W.

After Nanak died on 22 September 1539, Guru Angad ji was unable to bear the separation from Nanak and retired into a room in a disciple's house in a state of [[Vairagya]]. [[Baba Buddha]] later discovered him after a long search and requested him to return for Guruship.<ref name=":srigranth83">{{cite web|title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib, ang 83|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&id=3336&Param=83#l3336}}</ref> The [[Gurbani]] uttered at the time ''Die before the one whom you love, to live after he dies is to live a worthless life in this world.''<ref name=":srigranth83" /> was the first hymn in [[Guru Granth Sahib]] by Sri Guru Angad Dev ji and signifies the pain he felt at the separation from Nanak. Guru Angad ji later left Kartarpur for the village of Khadur Sahib (near Goindwal Sahib). Post succession, at one point, very few Sikhs accepted Guru Angad ji as their leader and while the sons of Nanak claimed to be the successors. Guru Angadji focused on the teachings of Nanak, and building the community through charitable works such as [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]].<ref name="Fenech2014p41">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

===Relationship with the Mughal Empire===
The second [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor of India [[Humayun]] visited Guru Angad ji at around 1540 after Humayun lost the Battle of Kannauj, and thereby the Mughal throne to [[Sher Shah Suri]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Pashaura|last2=Fenech|first2=Louis|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191004124|page=41|edition=First}}</ref> According to Sikh hagiographies, when Humayun arrived in Gurdwara Mal Akhara Sahib at [[Tarn Taran Sahib#Khadur Sahib|Khadur Sahib]] Guru Angad ji was sitting and teaching children.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Ajit |title=Suraj Prakash Granth part 5 ras 4 |date=2005 |isbn=81-7601-685-3 |page=177}}</ref> The failure to greet the Emperor immediately angered Humayun. Humayun lashed out but the Guru reminded him that the time when you needed to fight when you lost your throne you ran away and did not fight and now you want to attack a person engaged in prayer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gurpreet|title=Ten Masters|date=2001|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788171829460|page=53}}</ref> In the Sikh texts written more than a century after the event, Guru Angad ji is said to have blessed the emperor, and reassured him that someday he will regain the throne.<ref name="Fenech2014p41"/>

===Death and successor===
Before his death, Guru Angad ji, following the example set by Nanak, nominated [[Guru Amar Das]] as his successor (The Third Nanak). Amar Das was born into a Hindu family and had been reputed to have gone on some twenty pilgrimages into the [[Himalayas]], to [[Haridwar]] on river Ganges. About 1539, on one such Hindu pilgrimage, he met a ''sadhu'', or ascetic, who asked him why he did not have a [[guru]] (teacher, spiritual counsellor) and Amar Das decided to get one.<ref name=eosamardas/> On his return, he heard Bibi Amro, the daughter of the Guru Angad ji who had married his brother's son, singing a hymn by [[Guru Nanak]].<ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p29"/> Amar Das learnt from her about Guru Angad ji, and with her help met the second Guru of Sikhism in 1539, adopting Guru Angad as his spiritual Guru, who was much younger than his own age.<ref name=eosamardas/>

Amar Das displayed relentless devotion and service to Guru Angad. Sikh tradition states that he woke up in the early hours to fetch water for Guru Angad's bath, cleaned and cooked for the volunteers with the Guru, as well devoted much time to meditation and prayers in the morning and evening.<ref name=eosamardas/> Guru Angad named Amar Das as his successor in 1552.<ref name=cole20/><ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p29">{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

==Influence==
===Gurmukhi script===
[[File:Punjabi Alphabet.jpg|thumb|[[Gurmukhi]] script (partial)]]
Guru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the [[Gurmukhi]] script, which is now the standard writing script for Punjabi language in India,<ref name=shacklexvii>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xvii–xviii}}</ref> in contrast to Punjabi language in Pakistan where now a Perso-Arabic script called [[Shahmukhi]] is the standard.<ref name="Bright1996p395">{{cite book|author1=Peter T. Daniels|author2=William Bright|title=The World's Writing Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA395 |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7|page=395}}</ref> The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.<ref name=shacklexvii/>

Guru Angad standardized and made improvements to the scripts of the region to create the Gurmukhi script.<ref>{{cite book |last=Masica |first=Colin |author-link=Colin Masica |year=1993 |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages |place= Cambridge, U.K. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-29944-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3RSHWePhXwC&q=indoaryan+languages|page=143}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA36 |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|page=36}}</ref> Examples of possible forerunners of the script including at least one hymn written in acrostic form by Guru Nanak,<ref name=cole19>{{cite book | last=Cole | first=W.

He also wrote 62 or 63 [[Salok]]s (compositions), which together constitute about one percent of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the primary scripture of Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | page= xviii}}</ref> Rather than contribute hymns, Angad's importance was as a consolidator of Guru Nanak's hymns.<ref name=cole19/> Guru Angad would also supervise the writing down of Nanak's hymns by Bhai Paira Mokha and scrutinize the resulting compilation, preparing the way for a Sikh scripture, as well as the beginning of a vernacular Punjabi literature, as tradition holds that he may have also commissioned an account of Guru Nanak's life from earlier disciples.<ref name=cole19/> The collection of hymns would also be increasingly important for the expanding community.<ref name=cole19/>

===Langar and community work===
Guru Angad is notable for systematizing the institution of [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] in all Sikh temple premises, where visitors from near and far could get a free simple meal in a communal seating.<ref name="Mandair2013p35"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

Guru Angad visited other places and centres established by Guru Nanak for the preaching of Sikhism. He established new centres and thus strengthened its base.<ref name="Mandair2013p35"/>
