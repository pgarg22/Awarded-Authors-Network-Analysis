'''Geoffrey Edward Harvey Grigson''' (2 March 1905 – 25 November 1985) was a British poet, writer, editor, critic, exhibition curator, anthologist and naturalist. In the 1930s he was editor of the influential magazine ''New Verse'', and went on to produce 13 collections of his own poetry, as well as compiling numerous anthologies, among many published works on subjects including art, travel and the countryside. Grigson exhibited in the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] at [[New Burlington Galleries]] in 1936, and in 1946 co-founded the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]]. Grigson's autobiography ''The Crest on the Silver'' was published in 1950. At various times he was involved in teaching, journalism and broadcasting. Fiercely combative, he made many literary enemies.<ref name=SEH>[http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/about-college/geoffrey-grigson "Geoffrey Grigson"], St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford.</ref>

==Life and work==
Grigson was born at the vicarage in [[Pelynt]],<ref name="CUP">{{cite book|editor=Ian Ousby|editor-link=Ian Ousby|title=The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English|year=1993|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-44086-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00iano_0/page/395 395]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00iano_0/page/395}}</ref> a village near [[Looe]] in [[Cornwall]]. His childhood in rural Cornwall had a significant influence on his poetry and writing. As a boy, his love of objects of nature (plants, bones and stones) was sparked at the house of family friends at [[Polperro]] who were painters and amateur naturalists. He was educated at [[St John's School, Leatherhead|St John's School]], [[Leatherhead]], and at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref name="CUP"/>

After graduating from Oxford University, Grigson took a job at the London office of the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'', from where he moved on to become literary editor of the ''[[Morning Post]]''.<ref>Adrian Caesar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Hu7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=Yorkshire+post+geoffrey+grigson&source=bl&ots=LphfH0jkiE&sig=xhGrrM_36eMURhF0_3iEDS0IABE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDYQ6AEwB2oVChMIjsKj67eLyAIVi2kUCh3HNgxL#v=onepage&q=Yorkshire%20post%20geoffrey%20grigson&f=false "Geoffrey Grigson's ''New Verse''"], in ''Dividing Lines: Poetry, Class, and Ideology in the 1930s'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1991 (pp. 107–121), pp. 109, 111.</ref> He first came to prominence in the 1930s as a poet, then as editor from 1933 to 1939 of the influential poetry magazine ''New Verse''.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/246158/Geoffrey-Grigson "Geoffrey Grigson"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref> Among important works by many influential poets — notably [[Louis MacNeice]], [[Stephen Spender]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[W.

During this period, Grigson published some of his own poetry under the pseudonym Martin Boldero.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/243830 "Correspondence.

Later in life he was a noted critic, reviewer (for the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' in particular), and compiler of numerous poetry [[anthologies]]. He published 13 collections of poetry, and wrote on travel, on art (notably works on [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Wyndham Lewis]] and [[Henry Moore]]; he also had a volatile friendship with the painter [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]]),<ref>[[Frances Spalding]], [https://www.amazon.co.uk/John-Piper-Myfanwy-Lives-Art/dp/0199567611/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1400985834&sr=8-16&keywords=lionel+grigson ''John Piper, Myfanwy Piper: Lives in Art''], Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 126–27.</ref> on the English countryside, and on [[botany]], among other subjects.

Grigson was the castaway featured in an edition of [[Roy Plomley]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] first broadcast on 16 October 1982.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/9b6dab6b Desert Island Discs Castaway Archive], BBC Radio 4, October 1982.</ref> In 1984, he was interviewed by [[Hermione Lee]] in an edition of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Book Four''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KllNXmNlS7Y "Geoffrey Grigson interview, 1984"], YouTube.</ref>

Grigson in his later life lived partly in [[Wiltshire]], England, and partly in a [[cave house]] in [[Trôo]], a [[cave dweller|troglodyte]] village in the [[Loir-et-Cher]] [[département]] in France, which features in his poetry. He died in 1985 in [[Broad Town]], Wiltshire, and is buried there in [[Christ Church, Broad Town|Christ Church]] churchyard.<ref>[http://theliterarycemetery.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/geoffrey-grigson-1905-1985.html "Geoffrey Grigson (1905-1985)"], The Literary Cemetery.</ref>

==Family==
Born in 1905, Grigson was the youngest of seven sons of Canon William Shuckforth Grigson (1845–1930), a [[Norfolk]] clergyman who had settled in [[Cornwall]] as vicar of [[Pelynt]], and Mary Beatrice Boldero, herself the daughter of a clergyman.

Geoffrey Grigson's first wife was Frances Franklin Galt<ref name=DNB /> (who died in 1937 of [[tuberculosis]]). With her, he founded the poetry magazine ''New Verse''. They had one daughter, Caroline (who was married to designer [[Colin Banks]]). With his second wife, Berta Emma Kunert, Grigson had two children, Anna and [[Lionel Grigson]]. Following divorce from his second wife, Grigson married [[Jane Grigson]], ''née'' McIntire (1928–90). Their daughter is [[Sophie Grigson]]. Among Grigson's grandchildren is the political scientist [[Giacomo Benedetto]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|title=Giacomo Benedetto|url=https://livesofthefirstworldwar.org/profile/54493}}</ref>

==Honours and legacy==
Grigson was awarded the [[Duff Cooper Prize]] for his 1971 volume of poetry ''Discoveries of Bones and Stones''.<ref>[http://www.theduffcooperprize.org/past-duff-cooper-prize-winners/2 "Past winners"], The Duff Cooper Prize.</ref> A collection of tributes entitled ''Grigson at Eighty'', compiled by R. M. Healey (Cambridge: [[Rampant Lions Press]]), was published in 1985, the year of his death.<ref name=DNB /> In 2005, to mark the centenary of Grigson's birth a conference was held at St Edmund Hall, Oxford.<ref name=SEH />

In 2007 [[Pallant House Gallery]] in [[Chichester]] presented the exhibition ''Poets in the Landscape: The Romantic Spirit in British Art''. The exhibition explored "the creative links between poetry, the pastoral vision and British art in the work of Romantic artists of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the Neo-Romantic artists of the mid-20th century", with exhibits of Grigson’s anthology ''The Poet's Eye'', featuring lithographs by [[John Craxton]], and copies of ''New Verse''.<ref>Simon Martin, [[Martin Butlin]] & Robert Meyrick, [https://pallant.org.uk/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2007/poets-in-the-landscape/ “Poets In The Landscape”], Pallant House Gallery, 31 March to 10 June 2007.</ref>

In 2017 the [[British Museum]] presented a major exhibition of British landscape paintings from the century following the death of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. The exhibition title was "borrowed from the poet and critic Geoffrey Grigson's 1949 collection of essays ''Places of the Mind''",<ref>Geoffrey Grigson, ''Places of the Mind'', London: [[Routledge & Kegan Paul]], 1949.</ref> and, in doing so, "acknowledges how every landscape drawing is a construct of the mind and imagination of its creator".<ref>[[Kim Sloan]], Jessica Feather, [[Anna Gruetzner Robins]], Sam Smiles and Frances Carey (curators), [https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/past_exhibitions/2017/places_of_the_mind.aspx "Places of the Mind"], British Museum, 23 February to 28 August 2017.</ref>
