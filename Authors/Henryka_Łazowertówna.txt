The poem deals with the subject of a child struggling single-handedly to keep his family alive in the Ghetto by smuggling provisions from the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|"Aryan" side]] at the risk of his own life. A poem begins with the stanza also known from [[Untranslatability#Adaptation|an adaptive]] translation provided by [[Richard C. Lukas]]. It reads as follows:

The original text of the poem, together with translations in English and in Hebrew, is today inscribed on the [[Memorial to the Child Victims of the Holocaust]] ([[:pl:Pomnik Pamięci Dzieci – Ofiar Holokaustu|Pomnik Pamięci Dzieci]] in [[Warsaw]]), serving as the [[epitaph]] for the million children murdered in the [[Holocaust]].

==Life==
Henryka Łazowertówna was the daughter of Maksymilian Łazowert and his wife Bluma.  Her mother was a schoolteacher.<ref name="Smólski">[[Władysław Smólski]], "Tragiczny los poetki" (The Tragic Fate of a Poetess), ''Stolica'' (Warsaw), vol.&nbsp;20, No.&nbsp;14 (904), April 4, 1965, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Łazowertówna studied [[Polish studies|Polish]] and [[Romance studies|Romance]] [[philology]] at the [[University of Warsaw]], and subsequently [[French literature]] at the [[University of Grenoble]] on a scholarship funded by the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish interwar]] Government.<!--WP:BALASPS--><ref name="Koz424" /><ref name="Smólski" />

She was a very active member of the Warsaw section of the [[Polish Writers' Union]], participating in the events organized by the institution, such as for example the conference commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of the writer [[Stefan Żeromski]] in December 1935, an event during which she read from her works alongside such famous poets as [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Juljan Tuwim]], and [[Kazimierz Wierzyński]].<ref>"Uroczysta akademja ku czci Stefana Żeromskiego" (A Solemn Ceremony in Honour of [[Stefan Żeromski]]), ''Tygodnik Illustrowany'' (Warsaw), vol.&nbsp;76, No.&nbsp;49 (3,965), December 8, 1935, p.&nbsp;976.  [http://cyfrowa.chbp.chelm.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=7324 (See online.)]</ref> Among the [[literary magazine]]s of the day Łazowertówna collaborated principally with the literary journals ''Droga'' and ''Pion''.  She was seen as being poetically close to the [[Skamander]] circle, publishing in her short life of 33&nbsp;years two collections of poetry, ''Zamknięty pokój'' ("A Closed Room"), in which the Closed Room of the title poem is self-avowedly a [[metaphor]] for the person of the poet herself,<ref>Henryka Łazowertówna, ''Zamknięty pokój'', Warsaw, Nasza Bibljoteka, 1930, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> and ''Imiona świata'' ("The Names the World is Known By"), whose programmatic poem fulfills the poet's promise of the earlier collection to sound a voice uniquely her own among the women poets of the [[interbellum]] period.<ref>[[Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski]], "Noty", ''Kamena'', vol.&nbsp;1, No.&nbsp;9, May 1934, pp.&nbsp;170{{ndash}}171.</ref>  ''Zamknięty pokój'' ("A Closed Room") was – in the words of the writer and a stern [[literary critic]] [[Karol Wiktor Zawodziński]] (1890{{ndash}}1949) – a manifestation of a particularly subtile poetic talent and an extraordinary intelligence, both struggling to break free of the magic circle of [[subjectivism]] and onto the rough and tough ferment of the world (''zamęt życia'').<ref>[[Karol Wiktor Zawodziński]], ''Opowieści o powieśći'', ed. Cz.&nbsp;Zgorzelski, Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1963, p.&nbsp;261.  Cf. Władysław Smólski, "Tragiczny los poetki" (The Tragic Fate of a Poetess), ''Stolica'' (Warsaw), vol.&nbsp;20, No.&nbsp;14 (904), April 4, 1965, p.&nbsp;16.</ref>

Politically speaking, Henryka Łazowertówna was known for her left-wing sympathies, a point on which she differed – in the opinion of [[Józef Łobodowski]] – from another famous poet of her generation, [[Zuzanna Ginczanka]].<ref>[[Józef Łobodowski]], "O cyganach i katastrofistach" (About the Bohemians and the Catastrophists), ''[[Kultura]]'' (Paris), No.&nbsp;9, 1964, pp.&nbsp;59{{ndash}}68.</ref> However, her [[leftism]] was a condition of her sensitivity to social injustice and her moral rejection of all forms of oppression rather than an outcome of a political ideology.<ref name="Smólski" /> In contradistinction to [[Lucjan Szenwald]], her contemporary, she remained fundamentally a [[lyric poet]] to the end.<ref name="Smólski" />

Also unlike [[Zuzanna Ginczanka|Ginczanka]] Łazowertówna was not a woman of extraordinary physical beauty, but she possessed charm and grace which, coupled with her simplicity of demeanour and straightforward attitude, made her in the eyes of those who knew her personally the embodiment of femininity.<ref name="Gierymski">Tadeusz K. Gierymski, "O tym nie można ani mówić, ani milczeć" (A Subject Unfit to be Talked About or to be Passed Over in Silence), ''Spojrzenia'' ([[ezine]]), No.&nbsp;123, April 28, 1995.  ISSN 1067-4020.

The book is with me at all times, I do not take a single step away from it, and such close companionship is possible only where a book does not repulse by its physical appearance [''[[sc.]]'' as many library books do].  I do prefer to read a book untouched by the hands of others, to cut the pages, to rejoice in the peculiar fragrance of the printer's ink."<ref name="Gierymski" />

===Identity===
Biographer Eugenia Prokop-Janiec of [[Jagiellonian University]] asserts that it is the active [[antisemitism]] of the Polish society (''Gazeta Warszawska'') in the 1930s that ultimately forced the writers and poets like Henryka Łazowertówna who never espoused any particular aspect of specifically Jewish identity while working in the [[Polish language]], to align themselves with the Jewish community for the first time during either [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|the Interbellum]] or the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Prokop-Janiec">[[Eugenia Prokop-Janiec]], [https://books.google.ca/books?id=25sfhJOplxoC&pg=PA109 ''Polish–Jewish Literature in the Interwar Years''] tr. A.&nbsp;Shenitzer, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (New York)]], Syracuse University Press, 2003, pp.&nbsp;94{{ndash}}95, 109. {{ISBN|0815629842}}.</ref> Indeed, the hostility obtaining between the Jewish and non-Jewish communities in Poland receives an eloquent treatment in Łazowertówna's own fictional short story ''Wrogowie'' ("The Enemies"), published in 1938 – sixteen months before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] – where she tells the story of two child [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] of [[pretzels]], the one Jewish the other Gentile, who with great animosity towards each other aggressively compete for custom until common misfortune counsels them to join forces in the cause of common good (see [[#Prose|Works in Prose]]).<ref name="Prokop-Janiec" />

Other established Jewish writers enjoyed the utmost prestige in the country, such as [[Bolesław Leśmian]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Antoni Słonimski]] as well as other Jewish members and celebrated recipients of the Golden Laurel from the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] (PAL),<ref name="portalwiedzy">{{cite web | url=http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/29184,,,,polska_akademia_literatury,haslo.html | title=Polska Akademia Literatury | publisher=Encyklopedia [[Onet.pl]], Grupa Onet.pl SA | year=2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref> thus making Łazowertówna's biography somewhat unusual.<ref name="Gierymski" />

{{See also|The Little Smuggler}}
During the [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 part of Łazowertówna's Warsaw apartment in the ulica Sienna, which she shared with her mother, was destroyed in the [[strategic bombing]] conducted by the [[Luftwaffe]], but it was found possible to make the remaining quarters habitable again.<ref name="Smólski" /> (Łazowertówna's father had died of natural causes before the War.)

A year after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Henryka Łazowertówna found herself suddenly interned in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], like other residents of Jewish origin in the city, though without [[forced resettlement]] {{mdash}} the ulica Sienna of her residence having been simply encircled by the borders of the so-called "Little Ghetto" (of the Ghetto's two parts, the North Side and the South Side, this was the South Side).<ref name="Gierymski" /> As observed by Władysław Smólski (1909–1986), who visited her often during the first year of the War, the drama unfolding around her proved for Łazowertówna an opportunity to rise to the occasion displaying unhoped-for reserves of determination and strength.<ref name="Smólski" /> She immediately began collaboration with the Jewish charitable organization [[CENTOS (charity)|CENTOS]] whose mission was the care for orphan&shy;ed or homeless children.<ref>Tadeusz K. Gierymski, "O tym nie można ani mówić, ani milczeć" (A Subject Unfit to be Talked About or to be Passed Over in Silence), ''Spojrzenia'' ([[ezine]]), No.&nbsp;123, April 28, 1995.  ISSN 1067-4020.  [http://www.andsol.org/cudze/Spojrzenia/spoj123 (See online.)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034437/http://www.andsol.org/cudze/Spojrzenia/spoj123 |date=January 6, 2014 }} On CENTOS (''or'' Centos; "The Central Organization for Orphan Care"), see [[Barbara Engelking]] & [[Jacek Leociak]], ''The Warsaw Ghetto: A&nbsp;Guide to the Perished City'', tr.

Her duties were those of a [[copywriter|copy-writer]] for the various ''ad hoc'' utilitarian publications of that charitable institution (information leaflets, appeals for donations, etc.).<ref name="Kassow181">Samuel D. Kassow, ''Who will Write Our History?: Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive'', [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington (Indiana)]], Indiana University Press, 2007, p.&nbsp;181. {{ISBN|9780253349088}}, {{ISBN|0253349087}}.</ref>

She was subsequently recruited by Ringelblum to staff the Oyneg Shabbos Archives {{mdash}} also known as the [[Emanuel Ringelblum Archives]] in the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]]'s [[Memory of the World Register – Europe and North America|Memory of the World Register]] {{mdash}} where she distinguished herself in her work documenting the tragic vicissitudes of fate of refugees from various parts of Poland, having been praised by Ringelblum for her remarkable ability to bring to life and instill with vivid actuality the dry statistical facts recorded for the posterity by the organization about individual human beings.<ref name="Kassow181/2">Samuel D. Kassow, ''Who will Write Our History?: Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive'', [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington (Indiana)]], Indiana University Press, 2007, pp.&nbsp;181{{ndash}}182. {{ISBN|9780253349088}}, {{ISBN|0253349087}}.</ref>

In the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto]] she continued to write poetry.  Apart from the testimony to the realities of Ghetto life memorialized in the famous poem "[[Mały szmugler]]" ([[The Little Smuggler]]), there also survives (preserved in the [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature, Warsaw|Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature]] of [[Warsaw]]) the letter of Łazowertówna addressed to the poet [[Roman Kołoniecki]] (1906{{ndash}}1978) and dated September 6, 1941, a moving lyrical account of the Ghetto streets and the passersby to be encountered in them.<ref>[[Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature, Warsaw|The Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature]], [[Library classification|shelf mark]]&nbsp;2235, vol.&nbsp;2.  Cf. [[Piotr Matywiecki]], ''Kamień graniczny'', [[Warsaw]], Latona, 1994, pp.&nbsp;196 & 276.  {{ISBN|8385449205}}.</ref>

Łazowertówna had apparently no illusions that she needed outside help in order to survive: already in February or March 1940 (many months before the creation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto]]), she enlisted the services of Ludwik Brandstaetter, the father of the well-known writer [[Roman Brandstaetter]], in approaching a mutual Polish poet-friend with a request for assistance with resettlement in [[Cracow]], a city which she believed would offer her anonymity and hence greater security.<ref>Edward Kozikowski, ''Więcej prawdy niż plotki: wspomnienia o pisarzach czasów minionych'', [[Warsaw]], Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1964, p.&nbsp;431.</ref> One last (bitter) comment on the ultimate fate of Łazowertówna is offered by [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] himself:
:<span style="font-size:95%; line-height: 1.7em;">Łazowertówna was ill with a lung condition; however without a substantial amount of money in cash, without some ten thousand [[Polish złoty|zlotys]] or so, one could not dream of [crossing over to] the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|Aryan side]]... she had lots of Polish friends, after all they honoured her with many an authorial evening reception, she was a member of the [[Polish Writers' Union]] {{mdash}} despite all this there wasn't anyone in the end to save her...<ref name="Gierymski" /></span>

However, Władysław Smólski reports that when it became clear in the course of 1941 that the Ghetto would be eventually closed off from the outside world, many of Łazowertówna's friends counselled her to leave the precinct (together with her mother) while this was still possible, offering to find a [[safe house]] for the two of them.  She apparently refused to do so, arguing that she was needed by the most unfortunate of beings, the children, orphaned or homeless, from whom she cared at the time.<ref>Władysław Smólski, "Tragiczny los poetki" (The Tragic Fate of a Poetess), ''Stolica'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;20, No.&nbsp;14 (904), April 4, 1965, p.&nbsp;16.

(Engelking (b.&nbsp;1962) claims that Łazowertówna "refused to cross over to the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|Aryan side]] because she did not want to be separated from her mother".)</ref>

During the so-called ''[[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|Großaktion Warschau]]'', the mass deportations of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] population to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] conducted by the [[Nazis]] between July and September 1942, Henryka Łazowertówna of her own free will accompanied her mother to the [[Umschlagplatz (Warsaw Ghetto)|Umschlagplatz]] or the railway loading-dock that served as a point of departure for the victims being sent to their deaths at Treblinka gas chambers some 84&nbsp;kilometres to the north-east [[as the crow flies]].  The organization that employed her, the ''Aleynhilf'', attempted to rescue Łazowertówna from being included in the transport, but when she learned that she would have to leave her mother behind Łazowertówna declined the assistance being offered to her alone.<ref>Samuel D.
