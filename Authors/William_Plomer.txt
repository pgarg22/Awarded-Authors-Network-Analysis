'''William Charles Franklyn Plomer''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (10 December 1903 – 20 September 1973) was a South African and British author, known as a novelist, poet and [[literary editor]]. He also wrote a series of [[libretto]]s for [[Benjamin Britten]]. He wrote some of his poetry under the [[pseudonym]] '''Robert Pagan'''.

Born of British parents in South Africa, he moved to England in 1929 after spending a few years in Japan. Although not as well known as many of his peers, he is recognised as a [[modernist literature|modernist]] and his work was highly esteemed by other writers, including [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Nadine Gordimer]]. He was [[homosexual]], and at least one of his novels portrays a gay relationship, but whether he lived as openly gay himself is unclear.

==Early life: South Africa==
Plomer was born in [[Pietersburg]], in the [[Transvaal Colony]], now [[Polokwane]] in the [[Limpopo Province]] of South Africa, on 10 December 1903, to Charles Campbell Plomer (d. 1955) and Edythe, daughter of farmer Edward Waite-Browne.{{sfn|Alexander|2004}} His parents were English; his father was a colonial [[civil servant]], and the family moved between England and South Africa several times during Plomer's youth, with Plomer educated mostly in the UK, until his father left the civil service and took over a trading station in the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] region.<ref name="Cheney" />

Plomer insisted on the pronunciation of his name as "{{not a typo|ploomer}}" (to rhyme with "rumour"), although his family pronounced it in the usual way.{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}

He started writing his first novel, ''Turbott Wolfe'', when he was just 21, which brought him fame (or notoriety) in the [[Union of South Africa]] upon publication in 1925, which had inter-racial love and marriage as a theme. He was co-founder, editor and major contributor of the short-lived literary magazine ''[[Voorslag]]'' ("Whiplash") with two other South African rebels, [[Roy Campbell (Poet)|Roy Campbell]] and [[Laurens van der Post]] in 1926. It included material in both English and [[Afrikaans]], and intended to publish in the [[Zulu language]], and also attempted to portray the more superior standards of European culture, while promoting a racially equal South Africa. Campbell resigned in protest against the editorial control exerted by the financial backer of the magazine. It never gained a wide readership.{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}

==1926: Japan==
Plomer became a special correspondent for the ''[[Natal Witness]]'', but after Van der Post had met and befriended two Japanese men, one being the Japanese captain of a yacht, Katsue Mori, he and Plomer sailed for Japan in September 1926, Plomer leaving South Africa for the last time. Plomer stayed in Japan until March 1929, completing two volumes of short stories (''I speak of Africa'' and ''Paper Houses'') as well as a collection of poetry. He became friends with academic, poet and author [[Sherard Vines]].{{sfn|Alexander|1989|p=143}} There he fell in love with a Japanese man, Morito Fukuzawa, who became the model for the title character of ''Sado''.<ref name="Cheney"/>

==1929: England==

He then travelled through Korea, China, the [[Soviet Union]], Poland, Germany, and Belgium to England and, through his friendship with his publisher [[Virginia Woolf]] and husband [[Leonard Woolf]], entered the London literary circles. Among his friends there were [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[W.H. Auden]], Forster, [[J.R. Ackerley]] and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref name="Cheney"/> The Woolfs, under their imprint the [[Hogarth Press]], published ''Sado'' in 1931 and ''The Case is Altered'' in 1932, the latter becoming his most commercially successful novel.{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}

In 1933 Plomer left Hogarth amicably (''Selected Poems'' was published by Hogarth in 1940) and published ''The Child of Queen Victoria and Other Stories'' with [[Jonathan Cape]].{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}

He became a literary editor for [[Faber and Faber]],{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=243}} and became chief [[Publisher's reader|reader]] and literary adviser to Jonathan Cape from 1937 to 1940,<ref name="Cheney"/> where he recognised the saleability of, and edited the first and many more of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] series. Fleming dedicated ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' to Plomer.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=243}}

From 1937, Plomer took part in [[BBC radio]] broadcasts, and contributed to the [[Aldeburgh Festival]] from its start in 1948. From the late 1950s, he contributed to frequent poetry readings and events, served on the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] and the board of the [[Society of Authors]].<ref name=durham />

He is known to have used the pseudonym "Robert Pagan", notably for some of his poetry.<ref name="Cheney"/>

He was also active as a [[librettist]], with ''[[Gloriana]]'', ''[[Curlew River]]'', ''[[The Burning Fiery Furnace]]'' and ''[[The Prodigal Son (Britten)|The Prodigal Son]]'' for [[Benjamin Britten]].<ref name="Cheney"/>

At least one source (Alexander) says that Plomer was never openly gay during his lifetime; at most he alluded to the subject.{{sfn|Alexander|1989|p=194}} However Southworth says that he lived relatively openly as a [[homosexual]] in Japan, and portrayed gay relationships in a number of his novels, including ''Sado'', ''The Case is Altered'', and ''The Invaders''.{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}

==Later life, death==
In later life he collaborated with artist [[Alan Aldridge]] on a book of children’s verse, ''The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper’s Feast''.<ref name="Cheney"/>

Plomer described himself as "Anglo-African-Asian" in a 1967 article of that name, nearly 40 years after his return to England.{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}

The England and Wales National Probate Calendar records that at the time of his death, his address was 43, Adastra Avenue in [[Hassocks]], West Sussex{{sfn|Alexander|1989|p=310+}} (Cuckfield Vol 5H, Page 547, 3rd Quarter of 1973); another source gives Lewes, the location of a nearby hospital, as place of death.<ref name="Cheney"/> He died on 20 September 1973 aged 69 in the arms of his partner of almost thirty years, Charles Erdmann.<ref name="Cheney"/><ref name=TimesObit />{{sfn|Shieff|2012|p=454}} The date given by Encyclopaedia Britannica and in the ''London Gazette'' is incorrect.<ref name=EB /><ref name=LG46242 />

==Recognition, legacy==
In 1951 Plomer was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].<ref name=durham/>

He was awarded an honorary [[D.Litt.]] by the [[University of Durham]] in 1959.<ref name=durham/>

In 1966 he chaired the panel of judges for the [[Cholmondeley Award]].<ref name=durham/>

He won the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] in 1963.<ref name=durham/>

He was publicly tipped for the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureateship]] in 1967 and 1972.<ref name=durham/>

He was awarded a [[CBE]] in 1968.<ref name=durham/>

In 1958 he was elected president of the [[Poetry Society]].<ref name=durham/>

In 1976, the inaugural Mofolo-Plomer Prize, created by [[Nadine Gordimer]] and so named in honour of [[Basotho]] writer [[Thomas Mofolo]] and Plomer,<ref name=first/> was awarded to [[Mbulelo Mzamane]].<ref name=gov.za /> The judges for that year were [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Alan Paton]] and [[Adam Small (writer)|Adam Small]].<ref name=first /> Since then, [[Achmat Dangor]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], [[Njabulo Simakahle Ndebele]], [[Rose Zwi]] and [[Peter Wilhelm]] have been other recipients of the prize.

[[Nadine Gordimer]], in her introduction to a new edition of ''Turbott Wolfe'' in 2003, said that the novel deserved recognition as being in the "canon of renegade colonialist literature along with [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]]", and others have noted its experimental narrative structure, which puts it (along with some of his other work) in the category of a [[Literary modernism|modernist]] novel.{{sfn|Southworth|2012|p=}}<ref name="Cheney"/>

His last work, the collection of children's poems entitled ''The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper’s Feast'', won the 1973 [[Whitbread Award]].<ref name="Cheney"/>

[[Durham University]] has an extensive collection of Plomer's literary papers and correspondence, as well as his library of printed books, and lists a full bibliography on its website.<ref name=durham/>

A portrait of Plomer seated on a chair, in [[oil painting|oils]], dated 1929, by [[Edward Wolfe (artist)|Edward Wolfe]], and several photographs of Plomer, by [[Howard Coster]] and others are held by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London.<ref>{{npg name}}</ref>
