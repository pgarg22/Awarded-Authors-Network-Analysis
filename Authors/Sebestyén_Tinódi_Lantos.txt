'''Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos''' (c. 1510 in Tinód – 30 January 1556 in [[Sárvár]]) was a 16th-century [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] lyricist, epic poet, political historian, and minstrel.

Little is known about Tinódi's childhood. He attended various schools and studied [[Latin language|Latin]], and excelled at sheet music. He joined the military service in 1535 and in 1539 was wounded in a battle, which rendered him ineligible for further military service. In 1541, when [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] invaded, it made a big impression on him.  He became a political poet at this time, his works expressing the need to resist the Turks.

Tinódi started a family, and visited parliament and scenes of battles, and wrote poems about these. He then began to put his poems to music and performed them to the accompaniment of a lute, which led to his nickname, "Lantos" - the lute-player. His songs became recognized as an important chronicalization of the events of the day by [[Tamás Nádasdy]] in 1545, who recommended to Parliament that this become a public post for Tinódi. From 1546 to 1551 there was a general period of peace, but in 1552 a new Ottoman military campaign began, and this was again chronicled by Tinódi.
 
In 1553, he was formally recognized by the king as a chronicler who processed the historical events of his age in a poem form, and was conferred the patent of nobility. The collected edition of his works was published in 1554.  He traveled to [[Transylvania]] for a while and returned in 1555, but died shortly thereafter.
