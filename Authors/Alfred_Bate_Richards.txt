==Journalist==
From 1848 to 1850 Richards edited a weekly newspaper, ''The British Army Despatch''. On 3 August 1850 he started a new weekly journal, ''The Mirror of the Time'', which lasted only a year. From 29 June to 31 December 1855 he was the first editor of the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]''. In 1870 Richards was appointed editor of the ''[[Morning Advertiser]]'', in succession to [[James Grant (newspaper editor)|James Grant]], and held the position until his death.<ref name=DNB/>

Together with authors and journalists such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], Richards was a leading member of the Administrative Reform Association, founded in 1854.<ref>Anderson.</ref> He was on the platform for the Association's meeting of 26 January 1856 that strongly criticised the failings of the British Government that had contributed to the fall of the Turkish fortress of [[Siege of Kars|Kars]] towards the end of the [[Crimean War]].<ref>''The Observer'', 27 January 1856.</ref>

==Volunteer movement==
Richards was an advocate of enrolling of rifle corps throughout United Kingdom as a precaution against invasion; and while editor of ''The Daily Telegraph'' he publicised the subject. In 1858 he was appointed secretary of the National and Constitutional Defence Association, which was formed to give effect to the scheme. A public meeting was held, through his efforts, in St. Martin's Hall, Long Acre, on 16 April 1859; Admiral [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Napier]] presided, and, as a result, the [[War Office]] issued, on 12 May 1859, a circular which authorised the enrolling of rifle volunteers.<ref name=DNB/><ref>Beckett, pp. 16, 19.</ref>

Richards then hired rooms in the City of London, and enlisted 1000 men to form the 'Workmen's Volunteer Brigade'.<ref name=DNB/><ref>Beckett, pp. 19, 61, Appendix VI, pp. 277–8.</ref><ref>Planck, p. 2.</ref> Although the unit began holding parades at the City of London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] in the autumn of 1860,<ref name = Papers>''Morning Advertiser'', ''Times'', 24 Sep; ''Volunteer Services Gazette'', 29 Sep; ''Bengal Hurkaru'' 31 Oct 1860.</ref> the first officers' commissions were not issued until 26 April 1861, when the unit was formally adopted as the [[7th (City of London) Battalion London Regiment|3rd City of London Rifle Volunteer Corps]]. The men were generally less well-off than some other London corps recruited from the professions and middle classes, but the unit received some financial support from the [[City of London]] and the [[Livery company|Livery Companies]]. It adopted the motto ''[[LABOR OMNIA VINCIT]]'' (Work conquers everything) derived from [[Virgil]].<ref>Becket, Appendix VII.</ref><ref>Planck, pp. 2–3.</ref><ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 161.</ref><ref>Ehrlich.</ref>

Richards invited Maj-Gen [[William Ferguson Beatson]] of the [[Bengal Army]] to be the 3rd London RVC's honorary colonel. Beatson was a friend of [[Richard Francis Burton]] and was in London in connection with a court case. He had previously been supported by Richards and the Radicals in a series of high-profile disagreements with the [[War Office]]. Beatson took the salute at a parade in the Guildhall on 22 September 1860, but was under orders to return to India and was unable to accept the role permanently.<ref name = Papers/>

The 3rd London RVC needed a wealthy patron, and Richards next persuaded [[de Bathe baronets|Sir William de Bathe, Bt]] to become the [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel commandant]], with Richards his second-in-command, ranked as a [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]]. In 1861 Bathe and Richards became Honorary Colonel and Lt-Col Commandant respectively. Richards retired from the position in 1867, but the unit continued without him, becoming the [[7th (City of London) Battalion London Regiment]] in 1908.<ref>Planck, Appendix A, p. 243, Appendix G, p. 258.</ref> The Standards and Colours of these units are still on display at Grove Park Army Reserve Centre and can be viewed by appointment.

At the same time that he was raising the 3rd London RVC, Richards was also a member of the Garibaldi Special Fund, along with the journalist [[George Holyoake]]. The Committee raised money to send a force of volunteers, the 'British Legion', to assist [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in his campaign to liberate the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] from its [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] overlords. Many of the 'Garibaldi Excursionists', as the Legion was nicknamed, were members of the new Rifle Volunteer Corps.<ref>Stevenson.</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Richards died on 12 June 1876, in his fifty-seventh year, at 22 Brunswick Square, London, and was buried in St. Peter's churchyard, [[Croydon]]. The rifle-volunteer movement grew rapidly, as the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], and by the end of the century had enrolled well over 200,000.<ref name=DNB/>

==Works==

On 18 November 1841 Richards brought out an anonymous pamphlet ''Oxford Unmasked'', in which he denounced abuses in the organisation of the university. It passed through five editions; and its authorship became known. His first dramatic work, published in 1845, was a five-act tragedy ''Crœsus, King of Lydia''. Four other five-act dramas followed: ''Runnymede'' in 1846, ''Cromwell'' in 1847, ''Isolda, or Good King Stephen'' in 1848, and ''Vandyck, a Play of Genoa'', in 1850. In 1846 there appeared his first volume of poems, ''Death and the Magdalen'', and in 1848 another, entitled ''The Dream of the Soul''.<ref name=DNB/>

A nationalist and militarist, opposed to the Manchester school of politicians, Richards issued in 1848, in the form of a letter addressed to [[Richard Cobden]], a denunciation of the "peace-at-any-price party", under the title of ''Cobden and his Pamphlet considered''. Another volume was ''Britain Redeemed and Canada Preserved'', anticipating a railway between the Atlantic and the Pacific. ''Poems, Essays, and Opinions'' (2 vols.), and ''Essays and Opinions'' (2 vols.) consisted of writings from ''The Mirror of the Time''. He brought out, in 1854, a collection of lyrics called ''The Minstrelsy of War''.<ref name=DNB/>
[[File:Medea-Sandys.jpg|thumb|''Medea'' (1868) by [[Frederick Sandys]].]]
In 1869 Richards published ''Medea'', a poetic rhapsody on the picture by [[Frederick Sandys]]. In 1871 his only novel ''So very Human'' was published, with a title suggested by a phrase from [[Charles Dickens]]. Besides the five dramas above, Richards produced four others. One of these, his tragedy of ''Norma'', based on the libretto of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera, was performed for the first time on 5 February 1875 at [[Belfast]], with Miss Wallis in the title rôle. His other dramatic works, which were not published, were ''The Prisoner of Toulon'', ''King Pym, or the Great Rebellion'', and ''Love and Patience''.<ref name=DNB/>
