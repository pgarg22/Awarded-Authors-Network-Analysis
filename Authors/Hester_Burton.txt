'''Hester Burton''' (6 December 1913 – 17 September 2000)<!--immediate source is Ext link LCCN--> was an English writer, mainly of [[historical fiction]] for children and young adults. She received the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for her 1963 novel ''[[Time of Trial]],''<ref name=medal1963/> which like many of her books was illustrated by [[Victor Ambrus]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/time-of-trial/oclc/254124829 ''Time of Trial''] at [[WorldCat]].</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:TB 1953 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Flood waters at [[Erith]], 1953 which killed 41 people in Suffolk and inspired Burton's novel ''The Great Gale.'']]
She was born Hester Wood-Hill on 6 December 1913, in [[Beccles]], Suffolk, where her father was elected town [[Mayor]] three times.<ref name="Hester Burton; Obituary">{{Cite news |title=Hester Burton; Obituary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1372403/Hester-Burton.html |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 October 2000}}</ref> From 1925 to 1936, she attended [[Headington School, Oxford]] and then [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], where she received an honours degree in English.<ref name=medal1963/> In 1937, she married Reginald W. B. Burton, a Classics don at [[Oriel College]]. They had three daughters.<ref name=telegraph/>

==Non-fiction==
In 1949, Burton published a biography of [[Barbara Bodichon]], the 19th-century feminist, artist and educationalist. She worked for Oxford University Press from 1956 to 1964, contributing two volumes to the Oxford Sheldonian English Series for secondary schoolchildren: ''Coleridge and the Wordsworths,'' 1953,<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/coleridge-and-the-wordsworths/oclc/3350161 ''Coleridge and the Wordsworths''] at WorldCat.</ref> and ''Tennyson'' in 1954.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tennyson-selection-and-commentary-by-hester-burton/oclc/504708317 ''Tennyson''] at WorldCat.</ref> She worked as an assistant editor for the revised ''Oxford Junior Encyclopaedia'',<ref name=medal1963/><ref name=telegraph/> and edited two 1959 anthologies: ''A Book of Modern Stories''<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/book-of-modern-stories/oclc/154811371 ''A Book of Modern Stories''] at WorldCat.</ref> and ''Her First Ball''.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/her-first-ball-short-stories/oclc/18530428 ''Her First Ball''] at WorldCat.</ref>

In addition, Burton edited works by friends and colleagues, including ''Thomas Hardy: Distracted Preacher? Hardy's Religious Biography and its Influence on his Novels'' by Timothy R. Hands and Mike Esbester.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hands, Timothy R |first1=Esbester, Mike |title=Thomas Hardy: Distracted Preacher? Hardy's Religious Biography and its Influence on his Novels |date=1989 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=1349200352 |page=ix}}</ref>

==Fiction==
Burton's first children's novel was ''The Great Gale'', published 1960 and inspired by the devastation of the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] on her home county of [[Suffolk]].<ref name="Hester Burton; Obituary"/> Her subject matter often reflects a radical approach popularised by [[Geoffrey Trease]]. It includes the slave trade in ''To Ravensrigg'' and the [[Captain Swing]] riots of the 1830s in ''No Beat of Drum'' and ''Otmoor for Ever.'' She sometimes covered similar themes for different age groups; ''Beyond the Weir Bridge'' is for teens, while the same issues and events appear for six to nine-year-olds in ''Through the Fire''. Several are set in Suffolk, many having a maritime or naval setting.<ref name=FF> Fantastic Fiction [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/b/hester-burton "Hester Burton"].</ref>

Rather than balancing divergent views, Burton presented her stories from the angles of individuals or groups, which she saw as more authentic. In a 1973 interview, she explained, "I am not all-wise or all-knowing... but neither were the people actually taking part.... It is a wise precaution for a writer of historical fiction to limit this range of vision... [and] also much better art."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Gamble, Nikki |first1=Yates, Sally |title=Exploring Children's Literature: Teaching the Language and Reading of Fiction |date=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=978-1412930123 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96t8LdsoVX4C&q=hester+burton+author&pg=PA116 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref>

Many of her books, such as ''No Beat of Drum'' and ''A Time of Trial,'' reflect the impact of social inequalities on her protagonists, their willingness to challenge them, and the value they placed on education as a promoter of change.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Ann Christine |title=Historical Fiction for Children and Young People: changing fashions, changing forms, changing representations in British writing 1934‐2014 |date=2015 |publisher=PHD Thesis for Newcastle University |page=101 |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3215/1/Clark,%20A.C.%202016.pdf |accessdate=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923162642/https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3215/1/Clark,%20A.C.%202016.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Her biography of the Victorian feminist Barbara Bodichon shows her abiding interest in women's issues; her novels have strong, independent heroines, and many of Ambrus's cover illustrations emphasise female character.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Ann Christine |title=Historical Fiction for Children and Young People: changing fashions, changing forms, changing representations in British writing 1934‐2014 |date=2015 |publisher=PHD Thesis for Newcastle University |page=98 |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3215/1/Clark,%20A.C.%202016.pdf |accessdate=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923162642/https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3215/1/Clark,%20A.C.%202016.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' summarises her novels as "featuring heroines with strong opinions; class tensions and social justice are recurring themes. Her writing is unsentimental... and her books accounts of ordinary young people affected by national events."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Zipes |first1=Jack (ed) |title=Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature |date=2006 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0195146565 |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_o5w8 |accessdate=17 September 2018 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

In a letter of February 2006, one of Burton's daughters wrote, "I could always tell when Mum had another book on her mind, she would start to cook the meal while still wearing her overcoat and hat.''<ref name="Hester Burton; Books">{{cite web |last1=Mackenzie |first1=James |title=Hester Burton; Books |url=http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/hesterburton.html |website=Collecting Books & Magazines |accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref>
