'''William J. Palmer''' (born 1943) is an American professor of English and the author of the "Mr. Dickens" series of Victorian [[Crime fiction|murder mysteries]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = The Dick in Dickens :  THE DETECTIVE AND MR. DICKENS: A Secret Victorian Journal Attributed to Wilkie Collins, Discovered and Edited. By William J. Palmer  (St. Martin's Press: $17.95; 290 pp.)|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-20/books/bk-1029_1_wilkie-collins|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1991-01-20|access-date = 2016-01-23|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = Laura|last = Kalpakian}}</ref> He is also the author of "The Wabash Trilogy" (2010), three novels under one cover. The trilogy includes: "The Wabash Baseball Blues", a sports novel about industrial softball; "The Red Neck Mafia", a crime novel; and "Civic Theater", a comic backstage novel. all three of these novels are set in the Wabash river valley of Indiana.

His ''The Uses of Money'' (2016), set in post-hurricanes, post-earthquake Haiti, is the story of a love affair set against the backdrop of an American mission trip. At times a romance, at times a kidnap thriller, but always a work of global social consciousness, it explores the potential for humanitarian aid to the world's poorest heart of darkness.

His ''Two Cities'' (2017) is a bi-coastal political eco-thriller set in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. Before, during, and after the biggest protest march in modern history, two brothers must fight to put the world back together. As the title signals, this novel poses the literary question: ''"''What would Dickens's ''A Tale of Two Cities'' read like if written in 2017?"

Academically, Palmer has written books and articles on the nature of [[literary criticism]] and the [[history of film]].<ref>including ''The Films of the Seventies: A Social History'' (1987); ''The Films of the Eighties: A Social History'' (1994) and ''The Films of the Nineties: The Decade of Spin'' (2009).</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Staff|year=1995|title=Do movies shape your opinions?|journal=USA Today Magazine|volume=123 |issue=2598|pages=6&ndash;7|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Do+movies+shape+your+opinions%3F-a016805664}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newswise.com/articles/expert-talks-about-effects-of-world-trade-center-movie?ret=/articles/list&category=life-popular&page=59&search%5Bsub_section%5D=34 "Expert talks about effects of ‘World Trade Center’ movie"] ''Newswise'' 9 August 2006</ref>
