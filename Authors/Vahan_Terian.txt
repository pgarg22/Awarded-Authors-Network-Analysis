== Biography ==
[[File:ArmenianStamps-514.jpg|thumb|left|Vahan Teryan on a 2011 Armenian stamp.]]
Terian was born in the Gandza village (განძანი) of [[Javakheti]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (then in [[Russian Empire]]).  Schooled in [[Tiflis]], he then studied at the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages|Lazarian College]] in Moscow, where he was exposed to symbolism and joined the Russian Social Democrats.  He was jailed by Czarist police for his political activity.
He is mostly known for his poems dedicated to autumn and love. That's why Teryan is known as "Singer of Autumn" in Literature. He published his first book of poems, "Dreams at Dusk", in 1908, which made him an immediate sensation, Hovhannes Tumanian calling him the most original lyric poet of his age.  He later published "Night Remembrance", "The Golden Legend", "The Return", "The Golden Link", "In the Land of Nairi" (where he substitute the word 'Nairi' for each instance where the word 'Armenia' would have suited), and "The Cat's Paradise".  His poems are filled with images of rain, mist, pallid fields and shapeless shadows, symbols of sorrow, despair and eventually, peace.

In 1913, Terian left Moscow University for the University of St. Petersburg, where he majored in oriental languages, intensifying his political involvement.  After the revolution he became representative of Armenians in the Ministry of Nations, personally working with Lenin and Stalin. In 1916, Vahan Terian published a collection of poems entitled ''Land of Nairi'' (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]:  (Yerkir Nairi), in which he uses ''Nairi'' in place of Armenia. Likewise in 1923, [[Yeghishe Charents]] wrote a satirical novella entitled ''Land of Nairi'', using once again Nairi as a synonym for Armenia. [[Nairi Zarian|Hayastan Yeghiazarian]] used Nairi Zarian as his pen name, replacing his first name, Hayastan (which is what Armenians call Armenia in their own language since the Late Middle Ages) with [[Nairi (Armenian usages)|Nairi]].

He died in [[Orenburg]] of tuberculosis shortly before his 35th birthday.  He was buried there and the grave had been marked by a wooden cross, which was quickly forgotten and the exact spot lost. In 1964 soil from the Orenburg cemetery was brought to [[Yerevan]] by Terian's daughter and buried in the [[Komitas Pantheon]] with a cenotaph was placed.<ref>[http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&grave_id=hush797062e2eafa78e&gcemetery=Komitas+Pantheon&page=7fr%2FOEZL%2Ftu1wSesukwH3BUsSaSX8FhDPeDTS9lYULQ%3D Teryan's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon]</ref>

Each year there is a commemoration of his life in Javakhk region at Gandza village where he was born.
