'''Agnolo (Angelo) Ambrogini''' (14 July 1454&nbsp;– 24 September 1494), commonly known by his nickname '''Poliziano''' ({{IPA-it|politˈtsjaːno|lang}}; anglicized as '''Politian'''; [[Latin]]: '' Politianus''),<ref name="Kraye1" /> was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[classical scholar]] and [[poet]] of the [[Florentine Renaissance]]. His scholarship was instrumental in the divergence of [[Renaissance Latin|Renaissance (or Humanist) Latin]] from [[Medieval Latin|medieval norms]]<ref name="Celenza1" /><ref name="Moss1" /> and for developments in [[philology]].<ref name="Daneloni1" /> His nickname, ''Poliziano'', by which he is chiefly identified to the present day, was derived from the Latin name of his birthplace, [[Montepulciano]] (''Mons Politianus'').

Poliziano's works include translations of passages from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', an edition of the poetry of [[Catullus]] and commentaries on classical authors and literature. It was his classical scholarship that brought him the attention of the wealthy and powerful [[Medici family]] that ruled [[Florence]]. He served the Medici as a tutor to their children, and later as a close friend and political confidant. His later poetry, including ''La Giostra'', glorified his patrons.

He used his [[didactic]] poem ''Manto'', written in the 1480s, as an introduction to his lectures on [[Virgil]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Poliziano was born as Angelo Ambrogini in [[Montepulciano]], in central [[Tuscany]] in 1454.<ref name="biography1" /> His father Benedetto, a jurist of good family and distinguished ability, was murdered by political antagonists for adopting the cause of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] in Montepulciano; this circumstance gave his eldest son, Angelo, a claim on the [[House of Medici]].

At the age of ten, after the premature death of his father, Poliziano began his studies at [[Florence]], as the guest of a cousin. There he learned the classical languages of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek Language|Greek]]. From [[Marsilio Ficino]] he learned the rudiments of [[philosophy]]. At 13 he began to circulate Latin letters; at 17 he wrote essays in Greek versification; and at 18 he published an edition of [[Catullus]]. In 1470 he won the title of ''homericus adulescens'' by translating books II-V of the ''[[Iliad]]'' into Latin [[hexameter]]s. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the autocrat of Florence and the chief patron of learning in [[Italy]] at the time, took Poliziano into his household, made him the tutor of his children,<ref name="Cathenc1" /> among which were [[Piero the Unfortunate]] and Giovanni, the future [[Pope Leo X]]. The humanistic content of his lessons brought him into constant conflict with their mother, [[Clarice Orsini|Clarice]]. Lorenzo also secured him a distinguished post at the [[University of Florence]]. During this time, Poliziano lectured at the Platonic Academy under the leadership of Marsilio Ficino, at the Careggi Villa.

===Adulthood and teaching===

Among Poliziano's pupils could be numbered the chief students of [[Europe]], the men who were destined to carry to their homes the ''[[spolia opima]]'' of [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]]. He also educated students from [[Germany]], [[England]] and [[Portugal]].

It was the method of professors at that period to read the Greek and Latin authors with their class, dictating [[philology|philological]] and critical notes, emending corrupt passages in the received texts, offering elucidations of the matter, and teaching [[laws]], [[manners]], religious and philosophical [[opinions]] of the ancients. Poliziano covered nearly the whole ground of classical literature during his tenure, and published the notes of his courses upon [[Ovid]], [[Suetonius]], [[Statius]], [[Pliny the Younger]], and [[Quintilian]]. He also undertook a recension of the text of [[Justinian II]]'s [[Pandects]] and lectured about it. This recension influenced the [[Roman law|Roman]] code.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Proposal to King John II of Portugal===

Poliziano wrote a letter to [[John II of Portugal]] paying him a profound homage:

:''to render you thanks on behalf of all who belong to this century, which now favours of your quasi-divine merits, now boldly competing with ancient centuries and all Antiquity.''

and considering his achievements to be of merit above [[Alexander the Great]] or [[Julius Caesar]]. He offered himself to write an epic work giving an account of John II's accomplishments in navigation and conquests. The king replied in a positive manner, in a letter of October 23, 1491, but delayed the commission. The epic work regarding [[Portuguese discoveries]] was only written almost one hundred years later by [[Luís de Camões]].<ref name="XDjDf">{{cite book|author=Manuel Bernardes Branco|title=Portugal e os Estrangeiros|year=1879|pages=[https://archive.org/details/portugaleosestr02brangoog/page/n450 415]–417|publisher=Livraria de A.M.Pereira|location=Lisboa|url=https://archive.org/details/portugaleosestr02brangoog}} (Translation of the Latin by [[Teófilo Braga]])'' "render-vos graças em nome de todos quantos pertencemos a este século, o qual agora, por favor dos vossos méritos quasi-divinos, ousa já denodadamente competir com os vetustos séculos e com toda a antiguidade."''</ref>

===Final years===

Poliziano spent his final years without financial or other worries, studying philosophy. [[Piero the Unfortunate]] even asked [[Pope Alexander VI]] to make him a cardinal.

It is likely that Poliziano was [[homosexual]], or at least had male lovers, and he never married.<ref name="Strathern1" /> Evidence includes denunciations of [[sodomy]] made to the Florentine authorities, poems and letters of contemporaries, allusions within his work (most notably the ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'') and the circumstances of his death. The last suggests he was killed by a fever (possibly resulting from [[syphilis]]) which was exacerbated by standing under the windowsill of a boy he was infatuated with despite being ill.<ref name="DelLungo1" /> He may also have been a lover of [[Pico della Mirandola]].<ref name="12TeL">''The Ugly Renaissance,'' Lee, A., (2013), p.3</ref>

But it is just as likely that his death was precipitated by the loss of his friend and patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in April 1492, Poliziano himself dying on 24 September 1494, just before the foreign invasion gathering in France swept over Italy.

In 2007, the bodies of Poliziano and [[Pico della Mirandola]] were exhumed from the [[San_Marco,_Florence|Church of San Marco]] in Florence to establish the causes of their deaths.<ref name="ef05t">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6920443.stm Medici writers exhumed in Italy].

==Legacy==

Poliziano was well known as a scholar, a professor, a critic, and a Latin poet in an age when the classics were still studied with assimilative curiosity, and not with the scientific industry of a later period. He was the representative of that age of scholarship in which students drew their ideal of life from [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. He was also known as an Italian poet, a contemporary of [[Ariosto]].

At the same time he was busy as a translator from the Greek. His versions of [[Epictetus]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]], [[Plutarch]]'s ''Eroticus'' and [[Plato]]'s ''Charmides'' distinguished him as a writer. Of these learned labors, the most universally acceptable to the public of that time were a series of discursive essays on philology and [[criticism]], first published in 1489 under the title of ''Miscellanea''. They had an immediate and lasting effect, influencing the scholars of the next century.

Anthony Grafton writes that Poliziano's "conscious adoption of a new standard of accuracy and precision" enabled him "to prove that his scholarship was something new, something distinctly better than that of the previous generation":<blockquote>
By treating the study of antiquity as completely irrelevant to civic life and by suggesting that in any case only a tiny elite could study the ancient world with adequate rigor, Poliziano departed from the tradition of classical studies in Florence. Earlier Florentine humanists had studied the ancient world in order to become better men and citizens. Poliziano by contrast insisted above all on the need to understand the past in the light of every possibly relevant bit of evidence — and to scrap any belief about the past that did not rest on firm documentary foundations&nbsp;... [But] when he set ancient works back into their historical context Poliziano eliminated whatever contemporary relevance they might have had.<ref name="Grafton1" />
</blockquote>

==Works==

His Latin and Greek works include:
* the poem ''[[Manto (poem)|Manto]]'', in which he pronounced a [[panegyric]] of [[Virgil]];
* the ''Ambra'', which contains an idyllic sketch of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] landscape and a [[eulogy]] of [[Homer]];
* the ''Rusticus'', which celebrated country life;
* the ''Nutricia'', which was intended to serve as a general introduction to the study of ancient and modern poetry.

His principal [[Italian language|Italian]] works are:
* his most highly regarded work in Italian, [[Stanze per la giostra]], or ''[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/25.30.22 La Giostra]'', written upon [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano de' Medici's]] victory in a tournament in 1475. This work was left unfinished following the 1478 [[Pazzi conspiracy]], which resulted in the assassination of its protagonist. In addition, Lorenzo's wife [[Clarice Orsini|Clarice]] strongly disapproved of the humanistic nature of the poem, causing Politian to resign, leave Florence in 1479 and settle in Mantua, where he set to work on the [[Fabula di Orfeo]].
* the ''Orfeo'', a lyrical drama performed at [[Mantua]] with musical accompaniment;
* a collection of Tuscan songs, reproducing various forms of popular poetry distinguished by a roseate fluency.

His philosophical works are:
* ''Praelectio de dialectica'' (1491), an introduction to Aristotelian logic;
* ''Lamia. Praelectio in Priora Aristotelis Analytica'' (1492);
* ''Dialectica'' (1493), an introduction to a course on Aristotelian philosophy.
