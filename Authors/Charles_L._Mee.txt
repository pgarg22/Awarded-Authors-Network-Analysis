'''Charles L. Mee''' (born September 15, 1938) is an American playwright, historian and [[author]] known for his collage-like style of playwriting, which makes use of radical reconstructions of [[found texts]]. He is also a Special Lecturer of [[theater]] at [[Columbia University]].

==Early life and career==
Mee was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]], in 1938.  He contracted polio at the age of fourteen. His memoir ''A Nearly Normal Life'' (1999) tells how that event informed the rest of his life.

After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1960, Mee moved to [[Greenwich Village]] and became a part of the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] scene. Between 1962 and 1964, his plays were presented at venues that included [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa E.T.C]]., [[Joe Cino|Caffe Cino]], Theatre Genesis, and the [[Ontological-Hysteric Theater]].

In 1961 Mee began work at [[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] publishing company and eventually became the editor of the hardback bi-monthly ''[[Horizon (U.S. magazine)|Horizon: A Magazine of the Arts]]''. He was also the Advising Editor and then Contributing Editor of ''Tulane Drama Review'' &ndash; now called ''TDR'' and published from [[New York University]] &ndash; until 1964 and its Associate Editor from 1964 to 1965.

==Literary career==
To support himself and his family, Mee turned from writing plays to writing books in 1965. ''Lorenzo De'Medici and the Renaissance'', the first of his many nonfiction books, was published in 1969 by [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Juvenile Books]].  At the same time, he increasingly became caught up in anti-[[Vietnam War]] politics, campaigning for anti-war congressional candidates and writing anti-war polemics. He did not return to writing for the theater for 20 years.

In the 1970s, he became the co-founder and chairman of The National Committee on the Presidency, a grassroots organization which called for the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]]. His political activism led to his writing of political histories for the general public.

His ''Meeting at Potsdam'' (1975), about the 1945 [[Potsdam Conference]], was chosen as a main selection of the [[Book of the Month Club|Literary Guild]], and was adapted for both film and television by [[David Susskind]]. He wrote other books on summit diplomacy, international power sharing, and American history, including ''The End of Order: Versailles 1919'' (1980); ''The Marshall Plan: The Launching of Pax Americana'' (1987), and ''The Genius of the People'' (1987), about the 1787 Constitutional Convention. ''Playing God: Seven Fateful Moments When Great Men Met to Change the World'' (1993) was Mee's final published work of history.

''A Visit to Haldeman and Other States of Mind'' (1976) was described as "part autobiographical meditation, part elegiac crank letter to the American Republic, part confession and part essay on democratic politics" in a review by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first = Lance| last = Morrow| title = The '60s Trip| url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,919035,00.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130204110116/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,919035,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = February 4, 2013 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = June 13, 1977|access-date = July 25, 2009}}</ref> [[Greil Marcus]], in 2002, said that it was one of the best books he had read about American patriotism.<ref>[[Greil Marcus|Marcus, Greil]].

''[[The New York Times]]'', (May 18, 2017).</ref>

==Playwriting career==

Mee returned to playwriting in 1985. His libretto for choreographer [[Martha Clarke]]'s ''Vienna: Lusthaus'' was his first produced script since his Off-Off Broadway days. In 2002 Mee revised about a third of his ''Vienna: Lusthaus'' script. It was reprised as ''Vienna: Lusthaus (Revisited)''.  Clarke and Mee collaborated again in ''Belle Époque'' (2004). For years he continued working his day job as the editor-in-chief at consumer health publisher Rebus, Inc. and writing books.

Mee's daughter, [[Erin B. Mee]], also became involved in theater. In 1988 she was invited to direct a production at HOME for Contemporary Theatre and Art in [[SoHo]]. She chose to premiere her father's play, ''The Imperialists at the Club Cave Canem'' (1988), which received positive reviews from the ''[[Village Voice]]''<ref>Solomon, Alisa. "The Mee Generation", ''[[Village Voice]]'' (May 1988)</ref> and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>[[Mel Gussow|Gussow, Mel]] "'Club' Lets The Air Out of Post-Mod Pretensions" ''[[The New York Times]]'' (May 13, 1988)</ref> The play was picked up by [[Joseph Papp]] for a run at [[The Public Theatre]].<ref>Blumenthal, Eileen. "Blitzed-Out Lovers Tell a Tale for Our Time" ''[[The New York Times]]'' (May 1988)</ref> In 2000 Erin B. Mee staged another production of ''The Imperialists at the Club Cave Canem'' at The Market Theatre in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],<ref>Siegel, Ed.

''Another Person is a Foreign Country'' (1991) was the first of Mee's many collaborations with the director [[Anne Bogart]]. The [[En Garde Arts]] site-specific performance took place in the courtyard of the decrepit Towers Nursing Home in New York City.

In 1992 his ''Orestes'' was directed by [[Robert Woodruff (director)|Robert Woodruff]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and by Anne Bogart at the [[SITI Company|Saratoga International Theatre Institute (SITI)]]. In the summer of 1992, [[Tina Landau]] directed an En Garde Arts production as ''Orestes 2.0'' on an abandoned pier on the [[Hudson River]] in Manhattan.

This play was the first of ten plays for which Mee used the Greek texts as a base and added new fragments of text; he then would "throw the scaffolding away and call whatever remained the script."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amrep.org/people/mee1.html |title=All About Mee: Charles Mee Discusses the Creation of ''Full Circle'' |access-date=July 28, 2009 |last=Lester |first=Gideon |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119134624/http://www.amrep.org/people/mee1.html |archive-date=January 19, 2008 }}</ref> In 1996, his ''The Constitutional Convention: A Sequel,'' was produced by [[Clubbed Thumb]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clubbedthumb.org/history/s96/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515135023/http://www.clubbedthumb.org/history/s96/ |archive-date=2009-05-15 }}</ref>

In 2001 Erin B. Mee staged the premiere of her father's ''First Love'' at [[New York Theatre Workshop]]. He had written it specifically for her to direct, and it starred [[Ruth Maleczech]] and Fred Neumann of [[Mabou Mines]].<ref>Broome, Steven. "First Love".

"'First Love' a Comedy of the Aged", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' (June 17, 2002)</ref>

In other plays, Mee explores twentieth-century American history and culture through the points-of-view of contemporary visual artists in: ''bobrauschenbergamerica'' ([[Robert Rauschenberg]]), ''Hotel Cassiopeia'' ([[Joseph Cornell]]), ''soot and spit (the musical)'' [[James Charles Castle|(James Castle)]], and ''Under Construction'' ([[Jason Rhoades]] and [[Norman Rockwell]]).

His comedies and romances include ''Summertime'', ''First Love'', ''True Love'', ''Big Love'', ''Wintertime'', ''Fetes de la Nuit'', ''A Perfect Wedding'', and ''Fire Island.'' As source material, Mee would use Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, Molière, Anton Chekhov, René Magritte paintings, Bollywood musicals, and his own writing.

He is the only resident playwright of the theatre ensemble SITI Company, for whom he wrote ''Orestes'', ''bobrauschenbergamerica'', ''Hotel Cassiopeia'', ''Under Construction'', and ''soot and spit (the musical)''. Mee was the [[Signature Theatre Company (New York City)|Signature Theatre]] Playwright-in-Residence for the 2007–2008 season.

In 2008, Shakespeare and Renaissance scholar [[Stephen Greenblatt]] collaborated with Mee to write ''Cardenio''. It premiered at [[American Repertory Theater]] (A.R.T.) in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amrep.org/cardenio/ |title=A.R.T. Past Productions - Cardenio |access-date=July 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228173117/http://amrep.org/cardenio/ |archive-date=February 28, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2014 Mee co-wrote This Is Not A Theatre Company's ''Pool Play.''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://newyorktheater.me/2014/01/28/pool-play-q-and-a-erin-mee-on-immersive-theater-art-vs-academia-her-famous-father/ | title=Pool Play Q and A: Erin Mee on Immersive Theater, Art vs. Academia, Her Famous Father| date=2014-01-28}}</ref> Audiences sat at the edge of the pool with their feet in the water for an exploration of America's long, joyful, and complicated relationship with the swimming pool. The production included synchronized swimming, an existential boatman, musical numbers, and a snarky fish, along with stories about segregated pools, and a meditation on pollution.

Sarah Lucie of ''[[Show Business Weekly]]'' said: 
<blockquote>The entirety of the play is well executed, featuring a strong ensemble that has absolutely no fear of diving into whatever quirky material is presented to them. Their playfulness is contagious, ultimately creating an uplifting theatrical experience that leaves the audience joyous and refreshed—and maybe a little wet. Pool Play, while undeniably light-hearted, manages to communicate some profound and political themes to those who choose to pay attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbusinessweekly.com/article-2401-pool-play-by-jessie-bear.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150125234450/http://www.showbusinessweekly.com/article-2401-pool-play-by-jessie-bear.html |archive-date=2015-01-25 }}</ref></blockquote>

''Theatre is Easy'' wrote: 
<blockquote>Pool Play&nbsp;... is definitely worth the trip&nbsp;... The entire ensemble showed moments of skill, wit, and brevity far beyond their years. Erin B. Mee does a superb job directing this young group of artists to create a cohesive look at our fascination with the water, entertaining and engaging the audience along the way.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theasy.com/Reviews/2014/P/poolplay.php | title=Theatre is Easy &#124; Reviews &#124; Pool Play}}</ref></blockquote>

In fall 2015 Mee co-wrote ''Versailles 2015'', a site-specific play for a New York City apartment, conceived and directed by Erin B. Mee. ''New York Theatre Review'' noted that "Versailles 2015 is over far too quickly. It is an hors d'oeuvre plate of scenes that collectively&nbsp;... have a message about elitism and the vanity of apathy&nbsp;... Brief and poignant, Versailles 2015 will linger in your mind long after you see it."<ref>Kerry, Rachel. [http://newyorktheatrereview.blogspot.com/2015/10/time-to-party-rachel-kerry-on.html ''New York Theatre Review'']. 14 October 2015.</ref>  Courtney Escoyne of ''Thoughts from a Ballet Nerd'' wrote: "Versailles 2015 is a meditation upon privilege…It blurred the lines between audience and performer, ignored entirely the idea of a fourth wall, and managed to fit in some wonderfully crafted dialogue."<ref>Escoyne, Courtney, [https://awesometrinanerd.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/singing-in-the-shower-the-post-modern-dance-version/ Thoughts from a Ballet Nerd]. 22 October 2015.</ref> Finally, Stephen Kaplan of ''Theatre Is Easy'' said: "Delightful and provocative&nbsp;... Amidst the countless atrocities that confront us every day, at our core we are all struggling to find the naked honesty in our own lives&nbsp;... Versailles 2015 allows us the time to contemplate this in its characters and in ourselves."<ref>Kaplan, Stephen, [http://www.theasy.com/Reviews/2015/V/versailles2015.php ''Theatre Is Easy'']. 11 October 2015.</ref>

Mee's play ''The Glory of The World'' (2015), about [[Thomas Merton]], a noted Trappist monk and activist, was directed by Les Waters. It opened at The Actor's Theatre of Louisville in the spring of that year. It transferred to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in February 2016.

Mee teaches playwriting at the [[Columbia University School of the Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/art/app/arts/theatre/faculty.jsp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805195559/http://wwwapp.cc.columbia.edu/art/app/arts/theatre/faculty.jsp |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |title=Theatre Faculty - Columbia University School of the Arts |access-date=July 29, 2009 }}</ref>

==Style and method of writing==

On Mee's website, ''the (re)making project'', he says "There is no such thing as an original play." and that his plays are "composed in the way that [[Max Ernst]] made his Fatagaga pieces toward the end of World War I: texts have often been taken from, or inspired by, other texts."<ref name="RA">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlesmee.com/html/about.html |title=about the (re)making project - Charles Mee's web site |accessdate=July 29, 2009 }}</ref> An interview with Mee about his work by Erin B. Mee, along with a manifesto and other material, was published in TDR 46:3 (T175).<ref>"Mee on Mee" TDR 46:3 (T175), 88-100.</ref>
 
==Use of the Internet==

Mee began using the internet as a textual source for composing his pieces in the early 1990s. He first began making his own work freely available by posting three of his plays on Carnegie Mellon's humanities [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]]/[[File Transfer Protocol|ftp]]/[[telnet]] [[EServer.org|English Server]] in the mid-1990s. By 1996, with the help of his friend Tom Damrauer, ''the (re)making project'', a web site with his full scripts was launched. It contained an  invitation for people to "do freely whatever they want with them."<ref name="RA"/> He is the first and only playwright to make such a large body of theatre work available on the internet.

This was not viewed by Mee as a challenge to the current copyright law or a vehicle to raise issues of intellectual property. It was done as a populist gesture towards his utopian vision of a free and democratic internet. In 1996 he said "I'm attracted to the idea of things being owned in common." It also represented "Mee's Golden Rule: of do unto my writing as I have done unto the writing of others."<ref>Cummings (2006), pp.84-85</ref>

[[National Public Radio]] called Mee the "Public-Domain Playwright" in 2000 and credited him with touching "a raw cultural nerve" by making his work freely available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1080842 |title=Charles Mee, Public-Domain Playwright |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |date=August 17, 2000 |work=All Things Considered }}</ref>

Writer [[Jonathan Lethem]] credited Mee as one of the inspirations for his "Promiscuous Project" in which he made a selection of his stories available for filmmakers or dramatists to adapt at a dollar apiece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jonathanlethem.com/promiscuous_materials.html |title=Promiscuous Materials Project - Jonathan Lethem's website |access-date=July 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803155753/http://www.jonathanlethem.com/promiscuous_materials.html |archive-date=August 3, 2009 }}</ref>

In an explanation about ''the (re)making project'' on his current website, Mee says that his plays are protected by copyright if they are "essentially or substantially performed" as he has composed them. He continues, however, to invite others to freely pillage his texts to make their own work, without any attribution to him.<ref name="RA"/>

==Patronage==

In 1998, Mee's friend, former chairman of [[Morgan Stanley]] and philanthropist [[Richard B. Fisher]] and his wife, Jeanne Donovan Fisher, offered to provide Mee with enough money to support himself. The rare arrangement imposed no stipulations or conditions upon Mee or his writing nor did it specify how long the relationship would last. Although Richard B. Fisher died in 2004, Jeanne Donovan Fisher continues to support Mee and his work. The Fishers patronage has been hailed as one "without parallel or precedent in American theatrical philanthropy."<ref>{{cite book | last = Schlueter | first = Jennifer. (author. | title = "Patronage and Playwriting: Richard B. and Jeanne Donovan Fisher's Support of Charles L. Mee" in Angels in the American Theater: Patrons, Patronage, and Philanthropy (edited by Robert Schanke)| publisher = Southern Illinois University Press | year = 2007 | location = Carbondale | pages = 89 | isbn = 978-0-8093-2747-8 }}</ref>

Sometime in 2013, concurrent with the launch of a redesigned website, the language regarding patronage changed to the past tense: "Charles Mee's work has been made possible by the support of Richard B. Fisher and Jeanne Donovan Fisher."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://charlesmee.org/ | title=Charles Mee &#124; the (re)making project}}</ref> It is now possible to directly support the project.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://charlesmee.org/support-the-project.shtml | title=Charles Mee &#124; the (re)making project &#124; Support the Project}}</ref>

==Awards==
Among other awards, Charles Mee is the recipient of a lifetime achievement award in drama from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], two [[Obie Award]]s, for ''Vienna: Lusthaus'' (1986) and ''Big Love'' (2002), [[PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award]] for a playwright in mid-career, and the Fisher Award given by the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].
