In the early 1990s while he was living in Minneapolis, Sagal was hired to ghostwrite an autobiography of the 1970s pornography director [[Gail Palmer]].<ref name=FirstVicePres/><ref name=NPROrgPS/><ref name=WNPOPeterSagal/> Sagal discovered that Palmer did not direct the pornography movies attributed to her, and that she was a front for her pornographer boyfriend.<ref name=FirstVicePres/> Peter wrote the book anyway. However, Palmer did not approve of the manuscript, and it has not been published.<ref name=FirstVicePres/>

In October 2007 [[HarperCollins]] published Sagal's ''The Book of Vice: Very Naughty Things (and How to Do Them)''.<ref name=FirstVicePres/><ref name=HarperCollinsMTW/> In the book Sagal revisits the Gail Palmer incident and indicates that his exposure to the porn industry led to his writing ''Book of Vice''.<ref name=FirstVicePres/> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called ''Book of Vice'', "a hilarious, harmlessly prurient look at the banality of regular people’s strange and wicked pleasures".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Book of Vice: Very Naughty Things (and How to Do Them)|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-084382-3|website=publishersweekly.com|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=January 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206105920/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-084382-3|archive-date= February 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!''==
''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'' was designed as a weekly satirical look at the week's news in a quiz format.<ref name=IAVM/> The host of the show was to be a comedian named [[Duck's Breath Mystery Theatre|Dan Coffey]]<ref name=HarvardCrimson/> who would quiz panelists, celebrity guests and non-celebrity callers. The show debuted in January 1998<ref name=HarvardCrimson/><ref name=JoCoCruise/> but had a rocky start. The producers replaced Coffey with Sagal in May 1998.<ref name=HarvardCrimson/><ref name=JoCoCruise/>

''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!'' has become one of the most popular shows on NPR. The radio program is heard weekly by nearly three million listeners on 520 public radio stations nationwide.<ref name=JoCoCruise/><ref name=YakimaSpeakers>{{cite web|title=Peter Sagal|url=http://www.yakimatownhall.com/speakers/|website=Yakima Town Hall Speakers Series|publisher=Yakima Town Hall|access-date=31 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131182832/http://www.yakimatownhall.com/speakers/|archive-date=31 January 2017}}</ref> The ''Wait Wait...

''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!'' has not been without controversy. For instance, Sagal attempted a joke about a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn|Diocese of Brooklyn]] Christmas ad depicting a young woman taking a selfie with a picture of Jesus. He asked why Jesus did not just take the picture for her, and answered "His hands were occupied." Critics including [[Fox News]] host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[First Baptist Church (Dallas)|Dallas First Baptist Church]] senior pastor [[Robert Jeffress]] called the joke blasphemous and accused Sagal specifically and the secular media in general of mocking Christianity. O'Reilly stated that if Sagal's comment was salacious he should be fired. When asked about the incident, NPR President and CEO [[Jarl Mohn]] said, "[T]he show's goal is to poke fun at the news and make people laugh" and he "regrets that we didn't succeed in this case."<ref name=ChristianPostOccupiedHands>{{cite news|last1=Barnhart|first1=Melissa|title=Pastor Robert Jeffress Condemns NPR Host Peter Sagal for Mocking Jesus; NPR's CEO Says He 'Regrets' Joke Didn't Succeed|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/pastor-robert-jeffress-condemns-npr-host-peter-sagal-for-mocking-jesus-nprs-ceo-says-he-regrets-joke-didnt-succeed-130992/|newspaper=[[The Christian Post]]|access-date=January 31, 2017|date=10 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202011222/http://www.christianpost.com/news/pastor-robert-jeffress-condemns-npr-host-peter-sagal-for-mocking-jesus-nprs-ceo-says-he-regrets-joke-didnt-succeed-130992/|archive-date= February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
