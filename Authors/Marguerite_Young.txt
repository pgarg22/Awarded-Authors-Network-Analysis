Young's parents separated when she was very young, and she and her sister, Naomi, were brought up by their maternal grandmother, Marguerite Herron Knight, who was convinced the child Marguerite was the reincarnation of her dead cousin, Little Harry.<ref name=conv>

==Career==

===Education===

Young studied at [[Butler University]] in Indianapolis, receiving a BA in French and English. She then attended the [[University of Chicago]], auditing [[Thornton Wilder]]'s writing class at his invitation.<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref name=CTobit />  She also attended the University of Iowa.

In 1936, she earned her MA in Elizabethan and Jacobean Literature. She wrote her master's thesis on ''Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit'' by [[John Lyly]] (1578).<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref name=CTobit />

While attending the University of Chicago, Young had a part-time position reading Shakespeare to Minna K. Weissenbach. A patron of [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], Weissenbach was sometimes known as "the opium lady of [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]]"  and she became the inspiration for the Opium Lady in Young's ''[[Miss MacIntosh, My Darling]].'' Drug-based flights of fantasy were to make their way into the novel.<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref name=CTobit />

Later, Young received a Ph.D. in philosophy and English from the University of Iowa, where she taught at the prestigious Iowa Writers' Workshop.

===Teaching===

She briefly taught at Shortridge High School before embarking on a distinguished literary career. In New York she held a contract lectureship in English literature during the 1960s at Fordham University.

===Works===

Young's first book of poetry, ''Prismatic Ground'', was published in 1937,<ref name=ParisRev /> while she was teaching English at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis.<ref name="NYTobit"/> In that same year, she visited the commune of [[New Harmony, Indiana]], where her mother and stepfather resided.

After her MA, she taught at an Indianapolis high school and at the University of Iowa.<ref name="NYTobit"/>

In 1943, she moved to New York, where she became known for her works ''Moderate Fable'' (1944 or 1945) and ''Angel in the Forest'' (1945).<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref name=ParisRev />

She relocated to New Harmony and spent seven years there, beginning work on ''Angel in the Forest'', a study of utopian concepts and communities, at the same time producing ''Moderate Fable'' (1944), which won the poetry prize from the National Academy of Arts and Letters. ''Angel in the Forest'' appeared in 1945 and was well received, winning [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] and [[Newberry Library]] awards.

Over the next fifty years, while maintaining an address in New York City's Greenwich Village, Young traveled extensively and was part of a wide literary circle that included [[Mari Sandoz]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Anaïs Nin]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Marianne Hauser]] and [[Allen Tate]], with whom she had an affair.<ref name="NYTobit" /> She also had a complex friendship with [[Carson McCullers]] and [[Truman Capote]]. She wrote articles, poetry, and book reviews while also teaching creative writing at various venues, including the [[New School for Social Research]], [[Fordham University]], and the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].

In 1944, Scribners commissioned her to write a new work, ultimately published as the epic novel ''[[Miss MacIntosh, My Darling]]'' (1965).<ref name=ParisRev /> Although she had intended to take just two years, she did not finish her novel until 1963.<ref name=ParisRev />  Young described it as "an exploration of the illusions, hallucinations, errors of judgment in individual lives, the central scene of the novel being an opium addict's paradise."<ref name="wa"/> [[Anaïs Nin]], in ''The Novel of the Future'', calls it "an epic American novel written in a poetic style." ''[[Miss MacIntosh, My Darling]]'' was not well received critically but developed a cult following.

Young's next project was to be a biography of [[Hoosier]] poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]],<ref name="wa"/><ref name=ParisRev /><ref>

Her experiences in joining the protests against the Vietnam War made her turn her focus to Riley's friendship with [[Eugene V. Debs]].<ref name=Darling /> The digression was to occupy the rest of her life, becoming an ambitious biography of Debs, the union organizer who evolved into the first Socialist candidate for President of the United States (1904, 1908, 1912, 1920). She projected a three-volume epic history of the people, through Debs's battles for workers rights and the development of the Locomotive Firemen's workers union.<ref name="NYTobit"/> ''Harp Song for a Radical: The Life and Times of Eugene Victor Debs'' remained unfinished at the time of her death.<ref name=ParisRev />

Part I, “Prelude in a Golden Key,” portrays Swiss agnostic [[Wilhelm Weitling]]’s cross-country tour of the pioneer utopian communities built during the settlement of the western United States. He visits the Mormon communities in [[Nauvoo, Missouri]] and Salt Lake City, Utah; the [[Shakers]]; the [[Amish]] communities in Pennsylvania; the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] community; the [[Icarians]]; the [[Rappites]], and many other settlements in the wilderness. Through this perspective Young establishes that this nation was founded and settled on the principles of communal ownership and mutual assistance. In Part II of ''Harp Song for a Radical'', Young establishes that [[Eugene Debs]] was the catalyst through which these principles became the basic tenets of the labor movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

During Marguerite Young's final illness, her unfinished manuscript was compiled by Marilyn Hamilton and [[Suzanne Oboler]] and was then submitted to her publisher. After her death, the manuscript was edited by [[Charles Ruas]] to include Young's survey of utopian communities as well as her portraits of major historical figures encountered by Debs in his struggles as a labor organizer: the portraits of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[James Whitcomb Riley]], [[Joe Hill (activist)|Joe Hill]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Brigham Young]], [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]]. This edited version of ''Harp Song for a Radical'' was published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1999.

Also in her last illness, Marguerite Young returned to writing poetry. ''Inviting the Muses,'' a collection of her stories, essays, and reviews, was published by [[Dalkey Archive Press]] in 1994. Young’s papers are at the [[Beinecke Library]], [[Yale University]].

==Influences==

Starting in 1975, [[Charles Ruas]] produced for [[Pacifica Radio|Pacifica radio]] station [[WBAI]] in New York a year-long series of readings from ''[[Miss MacIntosh, My Darling]]'' called [[The Reading Experiment]]. The readings were by Young's contemporaries in the literary, theatre, and journalistic worlds, such as [[Leo Lerman]], [[Wyatt Cooper]], [[Osceola Archer]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[Ruth Ford (actress)|Ruth Ford]], [[James Coco]], [[Peggy Cass]], and [[Earle Hyman]]. The artist Rob Wynne scored each program with concrete sound effects and atonal and harmonic music, as well as opera. The programs were distributed nationally through the [[Pacifica Radio Network]]. The series has been reissued by and is available through [[Clocktower Gallery]]'s Internet station "Art on Air." Renewed interest in the book resulted in the publication in 1979 of a boxed two-volume paperback edition, with an Introduction by [[Anaïs Nin]], by [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], as well as a two-volume paperback edition in 1993 by [[Dalkey Archive Press|Dalkey Archive]].
