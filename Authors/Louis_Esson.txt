In the 1920s he was a co-founder of the Pioneer Players, a theatre company dedicated to the performance of Australian plays and the development of a national theatre.  The Pioneer Players produced 18 new Australian plays in their four years of existence.  The Pioneer Players have been called "a mismanaged collection of fly-by-night amateurs, but somehow he has come to be called 'The Father of Australian drama'".<ref>John McCallum, "Century of Theatre", ''Weekend Australian'', 3–4 July 1999, Review, p. 20</ref>
