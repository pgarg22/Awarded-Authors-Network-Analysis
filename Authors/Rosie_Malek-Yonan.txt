The expected result, she said, was an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Christians from Iraq. At least hundreds have been killed. One priest was quartered and beheaded."<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |title=For Iraqi Christians, Money Bought Survival |first=Andrew E. |last= Kramer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/world/middleeast/26christians.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&ref=middleeast&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin#125%u201CAnyt427+1e60d401 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 June 2008 |page=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20080318055924.htm |title=Genocide Unfolding: Death of a Catholic Assyrian Archbishop in Iraq |author=Malek-Yonan, Rosie |publisher=Assyrian International News Agency |date=18 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianweek.org/stories.php?id=247 |title=Attacks on Iraq Christians largely under-reported |author=Johnston, Geoffrey P. |publisher=ChristianWeek |date=15 December 2008 |volume=22 |number=19 }}</ref>

Reading from her book, she compared the Assyrian genocide of 1914–1918, as depicted in ''The Crimson Field'', to the current plight of the indigenous Assyrian Christians in Iraq. Her 30-minute testimony and plea to the U.S. government, ultimately prompted Congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (R-NJ) to travel to war-torn Iraq to witness matters for himself. While in Iraq, after meeting with local Assyrians, he turned in Malek-Yonan's in depth report to U.S. officials in Iraq.

''The Crimson Field'' is an historical and literary epic novel, set in [[Urmia]], Iran, Russia and San Francisco, [[California]]. It is based on real events and true family chronicles set to the backdrop of the [[Assyrian genocide]] of 1914–1918 in the shadows of World War I where 750,000 [[Assyria]]ns were massacred by the Ottoman Turks and Kurdish tribes in Ottoman Turkey and in the Assyrian inhabited region of Urmi (Urmia) in northwestern Iran. The book was selected as The Assyrian Event of the Year 2005 by ''Zinda'' magazine (22 April 2006).<ref>{{cite web |author=Zinda Magazine |url=http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2006/04.22.06/index_sat.php#zindasays |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185058/http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2006/04.22.06/index_sat.php#zindasays |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-30 |title=Event of the Year |publisher=Zindamagazine.com |accessdate=2014-08-27 }}</ref> It was features in the Winter 2007's fourth issue of ''MAKE'', a Chicago Literary Magazine<ref>{{cite news |title=Rosie Malek-Yonan's ''The Crimson Field'' |editor=Michael Zapata |url= http://makemag.com/issue-4-sister-cities-the-international-issue/ |newspaper=MAKE, A Chicago Literary Magazine |issue=4 |year=2007 }}</ref> and chosen as required reading by Professor Ellene Phufas for a World Literature class for the [[SUNY]] system ([[State University of New York]]) to represent a work about the Christian Genocides in Asia Minor.<ref>{{cite news |title=SUNY Days for The Crimson Field |author=Rosie Malek-Yonan |url=http://www.aina.org/guesteds/20100124025427.htm |newspaper=Assyrian International News Agency |date=24 January 2010 }}</ref>
