'''Vicente García-Huidobro Fernández''' ({{IPA-es|biˈsente ɣwiˈdoβɾo|am}}; January 10, 1893 &ndash; January 2, 1948) was a [[Chile]]an poet born to an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] family. He promoted the [[avant-garde]] literary movement in Chile and was the creator and greatest exponent of the literary movement called ''[[Creacionismo]]'' ("Creationism").

==Life and work==

===Early years===

Huidobro was born into a wealthy family from [[Santiago, Chile]]. He spent his first years in Europe, and was educated by French and English governesses. Once his family was back in Chile, Vicente was enrolled at the Colegio San Ignacio, a [[Company of Jesus|Jesuit]] secondary school in Santiago, where he was expelled for wearing a ring that he claimed was a wedding ring.

In 1910 he studied literature at the Instituto Pedagogico of the [[University of Chile]], but a good part of his knowledge of literature and poetry came from his mother, poet [[María Luisa Fernández (writer)|María Luisa Fernández]] Bascuñán. She used to host "tertulias" or [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] in the family home, where sometimes up to 60 people came to talk and to listen to her talk about literature, with guests including members of the family, servants, maids and a dwarf.<ref>[http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/ensayo_federico_schopf.htm Vicente Huidobro Universidad de Chile] SISIB Universidad de Chile Facultad de Filosofía y Humanidades, Introducción a Vicente Huidobro, Federico Schopf</ref> Later, in 1912, she would help him financially and emotionally to publish his first magazine "Musa Joven" (Young Muse).<ref>[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-92185.html Musa Joven – Memoria Chilea]. Algunos derechos reservados – 2014</ref>

In 1911 he published ''Ecos del alma'' (''Echoes of the Soul''), a work with [[Modernism|modernist]] tones. The following year he married Manuela Portales Bello. In 1913 he published ''Canciones en la noche'' (''Songs in the Night'').<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cancionesenlanoc00huid Canciones en la noche] 2014</ref> The book included some poems previously published in "Musa Joven" as well as his first [[calligram]], "Triángulo armónico" ("Harmonic Triangle").

In 1913, along with Carlos Díaz Loyola (better known as [[Pablo de Rokha]]), he published three issues of the magazine ''Azul'' (Blue), and published both ''Canciones en la noche'' and ''La gruta del silencio'' (''The Grotto of Silence''). The next year, he gave a lecture, ''[[Non serviam]]'', in which he reflected on his [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] vision. The same year, in "Pasando y Pasando"<ref>[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-94543.html Pasando y pasando – Memoria Chilena]. Algunos derechos reservados – 2014</ref> (“Passing and Passing”), Vicente explained his religious doubts, earning himself the reproach of both his family and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].

The same year, he published "Las pagodas ocultas" (1916),<ref>[https://archive.org/details/laspagodasoculta00huid Las pagodas ocultas] 2014</ref> and signed it for the first time as Vicente Huidobro.

===Move abroad===

In 1916, he traveled to Buenos Aires with [[Teresa Wilms Montt]], a young poet whom he had rescued from a convent. While in Buenos Aires, Huidobro outlined his [[Creacionismo|creationism literary]] theory, later a literary movement, and published "El espejo de agua" (The Mirror of Water).

Also in 1916, he moved to Europe with his wife and children. While passing through [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]], he met [[Rafael Cansinos-Asséns|Rafael Cansino Assens]], with whom he had exchanged letters since 1914.

He settled in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and published ''Adán'' (1916), a work that began his next phase of artistic development. Huidobro met and mixed with most of the Parisian [[avant garde]] of this period: [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Blaise Cendrars]].

In 1917, he contributed to the magazine Nord-Sud edited by [[Pierre Reverdy]], along with [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[André Breton]], [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Max Jacob]], until a disagreement with Reverdy forced him to leave the magazine. That same year he published ''Horizon carré'', including poems previously shown in "El espejo de agua" translated to French with the help of [[Juan Gris]].

In October 1918, Huidobro traveled to Madrid, making the first in a series of annual trips to that city. There he shared both ''[[Creacionismo]]'' and his knowledge of the Parisian vanguard with the artistic elite. In Madrid, Vicente met with [[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]], refugees in Spain, and resumed his friendship with [[Rafael Cansinos-Assens]]. He started the literary movement ''[[Ultraist movement|Ultraísmo]]'', corresponded with [[Tristan Tzara]] and collaborated with him on his [[Dadaist]] magazine.

In 1919, he brought to Madrid a rough draft of the series of poems that would eventually become his masterpiece, ''[[Altazor]]''. That same year, he took some science classes and became interested in esoteric subjects like [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], ancient [[Kabbalah]] among other forms of [[occultism]].

While in Paris, he worked with [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier]] (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris) at L' Esprit Nóuveau, a magazine directed by [[Paul Dermée]]. There he also worked for the Spanish magazines "Grecia", "Cervantes", "Tableros" and "Ultra".

In the [[El Liberal]], a Spanish newspaper, journalist and literary critic [[Enrique Gómez Carrillo]] published an interview with [[Pierre Reverdy]] where he accuses Huidobro of antedating the edition of "El espejo de agua" and claims that he himself created "creacionismo". Grecia magazine took Huidobro's side, and between August and September Huidobro traveled to Madrid to refute Gómez Carrillo's claims.

===Altazor and creacionismo===

In 1921, Huidobro founded and edited an international art magazine, ''Creación'' (Creation), in Madrid. The magazine featured a [[Jacques Lipchitz|Lipchitz]] sculpture and paintings by [[Georges Braque]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Albert Gleizes]]. In November he printed a second issue in Paris, titled ''Création Revue d'Art''. In December he presented his famous lecture, ''La Poesía'' (''Poetry''), which served as prologue to his works ''Temblor de Cielo'' (''Tremor of Heaven''), and "Saisons Choisies" (Chosen Seasons).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275139/Vicente-Huidobro Vicente Huidobro – Encyclopedia Britannica]</ref>

The next year, Huidobro presented his theory of "Pure Creation" at "Branche Studio" in Paris, and then in Berlin and Stockholm.He wrote for the Polish magazine "Nowa Sztuka". In Paris, his "Painted poems" exhibition at the Théâtre Edouard VII was shut down for being too "disruptive".

In 1923, he published "Finis Britannia", a critique of the British empire, which provoked antipathy from the British and resulted in him receiving a postcard in support from [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. In 1924 he was -arguably- kidnapped for this reason, disappearing for three days. Later in an interview, he briefly commented that the perpetrators of the kidnap were two "Irish scouts" but refused to give more details.<ref>[http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/entrevista6.htm Interview, Paris 1924] "Fueron dos scouts irlandeses... Pero esto es cosa pasada" Alberto Rojas Giménez, 1924</ref>

Huidobro continued with his diverse artistic activities in Europe, producing the third edition of "Création", where he published his "Manifeste peut-être" (Maybe Manifesto). Collaborator in this edition included [[Tristan Tzara]], [[René Crevel]], [[Juan Larrea (poet)|Juan Larrea]] and [[Erik Satie]]. He joined the French [[Masonic Lodge]] and met Spanish philosopher and writer [[Miguel de Unamuno]], who was exiled in Paris at the time.

In 1925 he returned to [[Chile]], where he edited and published "Acción. Diario de Purificación Nacional" (Action: Journal of National Purification) a [[political journalism|political]] newspaper where he criticised the state and reported fraudulent activities. He was consequently assaulted and beaten outside his home and, on 21 November, the newspaper was shut down. He started another newspaper, "La reforma" (Reform), in a symbolic gesture, young supporters of the progressive party declared him as their candidate for president. A bomb was then set off outside his house, though Huidobro escaped unharmed.
While in Chile, he wrote for the publications "Andamios", "Panorama" and "Ariel" and published "Automne Régulier" (Regular Autumn) and "Tout à coup" (Suddenly).

In 1926, he published a fragment of what would become the fourth canto of "[[Altazor]]" in "Panorama".

In 1927, he traveled to New York, where he met [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Gloria Swanson]], wrote a script for a film of his novel "Cagliostro",<ref>[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-92836.html Cagliostro] Memoria Chilena – Algunos derechos reservados – 2014</ref> and wrote the "Canto a Lindbergh" (Song for Lindbergh) dedicated to aviator ([[Charles Lindbergh]]).

He returned to Europe by the late 1920s, where he began to write the novel, ''Mío Cid Campeador''; he also continued his work on ''Altazor'' and began ''Temblor de Cielo'' (Tremor of Heaven). It was at this time that he discovered that he was heir to the [[Marquisate of Casa Real]]. He also participated in the [[Mandrágora]], a Chilean surrealist movement founded in 1938. There was a scandal when he married Ximena Amunátegui in a Muslim ceremony.

In 1930, while in the Italian [[Alps]], he wrote "La Proxima" (The Next),  and published his poem "Chanson de l'oeuf et de l'infini" (Song of the Egg and Infinity) in the magazine "Revue Européenne" and a fragment of "Altazor", in French, in the June edition of "Transition".

In 1931, he went back to Madrid to publish "Altazor", where he attended [[Federico García Lorca]]'s poetry recital "Poet in New York" and started his friendship with Uruguayan painter [[Joaquín Torres García]]. The same year he published "Portrait of a Paladin" and the English versions of his "Mío Cid Campeador", "Temblor de Cielo" and "[[Altazor]]".

==Back to Chile==

Huidobro went back to Chile in 1932, under the pressure of the [[Great Depression]]. In Chile, he published "Gilles de Raíz".

In 1933, he got involved with the Chilean communist party and published his article "Manifiesto a la juventud de Hispanoamérica" (Manifesto to the Youth of Hispano America) in Barcelona's "Europa" magazine, where he proposed the creation of a united republic formed of Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

In 1934 he wrote film reviews for [[Santiago]] magazines and newspapers, and published "La Próxima" (The Next) (Santiago, Walton); "Papá o el diario de Alicia Mir" (Father, or the diary of Alicia Mir) (Santiago, Walton), a novel written as a diary; and the play "En la Luna" (In the Moon) (Santiago, Ercilla). He founded the magazine Vital/Ombligo with Omar Cáceres and [[Eduardo Anguita]].

In 1935 a young [[Volodia Teitelboim]] read a [[Rabindranath Tagore]] poem, similar to Poem 16 of [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda's]] ''[[Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair]]'', Teitelboim mentioned this to Huidobro, and Huidobro accused Neruda of plagiarism. This would initiate a conflict between Neruda and Huidobro that later would involve [[Pablo de Rokha]].

In 1936, along with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], Arp, [[Vasily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], and Robert and [[Sonia Delaunay]] among others, he signed the "[[Fourth dimension in art|Dimensionist Manifesto]]"<ref>[http://www.artpool.hu/TamkoSirato/manifest.html The Dimensionist Manifesto] The Dimensionist Manifesto. Charles Sirato, Paris, 1936</ref>

In 1937, while in Spain supporting the republican cause, the conflict with Neruda resurfaced while Neruda was also supporting the republicans. The Parisian "Association Internationale des Ecrivains pour la Défense de la Culture", sending them a letter which called on them to change their attitude, signed by [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[César Vallejo]] and [[Juan Larrea (poet)|Juan Larrea]], among others.

Once back in Chile, he published the [[prose poem]] "Fuera de aquí" (Out of Here), arguing against Italian [[fascism]] and the Italian military (who were visiting Chile at that time), as well as the poem "Gloria y Sangre" (Glory and Blood) in "Madre España: Homenaje de los poetas chilenos" (Mother Spain: Tribute of the Chilean poets). In 1938 his mother died, and he became part of the creation of the Chilean [[surrealism|surrealist]] group [[La Mandrágora]]. The first meetings of the group took place in his home.

==Last years==

In 1942, Huidobro published the second editions of "Temblor de cielo", "Cagliostro" and "Mio Cid Campeador" in [[Santiago]].

In 1944, he edited and published the first and last edition of "Actual", the final magazine he would create. In November of that year he traveled back to Europe and made a stop in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] to give a lecture on "Introducción a la poesía" (Introduction to Poetry). In 1945 he went to Paris as a correspondent for “La Voz de América". In Paris, he received a letter from his wife Ximena informing him of her wish for a divorce. He entered [[Berlin]] (as a war correspondent) with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He was discharged and went back to Santiago with his third wife, Raquel Señoret.

In 1946 he settled in [[Cartagena, Chile|Cartagena]], a seaside town in central Chile, and published a new edition of "Trois Nouvelles Exemplaires", with text written in collaboration with [[Jean Arp]].

The following year he suffered a stroke attributed to his war wounds, and died on 2 January 1948, in his Cartagena house. According to his wishes, he was buried on a hill facing the sea. His eldest daughter Manuela and [[Eduardo Anguita]] wrote the epitaph: "Aquí yace el poeta Vicente Huidobro / Abrid la tumba / Al fondo de esta tumba se ve el mar". (Here lies the poet Vicente Huidobro / Open the tomb / At the bottom you can see the sea). That same year, Manuela published unedited texts and poems previously seen only in magazines.<ref>[http://hispanicissues.umn.edu/assets/doc/07_Huidobro_Oliphant.pdf "Huidobro and Parra: World-Class Antipoets"] Huidobro and Parra: World-Class Antipoets Dave Oliphant retrieved on February 29, 2015</ref>
