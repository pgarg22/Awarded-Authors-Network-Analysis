'''Halina Poświatowska''' ({{IPA-pl|Pɔɕviatɔvska|lang}}; [[Given name#Name at birth|née]] '''Halina Myga''', entered into church records as '''Helena Myga''';{{efn|by the [[baptism|baptizing]] [[diocese|local diocese]] priest, over the objections of her family}} born 9 May 1935 &ndash; 11 October 1967) was a Polish poet and writer, one of the most important figures in modern/contemporary Polish literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Poświatowska is famous for her lyrical poetry, and for her intellectual, passionate yet unsentimental poetry on the themes of death, love, existence, famous historical personages, especially women, as well as her mordant treatment of life, living, being, bees, cats and the sensual qualities of loving, grieving and desiring.

== Biography ==
[[File:Poswiatowska - fotografia, fot I Nowicka.jpg|thumb|160px|left| Picture of the poet at her museum in Częstochowa, fot. Ivonna Nowicka]]
Her first heart operation was performed in [[Philadelphia]], in 1958, her sea passage on the Polish [[ocean liner]] ''[[MS Batory]]'', the costs of her stay, and the procedure itself, funded by monies gathered in collection by [[Polish-Americans]], and was successful enough to enable her to live for nine more years.  Instead of returning to Poland afterward, she enrolled at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], where she completed her undergraduate studies in 3 years, commencing with no command of the English language whatsoever.  Then, turning down an offer of graduate admission with full financial support, extended to her by the faculty of [[Stanford University]]'s Department of Philosophy, she returned to Poland, where she matriculated in Philosophy at the [[Jagellonian University]], [[Kraków]], and died before continuing on to complete the doctorate, as a 4th year student.

She died at 32 after a second heart operation, this time, performed in Poland, to correct an acquired chronic heart defect that limited her mobility and breathing, which befell her due to chronic chill as a 9-year-old child during the [[World War II]] German occupation of Poland.

Her works have been collected in the four-volume ''Dzieła'' (Works), published by Wydawnictwo Literackie, Kraków, Poland, 1997, of which the first two volumes (several hundred pages) are poems, and the latter two prose and letters, respectively. She is the subject of several scholarly books and many reprints. Her popularity as a poet continues unabated in Poland, and new translations have increased her importance to world literature. If her own poem content, as well as her own poetry translations are any indication, she was influenced by [[Ezra Pound]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Jacques Prévert]], and a bevy of [[Slovene people|Slovene]] poets: [[Kajetan Kovič]], [[Jože Udovič]], [[Saša Vegri]], [[Dane Zajc]], as well as the classical Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]], bees, cats, the color red, the texture of fur, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s antiquity collections, and her contemporary Black American ([[Negro]]) city culture &ndash; in particular, the people of New York City, in [[Harlem]].
