==Biography==
The sole biological daughter of Donald and Claire (née Weill) Lehman, Kathy Acker was born '''Karen Lehman''' in New York City, in 1947,<ref name="kraus">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/cancer-became-my-whole-brain-kathy-acker-final-year|title='Cancer Became My Whole Brain': Kathy Acker's Final Year |first=Chris |last=Kraus |date = August 11, 2017 |work = The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n20/jenny-turner/literary-friction |title=Literary Friction |first=Jenny |last=Turner |date=October 19, 2017 |pages= 9–14 |journal=London Review of Books | volume = 39 | issue = 20}}</ref> although the [[Library of Congress]] gives her birth year as 1948, while The Editors of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] gave her birth year as April 18, 1948, New York, New York, U.S. and died Nov. 30, 1997, Tijuana, Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kathy-Acker|title=Kathy Acker {{!}} American author|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> Most obituaries, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', cited her birth year as 1944.<ref name="nytimesobit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/03/arts/kathy-acker-novelist-and-performance-artist-53.html|title=Kathy Acker, Novelist and Performance Artist, 53|date=December 3, 1997|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 5, 2017}}</ref> Her family was from a wealthy, assimilated, [[History of the Jews in Germany|German-Jewish]] background that was [[Secular Jewish culture|culturally]], but not [[Judaism|religiously]] Jewish. Her paternal grandmother, Florence Weill, was an [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian Jew]] who had inherited a small fortune from her husband's glove-making business.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n20/jenny-turner/literary-friction |title=Literary Friction |publisher=London Review of Books |access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref> Acker's grandparents went into political exile from [[Alsace-Lorraine]] prior to World War I, due to the rising [[German nationalism|nationalism]] of pre-Nazi Germany, moving to Paris and then to the United States. According to Acker, her grandparents were "first generation French-German Jews" whose ancestors originally hailed from the [[Pale of Settlement]]. In an interview with the magazine ''Tattoo Jew'', Acker stated that religious Judaism "means nothing to me. I don't run away from it, it just means nothing to me" and elaborated that her parents were "high-German Jews" who held cultural prejudices against [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-speaking]] Eastern European Jews ("I was trained to run away from Polish Jews.").<ref>{{cite book |last=Stratton |first=Jon |date=2008 |title=Jewish Identity in Western Pop Culture: The Holocaust and Trauma Through Modernity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpfFAAAAQBAJ&q=Jewish+Identity+in+Western+Pop+Culture |location=New York City |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=97 |isbn=978-1349372614 }}</ref>

The pregnancy was unplanned; Donald Lehman abandoned the family before Karen's birth. Her relationship with her domineering mother even into adulthood was fraught with hostility and anxiety because Acker felt unloved and unwanted. Her mother soon remarried, to Albert Alexander, whose surname Kathy was given, although the writer later described her mother's union with Alexander as a passionless marriage to an ineffectual man. Karen (later Kathy) had a half-sister, Wendy, by her mother's second marriage, but the two women were never close and long estranged. By the time of Kathy's death, she had requested that her friends not contact Wendy, as some had suggested.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kraus|first1=Chris|title=After Kathy Acker|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781635900064|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/after-kathy-acker|access-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> Acker was raised in her mother and stepfather's home in the [[York Avenue and Sutton Place|Sutton Place]] neighborhood of Manhattan's prosperous [[Upper East Side]].

In 1966, she married Robert Acker, and took his surname. Robert Acker was the son of lower-middle-class Polish-Jewish immigrants. Kathy's parents had held hopes that their daughter would marry a wealthy man and did not expect the marriage to last long.<ref>{{cite web|title=Littoral Madness|url=https://maydayrooms.org/wp-content/uploads/Acker-2.compressed.pdf|access-date=2020-07-26|publisher=MayDay Rooms}}</ref> Although her birth name was Karen, she was known as Kathy to her friends and family. Her first work appeared in print as part of the burgeoning New York City [[literature|literary]] underground of the mid-1970s.

During the 1970s, Acker often moved back and forth between San Diego, San Francisco, and New York. She married the composer and experimental musician [[Peter Gordon (composer)|Peter Gordon]] shortly before the end of their seven-year relationship.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wynne-Jones|first1=Ros|title=Interview: Kathy Acker: Written on the Body|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-kathy-acker-written-on-the-body-1239024.html|access-date=August 12, 2017|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=September 13, 1997}}</ref> Later, she had relationships with the theorist, publisher, and critic [[Sylvère Lotringer]] and then with the filmmaker and film theorist [[Peter Wollen]].<ref name=":0" />

In 1996, Acker left San Francisco and moved to London to live with the writer and music critic [[Charles Shaar Murray]].<ref name="kraus" />

She married twice. Although most of her relationships were with men, she was openly [[bisexual]]. In 1979, she won the [[Pushcart Prize]] for her short story "New York City in 1979". During the early 1980s, she lived in London, where she wrote several of her most critically acclaimed works. After returning to the United States in the late 1980s, she worked as an adjunct professor at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] for about six years and as a visiting professor at several universities, including the [[University of Idaho]], the [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the [[California Institute of Arts]], and [[Roanoke College]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&q=sfai+acker&pg=PA7|title=Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century|last=Ware|first=Susan|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01488-6|language=en}}</ref>

==Health and death==
In April 1996, Acker was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and she elected to have a double mastectomy. In January 1997, she wrote about her loss of faith in conventional medicine in a ''Guardian'' article, "The Gift of Disease".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outwardfromnothingness.com/the-gift-of-disease-i-el-don-de-la-enfermedad-i|title=The gift of disease|newspaper=The Guardian (original publisher, posted on Outward from Nothingness)|author=Kathy Acker|date=January 18, 1997|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref>

In the article, she explains that after unsuccessful surgery, which left her feeling physically mutilated and emotionally debilitated, she rejected the passivity of the patient in the medical mainstream and began to seek out the advice of nutritionists, acupuncturists, psychic healers, and Chinese herbalists. She found appealing the claim that instead of being an object of knowledge, as in Western medicine, the patient becomes a seer, a seeker of wisdom, that illness becomes the teacher and the patient the student. After pursuing several forms of [[alternative medicine]] in England and the United States, Acker died a year and a half later, on November 30, 1997, aged 50, from complications of cancer in a [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]] alternative cancer clinic, the only alternative-treatment facility that accepted her with her advanced stage of cancer.<ref name="kraus" /> She died in what was called "Room 101", to which her friend [[Alan Moore]] quipped, "There's nothing that woman can't turn into a literary reference". (Room 101, in the climax of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', is the basement torture chamber in which the Party attempts to subject a prisoner to his or her own worst fears.)<ref>{{cite web|last=Crispin|first=Jessa|author-link=Jessa Crispin|title=An interview with Neil Gaiman|url=http://www.bookslut.com/features/2006_10_010057.php|website=bookslut.com|publisher=[[Jessa Crispin|Bookslut]]|date=October 2006|access-date=August 4, 2017}}</ref>

==Education==
At [[Brandeis University]], she engaged in undergraduate coursework in Classics at a time when [[Angela Davis]] was also at the university. She became interested in writing novels, and moved to California to attend [[University of California, San Diego]], where [[David Antin]], [[Eleanor Antin]], and [[Jerome Rothenberg]] were among her teachers. She received her bachelor's degree in 1968. After moving to New York, she attended two years of graduate school at the [[City University of New York]] in [[Classics]], specializing in Greek. She did not earn a graduate degree. During her time in New York, she was employed as a file clerk, secretary, stripper, and porn performer.<ref name="NYU Fales Library"/>

==Literary overview==
Acker was associated with the New York [[punk subculture|punk]] movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The punk aesthetic influenced her literary style.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kraus|first1=Chris|title=After Kathy Acker|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781635900064|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/after-kathy-acker|access-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref>

In the 1970s, before the term "postmodernism" was popular, Acker began writing her books. These books contain features that would eventually be considered postmodernist work.<ref>McCaffery, Larry, and Kathy Acker. "An Interview with Kathy Acker", ''Mississippi Review'', vol. 20, no. 1/2, 1991, pp. 83–97, jstor.org/stable/20134512.</ref> Her controversial body of work borrows heavily from the experimental styles of [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Marguerite Duras]]. Her writing strategies at times used forms of [[pastiche]] and deployed Burroughs's [[cut-up technique]], involving cutting-up and scrambling passages and sentences into a somewhat random remix. Acker defined her writing as existing post-[[nouveau roman]] European tradition.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|last1=Kraus|first1=Chris|title=After Kathy Acker|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781635900064|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/after-kathy-acker|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

In her texts, she combines biographical elements, power, sex and violence. Indeed, critics often compare her writing to that of [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[Jean Genet]]. Critics have noticed links to [[Gertrude Stein]] and photographers [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Sherrie Levine]]. Acker's novels also exhibit a fascination with and an indebtedness to tattoos.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Brief in English: Kathy Acker in Helsinki|url=http://ylioppilaslehti.fi/1996/10/brief-in-english-56|work=[[Ylioppilaslehti]] (student magazine)|publisher=[[University of Helsinki]]|location=Helsinki, Finland|date=October 1996}}</ref> She dedicated ''Empire of the Senseless'' to her tattooist.

Acker published her first book, ''Politics'', in 1972. Although the collection of poems and essays did not garner much critical or public attention, it did establish her reputation within the New York punk scene. In 1973, she published her first novel (under the pseudonym '''Black Tarantula'''), ''The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula: Some Lives of Murderesses''. The following year, she published her second novel, ''I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac: Imagining''. Both works are reprinted in ''Portrait of an Eye''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Acker|first1=Kathy|title=Portrait of an Eye: Three Novels|date=1997|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=0802135439|url=https://archive.org/details/portraitofeyethr00acke|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

In 1979, she received popular attention after winning a [[Pushcart Prize]] for her short story "New York City in 1979". She did not receive critical attention, however, until publishing ''Great Expectations'' in 1982. The opening of ''Great Expectations'' is an obvious re-writing of [[Great Expectations|Charles Dickens's work of the same name]]. It features her usual subject matter, including a semi-autobiographical account of her mother's suicide and the appropriation of several other texts, including [[Pierre Guyotat]]'s violent and sexually explicit "Eden Eden Eden". That same year, Acker published a [[chapbook]], entitled ''Hello, I'm [[Erica Jong]]''.<ref name="auto"/> She appropriated from a number of influential writers. These writers include Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, John Keats, William Faulkner, T.S Eliot, the Brontë sisters, the Marquis de Sade, Georges Bataille, and Arthur Rimbaud.<ref>Hawkins, Susan E. "All in the Family: Kathy Acker's 'Blood and Guts in High School.'" Contemporary Literature, vol. 45, no. 4, 2004, pp. 637–58, jstor.org/stable/3593544</ref>

Acker wrote the script for the 1983 film ''[[Variety (1983 film)|Variety]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Jack|title=Haunted Cinema: Movie Theatres of the Dead|journal=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]|volume=70|date=October 31, 2010|url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/70/70stevenson.php|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119041932/http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/70/70stevenson.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> Acker wrote a text on the photographer [[Marcus Leatherdale]] that was published in 1983, in an art catalogue for the Molotov Gallery in [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Acker|first1=Kathy|last2=Leatherdale|first2=Marcus|author-link2= Marcus Leatherdale|title=Marcus Leatherdale: His photographs – a book in a series on people and years|publisher=Molotov|location=Vienna, Austria|year=1983|oclc=719286533|isbn=9783950370317}}</ref>

In 1984, Acker's first British publication, the novel ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'' was published soon after its publication by [[Grove Press]] in New York.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Chris|title=Kathy Acker's Blood And Guts in High School|journal=The Paris Review|date=November 9, 2017|ref=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/09/kathy-ackers-blood-guts-high-school}}</ref>

That same year, she was signed by Grove Press, one of the legendary independent publishers committed to controversial and avant-garde writing; she was one of the last writers taken on by [[Barney Rosset]] before the end of his tenure there. Most of her work was published by them, including re-issues of important earlier work. She wrote for several magazines and [[anthology|anthologies]], including the periodicals ''[[RE/Search]]'', ''[[Angel Exhaust]]'', ''[[monochrom]]'' and ''Rapid Eye''. As she neared the end of her life, her work was more well-received by the conventional press; for example, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published a number of her essays, interviews, and articles, among them was an interview with the [[Spice Girls]].<ref name="NYU Fales Library"/>

''In Memoriam to Identity'' draws attention to popular analyses of [[Rimbaud]]'s life and ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'', constructing or revealing social and literary identity. Although known in the [[literary]] world for creating a whole new style of [[Écriture féminine|feminist prose]] and for her [[Transgressional fiction|transgressive fiction]], she was also a [[punk ideology|punk]] and feminist icon for her devoted portrayals of [[subculture]]s, strong-willed women, and violence.<ref name="auto"/>

Notwithstanding the increased recognition she got for ''Great Expectations'', ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'' is often considered Acker's breakthrough work. Published in 1984, it is one of her most extreme explorations of sexuality and violence. Borrowing from, among other texts, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', ''Blood and Guts'' details the experiences of Janey Smith, a sex-addicted and [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]-ridden urbanite who is in love with a father who sells her into slavery. Many critics criticized it for being demeaning toward women, and Germany banned it completely. Acker published the German court judgment against ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'' in ''[https://www.amazon.com/Hannibal-Lecter-Father-Native-Agents/dp/0936756683 Hannibal Lecter, My Father]''.

Acker published ''Empire of the Senseless'' in 1988, and considered it a turning point in her writing. While she still borrows from other texts, including [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the appropriation is less obvious. However, one of Acker's more controversial appropriations is from [[William Gibson]]'s 1984 text, ''[[Neuromancer]]'', in which Acker equates code with the female body and its militaristic implications. In 1988, she published ''Literal Madness: Three Novels'', which included three previously-published works: ''Florida'' deconstructs and reduces [[John Huston]]'s 1948 [[film noir]] ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' into its base sexual politics, ''Kathy Goes to Haiti'' details a young woman's relationship and sexual exploits while on vacation, and ''My Death My Life by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'' provides a fictional ''autobiography'' of the Italian filmmaker in which he solves his own murder.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Between 1990 and 1993, she published four more books: ''In Memoriam to Identity'' (1990); ''Hannibal Lecter, My Father'' (1991); ''Portrait of an Eye: Three Novels'' (1992), also composed of already-published works; and ''My Mother: Demonology'' (1992). Her last novel, ''Pussy, King of the Pirates'', was published in 1996,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8021-1578-2|title=Fiction Book Review: Pussy, King of the Pirates|website=www.publishersweekly.com|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> which she, [[Rico Bell]], and the rest of rock band [[Mekons|the Mekons]] also reworked into an operetta, which they performed at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]], in 1997.<ref>{{cite news| date=September 18, 1997| title=Pussy, King of the Pirates| author=Helbig, Jack| newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]]| url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/pussy-king-of-the-pirates/Content?oid=894417| access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>
