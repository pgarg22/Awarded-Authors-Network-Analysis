== Literary career ==
Her poetry was "discovered" in 1976, when at the age of 40 she sent a small collection of her poems to poet [[Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna|Affonso Romano de Sant’Anna]].  De Sant'Anna passed her work on to the Brazilian modernist poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], who read it and proclaimed in his weekly newspaper column<ref name=":0" /> that St. Francis was dictating lines to a housewife in Minas Gerais.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-mystical-rose-271|title=The Mystical Rose {{!}} Bloodaxe Books|website=www.bloodaxebooks.com|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> Her work is a seeming paradox of a deep and spiritual Catholicism combined with the physical and the carnal.  She herself has tried to resolve this contradiction, writing that "It's the soul that's erotic."<ref name=":0" />  She is especially focused on the everyday concerns of women.<ref name=":3" />  Adélia has published eight volumes of poetry and seven volumes of prose, starting with her first poetry collection ''Bagagem'' (Baggage).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />  In describing her work, [[Robert Hass]] said "Brazil has produced what might seem impossible: a really sexy, mystical, Catholic poet."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.recoveringwords.com/site/happy-surprise-recovering-words-favorite-honoured-at-2014-griffin-poetry-awards|title=Happy Surprise!
