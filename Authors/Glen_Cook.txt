Cook wrote ''[[The Black Company (novel)|The Black Company]]'', a novel published by [[Tor Books|Tor Fantasy]] in May 1984. It began a gritty fantasy series of the same name (or Chronicles of the Black Company)<ref name=isfdb/> following an elite mercenary unit through several decades of its history. As of 2016, it comprises the novels published in three subseries 1984–85, 1989–90, and 1996–2000, plus recent short fiction.<ref name=isfdb/> It has become something of a cult classic, especially among current and former members of the military. When asked about the series' popularity among soldiers, Cook replied:  "The characters act like the guys actually behave. It doesn't glorify war; it's just people getting on with the job. The characters are real soldiers. They're not soldiers as imagined by people who've never been in the service. That's why service guys like it."<ref name="SH">{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2005/20050117/cook-int-a.shtml|title=Strange Horizons Interview|access-date=June 20, 2006 }}</ref>   Cook is also known for his [[Garrett P.I.]] series, which tells the haphazard adventures of [[hardboiled]] [[detective]] Garrett, and his [[Dread Empire]] series.
