Dunning began his career at age 12 as an extra and a carnival magician, and enlisted in the Navy during World War I. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] having made up his mind to visit Europe, Dunning was assigned to the [[SS George Washington|SS ''George Washington'']] to keep the President's party and the officers and crew in a happy frame of mind. One of his shipboard hits was a farce called ''Uncle Tom's Stateroom''. The President enjoyed it and wrote his appreciation and signature on his program as a memento for Dunning. One of the acts, ''Every Sailor'', ran for 65 consecutive weeks in vaudeville after the war.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
