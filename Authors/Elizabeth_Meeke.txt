'''Elizabeth Meeke''' (13 November 1761 – c. October 1826) was a prolific English author, translator and children's writer, and the stepsister of [[Frances Burney]]. She wrote about 30 novels, published by the [[Minerva Press]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Identity==
The novels appeared mainly under the name '''Mrs. Meeke''', sometimes under the pseudonym '''Gabrielli''', and a few anonymously. Their author was formerly assumed to be Mary Meeke, the wife of a Staffordshire vicar. However, "Mrs. Meeke" was conclusively identified as Elizabeth Meeke in an article by Simon Macdonald in 2013.<ref>Anthony Mandal, "Mrs. Meeke and Minerva: The Mystery of the Marketplace". In ''Eighteenth-Century Life'' Vol. 42, No. 2, April 2018, pp. 131–151.</ref> She is believed to have died in about October 1826.<ref>{{Cite ODNB |first=Simon |last=Macdonald |title=Meeke, Elizabeth (1761–1826?) |year=2013 |edition=Online |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18509 |accessdate=12 March 2015 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18509}}</ref>

==Novels==
Meeke's debut novel was ''Count St Blanchard'' in 1795. Others include ''The Abbey of Clugny'', ''The Mysterious Wife'', ''Anecdotes of the Altamont Family'' and ''Which is the Man?'' Her works include several translations from French, such as ''Elizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia''.

The third edition of Chamber's ''Cyclopaedia of English Literature'' in 1903 disparaged her work: {{quote|The novels are worthless and would be quite forgotten but for the mention of them in the ''Life of Macaulay'', who in his younger days at least "all but knew them by heart". According to Macaulay's sister the most of them turn on the fortunes of some young man in a very low rank of life who ultimately proves to be the son of a duke.<ref>Chambers, ''Cyclopaedia of English Literature'', 1903, Vol. 3, p. 178.</ref>}}
