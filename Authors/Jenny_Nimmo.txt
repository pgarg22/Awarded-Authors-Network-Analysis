'''Jenny Nimmo''' (born 15 January 1944)<ref name=weeweb/><ref name=notable/><!-- see TALK --> is a British author of children's books, including fantasy and adventure novels, [[chapter books]], and picture books. Born in England, she has lived mostly in Wales for 40 years.

''The Snow Spider'', first of the Magician books, won the second annual [[Nestlé Smarties Book Prize]]{{efn |name=smarties}} and the 1987 [[Tir na n-Og Award]] as the year's best originally English-language book with an authentic Welsh background. ''The Stone Mouse'' was highly commended for the 1993 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]].<ref name=ccsu/>{{efn |name=HC}} Several others of hers have been shortlisted for children's book awards.

For two years there was a single Nestlé Prize for children's books. Three age categories were introduced for 1987 publications and retained as long as the prize continued. Nimmo and ''The Owl Tree'' won the 1997 prize in category 6 to 8 years, the middle age group also called "younger readers". By that time there was no overall prize.
