==Life==
[[File:Suwałki ul. Kościuszki 31 (14).JPG|thumb|left|Birthplace and childhood home of Maria Konopnicka in [[Suwałki]], currently a museum]]
Konopnicka was born in [[Suwałki]] on 23 May 1842.<ref name="Sokol1992"/> Her father, Józef Wasiłowski, was a lawyer.<ref name="Sokol1992"/> She was  home-schooled and spent a year (1855–56) at a convent ''pension'' of the Sisters of Eucharistic Adoration in Warsaw (''Zespół klasztorny sakramentek w Warszawie'').<ref name="Bogusławska1961"/>
[[File:Maria Dulębianka - Maria Konopnicka 1902.jpg|thumb|135px|Konopnicka, by [[Maria Dulębianka]], 1902]]
She made her debut as a writer in 1870 with the poem, ''"W zimowy poranek"'' ("On a Winter's Morn").<ref name=gdedu/> She gained popularity after the 1876 publication of her poem, ''"W górach"'' ("In the Mountains"), which was praised by future [[Noble Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]].<ref name=gdedu/><ref name="AKlos-112"/>
In 1862 she married Jarosław Konopnicki.<ref name="Sokol1992"/><ref name="AKlos-112"/> They had six children.<ref name="Sokol1992"/><ref name="Szypowska1990"/> The marriage was not a happy one,<ref name="Konopnicka"/> as her husband disapproved of her writing career.<ref name="AKlos-112"/> In a letter to a friend, she described herself as "having no family" and as being "a bird locked in a cage".<ref name="Konopnicka"/> Eventually in 1878, in an unofficial separation, she left her husband and moved to Warsaw to pursue writing.<ref name="Sokol1992"/><ref name="Konopnicka"/> She took her children with her.<ref name="Baculewski1978"/> She would often travel in Europe; her first major trip was to Italy in 1883.<ref name=gdedu/> She spent the years 1890–1903 living abroad in Europe.<ref name="gdedu"/><ref name=histmuz/>

Her life has been described as "turbulent", including extramarital romances, deaths, and mental illnesses in the family.<ref name="AKlos-112"/> She was a friend of a Polish woman poet of the [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist period]], [[Eliza Orzeszkowa]],<ref name="Stauter-Halsted2004"/> and of the painter and activist [[Maria Dulębianka]] (with whom she lived in a possibly romantic relationship).<ref name="ErsoyGorny2010"/> It has been speculated that she was bisexual or a [[lesbian]] (particularly in relation to Dulębianka<ref name="AKlos-112"/><ref name="Czas kultury"/>), though this has not been properly researched, and the question is not usually mentioned in biographies of Konopnicka. Konopnicka’s wish was to be buried together with Dulębianka. Both woman have been laid to rest together at a cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine.   <ref name="SzyszkowskaGrzela2001"/><ref name="Wielcy i niezapomniani: Maria Konopnicka - Artykuły"/><ref name="Chińcz2006"/><ref name="Wencel gordyjski - Homo wiadomo - WPROST"/>
[[File:Dworek muzeum Mari Konopnickiej.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Konopnicka's country home, now a museum, in [[Żarnowiec, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Żarnowiec]]]]
In addition to being an active writer, she was also a social activist, organizing and participating in protests against the repression of ethnic (primarily Polish) and religious minorities in [[Prussia]].<ref name=gdedu/> She was also involved in [[women's rights|women's-rights]] activism.<ref name="PaletschekPietrow-Ennker2004"/>

Her literary work in the 1880s gained wide recognition in Poland.<ref name=gdedu/> In 1884 she began writing [[children's literature]], and in 1888 she debuted as an adult-prose writer with ''Cztery nowele'' (Four Short Stories).<ref name=gdedu/> Due to the growing popularity of her writings, in 1902 a number of Polish activists decided to reward her by buying her a [[dwór (architecture)|manor house]].<ref name=histmuz/> It was purchased with funds collected by a number of organizations and activists.<ref name=histmuz/> As Poland was not an independent country at the time, and as her writings were politically uncongenial to the Prussian and Russian authorities, a location was chosen in the more tolerant [[Austrian partition]] of pre-[[Partitions of Poland|Partition]] Poland.<ref name=histmuz/> In 1903 she received a manor in [[Żarnowiec, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Żarnowiec]], where she arrived on 8 September.<ref name=histmuz/><ref name="Jakubowska2012"/> She would spend most springs and summers there, but she would still travel about Europe in fall and winter.<ref name=gdedu/><ref name=histmuz/>
[[File:Maria Konopnicka - Lwów Cmentarz Łyczakowski - widok z lewej strony.JPG|thumb|220px|Konopnicka's grave in [[Lviv]]]]
She died in [[Lwów]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]) on 8 October 1910.<ref name=histmuz/> She was buried there in the [[Łyczakowski Cemetery]].As per her wish Dulębianka was laid to rest next to her. <ref name="Sokol1992"/><ref name="plBGKonopnicka"/>

== Work ==
[[File:Portret Marii Konopnickiej.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Konopnicka, by [[Maria Dulębianka]], 1910]]
Konopnicka wrote prose (primarily short stories) as well as poems.<ref name="CushmanCavanagh2012"/> One of her most characteristic styles were poems stylized as [[folk song]]s.<ref name=gdedu/> She would try her hand at many genres of literature, such as reportage sketches, narrative memoirs, psychological portrait studies and others.<ref name=gdedu/>

A common theme in her works was the oppression and poverty of the peasantry, workers, and [[Polish Jews]].<ref name="Frucht2005"/><ref name="Sokol1992"/> Her works were also highly patriotic and nationalistic.<ref name="Zuckerman1993"/><ref name="Biskupski2000"/><ref name="AKlos-113"/> Due to her sympathy for Jewish people, she was considered a [[philosemite]].<ref name="Zuckerman1993"/>

One of her best known works is the long epic in six [[canto]]s, ''Mister Balcer in Brazil'' (''Pan Balcer w Brazylii'', 1910), on the [[Polish Brazilians|Polish emigrants in Brazil]].<ref name="Sokol1992"/><ref name=gdedu/>  Another one was ''[[Rota (poem)|Rota]]'' (''Oath'', 1908) which set to the music by Feliks Nowowiejski two years later became an unofficial [[anthem]] of Poland, particularly in the territories of the [[Prussian Partition]].<ref name="Jakubowska2012"/><ref name="Prizel1998"/> This patriotic poem was strongly critical of the [[Germanization]] policies and thus described as [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]].<ref name="Kamusella2007"/>

Her most famous [[children's literature]] work is the 1896 ''O krasonoludkach i sierotce Marysi'' (''Little Orphan Mary and the Gnomes'').<ref name="AKlos-113"/> Her children literature works were well received, as compared to many other works of the period.<ref name=gdedu/>

Maria Konopnicka also composed a poem about the execution of the Irish patriot, [[Robert Emmet]].  Emmet was executed by the British authorities in [[Dublin]] in 1803, but Konopnicka published her poem on the topic in 1908.<ref name="Maria Konopnicka agus Robert Emmet"/>

She was also a translator. Her translated works include [[Ada Negri]]'s ''Fatalita'' and ''Tempeste'', published in Poland in 1901.<ref name="AKlos-110"/>
