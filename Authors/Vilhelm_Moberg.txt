'''Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg''' (20 August 1898 &ndash; 8 August 1973) was a Swedish [[journalist]], author, [[playwright]], [[historian]], and debater. His literary career, spanning more than 45 years, is associated with his series [[The Emigrants (novels)|''The Emigrants'']]. The four books, published between 1949 and 1959, deal with the [[Swedish emigration to the United States]] in the 19th century, and are the subject of two movie adaptations and a musical. Among other works are ''[[Raskens]]'' (1927) and ''[[Ride This Night (novel)|Ride This Night]]'' (1941), a historical novel of a 17th-century rebellion in [[Småland]] acknowledged for its subliminal but widely recognised criticism of the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]].

A noted public intellectual and debater in Sweden, he was noted for his vocal criticism of the [[Swedish monarchy]] (most notably after the [[Haijby affair]]), describing it as a servile government by [[divine mandate]], and publicly supporting its replacement with a Swiss-style [[confederal]] [[republic]]. He spoke out aggressively against the policies of [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Greek military junta]], and the [[Soviet Union]], and his works were among those destroyed in [[Nazi book burnings]]. In 1971, he scolded Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] for refusing to present the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] to its recipient [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] – who was refused permission to attend the ceremony in Stockholm – through the Swedish embassy in [[Moscow]].

Moberg's suicide by self-inflicted drowning also drew much attention. He had had a long struggle with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[writer's block]].

==Early life==
Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg was born in 1898 on a farm outside of the town [[Emmaboda]] in the Parish of [[Algutsboda, Sweden|Algutsboda]] in [[Småland]], in southern Sweden. He was the fourth child of six, of whom only three survived into adulthood. His forebears were soldiers and small farmers. He lived the first nine years of his life at the tenement soldier's cottage in Moshultamåla that his father Karl Moberg, a territorial soldier, took over in 1888. In 1907 the family moved to a small farm in the village of Moshultamåla. This had been the family home of his mother Ida Moberg; they had lost it due to poverty. Money from her family in America enabled them to buy the property back.  Moberg had only limited schooling from 1906 until 1912.  However, as a child he was an avid reader; he published his first writing at the age of 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vilhelmmoberg.com/english.html |title=Vilhelm Moberg - The Greatest Swedish Author |author=A.A |work=vilhelmmoberg.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207064136/http://www.vilhelmmoberg.com/english.html |archivedate=December 7, 2007 }}</ref>

Moberg worked as a farmer and forest laborer, and later at [[glassblowing]] before and between his various studies.  In 1916 he nearly emigrated to the United States, following his uncle and aunt, but ultimately decided to remain in Sweden with his parents. Largely self-educated, Moberg studied at [[Kronoberg]] County Folk High School in [[Grimslöv]] from 1916 to 1917, and at Katrineholms Praktiska Skola, a private school in [[Katrineholm]], from 1917 to 1918.  Moberg contracted the [[Spanish flu]] in 1918, and was sick for half a year. After his illness, Moberg took a position on the newspaper ''Vadstena Läns Tidning'' in [[Östergötland]] which published many of his stories between 1919 and 1929.

In 1926, Moberg made his breakthrough as a playwright when his comedy ''Kassabrist'' had a successful run in Stockholm. He published his first novel ''Raskens'' the following year. Moberg became a full-time writer when the success of ''Raskens'' enabled him to devote himself entirely to writing.

==Author==
[[File:LA2-vx06-vilhelmmoberg.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bust near the [[Swedish Emigrant Institute]], [[Växjö]]]]
Many of his works have been translated into English, and he is well-recognized in the English-speaking world among those interested in [[Scandinavia]]n culture and history. In his autobiographical novel, ''A Soldier with a Broken Rifle'' (Swedish: ''Soldat med brutet gevär''), he speaks to the importance of giving voice to the downtrodden, illiterate classes of his forebears. This viewpoint also formed his ''History of the Swedish People, I-II'' (Swedish: ''Min svenska historia, berättad för folket'', I-II), published in 1970–71 in both Swedish and English. He had intended the history to have more volumes, but he never finished it.

As a playwright, Moberg wrote 38 works for the stage or for radio (1919-1973). Some were produced as lighter classics of the Swedish stage and television, or were adapted as feature films by directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid%3D672037B6-F0AA-48D9-A9EC-7D53DEAD8786 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106073039/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=672037B6-F0AA-48D9-A9EC-7D53DEAD8786 |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref> (''Lea och Rakel''/''Leah and Rachel''; [[Malmö City Theatre]] 1955) and [[Alf Sjöberg]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053781/|title=Domaren (1960)|date=14 October 1960|work=IMDb}}</ref> (''Domaren''/''The Judge''; 1960).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595002/|title=Vilhelm Moberg|work=IMDb}}</ref>

==Social themes==
Moberg had become a member of a young [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]] club in 1913. In his works, he often expressed a republican (anti-royalist) point of view, much due to the facts that surfaced in the [[Kejne affair]] and [[Haijby affair]], in which Moberg took an active part.

From the 1950s, Moberg participated in debates about the [[Swedish monarchy]], bureaucracy, and corruption, and devoted much time to help individual citizens who had suffered injustice. Much like others of his generation of Swedish authors from a working-class background, such as [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]], [[Harry Martinson]] and [[Moa Martinson]], Moberg depicted the life of the dispossessed, their traditions, customs, and everyday struggle. His novels are important documents of social history, and trace the influences of various social and political movements in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/vmoberg.htm |title=Vilhelm Moberg |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706154417/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/vmoberg.htm |archivedate=6 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==''The Emigrants'' series==
[[File:Grav Vilhelms Mobergs.jpg|right|thumb|80px|Grave at Norra
 in Stockholm]]
Moberg's most famous work is [[The Emigrants (novels)|''The Emigrants'' series of four novels]], written between 1949 and 1959, that describe one Swedish family's emigration from [[Småland]] to [[Chisago County, Minnesota]] in the mid-19th century. This was a destiny shared by almost one million Swedish people, including several of the author's relatives.  These novels have been translated into English: ''[[The Emigrants (Swedish novel)|The Emigrants]]'' (1951), ''[[Unto a Good Land]]'' (1954), ''[[The Settlers (novel)|The Settlers]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Last Letter Home]]'' (1961). His literary portrayal of the [[Swedish-American]] immigrant experience is considered comparable to [[O.E. Rolvaag]]'s work depicting that  of [[Norwegian-American]] immigrants.

===Films and musical===
Swedish [[film director]] [[Jan Troell]] 1971-72 turned the books into two major feature films, ''[[The Emigrants (film)|The Emigrants]]'' and ''[[The New Land]]'', starring [[Max von Sydow]] and [[Liv Ullmann]] as Karl Oskar and Kristina. These were nominated for several [[Academy Award]]s and ''The New Land'' won [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

The [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (English title ''Kristina'') (1995) by ex-[[ABBA]] members [[Björn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]] is based on Moberg's ''The Emigrants Series''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=56|title=Jim Colyer|work=jimcolyer.com}}</ref>

Even several of the other works by Moberg have been turned into films and TV series in Sweden over the years.

==Moberg Room==
Moberg donated his papers to the [[Swedish Emigrant Institute]] in [[Växjö, Sweden]], It displays his original manuscripts, excerpts, notes, and photographs in The Moberg Room, in such a way that visitors get a feeling of meeting Vilhelm Moberg in his workshop.  This unique collection of Moberg memorabilia includes Axel Olsson's sculpture entitled ''The Emigrants'', which portrays the main characters featured in ''The Emigrants Series''. The Vilhelm Moberg Society, headquartered in the Swedish Emigrant Institute, promotes publications, research and popular interest in Moberg's works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utvandrarnashus.se/eng/|title=Swedish Emigrant Institute|work=utvandrarnashus.se|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006130904/http://www.utvandrarnashus.se/eng/|archivedate=2013-10-06}}</ref>

==Later life==
Moberg struggled with severe depression in the last years of his life. He committed [[suicide]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Hochman|first=Stanley|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama|url=https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillencycl05hoch|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 June 2009|edition=2|year=1984|publisher= McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-079169-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillencycl05hoch/page/397 397]}}</ref> by drowning himself in a lake outside his house. He left a note to his wife saying: "The time is twenty past seven; I go to seek in the lake the eternal sleep. Forgive me, I could not endure." Moberg was buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

<blockquote>Klockan är tjugo över sju. Jag går att söka i sjön, sömnen utan slut. Förlåt mig, jag orkade inte uthärda.</blockquote>
