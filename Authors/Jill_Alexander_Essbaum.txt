M.|last=Palmer|date=7 January 2010|website=Strongverse.nlogspot.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref> She currently teaches at the [[University of California, Riverside#Palm Desert Graduate Center|University of California Riverside Palm Desert Graduate Center]] in the Masters of Creative Writing Graduate Program.  Essbaum's [[debut novel]] ''Hausfrau'' (Random House) was published in March, 2015.

==Critical response==
[[Publishers Weekly]] notes, of Hausfrau:<blockquote>"The realism of Anna’s dilemmas and the precise construction of the novel are marvels of the form, and Essbaum chooses her words carefully."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fiction Book Review: Hausfrau by Jill Alexander Essbaum|url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8129-9753-8|website = PublishersWeekly.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}</ref></blockquote>[[Agha Shahid Ali]] wrote:

"Only the best writers put us right at the site of myth and thus assert, for us, our right to be part of the beginning and end of any world, any heaven.  That Jill Alexander Essbaum does it so quietly, so delicately, and puts herself, and us, at the center of Heaven itself leads me only to envy.  For how else can one convincingly transcend the domestic?  There is simply no self-congratulation in these poems.  Just a graceful, magical way of taking oneself - and one's bare uncertainties - for granted.<ref name="dartmouth.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~upne/bllist.html|title=University Press of New England - Bread Loaf Poetry|website=Dartmouth.edu|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>

Of Essbaum's work in general, the critic G.M. Palmer, on his literary blog ''Strong Verse'',<ref name="strongverse.blogspot.com"/> writes,
<blockquote>
Dancing on the edge of her words one finds despair and salvation, often in the same word. She echoes Donne and Plath and riffs on Eliot but has the precise benefit of being alive and full of our time.<ref name="strongverse.blogspot.com"/>
</blockquote>
