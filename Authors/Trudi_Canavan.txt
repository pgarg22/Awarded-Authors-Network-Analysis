==Biography==
Canavan was born in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], in [[Melbourne]], Australia and grew up in the suburb of [[Ferntree Gully]]. From early in her childhood she was creative and interested in art, writing and music. After deciding to become a professional artist she completed an Advanced Certificate in Promotional Display at the [[RMIT TAFE School of Design|Melbourne College of Decoration]], where she received an award for Highest Aggregate Mark in Art Subjects in 1988.<ref name="abouttrudi">[http://www.trudicanavan.com/abouttrudi.php Trudi Canavan: About Trudi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506160659/http://www.trudicanavan.com/abouttrudi.php |date=6 May 2007 }}</ref>

In 1995 Canavan started ''The Telltale Art'', a freelance business specialising on graphical design services. In that same year she began working for ''[[Aurealis]]'', a magazine of Australian Fantasy and Science Fiction, working a do-it-all job as art and cover editor, reading manuscripts, creating web pages and stuffing envelopes. By taking on this job she was able to start writing in her spare time. Canavan states that until the age of 25 she dreamed of writing a novel but lacked the focus to do so.  When she turned 25 she took several writing courses, worked on refining her fiction writing skills, while she fought her way through several rejections.<ref name="aboutwriting">[http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutwriting.php Trudi Canavan: About Writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509091511/http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutwriting.php |date=9 May 2007 }}</ref>

In 1999, Canavan's writing career took off when she won the [[Aurealis Award]] for Best Fantasy Short Story with ''[[Whispers of the Mist Children]]''.<ref name="abouttrudi"/> In 2001, she further established herself with ''[[The Magicians' Guild]]'', centring on Sonea, a slum child who is hunted for her rogue magic. The novel, which was the first of three books of ''[[The Black Magician (novel series)|The Black Magician Trilogy]]'', brought her widespread acclaim, and the second book of the trilogy, ''[[The Novice (novel)|The Novice]]'' (2002), was nominated for the Aurealis Award for Best Fantasy Novel. The third book, ''[[The High Lord]]'', was released in January 2003 and was nominated for the Best Novel Ditmar category. All three books entered Australian top ten SF best-seller lists. The trilogy is now rated by [[Nielsen BookScan]] as the most successful debut fantasy series of the last 10 years, and in 2006 had sold over 275,000 copies in all editions.<ref name="abouttrudi"/> The trilogy has been translated into German, Dutch, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Czech, Danish, Spanish and French.<ref name="lang">[http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutbooks.php?pg=books2 Trudi Canavan: About Trudi's Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101131753/http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutbooks.php?pg=books2 |date=1 January 2007 }}</ref>

Canavan's second trilogy, ''[[Age of the Five]]'', was also well received by her readers. The first in the series, ''[[Priestess of the White]]'' reached No.3 in the Sunday Times hardback fiction best-seller list, staying in the top ten for 6 weeks. In early 2006, Canavan signed a seven-figure contract with Orbit to write the prequel and sequel to The Black Magician Trilogy.  This book, ''[[The Magician's Apprentice]]'', was released in February 2009.<ref name="abouttrudi"/>

Canavan's third trilogy, ''[[The Traitor Spy (novel series)|The Traitor Spy trilogy]]'', is a sequel to the Black Magician Trilogy. The first book, ''[[The Ambassador's Mission]]'', was published on 6 May 2010.  The trilogy was completed in 2012.

===On writing===
Canavan states that "the best way to improve your writing is to write. A lot."<ref name="aboutwriting"/> In the "FAQ" section of her web page, she says that she does not specifically base her characters on herself or anybody else in real life. Asked about her habit of inventing new names for staples of real-world life (e.g. "bol" for spirits, "ceryni" for rat), she explains that the animals that inhabit her world are not the same as those of ours, but are bound to be similar when filling the same ecological niches as real world animals.<ref name="faq">[http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutwriting.php?pg=gen1 Trudi Canavan: About Writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101055607/http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutwriting.php?pg=gen1 |date=1 November 2007 }}</ref>
In contrast to other fantasy/science fiction authors, Canavan is also appreciative of [[fan fiction]].<ref name="fan-fiction">[http://www.trudicanavan.com/about-writing/fan-fiction/ Trudi Canavan: Fan Fiction]</ref>
