'''Mina Assadi''' ({{lang-fa|مینا اسدی}}; born March 12, 1943) is an Iranian-born [[poet]], [[author]], [[journalist]] and [[songwriter]] who lives in exile in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

==Author==
She is known for writing about controversial and provocative subjects, especially when she describes the fight against the Iranian government. In 2007 she wrote the poem called "[[Pimps]]" (Djakesha). It caused a lot of discussion for being too vulgar. The poem is about those who live in Iran and in exile who have forgot the struggle. She wrote her debut book, a collection of poems named "[[Minas Gift]]" (Armanghane Mina), at the age of 18. Thereafter she worked as a journalist for several well-known Iranian magazines, for example [[Kayhan]]. She has written 14 books in total, the book "[[Who throws rocks]]" (Che kasi sang miandazad) attracting most attention.

==Songwriter==
Assadi has also written songs for Iranian singers like [[Ebi]] ("Halah"), [[Dariush]] ("Zendegi jek basie" and "Ahay javoon"), [[Hayedeh]] ("Onkeh jek rosi barajeh man khoda bod"), [[Giti]] ("Oje parvaz"), [[Ramesh]] ("To aftabi, to baroni") and Nooshafarin ("Koh he ghavei") and [[Afshin]] ("delam az ru nemire) to name a few. She has been compared to Persian poets [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Simin Behbahani]] (who also is a Hellman/Hammet Grant winner) and [[Parvin E'tesami]] and Swedish poets [[Karl Vennberg]] and [[Edith Södergran]].

==Awards==
In the year of 1996, she won the [[Hellman/Hammett Grant]] from the [[Human Rights Watch]] of [[New York City]], U.S.
