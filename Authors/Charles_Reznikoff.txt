'''Charles Reznikoff''' (August 31, 1894 – January 22, 1976) was an American poet best known for his long work, ''Testimony: The United States (1885–1915), Recitative'' (1934–1979). The term [[Objectivist poets|Objectivist]] was coined for him.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} The multi-volume ''Testimony'' was based on court records and explored the experiences of immigrants, black people and the urban and rural poor in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He followed this with ''Holocaust'' (1975), based on court testimony about [[Extermination camp|Nazi death camps]] during [[World War II]].

In 1930 Reznikoff married [[Marie Syrkin]], a prominent [[Zionist]] and friend and biographer of [[Golda Meir]].  Although they did not live together at all times during the marriage, it lasted until Reznikoff's death.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

When [[Louis Zukofsky]] was asked by [[Harriet Monroe]] to provide an introduction to what became known as the Objectivist issue of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', he contributed his  essay, ''Sincerity and Objectification: With Special Reference to the Work of Charles Reznikoff''. This established the name of the loose-knit group of second-generation [[modernist poetry|modernist poets]] and the two characteristics of their poetry: sincerity and objectification.

==Early years==
Charles Reznikoff was born in 1894 in a [[Jew]]ish [[neighborhood]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of immigrants Sarah Yetta (Wolvovsky) Reznikoff and Nathan Reznikoff, who fled the [[Russian Empire]] and its [[pogroms]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} His Hebrew name was Ezekiel, after his maternal grandfather.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} His father established a family business of manufacturing hats.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} He was young when he graduated from high school and had already started writing poetry.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} He spent a year studying journalism in graduate school at the University of Missouri, where Reznikoff realized he was interested in writing more than reporting news.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} He entered the law school of [[New York University]] in 1912 and graduated in 1916.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} He practiced law briefly.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} In 1918 as the United States had entered the Great War, he entered officer training school.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} He did not see active service before the end of the [[World War I|war]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Reznikoff worked for a time for his family's business as a hat salesman. He worked for a legal publishing house, where he wrote summaries of court records for legal reference books. This experience was to prove integral to his later writing.

From his teens, Reznikoff had been writing poetry, much of it influenced by the [[Imagist]]s. He published his own work, using a second-hand press for which he set the type himself. Throughout his writing life, Reznikoff was always concerned to ensure that his work was published, even at his own expense. This appears to have been inspired by a family story of his grandfather, an unpublished [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] poet whose manuscripts were destroyed after his death, for fear of their falling into Russian hands.

==Objectivist poet==
Around the time the Objectivist issue of ''Poetry'' appeared, Reznikoff, Zukofsky and [[George Oppen]] set up To Publishers and later the Objectivist Press, essentially to publish their own work. Reznikoff had had some success with his 1930 novel ''By the Waters of Manhattan'', and the new press published three titles by him, two that gathered together previously self-published work and the third a first installment of a long work called ''Testimony''.

==Court poetry==
In early drafts, ''Testimony'' was a prose retelling of stories that Reznikoff had discovered while working on court records. Reznikoff found these accounts to give him insight into the story of America between 1885 and 1915, both in its diversity and its violence. Tellingly, he chose to omit the judgements, focusing on the twists and turns of the stories.

Over the following forty years, Reznikoff worked on refashioning these stories into an extended [[Found poetry|found poem]], which finally ran to some 500 pages over two volumes. He tried to express the stories in as near as possible the words of the participants. As a result, his poetry was almost entirely stripped of [[metaphor]] and of authorial personality and emotion. In this sense, ''Testimony'' can be read as the great monument of Objectivist poetry.

The poetic mode which Reznikof developed in writing this work was invaluable to his work on ''Holocaust.'' It was based on testimony in court cases related to the [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[death camps]]. He also adopted this style for his poetry that reworked stories from the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]].

==Late recognition==
Reznikoff lived and wrote in relative obscurity for most of his life, with his work being either self-published or issued by small independent presses. In the 1960s, at the behest of friend and fellow poet [[George Oppen]], and Oppen's sister June Oppen Degnan, [[New Directions Publishers]] published two books of his poetry: ''By the Waters of Manhattan'' (1962, New Directions/San Francisco Review NDP121), which had an Introduction by [[C. P. Snow]]; and ''Testimony: The United States 1885–1890'' (1965, New Directions/San Francisco Review NDP200). But, despite acclaim from fellow poets such as [[Hayden Carruth]], [[May Swenson]], and [[Denise Levertov]], critical reaction was generally negative. Reznikoff had to return to self-publishing to see his work in print.

In 1971, he was awarded the Morton Dauwen Zabel Prize of $2,500 by The National Institute of Arts and Letters. Around this time, he found a new publisher, [[Black Sparrow Press]]. They published ''By the Well of Living and Seeing: New and Selected Poems, 1918-1973'' in 1974. At the time of his death, Reznikoff was correcting proofs of the first volume of the Black Sparrow ''Collected Poems''. In the years immediately following his death, Black Sparrow reprinted all his major poetry and prose works. In addition, it published for the first time his completed novel, ''The Manner “Music”'' (1977), found among his papers.

==Representation in other media==
In 2013, the band [[Joan of Arc (band)|Joan of Arc]], with the help of the experimental performance group, Every House Has a Door,<ref>{{cite web|title=Testimonium|url=http://everyhousehasadoor.org/projects/testimony-22|publisher=Every House Has A Door|accessdate=29 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054755/http://everyhousehasadoor.org/projects/testimony-22#|archive-date=2013-07-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> created a musical/theater piece based on Reznikoff's ''[[Charles Reznikoff#Court poetry|Testimony]]''. The album inspired by his work was called ''Testimonium Songs'' and released on [[Polyvinyl Record Co.]] and [[Joyful Noise Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Thomas|title=Testimonium Songs by Joan of Arc|url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/testimonium-songs-by-joan-of-arc/|publisher=Joyful Noise Recordings|accessdate=29 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201191827/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/testimonium-songs-by-joan-of-arc/|archivedate=1 February 2014}}</ref>

The song "Texas Reznikoff" by the singer-songwriter [[Mitski]], from her album ''[[Bury Me at Makeout Creek]]'' (2014), refers to Reznikoff's work. In a 2016 interview Mitski cited Reznikoff as an influence on her music, and praised his poetic precision and ability to "create a striking image in people’s brains".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.avclub.com/mitski-talks-poetry-and-the-competitive-nature-that-ins-1798248290|title=Mitski talks poetry and the competitive nature that inspires her music|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2019|work=[[The A.V.

Reznikoff is mentioned in [[Yannick Haenel]]'s novel ''Tiens ferme ta couronne'' (2017), published in English as ''[[Hold Fast the Crown]]''. One of the novel's chapters is named after him.
