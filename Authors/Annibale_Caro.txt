[[Friar|Fra']] '''Annibale Caro''', [[Order of Malta|K.M.]], (6 June 1507{{snd}}17 November 1566) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] writer and  [[poet]].

==Biography==
[[File:Lettere del commendatore Annibal Caro.tif|thumb|''Lettere del commendatore Annibal Caro'' (1807)]]
Born in [[Civitanova Marche]], then in the [[March of Ancona]], Caro became tutor to the wealthy family of [[Lodovico Gaddi]] in [[Florence]], and then secretary to Lodovico's brother [[Giovanni Gaddi (priest)|Giovanni]]. At Gaddi's death, he entered the service of the [[Farnese family]], and became confidential secretary to [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma]], and to his sons, Duke [[Ottavio Farnese|Ottavio]] and [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinals]] [[Ranuccio Farnese (Cardinal)|Ranuccio]] and [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alexander]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Caro's most important work were his translations (see below). He is also the author of poems, [[sonnet]]s, and a [[comedy]] called ''Gli Straccioni''. His work additionally includes two clever ''jeux d'esprit'': ''La Fichelde'', in praise of [[ficus|fig]]s, and a [[eulogy]] of the big nose of [[Leoni Ancona]], a local figure. His poetry is noted for the freedom and grace of its versification, so that many claim that he brought ''[[verso sciolto]]'' to its highest form in [[Italy]].  Letters he wrote, both in his own name and on behalf of the Cardinals Farnese, are considered remarkable for both the baseness they display and for their [[euphemism|euphemistic]] polish and elegance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Caro's fame was diminished because of the virulence with which he attacked [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] in one of his ''canzoni'', and by his meanness for denouncing him to the Church for translating some of the writings of [[Philipp Melanchthon]], an associate of [[Martin Luther]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1555 Caro was installed as a "knight of grace" (a member not taking [[religious vows]]) of the [[Order of Malta]] by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.500annibalcaro.it/vita.aspx|work=500AnnibalCaro|title=Vita di Annibale Caro|year=2007|accessdate=7 January 2013|language=it}}</ref>

Caro died in [[Frascati]] in 1566 and was buried in the Church of [[San Lorenzo in Damaso]] in Rome. His prose includes translations of [[Aristotle]], [[Cyprian]], and [[Gregory Nazianzen]].

== The translations ==

Annibal Caro published a translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Vergil]], which was much admired by contemporaries, and still is read with pleasure by the lovers of the [[Italian language]]. Another translation, which remained the standard one for several centuries, is that of ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'', the ancient Greek novel by [[Longus]].
