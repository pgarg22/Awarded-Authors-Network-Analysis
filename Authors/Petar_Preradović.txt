'''Petar Preradović''' (19 March 1818 – 18 August 1872) was a Croatian<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnISZNM6X6EC&q=Petar+Preradovic&pg=PA40 |title = Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation: Literature and Cultural Politics in Yugoslavia|isbn = 978-0-8047-3181-2|last1 = Wachtel|first1 = Andrew|year = 1998}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm93d_KQsCAC&q=Petar+Preradovic&pg=PA232 |title = A Companion to Twentieth-century German Literature|isbn = 978-0-415-15057-6|last1 = Furness|first1 = Raymond|last2 = Humble|first2 = Malcolm|year = 1997}}</ref> [[poet]], [[writer]], and military general. He was one of the most important Croatian poets of the 19th century [[Illyrian movement]] and the main representative of [[romanticism]] in [[Croatia]].

He was also the paternal [[grandfather]] of the Austrian writer and poet [[Paula von Preradović|Paula Preradović]], who is best known for composing the lyrics of the [[National anthem of Austria|Austrian national anthem]].

== Early life and  education ==
Petar Preradović was born to a family of [[Serbs|Serb]] origin<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDaEDwAAQBAJ|title=Voices of Identities: Vocal Music and De/con/struction of Communities in the Former Habsburg Areas|last1=Ender|first1=Daniel|last2=Flamm|first2=Christoph|date=2019-01-15|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=72|isbn=978-1-5275-2587-0|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://snv.hr/znameniti-srbi-u-hrvatskoj/petar-preradovic|title=Srpsko Narodno Vijeće :: Petar Preradović|website=snv.hr|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portalnovosti.com/general-i-pjesnik|title=General i pjesnik|website=portalnovosti.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> in the village of [[Grabrovnica]] near the town of [[Pitomača]] in modern-day [[Croatia]], which was a part of the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] at the time. He was born to Ivan and Pelagija (née Ivančić) Preradović,<ref>{{cite web|title=Preradović, Petar – Hrvatska enciklopedija|url=http://enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=50197|access-date=11 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preradović, Petar – Proleksis enciklopedija|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/42607/|access-date=11 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preradović, Petar – enciklopedija.lzmk.hr – Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža|url=http://enciklopedija.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=32298

Matice hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., Crtice moga života, p. (I)</ref> In autobiography ''Crtice moga života'', Preradović wrote of himself as a [[Croats|Croat]].<ref>Petar Preradović, Milivoj Šrepel, Izabrane pjesme: uvod napisao Milivoj Šrepel: sa slikom pjesnikovom , Izd. Matice Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., p. 3, 16, 366-367</ref> He had two sisters, Marija (20 December 1812 – 25 February 1867) and Ana (11 February 1820 – 5 April 1822).<ref>Petar Preradović. Pozdrav domovini: izabrane pjesme, (izbor i redakcija Dragutin Tadijanović), [[Matica hrvatska]], Zagreb, 1968., p. 203</ref>

Following his fathers' death in 1828, Preradović, like many from the Military Frontier area, chose to become a professional soldier. He enrolled at the military academy in [[Bjelovar]] and later [[Wiener Neustadt]] where he converted from [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]] to [[Catholicism]] and went on to excel as one of the school's best students.<ref name="preradovic">{{cite book |title= Leksikon hrvatskih pisaca |last=Fališevac |first=Dunja |author2=Krešimir Nemec |author3=Darko Novaković   |year= 2000|publisher= Školska knjiga d.d|location= Zagreb|isbn= 953-0-61107-2}}</ref> During the training, all Academy students were conducted as Roman Catholics, which could've been changed at the express request of the soldier. However, this has rarely occurred. Thus Preradović, tacitly signed as a Roman Catholic convert from the Orthodox Christianity which was legitimized by a formal act of conversion. His loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church was later increased since both he and his wife were Roman Catholics.<ref>[Eminent Serbs XIX century, year 2, Volume II, edited by Andra Gavrilovic, Serbian edition printing (deon.

== Career ==
After graduation, he was stationed in [[Milan]] where he met [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]], a fellow officer from Croatia, who inspired him to start writing in [[Croatian language|Croatian]].<ref name="preradovic" /> This stimulated his interest in Croatian culture and Croatia's political and economic situation. After Milan, Preradović was posted to [[Zadar]] where he wrote his first song in Croatian, ''Poslanica Špiri Dimitroviću'' [Epistle to Špiro Dimitrović].<ref name="foi.hr">{{cite web|url=http://library.foi.hr/m3/mda1.php?B=1&A=0000000012&grupa=Narodna+knji%259Enica+PETAR+PRERADOVI%25C6+Bjelovar&vrsta=VLA&H=bjelovar|title=Metelgrad – Detalji o Autoru|website=library.foi.hr|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> His writings were published in the local Croatian-language newspaper ''Zora dalmatinska'' in 1846.<ref name="petar" /> He then went to [[Zagreb]] where he met the leading figures of the [[Illyrian movement]]. At the request of [[Ante Kuzmanić]], who was then editor of the Zora dalmatinska, Preradović wrote the song "Zora puca, biche dana"  for the first issue of the paper (published on 1 January 1844). Like most of his songs, this one speaks of the emergence of Croatian national consciousness and suggests a new, prosperous era for the Croatian people.<ref name="foi.hr" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-BAE1GVME|title=dLib.si – Slovan|website=www.dlib.si}}</ref> Since then, he has been systematically continuing his poetry work in Croatian and has also advocated official acceptance of [[Ljudevit Gaj]]'s grammar in southern Croatia.<ref name="foi.hr" />

In 1848, he was again stationed in [[Italy]] where he took part in the [[Italian Unification|Wars of Italian Unification]].<ref name="petar" /> In September of 1848, he traveled to [[Dubrovnik]] where a month later he married Zadar native Pavica de Ponte. In 1849, he was transferred to [[Zagreb]] where he was assigned to the military department of the Ban's Court (Government of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]). In 1851, Ban [[Josip Jelačić]] appointed him deputy commander of the military department and Ban's adjutant. At the end of 1852, he moved to [[Cremona]], in 1853 to [[Verona]], in September of that same year to [[Pančevo]], and afterward to Kovin, Arad and Transylvania. In 1854, he was assigned to the Supreme Command in Vienna. In 1855, his wife Pavica committed suicide which made him interested in [[spiritism]] in his later years. In 1865, he married Emma Regner and was sent to Verona to fight in a war with Italy.<ref name="foi.hr" />

On 24 February 1864, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] awarded Preradović with the nobility, and also gave him a part of his personal treasury as Preradović was at the time in a bad financial situation. Preradović wrote a song in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gskos.unios.hr/~descape/files/Zivot+i+pjesme+Petra+Preradovica+spojeno.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328085519/http://www.gskos.unios.hr/~descape/files/Zivot%20i%20pjesme%20Petra%20Preradovica%20spojeno.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 March 2016|title=Život i pjesme Petra Preradovića|year=1916|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> In 1866, he became a general.<ref name="petar" /> In mid-1871 he participated in the military exercises at Bruck and was in the same year suggested for the position of Croatian ban, but he was very sick and wrote in a letter that he was not interested.

His health deteriorated at the end of 1871 so he was sent to treatment in Mariabrunn near Munich and then in the Austrian town of Fahrafeld. Petar Preradović died on 18 August 1872 from [[dropsy]]. He was buried on 21 August 1872 in Vienna. Viennese youth organization Velebit, proposed that his remains should be transferred to Zagreb. On 11 July 1879, his remains were removed from the Vienna cemetery and transferred to the arcades of [[Mirogoj cemetery]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradskagroblja.hr/default.aspx?id=320|title=Gradska groblja Zagreb – P|first=Globaldizajn|last=www.globaldizajn.hr|website=www.gradskagroblja.hr|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> where he was buried on 14 July 1879.<ref>Petar Preradović, Milivoj Šrepel, Izabrane pjesme, Izd.

He had eight children: Čedomil (8 July 1849 – 24 September 1849), Milica (b. 24 September 1850), Slavica (17 August 1852 – 23 March 1854), Dušan (18 September 1854 – 30 September 1920), Radovan Josip Petar (24 August 1858 – 11 February 1908), Milan (5 February 1866 – 6 August 1879), Zora (13 December 1867 – 10 May 1927) and Jelica (13 June 1870 – 27 December 1870). One of his grandchildren was [[Paula von Preradović]], Austrian poet and the author of the Austrian national anthem.

== Lyric poetry ==
[[File:Pervenci cover 1846.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Pervenci'', cover from 1846]]
While attending the military academy in Vienna, Preradović began writing his first poems (''Der Brand von Neustadt'', 1834) in German. In 1840, he met [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]], who awoke his interest in Croatian culture and encouraged him to write in his native Croatian. In 1841, in Zagreb's German magazine ''Croatia'' he published the song ''Das Uskoken-Mädchen''. On the initiative of Špiro Dmitrović, in 1843, Preradović wrote the first poem in Croatian, ''Poslanica Špiri Dimitroviću''. His first published song written in Croatian ''Zora puca, bit će dana'' was published in 1844 in the first issue of Zora dalmatinska.<ref>Petar Preradović, Milivoj Šrepel, Izabrane pjesme, Izd. Matice hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., p. 21-22</ref> Preradović remained one of the constants of Croatian romanticism by its very nature.<ref>Dubravko Jelčić, Povijest hrvatske književnosti, Naklada P.I.P. Pavičić, Zagreb, 2004., II. edition, {{ISBN|953-6308-56-8}}, p. 182</ref>

The romantic love for medieval traditions has a complete expression in two Preradović's dramas, ''[[Prince Marko|Kraljević Marko]]'' and ''Vladimir i Kosara''. But he achieved widespread popularity with his lyric poems. His pensive melancholy expressed itself in the allegory ''Putnik'' (The Traveler), which hides a whole life of homelessness and isolation. The same note of sadness and longing is felt in his songlet ''Miruj, miruj, srce moje'' (Be still, my heart, be still):

<poem>  ''Who has stirred thee, heart of mine,''
  ''That thou art so restless now?''
  ''As a bird in a cage thou longest,''
  ''In the heavens to wing thy way.''
         ''Be still, my heart, be still! . . .''
</poem>

In most of his poems, Preradović upheld a mystic patriotism in the manner of the Polish messianists and Czech and Slovak pan-Slavists. But being too reflective, and not so keen as his progenitors, he did not exercise any decided influence on his successors.

== Translator ==
Preradović translated during schooling the song ''Máy'' by Czech poet [[Karel Hynek Mácha]] to German. He published in ''Prevenci'' his translations of works by Lanau, Scmidt, Lübeck, Gleim, Wieland, Goethe and Bürger. Under Kukuljević's advisement, he translated part of [[Ivan Gundulić]]'s ''Osman'' to German. Preradović translated from French to Croatian [[Allan Kardec]]'s ''L’Évangile selon le Spiritisme'' (Zagreb, 1865).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://katalog.kgz.hr/pagesresults/bibliografskiZapis.aspx?&currentPage=1&searchById=10&sort=0&spid0=10&spv0=Kardec,+Allan&xm0=1&selectedId=303000537|title=Katalog Knjižnica grada Zagreba – Detalji|website=katalog.kgz.hr|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> He also translated works by V. J. Pick, George Gordon Byron, Dante Alighieri and Alessandro Manzoni. Preradović translated from Croatian to German [[Franjo Rački]]'s ''Rieka prema Hrvatskoj'' (Fiume gegenüber von Croatien, Dr Franz Rački, Aus dem kroatischen übers von X.Y., Zagreb, 1869). He spoke German, Italian, French, English and almost all Slavic languages.<ref name="knjiznica-bjelovar.hr" />
