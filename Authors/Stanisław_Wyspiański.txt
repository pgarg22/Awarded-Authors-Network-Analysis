'''Stanisław Mateusz Ignacy Wyspiański''' ({{IPA-pl|'staˈɲiswaf vɨˈspjaɲskʲi|pron}}; 15 January 1869&nbsp;– 28 November 1907) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[playwright]], [[painter]] and [[poet]], as well as interior and furniture designer. A patriotic writer, he created a series of symbolic, national dramas within the artistic philosophy of the [[Young Poland]] Movement. Wyspiański was one of the most outstanding and multifaceted artists of his time in Poland under [[Partitions of Poland|the foreign partitions]].<ref name="uj" /> He successfully joined the trends of [[modernism]] with themes of the Polish folk tradition and [[Polish Romanticism|Romantic history]]. Unofficially, he came to be known as the Fourth Polish Bard (in addition to the earlier [[Three Bards]]: [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Juliusz Słowacki]], and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]]).

==Biography==
Stanisław Wyspiański was born to Franciszek Wyspiański and Maria Rogowska. His father, a sculptor, owned an [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] at the foot of [[Wawel Hill]]. His mother died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1876 when Stanisław was seven years old. Due to problems with alcohol, Stanisław's father could not fulfil his parental responsibilities. Stanisław was adopted by his aunt Joanna Stankiewiczowa and her husband Kazimierz. The Stankiewicz family belonged to the bourgeois intellectual class. In their house, Wyspiański became acquainted with painter [[Jan Matejko]], who was a frequent visitor. Matejko soon recognized that the boy had artistic talent and gave him his first artistic guidance. Wyspiański attended Saint Anne's [[Gymnasium (school)|secondary school]]. The school was unique for several reasons. First, although the Polish language was forbidden in educational institutions under foreign rule, the lectures at Saint Anne's were delivered in Polish. Second, the teacher's goal was to equip the students with a thorough knowledge of [[Polish history]] and [[Polish literature|literature]]. Third, graduates of the school, including [[Lucjan Rydel]], [[Stanisław Estreicher]] and [[Henryk Opieński]], were considered prominent figures in [[Kraków]]'s cultural life. As a student, Wyspiański took particular interest in art and literature. According to Joanna Stankiewiczowa, the young Stanisław portrayed small cottages, animals, plants, [[armour|armors]] and decorations. Wyspiański also created a dramatic interpretation of Matejko's painting ''Stefan Batory pod Pskowem (Bathory at [[siege of Pskov|Pskov]])''.

In 1887 Wyspiański enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy at [[Jagiellonian University]] and the [[School of Fine Arts in Kraków]]. While studying at the [[Jagiellonian University|university]], he attended lectures in art, history and literature. Jan Matejko, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the School of Fine Arts, soon recognized Wyspiański's talent and asked him to join in the creation of a [[polychrome]] inside the [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|Mariacki Church]].<ref name="Stanisław Wyspiański">{{cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/stanislaw-wyspianski |title=Stanisław Wyspiański |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Wyspianski, Planty o swicie, 1894.jpg|thumb|''Planty Park at Dawn'', 1894]]

The years 1890–1895 were devoted to travel. Wyspiański visited Italy, [[Switzerland]], Germany, Prague and France. His stay in France is regarded as a major point in his artistic life. He studied at the private [[Académie Colarossi]]. Since the school fee was very high, Wyspiański applied for a grant. During his stay in France he got acquainted with [[Paul Gauguin]]. Together they visited art museums, where Wyspiański was bewitched by the beauty of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes|Pierre Puvis de Chavannes's paintings]]. He also attended theatre performances based on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and classical era plays. His future dramas ''Daniel i Meleager (Daniel and Meleagra)'' and ''Powrót Odysa (Return of Odysseus)'' were based on the antic tradition. Meanwhile, he worked on several dramas, ''Królowa Polskiej Korony (The Queen of Polish Crown), Warszawianka (Varsovian Anthem)'' and the first version of ''Legenda (Legend)''. The play ''Legenda (Legend)'' was based on the famous Polish [[legend]] of Wars and Sawa. In August 1894 he returned to [[Kraków]], where he got involved in the [[modernism|modernist movement]]. It was then he designed and partially made a [[polychrome]] for the [[Church of St. Francis of Assisi, Kraków|Franciscan]] Church that was composed of flowery, geometrical and heraldic motifs. Moreover, the [[prior]] of the church encouraged Wyspiański to design various [[stained glass|stained glass windows]], such as ''Blessed Salomea, Saint Francis Stigmata'' and ''[[God the Father (stained glass)|God the Father]]''. Wyspiański received an award from the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] for the [[landscape]] of the ''Kopiec Kościuszki ([[Kościuszko Mound]])''.
As a painter, interior designer and poet he cooperated with the Municipal Theatre in Kraków. First he designed furniture and [[scenography]] for the theatre performances, then he staged various dramas on the stage of the theatre.

[[File:Stanisław Wyspiański, Macierzyństwo.jpg|thumb|''Motherhood'', 1905, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]]]]

He cooperated with the [[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Art]] and in mid-1898 was named art manager of the weekly ''Życie (Life)''. Unfortunately, his first published dramas, ''Legenda (Legend)'', (1897) and ''Daniel i Meleager (Daniel and Meleagra)'' (1898), did not receive the acclaim of the critics. It was the ''Warszawianka (Varsovian Anthem)'' that brought instantaneous acclaim to its author. The premiere of the drama marked his debut as a playwright of national dramas. The theatre [[premiere]] of the drama on 2 July 1901 starred [[Helena Modrzejewska]] as Maria. The years 1899–1900 marked the publication of ''Protesilas i Laodamia (Protesilas and Laodamia), Lelewel (Lelevel)'' and ''Legion''. This drama is regarded to be the author's [[polemic]] displaying a [[romanticism|romantic vision]] of history. In 1900, Wyspiański married the mother of his four children, Teodora Pytko. In November the same year he participated in the wedding of his friend [[Lucjan Rydel]] in [[Bronowice, Kraków|Bronowice]], a village near Kraków. The wedding party was the inspiration for his widely acclaimed play ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|Wesele (The Wedding)]]''. It is a deeply critical yet sarcastic exposé of Polish society of the 19th century. "''Wesele''" transformed Wyspianski from a moderately successful visual and verbal artist associated with the [[Young Poland]] movement into a national dramatist-visionary whose significance in Poland is comparable to [[Yeats]]'s in Ireland, [[Eugene O'Neill|O'Neill]]'s in America, or [[Maeterlinck]]'s in Belgium."<ref name="jhu" /> The drama made references to the contemporary situation in [[Poland]] and depicted a powerless society. Although censorship barred the sale of copies of ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|Wesele (The Wedding)]]'', the play was staged in the theatre.<ref name="Stanisław Wyspiański"/>
[[File:Portret z zona.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait with Wife at the Window'', 1904, National Museum in Kraków]]

After the success of ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|Wesele (The Wedding)]]'' four new plays based on [[History of Poland|Polish history]] were [[publishing|published]]: ''Wyzwolenie (Liberation), Achilles, Bolesław Śmiały (Boleslaus The Bold)'' and ''Legenda II (Legend 2)''. The following years were devoted to publishing of ''[[Skałka]]'' and ''Powrót Odysa (Return of Odysseus)''; meanwhile Wyspiański translated [[Pierre Corneille|Corneillea's]] ''Cyd (Le Cid)'' and [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaïre]]''.

In 1906 Wyspiański became a professor at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Kraków]]. He was also a member of the city council.
In his last years, Wyspianski's health deteriorated. As a result, he underwent [[therapy|medical treatments]] in Rymanów and [[Bad Hall]] and then settled in his small [[cottage]] in the village of Węgrzce. He died of [[syphilis]], which was incurable at the time. His funeral took place in [[Kraków]] and became a national day of mourning. Wyspiański was buried in the [[Crypt]] of the Distinguished in the [[Skałka|Skałka Church]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://dzieje.pl/postacie/stanis%C5%82aw-wyspia%C5%84ski-1869-1907 |title=Stanisław Wyspiański (1869-1907) |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

==Creative output==

Wyspiański's artistic output is very eclectic. Among dramas and poetry, there are views of [[Kraków|Cracow]] (drawings, sketch-books, [[oil painting|oil-paintings]], pastel drawings), [[portrait]]s and [[self-portrait]]s, designs of [[stained glass]] windows and paintings, [[illustration]]s, [[graphics|graphic art]], and designs for furniture and interiors, and development of [[Wawel]].

Drawings, such as his 1890 [[self-portrait]], and drafts from his journeys across Europe and [[Poland]], are among Wyspiański's better-known works. He later created a [[herbarium]] by drawing plants. However, he most frequently used soft [[pastel]] techniques; his first pastel drawings were produced between 1890 and 1894. They mainly present the artist's family, friends and other artists. Wyspiański eagerly drew his children in everyday situations such as sleeping or feeding, including ''Helenka'' (1900), pastel drawing, owned by the [[National Museum, Kraków|National Museum]] in [[Kraków]]; ''Śpiący Staś (Sleeping Staś)'' (1902), pastel drawing, [[Silesian Museum]] in Katowice; ''Śpiący Mietek (Sleeping Mietek)'' (1904), pastel drawing, Museum of Art in [[Łódź]]; ''Macierzyństwo (Motherhood)'' (1905), pastel drawing, National Museum in Kraków; and ''Żona artysty z synkiem Stasiem (The Artist's Wife with Their Son Staś)'' (1904), pastel drawing, now at the Upper Silesian Museum in [[Bytom]].

Using this technique, he painted many of his acquaintances and artists, among others Kazimierz Lewandowski, [[Jacek Malczewski]], Eliza Pareńska, the Kryształowicz family, [[Ludwik Solski]], Irena Solska, and [[Jan Stanisławski (painter)|Jan Stanisławski]]. He painted landscapes of [[Kraków]]&nbsp;– the [[Kraków]] [[Planty Park]] with desmans (also painted in oil), the Vistula Rudawa River, cottages in Grębowo, and at the end of his life, views from his studio to the [[Kościuszko Mound]]. He also created a poster for [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck's]] ''Wnętrze (Interior)''.

Part of his output constitutes various designs&nbsp;– mainly [[stained glass]] windows, [[polychrome]]s and interiors. Stanisław Wyspiański and [[Józef Mehoffer]] designed 36 [[stained glass]] windows together for the [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|Mariacki Church]] in [[Kraków]] to help [[Jan Matejko|Matejko]] with the church conservation he had been involved with since 1889. During their stay in Paris they both made two boxes for the competition of the Rudolfinum Hall Decoration Design in [[Prague]] and curtain designs for the [[Juliusz Słowacki]] Theatre in [[Kraków]]. However, Wyspiański himself designed [[stained glass]] windows and [[polychrome]]s for the [[Church of St. Francis of Assisi, Kraków|Franciscan Church]] in Kraków (with the famous stained glass window ''Stań się''), [[stained glass]] windows depicting Saint Stanislaus, [[Casimir III of Poland|Kazimierz the Great]] and [[Henry II the Pious|Henryk Pobożny]] for [[Wawel Cathedral]] (not executed until 2005–2007 in the [[Wyspiański Pavilion|Wyspiański 2000 Pavilion]]), the design of a showroom of the Fine Arts Society (1904), and stairs and hall decoration for the Medical Society. In 1905 Wyspiański and Władysław Ekielski designed a scheme for redevelopment of the [[Wawel Hill]] (the so-called ''Acropolis'').<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.encyklopediateatru.pl/autorzy/161/stanislaw-wyspianski |title=Stanisław Wyspiański |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

==Streets of Kraków with Wyspiański connections==
[[File:Tenement house, 79 Krowoderska street, Kraków, Poland.jpg|thumb|Tenement house, 79 Krowoderska street]]

* '''26 Krupnicza Street''' Wyspiański was born at 26 Krupnicza Street in [[Kraków]], in a house that belonged to his grandparents.  He lived there until 1873.

* '''25 Kanonicza Street''' In the summer of 1873 Wyspianski's family moved to the house of [[Jan Długosz]]. Wyspiański's younger brother and mother died here. In the autumn of 1880 Wyspiański moved into the house of his uncle and aunt.

* '''1 Kopernika Street''' Between 1880 and 1883 he lived in the house of the Stankiewicz family, site of the later [[PTTK]] Tourist House and the present Wyspiański Hotel.

* '''2 Zacisze Street''' Here was the Stankiewicz family's new apartment. It was on the second floor of the now non-extant Central Hotel at the junction of Zacisze and Basztowa streets, with a view onto the [[Barbican of Kraków|Barbakan]] and the [[Planty Park]]. Because of the hotel's expansion, the Stankiewicz family was forced to move out in 1885.

* '''1 Westerplatte Street (then Kolejowa Street)''' In July 1895 the Stankiewicz family began living here in an apartment on the ground floor at the corner of Kolejowa and Lubicz streets. Currently at this site there are arcades and stairs to an underground passage. At the time Wyspiański had his studio in the nearby village of [[Grzegórzki (Kraków)|Grzegórzki]], where he worked on [[stained glass]] window designs for the [[Church of St. Francis of Assisi, Kraków|Franciscan Church]].

* '''10 Poselska Street''' After a few months at Westerplatte Street, Wyspiański's uncle died and Wyspiański and his aunt went to live at 10 Poselska Street in a second-floor apartment.
