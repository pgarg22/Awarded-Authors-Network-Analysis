'''Marie-Elena John''' (born 1963) is a [[Caribbean]] writer whose first novel, ''[[Unburnable]]'', was published in 2006.

==Biography==
John was born and raised in [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]] and is a former development specialist of the [[African Development Foundation]], the [[World Council of Churches]]’ Program to Combat Racism, and [[Global Rights]] (formerly the International Human Rights Law Group), where she worked in support of the pro-democracy movement in [[Nigeria]] and in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].<ref>[http://www.allafrica.com/stories/200109100142.html "Nigeria: Widows From the East"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418192300/http://allafrica.com/stories/200109100142.html |date=18 April 2012 }}. allAfrica.com, 10 September 2001.</ref> She is known especially for her work in the [[United Nations]] and at local and national levels to raise awareness about the denial of inheritance rights to women.<ref>John, Marie-Elena.

Marie-Elena John made history in 1986 as the first Black woman [[valedictorian]] of New York's [[City College of New York|City College]] (CCNY).<ref>Moore, Keith. "She's the Class of the Class". ''The New York Daily News'', 30 May 1986, p. 4.</ref> She later earned a Masters of International Affairs from [[Columbia University]], specializing in culture and development in Africa. She lives in Antigua and [[Washington, D.C.]] with her husband, and their two children, Trey and Elyse.

John made her literary debut with ''Unburnable''. ''Unburnable'' which moves back and forth between modern times and the past, is primarily a [[historical novel]] centred on the hanging of a family matriarch, and fuses Caribbean history, African heritage, and African-American sensibilities. Marie-Elena John parlays her knowledge of the [[African diaspora]], including the [[United States]] and the Caribbean island of [[Dominica]], into a work that shifts from modern to [[Colonialism|colonial]] and pre-colonial times, exploring the intersection of history, [[African mythology]] and African-Caribbean culture. Important themes include the African origins of [[Carnival]] and [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s, African religion, the practice of [[Obeah]], [[Syncretism#Syncretism in Caribbean religions and cultures|syncretic]] [[Catholicism]], [[Caribbean folklore]], the [[maroon (people)|Maroons]] and resistance to [[slavery]]. In this respect, ''Unburnable'' is both a contemporary Caribbean novel as well as a neo-[[slave narrative]]. ''Unburnable'' also notably includes the original inhabitants of the Caribbean, the [[Kalinago]] (also called the Carib Indians). It has been compared to [[Jean Rhys]]’ ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''<ref>Harris, Ena. "Dominica as Spiritual Landscape: Representations of Nature and Ritual in Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea and Marie-Elena John's Unburnable".
