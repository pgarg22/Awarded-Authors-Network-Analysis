'''Roland Edward Robinson''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (12 June 1912 – 8 February 1992) was an [[Australia]]n poet, writer and collector of Australian Aboriginal myths.

==Life and career==
Robinson was born in [[County Clare]], [[Ireland]] in 1912. At the age of 9, in 1921 he was brought to [[Australia]]. After only a brief education he worked in various jobs, mainly in the bush as a roustabout, boundary-rider, railway fettler, fencer, dam-builder, gardener and as a lifelong love - a [[ballet dancer]].

Robinson's first published poetry appeared in ''Beyond the Grass-Tree Spears'' published in 1944. He served in the [[Australian Army]]. His love of the Australian landscape and everyday scenes were inspiration for his poetry. He was one of the most dedicated poets to the [[Jindyworobak Movement]].

As well as a writer and poet, Robinson was dance critic for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1940s he took classes with [[Helene Kirsova]] and appeared in a number of productions by the [[Kirsova Ballet]].{{cite web |title= Robinson, Roland (1912 - 1992) |publisher= Australia Dancing |url= http://www.australiadancing.org/apps/ad?action=ViewSubject&id=101&resourceType=Ephemera |accessdate= 2008-04-07}}

Robinson was a distinguished poet and writer who spent his later years in Lake Macquarie. After his death in 1992, Lake Macquarie City Council established [[The Roland Robinson Literary Award]], an annual award to honour Robinson's contribution to literature and culture, and to foster creative literary talent in the city.

In 1997, [[Lake Macquarie]] City Council named the new library at [[Belmont, New South Wales|Belmont]] in his honour.{{cite web |title= About Roland Robinson |publisher= City of Lake Macquarie |url= http://history.lakemac.com.au/page-local-history.aspx?pid=1085&vid=20&tmpt=narrative&narid=3596 |accessdate= 2008-04-07}}
Robinson worked very closely with Aboriginal people from all over Australia writing down their myths. Perhaps his most important work was conducted with various Aboriginal people from the New South Wales. In particular his collaboration with Percy Mumbulla of the Yuin people.
