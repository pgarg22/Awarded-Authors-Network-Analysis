'''Yehuda Amichai''' ({{lang-he|יהודה עמיחי}}; born Ludwig Pfeuffer {{lrm}}3 May 1924 – 22 September 2000) was an Israeli poet and author, one of the first to write in [[colloquial]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in modern times.<ref name="bandw">{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/amichai.htm |title=Yehuda Amichai |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050104083533/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/amichai.htm |archive-date=4 January 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Amichai was awarded the 1957 Shlonsky Prize, the 1969 [[Brenner Prize]], 1976 [[Bialik Prize]], and 1982 [[Israel Prize]]. He also won international poetry prizes and was nominated several times for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]

== Biography==
Yehuda Amichai was born in [[Würzburg]], Germany, to an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family, and was raised speaking both Hebrew and [[German language|German]]. His German name was Ludwig Pfeuffer.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9699843 Love, War and History: Israel's Yehuda Amichai], ''All Things Considered'', 22 April 2007</ref>

Amichai immigrated with his family at the age of 12 to [[Petah Tikva]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1935, moving to Jerusalem in 1935.<ref name="jewish-agency">[http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/Gallery+of+People+(Biographies)/Amichai+Yehuda Gallery of People, Biographies, Yehuda Amichai]. Jewishagency.org (28 July 2008).</ref><ref name="npr">[http://www.npr.org/transcripts/9699843]. Npr.org (22 April 2007).</ref> He attended Ma'aleh, a religious high school in Jerusalem. He was a member of the [[Palmach]], the strike force of the [[Haganah]], the defense force of the Jewish community in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate]] Palestine. As a young man he volunteered and fought in [[World War II]] as a soldier in the [[British Army]], and in the [[Negev]] on the southern front in the [[1947–1949 Palestine war]].<ref name="jewish-agency"/>

After discharge from the British Army in 1946, Amichai was a student at [[David Yellin Teachers College]] in Jerusalem, and became a teacher in Haifa. After the 1947–1949 [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Amichai studied the [[Torah]] and [[Hebrew literature]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Encouraged by one of his professors at Hebrew University, he published his first book of poetry, ''Now and in Other Days'', in 1955.<ref name="beinecke">[http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brblinfo/brblguide_2000.html Yehuda Amichai papers, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]. Library.yale.edu.</ref>

In 1956, Amichai served in the [[Suez Crisis|Sinai War]], and in 1973 he served in the [[Yom Kippur War]].<ref>[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/14604/edition_id/283/format/html/displaystory.html Yehuda Amichai, Israel’s national poet, dies at 76]. Jewishsf.com (29 September 2000).</ref> Amichai published his first novel, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ShjAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Not+of+This+Time,+Not+of+This+Place%22+amichai&dq=%22Not+of+This+Time,+Not+of+This+Place%22+amichai&cd=1 Not of This Time, Not of This Place]'', in 1963. It is about a young Israeli who was born in Germany, and after World War II, and the [[1947–1949 Palestine war]], he visits his hometown in Germany, recalls his childhood, trying to make sense of the world that created the [[Holocaust]]. His second novel, ''Mi Yitneni Malon,'' about an Israeli poet living in New York, was published in 1971 while Amichai was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was a poet in residence at [[New York University]] in 1987.<ref name="bandw"/> For many years he taught literature in an Israeli seminar for teachers, and at the Hebrew University to students from abroad.<ref name="findarticles.com">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_3-4_53/ai_n14735945/pg_6/ Religious metaphor and its denial in the poetry of Yehuda Amichai]. Findarticles.com.</ref>

Amichai was invited in 1994 by Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] to read from his poems at the ceremony of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in [[Oslo]]. "God Has Pity on Kindergarten Children" was one of the poems he read. This poem is inscribed on a wall in the [[Rabin Museum]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. There are streets named for him in cities in Israel, and also one in Würzburg.

Amichai was married twice. He was first married to Tamar Horn, with whom he had one son, and then to Chana Sokolov; they had one son and one daughter. His two sons were Ron and David, and his daughter was Emmanuella.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Literature/Hebrew/Israeli_Literature/The_New_Wave/Yehuda_Amichai.shtml Poet of Israel's Soul, My Jewish Learning].

Amichai died of cancer in 2000, at age 76.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Joffe |first=Lawrence |title=Yehuda Amichai. Irreverent poetic conscience of Israel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/sep/29/guardianobituaries.books |magazine=Guardian}}</ref>

== Poetry ==
Amichai's poetry deals with issues of day-to-day life, and with philosophical issues of the meaning of life and death. His work is characterized by gentle [[irony]] and original, often surprising imagery. Like many secular Israeli poets, he struggles with religious faith. His poems are full of references to God and the religious experience.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KufLljeXft4C&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212&dq=amichai+trend+secular+israeli&source=bl&ots=hI2ReXv9Rd&sig=gFgVryTPQrZGjIO3wnU0DMwRE60&hl=en&ei=Rym5SofJJpmRjAfp3vn9BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=amichai%20trend%20secular%20israeli&f=false '&#39;Does David still play before you?: Israeli poetry and the Bible'&#39;, David C. Jacobson]. Books.google.com.</ref> He was described as a philosopher-poet in search of a post-[[theological]] [[humanism]].<ref>Chana Kronfeld, "The Wisdom of Camouflage" Prooftext 10' 1990 pp469-</ref>

Amichai has been credited with a "rare ability for transforming the personal, even private, love situation, with all its joys and agonies, into everybody's experience, making his own time and place general."<ref name=PoetryFoundation>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=80634 Yehuda Amichai]. Poetry Foundation.</ref>

Some of his imagery was accused of being sacrilegious.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1486476 Sacrilegious Imagery in Yehuda Amichai's Poetry, Yoseph Milman, 1995, Association for Jewish Studies]</ref> In his poem "And this is Your Glory" (''Vehi Tehilatekha''), for example, God is sprawled under the globe like a mechanic under a car, futilely trying to repair it. In the poem "Gods Change, Prayers Stay the Same" (''Elim Mithalfim, ha-Tfillot Nisharot la-Ad''), God is a portrayed as a tour guide or magician.<ref name="findarticles.com"/>

Many of Amichai's poems were set to music in Israel and in other countries. Among them:
the poem ''Memorial Day for the War Dead'' was set to music for solo voices, chorus and orchestra in [[Mohammed Fairouz]]'s Third Symphony.<ref name=mohammedopera>Moore, Thomas (12 September 2010), [http://www.operatoday.com/content/2010/09/mohammed_fairou.php Mohammed Fairouz: An Interview], ''Opera Today''. Retrieved 19 April 2011</ref>
Other poems were set by the composers [[Elizabeth Alexander (composer)|Elizabeth Alexander]] ("Even a fist was once an open palm and fingers"), David Froom, Mattias Pintscher, Jan Dušek, Benjamin Wallfisch, Ayelet Rose Gottlieb, Maya Beiser, Elizabeth Swados, Daniel Asia and others.

== Language and poetic style ==
In an interview published in the ''[[American Poetry Review]]'', Amichai spoke about his command of Hebrew:

<blockquote>I grew up in a very religious household ... So the prayers, the language of prayer itself became a kind of natural language for me ... I don't try—like sometimes poets do—to 'enrich' poetry by getting more cultural material or more ethnic material into it. It comes very naturally.<ref name=PoetryFoundation/></blockquote>

[[Robert Alter]] describes Amichai's poetry as a "play of sound". He "builds a strong momentum that moves in free association from word to word, the sounds virtually generating the words that follow in the [[syntactic]] chain through [[phonetic]] kinship".<ref>Alter, Robert (31 December 2008). [http://www.tnr.com/article/books/only-man "Only a Man"] ''The New Republic''.</ref>

Amichai's work was popular in English translation, but admirers of his poetry in the original Hebrew claim his innovative use of the language is lost in translation. Subtle layers of meaning achieved using an ancient word rather than its modern synonym to impart a biblical connotation cannot always be conveyed. In Amichai's love poem ''In the Middle of This Century'', for instance, the English translation reads: "the linsey-woolsey of our being together". The Hebrew term, ''[[shaatnez]]'', refers to the biblical taboo on interweaving linen and wool, which a Hebrew reader would grasp as an image of forbidden union.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/yehuda-amichai Yehuda Amichai biography]. Answers.com.</ref>

== Literary work ==
Amichai traced his beginnings as a poetry lover to when he was stationed with the British army in Egypt. There he happened to find an anthology of modern British poetry, and the works of Dylan Thomas, T. S. Eliot, and W. H. Auden. That book inspired his first thoughts about becoming a writer.

Literary scholar Boaz Arpaly wrote about the influence of biography on Amichai's poetry: "Literary criticism made the determination long ago that despite the autobiographical character of Amichai's poetry, the individual depicted in it is the typical Israeli everyman, and even in a wider sense, the individual as an individual of the twentieth century (a poetics that interweaves the private with the typically generic) ... Amichai routinely conflates biographical details from different times into one poetic framework, and exploits drafts and poetic ideas that were recorded in different periods, for a poem that would be written years later."<ref name=arpaly>Boaz Arpaly, "Yehuda Amichai- The Making of Israel's National Poet," ''[[Shofar (journal)|Shofar]]'', winter 2010 vol.28 No.2</ref> "Almost every poem by Amichai is a statement about the general human condition and Amichai, in a certain sense, is always a philosophical poet."<ref>Boaz Arpali: "The Flowers and the Urn" Amichai's Poetry – Structure, Meaning, Poetics, Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1986</ref>

He changed his name to Yehuda Amichai ("my people lives") around 1946. In her biography of Amichai,<ref name="upne">[http://www.upne.com/1-58465-733-2.html Nili Scharf Gold: '&#39;Yehuda Amichai, The Making of Israel’s National Poet'&#39;, Brandeis University Press]. Upne.com.</ref> literary critic [[Nili Rachel Scharf Gold|Nili Scharf Gold]] writes that the idea for the name change, as well as the name "Amichai", came from his girlfriend, Ruth Herrmann, who later moved to the United States and married Eric Zielenziger.<ref name=JewishQuarterlyReview>Feinstein, Elaine [http://jewishquarterly.org/2009/03/yehuda-amichai-the-making-of-israel%E2%80%99s-national-poet/ Nili Scharf Gold: '&#39;Yehuda Amichai, The Making of Israel’s National Poet']. ''Jewish Quarterly''.</ref> Contrary to Gold's claim, Amichai said in an interview that it was his idea to choose the name Amichai: "it was common at that time to change (foreign) names into Hebrew names ... 'Amichai' was a right name, because it was Socialist, Zionist and optimistic."<ref name=Interview>Dan Omer: In This Burning Country, An Interview with Amichai, Proza 1978</ref>

The only influence that the relationship with Herrmann had on his poetry is on one poem, "The Rustle of History's Wings, As They Used to Say", in which he wrote:

<blockquote>For five shillings I exchanged the exile name of my fathers for a proud Hebrew name that suited hers. That whore ran off to America and married a man, a spice dealer, pepper, cinnamon, and cardamom, leaving me with my new name and with the war.</blockquote>

Gold also believes that a childhood trauma in Germany affected Amichai's later poetry. She claims in her book that Amichai had an argument with a childhood friend, Ruth Hanover, which led to her cycling home angrily. Ruth was caught in a traffic accident, as a result of which she had to have a leg amputated, and Gold claims that Amichai felt guilt and responsibility.<ref name=JewishQuarterlyReview/> Ruth later was murdered in the [[Holocaust]]. Amichai occasionally referred to her in his poems as "Little Ruth". However, in Amichai's account of this episode in his journal, the accident happened some days after his dispute with Little Ruth, and there was no connection between the dispute and the accident:

<blockquote>I remember that in 1934 the little Ruth accident happened. Days before, we argued a little because I easily gave up the leading part of Yehuda Maccabi in the school show and the son of the headmaster got it. She argued that I had to fight more and not to give up immediately.<ref name="Amichai Yehuda 1990">Amichai Yehuda, Working Journal, 11.12. 1990, Beinecke Library, Yale University, Gen.Mss 572/</ref></blockquote>

In an interview Amichai said: "Little Ruth is my Anne Frank".  "I found out that she (Little Ruth) was in the last transport in 1944. This knowledge goes with me all the time, not because of guilt."<ref name="Interview"/> "If there is any guilty feeling it's like the guilt that soldiers feel when they survive the battle while their friends were killed."<ref name="Amichai Yehuda 1990"/>

Robert Alter wrote about Gold's contention: "Again and again Gold asks why Amichai did not represent his German childhood in his poetry, except fragmentarily and obliquely. The inconvenient fact that his major novel, ''Not of This time, Not of This Place'', devotes elaborate attention to Würzburg (which is given the fictional name Weinburg) is not allowed to trouble Gold's thesis of suppression, because the book is fiction, not poetry, and hence is thought somehow to belong to a different category in regard to the writer's relation to his early years. But Gold's notion of Amichai's 'poetics of camouflage' rests on an entirely unexamined assumption{{mdash}}that it is the task of the poet to represent his life directly and in full ..."<ref>Alter, Robert (31 December 2008), "Only A Man The New Republic".</ref> However, Gold argued that Amichai only wrote extensively about Würzburg in his novel because it was not his primary genre and therefore would be read by fewer people. Moreover, ''Not of This Time, Not of This Place'' does not hide the fact that it is based on Amichai's autobiography, including both his trip to his former hometown (and, explicitly, his search for closure about Little Ruth) and his affair with an American woman.<ref name="upne"/>

Contrary to Gold's argument, Amichi wrote many plays and radio plays,<ref>Yehuda Amichai, Bels and Trains, Shcken Israel, 1992</ref> a book of short stories,<ref>Yehuda Amichai, The World Is a Room and Other Stories. JPS 1984</ref> and a second novel,<ref>Yehuda, Amichai. Hotel in the Wilderness. Shocken,1971</ref> and he never said or wrote in any interview that he hoped that fewer people would read his prose.

Boaz Arpaly wrote: "Amichai did not hide in his poetry the fact that he was an immigrant and a son of immigrants, but he chose to tell the story of his childhood in his hometown, in his novel ''Not of This Time, Not of This Place'', and like any other writer, he decided which material of his life will become material to his poetry..."

:Did Amichai want to become a national poet? ... his poetry embodied a silent but piercing revolution against the social and political institutions that enslave the life and happiness of the individual for their need – He should bother so much to build for himself the mythology of a national poet? All the things that Gold thinks he was hiding were not in any contrast to the unique "nationality" embodied in his poetry. I did not find in Gold's book an explanation to the concept 'national poet' but in the first place, this concept appears in her book she is pointing to my article (1997) that says: "of all the poets who began to at the time of Amichai, or in later years, since Alterman there was not a poet more popular than Amichai. In this he is unique. He is probably the only canonic poet read by so many, also by people that do not belong to the Literary Community. In this matter he has no rivals. From this aspect, at least, he may be considered a national poet, a title that does not suit him from any other point of view ..." Gold's use of that title is not clear and not responsible.<ref name=arpaly /><ref>Boaz Arpaly, "Patuach Patuac", ''Haaretz'', 16 January 2009</ref>

== Critical acclaim ==
Amichai's poetry in English appeared in the first issue of ''Modern Poetry in Translation'', edited by Daniel Weissbort and [[Ted Hughes]] in 1965. In 1966 he appeared at the [[Spoleto]] poetry festival with [[Ezra Pound]], [[W.H. Auden]], [[Pablo Neruda]] and others. In 1968, he appeared at the London Poetry Festival. His first book in English, ''Selected Poems'' (1968), was translated by [[Assia Wevill|Assia Guttman]] (Hughes' lover and mother to his daughter Shura).<ref>Koren, Yehuda and Negev, Eilat ''A Lover of Unreason: the Life and Tragic Death of Assia Wevill'', Robson Books, London 2006</ref> Referring to him as "the great Israeli poet", Jonathan Wilson wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he is
:one of very few contemporary poets to have reached a broad cross-section without compromising his art. He was loved by his readers worldwide ... perhaps only as the Russians loved their poets in the early part of the last century. It is not hard to see why. Amichai's poems are easy on the surface and yet profound: humorous, ironic and yet full of passion, secular but God-engaged, allusive but accessible, charged with metaphor and yet remarkably concrete. Most of all, they are, like the speaking persona in his ''Letter of Recommendation,'' full of love: ''Oh, touch me, touch me, you good woman! / This is not a scar you feel under my shirt. / It is a letter of recommendation, folded, / from my father: / 'He is still a good boy and full of love.'<ref name="god-small-things"/>

In the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', Ted Hughes wrote: "I've become more than ever convinced that Amichai is one of the biggest, most essential, most durable poetic voices of this past century – one of the most intimate, alive and human, wise, humorous, true, loving, inwardly free and resourceful, at home in every human situation. One of the real treasures."<ref>''Times literary Supplement'', 9 January 1998.</ref>

In the ''New-Republic'', 3 July 2000, C. K. Williams wrote: "If there really is such a thing as wisdom, it might well reside in the character that a master such as Amichai can fashion for himself, and so for us".

In ''[[The American Poetry Review]]'', May–June 2016, David Biespiel wrote:
:He translates the hardness of existence into new tenderness; tenderness into spiritual wonder that is meant to quiet outrage; and outrage into a mixture of worry and love and warmth ... He is one of the great joyful lamenters of all time, endlessly documenting his anguish, throbbing pains, mistaken dreams, shortages of faith, abundances of ecstatic loves, and humiliations. And, like everyone else, he wants everything both ways. In particular, he wants to be a lover and a loner, a guy in the street and an intellectual, believer and infidel, while insisting that all manifestations of war against the human spirit be mercilessly squashed.<ref>''American Poetry Review'', May–June 2016</ref>

Paul Celan wrote to Amichai:
:What really belongs to you in your poems comes through with the most convincing, most conspicuous force. You are the poem you write, the poem you write is ... you yourself.--Right away I loaned the English selection of your work to my friend Andre du Bouchet, who writes poems as well, and to my great joy what had struck me came through to him too. Now this book is going round to other contributors and editors of the magazine L'Ephemere (I'm also among them). We'd be delighted to bring out a book of yours in French translation". (Letter to Amichai, 7 November 1969<ref>Amichai papers, Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscripts Library of Yale University</ref>)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ithl.org.il/amichai/more.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427110252/http://www.ithl.org.il/amichai/more.html |archive-date=27 April 2012}}</ref>

Octavio Paz:  "He is one of our great poets, a very accessible one. Once one has read his poems, one can never forget them - there can be so much life in sixteen lines. Yehuda Amichai is a master."{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Anthony Hecht said in 2000 that ''Open Closed Open'' "is as deeply spiritual a poem as any I have read in modern times, not excluding Eliot's Four Quartets, or anything to be found in the works of professional religionists. It is an incomparable triumph. Be immediately assured that this does not mean devoid of humor, or without a rich sense of comedy.".<ref>''The New York Review of Books'', 2 November 2000</ref> And:  "not only superb, but would, all by itself, have merited a Nobel Prize."<ref>''Selected Letters of Anthony Hecht'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013</ref>

Author [[Nicole Krauss]] has said that she was affected by Amichai from a young age.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Q&A With Nicole Krauss, Author of Great House and The History of Love|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elana-estrin/qa-with-nicole-krauss-aut_b_965230.html|website =Huffington Post|date = 15 September 2011|access-date = 2015-10-16}}</ref>

== Amichai Archive ==
Amichai sold his archive for over $200,000 to the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] of Yale University. The archive contains 1,500 letters received from the early 1960s to the early 1990s from dozens of Israeli writers, poets, intellectuals and politicians. Overseas correspondence includes letters from [[Ted Hughes]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Erica Jong]], [[Paul Celan]], and many others. The archive also includes dozens of unpublished poems, stories and plays; 50 notebooks and notepads with 1,500 pages of notes, poems, thoughts and drafts from the 1950s onward; and the poet's diaries, which he kept for 40 years. According to Moshe Mossek, former head of the [[Israel State Archive]], these materials offer priceless data about Amichai's life and work.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-holidays/rosh-hashanah/could-yehuda-amichai-s-priceless-archive-have-been-kept-in-israel-1.465119 Could Yehuda Amichai's priceless archive have been kept in Israel?]</ref><ref>In the Hebrew edition of 19 October 2012, the ''[[Haaretz]]'' editorial board apologized for the incorrect facts that were published in Mosek's article.</ref>
