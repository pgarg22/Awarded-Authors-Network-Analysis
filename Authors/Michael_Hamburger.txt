'''Michael Peter Leopold Hamburger''' {{postnom|country=GBR|OBE}} (22 March 1924 – 7 June 2007) was a noted German-British translator, poet, [[literary critic|critic]], memoirist and [[academia|academic]]. He was known in particular for his translations of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Paul Celan]], [[Gottfried Benn]] and [[W. G. Sebald]] from German, and his work in [[literary criticism]]. The publisher [[Paul Hamlyn]] (1926–2001) was his younger brother.

==Life and work==
Michael Hamburger was born in [[Berlin]] into a [[Jew]]ish family that left for the UK in 1933, and settled in London.  He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and served in the [[British Army]] from 1943 to 1947 in Italy and [[Austria]]. After that he completed his degree, and wrote for a time. He took a position at [[University College London]] in 1951, and then at the [[University of Reading]] in 1955. There followed many further academic positions in the UK and the US. Hamburger held temporary appointments in German at [[Mount Holyoke College]] (1966–7), the [[University at Buffalo|University of Buffalo]] (1969), [[Stony Brook University]] (1970), [[Wesleyan University]] (1971), the [[University of Connecticut]] (1972), the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]] (1973), the [[University of South Carolina]] (1973), and [[Boston University]] (1975 and 1977). He resettled permanently in England in 1978, the year he became a part-time professor at the [[University of Essex]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|last=Baker|first=William|date=2013|title=Hamburger, Michael Peter Leopold (1924–2007), poet, translator, and literary critic|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-98868|url-status=live|access-date=2021-02-21|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/98868}}</ref>

Hamburger published translations of many of the most important [[German language|German-language]] writers, particularly poets.  His work was recognised with numerous awards, including the [[Aristeion Prize]] in 1990, and the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1992. Hamburger lived in [[Middleton, Suffolk]], and appeared as a character in [[W. G. Sebald]]'s ''[[The Rings of Saturn]]''. A few months before his death he was visited by the artist [[Tacita Dean]], whose poignant film [https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dean-michael-hamburger-t12880 Michael Hamburger] focuses on the man and his home and the bonding of the man and his apple orchard.

Representative works included ''The Truth of Poetry'' (1968), a major work of criticism. His ''Collected Poems, 1941–1994'' (1995) drew on around twenty collections. Hamburger himself commented unhappily on the habit that reviewers have of greeting publication of his own poetry with a ritualised "Michael Hamburger, better known as a translator...". Perhaps ironically, his original poetry is better known in its German translations, by the Austrian poet and translator [[Peter Waterhouse (writer)|Peter Waterhouse]].<ref>[http://books.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2099883,00.html Michael Hamburger: Poet, translator and academic, more acclaimed in Germany than in Britain]</ref> He often commented on the literary life: the first edition of his autobiography came out with the title ''A Mug's Game'', a quotation from [[T. S. Eliot]], whom Hamburger greatly admired, and to whose sixtieth-birthday [[book|biblio]]-[[symposium]] he contributed an [[eponym]]ous poem of four [[stanzas]]<ref>Hamburger 1948, p. 178.</ref> which tells its own story.

Michael Hamburger was honoured with the [[Johann-Heinrich-Voß-Preis für Übersetzung]] in 1964 and with the [[Petrarca-Preis]] in 1992. He died on 7 June 2007 at his home in [[Suffolk]].
