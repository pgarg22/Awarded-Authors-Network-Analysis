== Biography ==
[[File:Antjie Krog 2021.jpg|thumb|Antjie Krog (2021)]]
Krog was born into an [[Afrikaner]] family of writers, and was the daughter of Afrikaans poet Dot Serfontein. She grew up on a farm in [[Kroonstad]], [[Orange Free State (province)|Orange Free State]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Vijoen|first=Louise|date=2009-03-01|title=Antjie Krog: Extended Biography|url=https://www.poetryinternational.org/pi/cou_article/29843/Antjie-Krog/en/tile|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Poetry International}}</ref> Her literary career began in 1970 when, at the height of [[John Vorster]]'s [[apartheid]] years, she wrote an anti-apartheid poem titled "My mooi land" ("My beautiful country") for her school magazine. The poem opened with the line, "''Kyk, ek bou vir my 'n land / waar 'n vel niks tel nie''" ("I'm building myself a country where skin colour doesn't matter").<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Garman|first=Anthea|date=February 2009|title=Antjie Krog, Self and Society: The Making and Mediation of a Public Intellectual in South Africa.|url=https://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/7957/Anthea%20Garman%20PhD%20Thesis%202009.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=McDonald|first=Peter|date=2020-09-01|title=An exchange with Antjie Krog|url=https://artefactsofwriting.com/2020/09/01/art-action-an-exchange-with-antjie-krog/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Art & Action (Artefacts of Writing)|language=en}}</ref> It caused a stir in her conservative [[Afrikaans]]-speaking community and was reported on in the national media.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kemp|first=Franz|date=1970-08-16|title=Dorp gons oor gedigte in skoolblad|page=5|work=Die Beeld}}</ref> Krog's first volume of poetry, ''Dogter van Jefta'' ("Daughter of Jephta"), was published shortly afterwards, while Krog was still just seventeen.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=Antjie Krog|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.za/author/antjie-krog|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Penguin Random House South Africa}}</ref> "My mooi land" was later translated by [[Ronnie Kasrils]] and published in the January 1971 issue of ''Secheba'', the official publication of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in London.

'''1980s: Poet and activist'''

In the 1980s and early 1990s, living with her husband and young children in Kroonstad, Krog taught at a black high school and teachers' college. In Kroonstad, she was politically active – attending ANC meetings and protests – and became involved with the [[Congress of South African Writers]], founded in 1987.<ref name=":3" /> She was invited to read a poem at a "Free [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]]" rally in the township of [[Maokeng]].<ref name=":3" /> Her [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-Apartheid]] activities during this period, and the hostility they evoked among conservative white locals, are the topic of her first work of prose, ''Relaas van 'n moord'' (1995; "Account of a Murder").<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last=Renders|first=Luc|date=June 2016|title=Antjie Krog: an unrelenting quest for wholeness|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03096564.2006.11730870?casa_token=MM6AeEHSv2MAAAAA:1uah_i5FxXYu1G3A2weYQVQmbpU3IHVb11PdSClnxFycdkc4MaJd4hNTkzQfDXFmet0a5avl5g5Vug|journal=Dutch Crossing|volume=30|issue=1|pages=43–62|doi=10.1080/03096564.2006.11730870|issn=0309-6564}}</ref>

'''1990s: Journalist at the ''TRC'''''

In 1993, Krog became editor of a now-defunct Afrikaans current-affairs journal, ''[[Die Suid-Afrikaan]]'' ("The South African").<ref name=":4" /> From 1995 to 2000, she was a radio journalist at the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC).<ref name=":1" /> She led the radio team that covered the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) from 1996 to 1998, and her reporting during this period became the basis of her second prose work, ''[[Country of My Skull]]'' (1998).<ref name=":8" /> Krog reported under her married name, Antjie Samuel.<ref name=":8" />

'''2000s–present: Author, academic, and public intellectual'''

In the past two decades, Krog has published three volumes of new poetry, four prose books and a book of essays, and several translations, including two from indigenous African languages. Krog also translated [[Nelson Mandela]]'s biography, ''[[Long Walk to Freedom]]'', into Afrikaans.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Krog|first=Antjie|date=2018|title=In his own words?|url=https://www.ciol.org.uk/his-own-words|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Chartered Institute of Linguists}}</ref> She regularly translates from Dutch into Afrikaans as a writing exercise.<ref name=":3" />

Following the publication of ''Country of My Skull'', Krog gave a series of lectures about the TRC in Europe and the United States.<ref name=":7" /> More recently, she taught a course on translation at [[Columbia University]]'s Institute for Comparative Literature and Society.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|title=Centre for Multilingualism and Diversities Research People: Research Fellows|url=https://www.uwc.ac.za/study/all-areas-of-study/centres/centre-for-multilingualism-and-diversities-research/people|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=University of the Western Cape|language=en}}</ref> She was writer-in-residence at the [[Dutch Foundation for Literature]] in early 2019, at [[Ghent University]] in 2020, and at [[Leiden University]] in autumn 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Antjie Krog as WiR in Amsterdam|url=http://www.letterenfonds.nl/en/entry/2228/antjie-krog-as-wir-in-amsterdam|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Nederlands Letterenfonds}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Antjie Krog writer in residence at Leiden University this autumn|url=https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2021/06/210607-antjie-krog-writer-in-residence|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Leiden University|language=en}}</ref> Since 2004, she has been Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of the Western Cape]] and a research fellow at its Centre for Multilingualism and Diversities Research, and she regularly publishes literary criticism.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":9" />

Krog is married to architect John Samuel.<ref name=":4" /> She has four children – Andries, Susan, Philip, and Willem – and several grandchildren.<ref name=":2" />

== Poetry ==
Krog published her first book of verse, ''Dogter van Jefta'' ("Daughter of Jephta"), in 1970. Since then she has published several further volumes. Her poetry is often autobiographical, involving reflections on love and the responsibilities of artists, and since the 1980s has often dealt with racial and gender politics.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":8" /> Krog has said that her sixth collection, ''Jerusalemgangers'' (1985), was the first to have "a complete political foundation."<ref name=":3" /> She writes mostly in free-verse.<ref name=":1" />



Krog's poetry is critically acclaimed in South Africa. She has won two [[Hertzog Prize]]s and several other national awards. Reviewing ''Kleur kom nooit alleen nie'' (2000), Leon de Kock wrote, "She messes with proprieties, both sexual and political... she refuses to give up trying to speak the voices of the land."<ref name=":5" /> In [[J. M. Coetzee|J.M. Coetzee]]'s novel ''[[Diary of a Bad Year]]'', the main character says the following of Krog: <blockquote>Her theme is a large one: historical experience in the South Africa of her lifetime. Her capacities as a poet have grown in response to the challenge, refusing to be dwarfed. Utter sincerity backed with an acute, feminine intelligence, and a body of heart-rending experience to draw upon... No one in Australia writes at a comparable white heat. The phenomenon of Antjie Krog strikes me as quite Russian. In South Africa, as in Russia, life may be wretched; but how the brave spirit leaps to respond!<ref>{{Cite book|last=Coetzee|first=J.M.|title=[[Diary of a Bad Year]]|publisher=Vintage|year=2008|pages=199}}</ref></blockquote>Her poetry has been translated into English, Dutch, French, and several other languages.<ref name=":1" /> It was first published in English in ''Down to My Last Skin'' (2000), by which time Krog had already won several prestigious South African literary awards.

== Prose and non-fiction ==
She is best known for her book ''[[Country of My Skull]]'' (1998), which is based on her experiences reporting on the TRC. It contains elements of both memoir and documentary, and was later dramatised in a [[In My Country (2004 film)|2004 film]] starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Juliette Binoche]]. ''A Change of Tongue'' (2003), Krog's second work of prose in English, reflects on the progress made – both in South Africa and in Krog's own life – since the [[1994 South African general election|first democratic elections in 1994]].<ref name=":8" /> A post-modern blend of fiction, poetry, and reportage, it weaves strands of autobiography with the stories of others to document struggles for identity, truth and salvation. The title of the book has political and private meanings: the diminishing role of Afrikaans in public discourse is reflected in her own flight into English as the vernacular of her work. Recounting the meetings she had with Mandela while translating his autobiography into Afrikaans, she reflects on her relationship with the Afrikaans language, which had come to be closely associated with [[Apartheid]]. ''Begging to be Black'' (2009) has a similar form and similar thematic concerns to Krog's earlier prose in English, and her publisher advertises it as the third in an unofficial trilogy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Begging To Be Black|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.za/book/begging-be-black/9781770220706|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Penguin Random House|language=en}}</ref>

''There Was This Goat: Investigating the Truth Commission Testimony of Notrose Nobomvu Konile'' (2009) is a work of academic non-fiction, co-written with Nosisi Mpolweni and Kopano Ratele. The book follows the authors' attempts to make sense of the experience of a single woman, whose TRC testimony about the death of her son, given in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], sounded strange and incomprehensible to those listening to the English interpretation.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|last=Basson|first=Adriaan|date=2009-06-05|title=The dream truths of Notrose Konile|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2009-06-05-the-dream-truths-of-notrose-konile/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Mail & Guardian|language=en-ZA}}</ref>
Krog's prose is influenced by the writing of [[J. M. Coetzee|J.M. Coetzee]] and [[Njabulo Ndebele]], as well as by various translated works from indigenous African languages, which together she says "saved [her] life":<blockquote>The African writings gave me access to a world-conception that I have lived with all my life, but was not really aware of (its radical profoundness, depth and beauty), while Coetzee gave me the tools to do meaningful dissections from it.<ref name=":3" /></blockquote>

== Play and theatre adaptations ==
Krog's only stage play, ''Waarom is dié wat voor toyi-toyi altyd so vet?'' ("Why are those who [[toyi-toyi]] in front always so fat?") was performed in 1999, opening at the Aardklop Arts Festival.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|date=2018-10-22|title=Antjie Krog (1952–)|url=https://www.litnet.co.za/antjiekrog-1952/|access-date=2021-11-06|website=LitNet}}</ref> The play was directed by Marthinus Basson. At the 1999/2000 FNB Vita Regional Theatre Awards (Bloemfontein), the production was nominated for seven awards, including Best Production and Best Script of a New South African Play.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2000-06-20|title=FNB Vita Regional Theatre Awards 1999/2000|url=http://www.artlink.co.za/news_article.htm?contentID=12868|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Artslink|language=en}}</ref> In Krog's words, the play is about "the effort of two races to get into a dialogue."<ref name=":8" />

Krog's Afrikaans translation of ''Mamma Medea'' by [[Tom Lanoye]] was staged in South Africa in 2002, also under Basson's direction.<ref name=":12" /> ''<nowiki/>'n Ander tongval'', the Afrikaans translation of her book ''A Change of Tongue,'' was adapted for the theatre by Saartjie Botha and staged in 2008 under the direction of Jaco Bouwer.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-07-31|title=Smorgabord of Afrikaans theatre|url=http://www.artlink.co.za/news_article.htm?contentID=6050|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Artslink|language=en}}</ref>

== Plagiarism allegation ==
In 2006, poet [[Stephen Watson (poet)|Stephen Watson]], then head of the English department at the [[University of Cape Town]], accused Krog of [[plagiarism]]. Writing in a literary review called ''New Contrast'', he said that ''Country of My Skill'' used phrases from [[Ted Hughes]]'s 1976 essay, "Myth and Education." Watson also claimed that the concept for ''Die sterre sê 'tsau','' a 2004 selection of indigenous poetry arranged and translated by Krog, had been ripped off from a similar collection he had published in 1991.<ref name=":13" /> Krog strongly denied the allegations, saying that she had not been aware of the Hughes essay until after she had published ''Country of My Skull'', and that she had properly credited her sources in ''Die sterre sê 'tsau'''.<ref name=":13">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/21/books.southafrica |title=South African author accused of plagiarism |last=Carroll |first=Rory |work=The Guardian  |date=21 February 2006 |access-date=15 June 2010}}</ref>
