==Biography==
Hichens was born in [[Speldhurst]] in Kent, the eldest son of the Rev. Frederick Harrison Hichens, and his wife Abigail Elizabeth Smythe.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=33851|first=Stacy|last=Gillis|title=Hichens, Robert Smythe}}</ref><ref>{{alox2|title=Hichens, Frederick Harrison}}</ref> He was educated at [[Clifton College]],<ref>"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p84: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948</ref> the [[Royal College of Music]] and early on had a desire to be a musician.<ref name=sutherland/> Later in life he would be a music critic on the ''World'', taking the place of [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref name=sutherland/> He studied at the [[London School of Journalism]]. Hichens was a great traveller. Egypt was one of his favourite destinations – he first went there in the early 1890s for his health.<ref name=sutherland/> For most of his later life he lived outside England, in Switzerland and the [[Riviera]].<ref name=sutherland/> Hichens was a homosexual;<ref name=denisoff>"Like Douglas and Turner, Hichens was sexually attracted to men". [[Dennis Denisoff]], ''Aestheticism and Sexual Parody 1840-1940''.Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2006 {{ISBN|0521024897}}, (p. 115).</ref> he never married.<ref name=sutherland/>

Hichens first novel, ''The Coastguard's Secret'' (1886), was written when he was only seventeen. He first became well known among the reading public with ''[[The Green Carnation]]'' (1894), a satire of Hichens's friends [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]; since the work made clear Wilde was homosexual it was withdrawn from publication in 1895,<ref name=sutherland/>  but not before helping set the stage for Wilde's public disgrace and downfall.<ref name=sutherland/><ref name=denisoff/>

Hichens was also friends with several other writers, including [[E. F. Benson]] and [[Reginald Turner (writer)|Reggie Turner]],<ref name=denisoff/> as well as the composer [[Maude Valérie White]].<ref>"White also had friends with several gay men including... the novelist Robert Hichens, whom she met in the late 1890s". Sophie Fuller and Lloyd Whitesell, ''Queer Episodes in Music and Modern Identity''. University of Illinois Press, 2002 {{ISBN|025202740X}}, (p. 90).</ref>

Hichens's first big success was ''[[An Imaginative Man]]'' (1895); set in the city of [[Cairo]], Egypt, a place which fascinated Hichens, it is a study of insanity, in which the hero has a number of sexual adventures and then smashes his head against the [[Great Sphinx]].<ref name=sutherland/> Other early fiction includes ''The Folly of Eustace'' (1896), a collection of stories including some supernatural;<ref name=sutherland/> ''Flames'' (1897), a story resembling ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'';<ref name=sutherland/> ''The Londoners'' (1898), a satire about decadent London;<ref name=sutherland/> ''[[The Slave (1899 novel)|The Slave]]'' (1899), a fantasy about an amazing emerald;<ref name=sutherland/> ''Tongues of Conscience'' (1900), a collection of five horror stories including "How Love Came to Professor Guildea" (this story is about a supernatural visitation and is thought by some to be Hichens's best fiction – it is frequently anthologised).<ref name=sutherland/><ref name=stableford/> "How Love Came to Professor Guildea" was not initially well-received, with [[Frederic Taber Cooper]] calling the story "a hideous bit of morbidity"<ref name=colavito>"Frederic T. Cooper", "Robert Hichens",in: Colavito, Jason, ed. ''A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008.  {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3968-3}}  (pp. 307–324). (Reprinted from Cooper's ''Some English Story Tellers'', 1912. pp. 342–375.)</ref> and [[Edmund Wilson]] dismissing the story as "trash".<ref name=colavito /> Later reviews of the story were more positive; [[J. A. Cuddon]] called it "outstanding" and compared it with "[[The Horla]]" by [[Guy de Maupassant]] and "The Beckoning Fair One" by [[Oliver Onions]].<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''The Penguin Book of Horror Stories''. London, Bloomsbury. {{ISBN|978-1-870630-94-8}} (p. 44)</ref> [[Brian Stableford]] described the story as an "authentic masterpiece of horror fiction",<ref name=stableford/> and [[Jason Colavito]] called it "possibly one of the greatest stories of its age".<ref name=colavito/>

Hichens's ''Felix'' (1902), is an early fictional treatment of hypodermic morphine addiction, while ''[[The Garden of Allah (novel)|The Garden of Allah]]'' (1904) sold well internationally,<ref name=sutherland/> and was made into a film three times.

Hichens published his memoirs in 1947, ''Yesterday''.
