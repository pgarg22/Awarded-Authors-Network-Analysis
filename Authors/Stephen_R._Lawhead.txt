==Biography==
He was born to Robert Eugene Lawhead and Lois Rowena Bissell Lawhead at Good Samaritan Hospital, [[Kearney, Nebraska]]. In 1968, Lawhead graduated from [[Kearney High School (Kearney, Nebraska)|Kearney High School]] and entered [[Kearney State College]] as an Art major. In 1969, while at Kearney State College, he wrote a weekly humour column for the [[college newspaper]] and was a frequent contributor of poetry and [[short story|short stories]] to ''The Shore Anthology'' and ''The Antler''. He paid his way through college largely through playing lead guitar in a college rock band named Mother Rush. Lawhead met Alice Slaikeu in 1971, and married her in 1972. He graduated from Kearney State College in 1973 with BA in Art and then went on to enroll in [[Northern Baptist Theological Seminary]]. During this time Lawhead also enrolled in a number of writing courses at nearby [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]. His professional writing career began with five busy years as an editor and staff writer for Campus Life magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=God in the life of Stephen Lawhead|url=https://www.oxford.anglican.org/stephen-lawhead/|website=Diocese of Oxford|publisher=Diocese of Oxford|access-date=5 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Author|url=http://www.stephenlawhead.com/the-author|website=Stephen R. Lawhead|access-date=5 March 2018}}</ref> In 1980, Lawhead became the manager of the successful [[Christian rock]] act [[DeGarmo and Key]] and formed his own record company, Ariel Records.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://unknews.unk.edu/2003/12/02/stephen-lawhead-award-winning-author-and-unk-alumnus-is-winter-commencement-speaker/|title = STEPHEN LAWHEAD, AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR AND UNK ALUMNUS, IS WINTER COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER|date = 2 December 2003|access-date = 26 May 2015|publisher = University of Nebraska at Kearney}}</ref> The demise of Ariel Records in 1981 prompted the beginning of Lawhead's fiction-writing career.

In 1981, Lawhead began to author novels, initially fantasy and science fiction, completing his first trilogy, the "Dragon King trilogy". In 1986, he moved to [[Oxford]], [[England]] to do research for [[Pendragon Cycle|The Pendragon Cycle]], a reinterpretation of the legend of [[King Arthur]] in a [[Celt]]ic setting combined with elements of [[Atlantis]]. Heavily rooted in the original Celtic source material which gave rise to the later and more familiar versions of the [[Arthurian legend]], the series has received critical acclaim for its creative retelling of the Arthur legend and historical credibility.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2010/08/conundrum-of-stephen-lawhead-catholic.html | title=The Conundrum of Stephen Lawhead | author=Bradley J. Birzer |author-link=Bradley J. Birzer | website=[[The Imaginative Conservative]]}}</ref>

The first book in the series, ''Taliesin'', won the [[Evangelical Christian Publishers Association]]'s Gold Medallion Award for Fiction in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Christian Book Expo: 1988 Gold Medallion Book Awards Winners|url = http://www.christianbookexpo.com/christianbookawards/gm1988.php|website = www.christianbookexpo.com|access-date = 2015-05-27}}</ref> Lawhead's research for The Pendragon Cycle sparked an interest in Celtic history and culture, especially [[Celtic Christianity]], topics which have featured prominently in his work ever since.

"The [[Song of Albion]]" trilogy prompted a return to England (Lawhead having left in 1987). This was a series of books set between the [[Celtic Otherworld]] and present-day [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1990s, he published ''[[Byzantium]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=James|first=Marion|title='Byzantium' by Steven R.

In 2006, he published ''[[King Raven Trilogy|Hood]]'', the first book in the ''[[King Raven Trilogy]]'' – a retelling of the [[Robin Hood]] legend, transferred to [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Jane|title=The truth about Robin Hood|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-truth-about-robin-hood-20100528-wkyy.html|access-date=11 January 2011|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 May 2010}}</ref> In 2008, the second book in the trilogy, ''Scarlet'', won a [[Christy Award]] in the category of Visionary Fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.christyawards.com/ca_new/images/stories/client_pdf/00-10_WinnersFinalists.pdf|title = 2001-2010 Christy Awards Winners & Finalists|date = 26 May 2015|access-date = 26 May 2015|website = The Christy Awards|publisher = The Christy Awards|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120124031909/http://www.christyawards.com/ca_new/images/stories/client_pdf/00-10_WinnersFinalists.pdf|archive-date = 24 January 2012|df = dmy-all}}</ref>
