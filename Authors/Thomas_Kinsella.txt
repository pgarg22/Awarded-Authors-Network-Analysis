'''Thomas Kinsella''' (born 4 May 1928) is an Irish poet, translator, editor, and publisher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Kinsella|title = Thomas Kinsella &#124; Biography, Books, Poetry, & Facts}}</ref>

==Early life and work==
Kinsella was born in [[Inchicore]], [[Dublin]], [[Irish Free State]].<ref>Andrew Fitzsimons, ''The Sea of Disappointment: Thomas Kinsella's Pursuit of the Real'' (UCD Press, 2008), p. 15.</ref> He spent most of his childhood in the [[Kilmainham]]/Inchicore area of Dublin. He was educated at the Model School, Inchicore, where classes were taught in the [[Irish language]], and at the [[O'Connell School]]s in North Richmond Street, Dublin. His father and grandfather both worked in [[Guinness]]'s Brewery.<ref>Fitzsimons, ''The Sea of Disappointment'', p. 156.</ref> He entered [[University College Dublin]] in 1946, initially to study science. After a few terms in college, he took a post in the [[Irish civil service]] in the Department of Finance and continued his university studies at night, having switched to humanities and arts.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/kinsellas-wife-reveals-her-hurt-at-the-poets-words-of-love-26522803.html Byrne, Andrea. "Kinsella's wife reveals her hurt at the poet's words of love", Independent.ie, 22 March 2009]</ref>

Kinsella's first poems were published in the University College Dublin magazine ''National Student''. His first pamphlet, '' The Starlit Eye'' (1952), was published by Liam Miller's [[Dolmen Press]], as was ''Poems'' (1956), his first book-length publication. These were followed by ''Another September'' (1958), ''Moralities'' (1960), ''Downstream'' (1962), ''Wormwood'' (1966), and the long poem ''Nightwalker'' (1967).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2020-09-08|title=Thomas Kinsella|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/thomas-kinsella|access-date=2020-09-09|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref>

Marked as it was by the influence of [[W. H. Auden]] and dealing with a primarily urban landscape and with questions of romantic love, Kinsella's early work marked him as distinct from the mainstream of Irish poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, which tended to be dominated by the example of [[Patrick Kavanagh]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Her Vertical Smile|isbn=0948463007|last1=Kinsella|first1=Thomas|year=1985}}</ref>

He received the Honorary Freedom of the City of Dublin in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dublincity.ie/image/libraries/foc076-thomas-kinsella| title=Dublin Artists receive Honorary Freedom | access-date=2008-01-27 }}</ref>

He taught the Irish Tradition Programme at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trinity College Dublin School of English Year Book|url=https://www.tcd.ie/OWC/assets/pdf/MPIW%20Course%20Handbook%202019-2020.pdf|access-date=2020-09-10|website=tcd.ie}}</ref>

The composer and member of [[Aosdána]], [[John Kinsella (composer)|John Kinsella]] (1932–2021), was his brother.

In December 2018, he was awarded Doctor in Litteris, Honoris Causa, by the University of Dublin ([[Trinity College Dublin]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/registrar/honorary-degrees/2018-19/|title=Registrar : Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin, Ireland|website=www.tcd.ie|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

==Translations and editing==
At Miller's suggestion, Kinsella turned his attention to the translation of early Irish texts. He produced versions of ''Longes Mac nUislenn'' and ''The Breastplate of St Patrick'' in 1954 and of ''Thirty-Three Triads'' in 1955. His most significant work in this area was collected in two important volumes. The first of these was '' The Táin'', (Dolmen 1969 and Oxford 1970), a version of the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' illustrated by [[Louis le Brocquy]].

The second major work of translation was an anthology of Irish poetry ''An Duanaire: 1600-1900, Poems of the Dispossessed'' (1981), translated by Kinsella and edited by [[Seán Ó Tuama]]. He also edited [[Austin Clarke (poet)|Austin Clarke]]'s ''Selected Poems'' and ''Collected Poems'' (both 1974) for Dolmen and ''The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse'' (1986).

==Later poetry==

In 1965, Kinsella left the civil service to become writer in residence at [[Southern Illinois University]], and in 1970 he became a professor of English at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]]. While at Temple, he developed a program for students to study in Ireland called "the Irish Experience".

In 1972, he started [[Peppercanister Press]] to publish his own work. The first Peppercanister production was ''Butcher's Dozen'', a satirical response to the [[Widgery Tribunal]] into the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]. This poem drew on the ''[[aisling]]'' tradition and specifically on [[Brian Merriman]]'s ''Cúirt An Mheán Óiche''. Kinsella's interest in the publishing process dates back at least as far as helping set the type for '' The Starlit Eye'' 20 years earlier.

In the Peppercanister poems, Kinsella's work ceased to be Audenesque and became more clearly influenced by American modernism, particularly the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Robert Lowell]]. In addition, the poetry started to focus more on the individual psyche as seen through the work of [[Carl Jung]]. These tendencies first appeared in the poems of '' Notes from the Land of the Dead'' (1973) and ''One'' (1974).

In the 1980s, books such as ''Her Vertical Smile'' (1985) ''Out of Ireland'' (1987) and ''St Catherine's Clock'' (1987) marked a move away from the personal to the historical. This continued into a sometimes darkly satirical focus on a contemporary landscape through the late 1980s and 1990s in such books as ''One Fond Embrace'' (1988), ''Personal Places'' (1990), ''Poems From Centre City'' (1990) and ''The Pen Shop'' (1996). His ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 1996 and again in an updated edition in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas Kinsella Poetry Irish culture and customs - World Cultures European|url=https://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/Poetry/Kinsella.html|access-date=2020-09-09|website=www.irishcultureandcustoms.com}}</ref>
