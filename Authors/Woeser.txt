==Biography==
Woeser, a quarter Han Chinese and three quarters Tibetan, was born in [[Lhasa]]. Her grandfather, Chinese, was an officer in the [[Nationalist Army]]{{clarify|date=November 2019}} of the [[Kuomintang]] and her father was a high rank Army officer in the [[People's Liberation Army]]. 
When she was very young, her family relocated to the [[Kham]] area of western [[Sichuan]] province. In 1988, she graduated from [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu]] with a degree in [[Chinese literature]]. She worked as a reporter in [[Kardzé]] and later in Lhasa and has lived in Beijing since 2003 as a result of political problems. Woeser is married to [[Wang Lixiong]], a renowned author who frequently writes about Tibet. According to [[Reporters sans frontières]], "Woeser is one of the few Tibetan authors and poets to write in Chinese."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=18427 |title=Reporters sans frontières - China |publisher=En.rsf.org |access-date=2014-08-08}}</ref> When the government refused to give her a passport, she sued the authorities.<ref name="herald23082008">[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223222414/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/23/asia/AS-FEA-Tibets-Lone-Voice.php ''Tibetan writer, a rare outspoken voice against Beijing's policies, sues Chinese government''] Herald Tribune July 23, 2008 p. 1 (iht.com)</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Tsering Woeser.webm|thumb|262x262px|Video to honor Woeser by the [[Prince Claus Fund]] for her 2011 award]]
Woeser is the author of the book, ''Notes on Tibet'' ({{zh|labels=no|s=西藏笔记 |p=Xīzàng Bǐjì}}). The Tibet Information Network quotes unnamed sources that the book was banned by the government around September 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2004&m=3&p=16_2 |title=TAR Authorities Ban Book by Tibetan Author (TIN) |publisher=Tibet.ca |access-date=2014-08-08}}</ref>

According to [[UNPO]], shortly after the alleged ban, Woeser was also fired from her job and lost her status with her [[work unit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=1371 |title=Tibet: China persecuting Tibetan Writer for Pro-Dalai Lama Opinion |publisher=Unpo.org |date=2004-10-28 |access-date=2014-08-08}}</ref> [[Radio Free Asia]] reported that she continued to post a variety of poems and articles to her two blogs: Maroon Map ({{zh|labels=no|s=绛红色的地图}}, ''oser.tibetcul.net''), which, according to the author, was visited primarily by Tibetans and the Woeser blog ''(blog.daqi.com/weise)'', which was visited primarily by those of [[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnicity. According to RFA, on July 28, 2006, both blogs were closed by order of the government, apparently in response to postings in which she expressed birthday greetings to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and touched on other sensitive topics. Woeser stated that she would continue writing and speaking.<ref>{{cite web
