'''John Henley Heathcote-Williams''' (15 November 1941 – 1 July 2017), known as '''Heathcote Williams''', was an English poet, actor, political activist and dramatist.<ref name="Harding" /> He wrote a number of book-length polemical poems including ''Autogeddon'', ''Falling for a Dolphin'' and ''Whale Nation'', which in 1988 was described by [[Philip Hoare]] as "the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on [[whaling]]."<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news|last=Hoare|first=Philip|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/troubled-waters-did-we-really-save-the-whale-935193.html|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=20 September 2008|title=Troubled waters: Did we really save the whale?}}</ref> Williams invented his idiosyncratic "documentary/investigative poetry" style which he put to good purpose bringing a diverse range of environmental and political matters to public attention.

In June 2015 he published a book-length investigative poem about the "Muslim Gandhi", [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], "Badshah Khan".<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Rogers|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/paul-rogers/islam-and-nonviolence-badshah-khan's-example|title=Islam and non-violence: Badshah Khan's example|publisher=Open Democracy|date=27 May 2015}}</ref>

As well as being a playwright and screenwriter, Williams appeared in a number of independent and Hollywood films and was among the celebrity guests in the last episode of season 4 of ''[[Friends]]'', '[[The One with Ross's Wedding|"The One With Ross's Wedding"]]'. He played [[Prospero]] in [[Derek Jarman]]'s ''[[The Tempest (1979 film)|The Tempest]]'' (1979) and appeared in several "[[arthouse]]" films, including ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'' (1992), as well as Hollywood movie ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]'' (2006).<ref name="Harding" /> [[Al Pacino]] played the part of a Williams fan in a spoof arts documentary, ''Every Time I Cross the Tamar I Get into Trouble''. Williams also wrote lyrics, collaborating with [[Marianne Faithfull]] among others.

Williams was a keen naturalist and discovered a new species of honey-producing wasp in the [[Pampas|Argentine pampas]], an event he recorded in a book of poems called ''Forbidden Fruit''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huxleyscientific.com/books/forbidden-fruit/|title=Huxley Scientific Press}}</ref> Williams was a magician and a member of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]]. He wrote a TV play called ''What the Dickens!'' about [[Charles Dickens]]'s penchant for performing magic shows. [[Bob Hoskins]] taught him fire eating. When he went to demonstrate his new found talent to then girlfriend [[Jean Shrimpton]], he accidentally set himself alight on her doorstep.

Williams was a leading activist in the London squatting scene in the 1970s and ran a squatters "estate agency" called the "Ruff Tuff Cream Puff". In 1977 he and a couple of hundred fellow squatters established the "state" of [[Frestonia]] in Notting Hill and declared independence from Britain. The then Shadow Chancellor, [[Geoffrey Howe]], wrote to express his support and Williams was appointed UK Ambassador. Frestonia lasted almost a decade and had its own institutions and postage stamps.
 
Williams spray-painted graffiti on the walls of [[Buckingham Palace]] as a protest against the Queen signing [[Michael X]]'s death warrant while there was no capital punishment in the UK. In the early 1970s, his agitational [[graffiti]] were a feature on the walls of the then low-rent end of London's [[Notting Hill]] district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portobellofilmfestival.com/talkpics/talk-vague06.html |title=PFF 2005 |publisher=Portobellofilmfestival.com |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> The final paragraph of Williams' ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary summed up his philosophy: "If poetry isn't revolutionary, it's nothing," he told Saira Viola from the web publication Gonzo Today in 2015. "Poetry is heightened language, and language exists to effect change, not to be a tranquilizer."<ref name="nyt2017">{{cite news|last1=Grimes|first1=William|title=Heathcote Williams, Radical British Poet Who Helped Form Anarchist Nation, Dies at 75|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/books/heathcote-williams-radical-british-poet-who-helped-form-anarchist-nation-dies-at-75.html|access-date=24 July 2017|work=The New York Times|date=5 July 2017}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
John Henley Heathcote-Williams was born in [[Helsby]], Cheshire. After his schooldays at [[Eton College|Eton]], he changed his name to Heathcote Williams. His father, [[Harold Heathcote-Williams]], was a barrister (appointed [[Queen's Counsel]])<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/2ef92fbe-623a-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/93/Heathcote-Williams.html |title=Heathcote Williams Biography (1941–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=15 November 1941 |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> and his mother, (Margaret) Julian (née Henley) a clergyman's daughter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jul/02/heathcote-williams-obituary|title=Heathcote Williams obituary|date=2 July 2017}}</ref> His first book was ''The Speakers'' (1964), an account of life at [[Speakers' Corner]] in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], written when he was just 22 years old. ''The Speakers'' attracted enthusiastic reviews, with [[Harold Pinter]] describing it as "brilliant... a remarkable achievement and very, very funny". In 1974, it was adapted for the stage by the [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]].

His first full-length play, ''AC/DC'' (1970), first staged at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], is a critique of the burgeoning mental health industry; it includes a thinly veiled attack on 1960s [[Counterculture|alternative society]], and the proponent of the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, [[R. D. Laing|R.D. Laing]]. Its production did not, however, appear to impede cordial relations between the two men in later years. ''AC/DC'' won the London ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s Most Promising Play Award. It also received the 1972 [[John Whiting Award]] for being "a new and distinctive development in dramatic writing with particular relevance to contemporary society." It was described in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' in a front-page review by [[Charles Marowitz]] as "the first play of the 21st century." ''AC/DC'' was produced in New York City in 1971 at the [[Chelsea Theater Center]] at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

Other plays include the one-act monologue ''Hancock's Last Half Hour'', ''[[The Local Stigmatic]]'', ''The Immortalist'' and the impossible to categorise ''Remember The Truth Dentist'' – an early effort, again at the Royal Court, directed by [[Ken Campbell]].

The inaugural issue of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' included an effusive profile by fellow Etonian [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] titled ''The Magic of Heathcote Williams''.

==Poetry==
Williams had often been reluctant to co-operate in the promotion of his work commercially, refusing, for example, to go to the US to promote ''AC/DC'', to the despair of his publishers. The only book signing tour he has ever done{{spaced ndash}} "enough," he complained, "to cripple a rock-star"{{spaced ndash}}was the result of relentless pressure from [[Jonathan Cape]]'s PR department.

Energetic publicity efforts on Williams' behalf, the responsibility of Cape's [[Polly Samson]], enabled him to reach a wider audience for his trilogy of book-length poems on environmental themes. Each of them was the result of detailed research and featured many photographs. Written some years earlier as visionary propaganda, they had otherwise been gathering dust in a corner of his then agent's office. The North American rights for the poem ''Whale Nation'' (1988) were sold at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] for $100,000; Williams donated his share of the advance to environmental organizations. According to another writer on this subject, [[Philip Hoare]] in 2008, it is an "epic plea for the future of the whale, a hymn to the beauty, majesty and intelligence of the largest mammals on earth, as well as a prayer for their protection... ''Whale Nation'' became the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling, and for a moment, back in 1988, it seemed as if a shameful chapter in human history might finally be drawing to a close.".<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

''Whale Nation'' was followed by ''Sacred Elephant'' (1989), which deals with the devastation of the natural environment, and ''Autogeddon'' (1991), which characterises the motor car's global death toll as, "A humdrum holocaust, the third world war nobody bothered to declare."<ref name="Harding" /> Each poem was made into a film by [[BBC Television]], ''Autogeddon'' being performed by [[Jeremy Irons]]. Williams' public readings of ''Whale Nation'' reduced some members of the audience to tears.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=http://www.recrea.org/rrf/whale_nation-at_the_hands_of_man.mp3 |title=Audio recording. |access-date=22 April 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210357/http://www.recrea.org/rrf/whale_nation-at_the_hands_of_man.mp3 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His recordings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/artistinfo/bio3745.htm |title=Heathcote Williams- Bio, Albums, Pictures – Naxos Classical Music |publisher=Naxos.com |date=25 June 2011 |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> for [[Naxos Records]], which include readings from the [[Buddhist scriptures]], [[Dante]] and the Bible, have won awards.

In 2011, Williams began a new collaboration with Roy Hutchins, who had performed ''Whale Nation'', ''Autogeddon'' and ''Falling for a Dolphin'' in the 1980s. The result was ''Zanzibar Cats'', a performance of recent short poems. In ''What's on Stage'', the reviewer [[Michael Coveney]] wrote: "These wonderful poems seize on political absurdity, planetary destruction and social injustice with relish and delight, as well as great erudition and verbal dexterity."<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Coveney |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/reviews/theatre/edinburgh/E8831313236414/Zanzibar+Cats.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209052714/http://www.whatsonstage.com/reviews/theatre/edinburgh/E8831313236414/Zanzibar+Cats.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 February 2013 |title=Zanzibar Cats by Heathcote Williams Reviews at Gilded Balloon Teviot – Edinburgh |publisher=Whatsonstage.com |date=13 August 2011 |access-date=31 October 2011 }}</ref>

In December 2011, Huxley Scientific Press published a collection of poems by Williams on science and nature entitled ''Forbidden Fruit''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huxleyscientific.com/books/forbidden-fruit/ |title=Forbidden Fruit |publisher= Huxley Scientific Press}}</ref> The title poem is an elegy for mathematician, computer pioneer, and wartime codebreaker [[Alan Turing]], the centenary of whose birth occurred in 2012. The [[Beat poetry|Beat poet]] [[Michael McClure]] called the book "a collection of inspirations … as rich and dark as wasp honey". At the end of 2012, Huxley Scientific Press published ''Shelley at Oxford: Blasphemy, Book-Burning, and Bedlam'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huxleyscientific.com/books/shelley/ |title=Shelley at Oxford|publisher= Huxley Scientific Press}}</ref> written by Williams during the bicentenary of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley's]] expulsion from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] for [[atheism]], aged 19.

Williams regularly published new work on the digital, resurrected [[International Times]]. ''Royal Babylon: The Criminal Record of the British Monarchy'' was made into a video installation by the filmmaker collective Handsome Dog, to coincide with [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s diamond jubilee, and his poems ''Lord of the Drones: The President and the White House Fly'', ''Hollywoodland'', and ''Was Moby Dick Behind 9/11?'' (2012) are currently{{when|date=September 2019}} being edited into a trilogy—''Autopsy: The American Empire Dissected''.

In June 2015, 'Badshah Khan: Islamic Peace Warrior' was published by [[Thin Man Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinmanpress.com/forthcoming-publications/badshah-khan-islamic-peace-warrior-by-heathcote-williams/|title=Badshah Khan: Islamic Peace Warrior by Heathcote Williams|date=1 January 2015}}</ref> Williams's "poetic investigation" reviews the life and legacy of [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (1890–1988).

Williams's riposte to the election of President [[Donald Trump]], ''American Porn'', was published by Thin Man Press on 20 January, Trump's inauguration day.<ref name="Harding" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://madammiaow.blogspot.com/2017/02/review-heathcote-williams-american-porn-trump.html|title=Madam Miaow Says: Heathcote Williams' American Porn poetry collection: balancing passion and disgust on a razor's edge — review|first=Madam|last=Miaow|date=24 February 2017|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

==Political pamphlets==
In 2016, Williams responded to contemporary political events with a pamphlet in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftean]] tradition, an excoriating commentary on [[Boris Johnson]] entitled 'The Blond Beast of Brexit: a Study in Depravity'. The pamphlet was described by a review as "a 20,000-word collage of the most maniacal, hypocritical, and cruel things the former mayor has ever said or done".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/back-with-a-vengeance-heathcote-williams-s-latest-work-is-a-lacerating-attack-on-boris-johnson-a7054891.html|title=Back with a vengeance: Heathcote Williams's latest work is a lacerating attack on Boris Johnson|date=29 May 2016|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

Later that year, an updated and expanded version, 'Brexit Boris: From Mayor to Nightmare', was published by Public Reading Rooms.<ref name="Harding">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/02/heathcote-williams-radical-poet-playwright-actor-dies-aged-75|title=Heathcote Williams: radical poet, playwright and actor, dies aged 75|first=Luke|last=Harding|author-link=Luke Harding|date=2 July 2017|access-date=2 July 2017|via=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://internationaltimes.it/brexit-boris-from-mayor-to-nightmare/|title=Brexit Boris – From Mayor to Nightmare - IT|website=internationaltimes.it|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

==Painting and sculpture==
Williams's second bout of fame caused him to cease writing in effect, and turn to painting and sculpture full-time. Leading the life of a would-be recluse, he received prolonged tuition from the 'New Ruralist'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruralists.com/ |title=The Brotherhood of Ruralists Information Website – Homepage |publisher=Ruralists.com |date=18 September 2011 |access-date=31 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927180018/http://ruralists.com/ |archive-date=27 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> artist [[Graham Ovenden]], at the latter's home on the edge of [[Bodmin Moor]], Cornwall. The result was an out-pouring of hundreds of canvases, including satirical pastiches of the works of [[Van Gogh]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Lucian Freud]] and others. He also produced a number of sculptures of great piles of books, tottering and damp-swollen, elaborately hand-carved in wood.

==Song-writing==
Williams's occasional but typically anarchistic forays into the realm of lyric-writing include the uncategorisable and unreleased "Wrinkly Bonk", and "Why D'Ya Do It?", a sexually explicit exploration of carnal jealousy, for [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s 1979 classic album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|nH6bAMKA5fU|Marianne Faithfull – Why d'ya do it (live)<!-- Bot generated title -->}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> Williams's words were enough to cause a walk-out by the female workers on [[EMI]]'s production line.

==Magazines==
Williams was for a time associate editor of the literary journal ''[[Transatlantic Review (1959)|Transatlantic Review]]'', as well as being one of those responsible for the alternative sex paper ''Suck.'' He was a frequent contributor to the London underground paper ''[[International Times]]'' during the 1970s, to the radical vegetarian magazine ''Seed'' and to ''The Fanatic'', issues of which would appear sporadically and provocatively in different formats and various countries of Western Europe. In 1974, he launched his own mimeographed underground newspaper, ''The Sunday Head''. It was published from his home in [[Notting Hill Gate]], London at the time when he was also the [[impresario]] for Albion Free State's Meat Roxy, a series of music, dance and poetry events held in a squatted, redundant bingo hall near the [[Portobello market]].

An anthology of his tracts and manifestos from this period, ''Severe Joy'', was announced by his then publisher but for some reason never actually appeared. A sampling did appear in a bi-lingual, limited edition titled ''Manifestoes'' from the [[Rotterdam]]-based Cold Turkey Press as well as in the [[Manchester]] literary magazine ''Wordworks'' in 1975.

==Film==
The theme of Williams' early one-act play ''The Local Stigmatic'' is fame and its adverse consequences, performed by [[Al Pacino]] at an [[Off-Off-Broadway]] venue, with financial assistance from [[Jon Voight]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/33/articles/1363|title=Pacino on Local Stigmatic and Heathcote Williams|publisher=bombsite.com|date=Fall 1990 |access-date=23 March 2013}}</ref> In later years the film version became known as 'Pacino's secret project,' his debut as a director. It was finally released as part of the ''Pacino: An Actor's Vision'' box-set in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviesunlimited.com/musite/product.asp?sku=D74951 |title=Buy Movies at Movies Unlimited – The Movie Collector's Site |publisher=Moviesunlimited.com |access-date=31 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618214157/http://www.moviesunlimited.com/musite/product.asp?sku=D74951 |archive-date=18 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Williams' own film performances include [[Prospero]] in [[Derek Jarman]]'s version of ''[[The Tempest (1979 film)|The Tempest]]'' (1979),<ref name="Harding" /> ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 movie)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1987), ''[[Stormy Monday (film)|Stormy Monday]]'' (1988), Sally Potter's ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'' (1992),<ref name="Harding" /> ''[[The Browning Version (1994 film)|The Browning Version]]'' (1994), ''[[The Steal (film)|The Steal]]'' (1995), ''[[Blue Juice]]'' (1995) with [[Catherine Zeta Jones]], ''[[Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis]]'' (1997), ''[[The Odyssey (miniseries)|The Odyssey]]'' (1997), ''[[Cousin Bette (film)|Cousin Bette]]'' (1998), ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'' (1998) and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1999 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1999). Williams also appeared in ''[[Hotel (2001 film)|Hotel]]'' (2001) with [[Salma Hayek]], which he also co-wrote, and enjoyed a steady stream of bit-parts in big-budget Hollywood productions, such as the ill-fated ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]'' (2006) and ''[[City of Ember]]'' (2008).

==Television==
[[File:Peoples Hall Frestonia.JPG|thumb|right|The National Theatre of [[Frestonia]]: by day it was the People's Hall, focal point for the independence movement. It staged Williams's one-act play ''The Immortalist'', in which [[David Rappaport]] interviewed a 278-year-old man. In a later [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] production the TV personality [[Joan Bakewell]] played the incredulous interviewer.]]

Williams' contact with television overlapped with his activity in community politics. In a 1970s experiment by the BBC in public access television Williams, in the guise of a tree, spoke for fifteen minutes on the virtues of life unencumbered by the rule of [[Houses of Parliament|Westminster]]. Albion Free State was his name for a [[utopian]] vision of an England free from government and bosses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPmkFKRWgtA |title=The A-Z of TV Hell Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> Williams was one of 120 or so [[squatters]] who had commandeered a small chunk of West London, just about visible from <!-- Name change in 2014 is not applicable here. -->[[BBC Television Centre]] itself. [[Frestonia]], as the extensive squat was known, had declared itself independent of [[UK|Great Britain]]. The actor [[David Rappaport]] was proclaimed Foreign Minister and Williams served as ambassador to the UK. Postage stamps were issued bearing the face of [[Guy the Gorilla]] instead of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]; they made no mention of currency, but simply carried the legend, ''God Will Provide''. The project, which exasperated the authorities for years, provoked much litigation before the bulldozers were finally able to move in.

Williams later applied his abilities as a conjurer{{spaced ndash}}he was a member of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]]{{spaced ndash}}to come up with a Christmas play based on [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] enthusiasm for performing magic shows for his friends and extended family. ''What the Dickens!'' depicted the novelist, with the likes of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[William Thackeray|Thackeray]] standing by to assist, as he manipulated "airy nothings" and assorted props to the delighted squeals of foundling children from the [[Thomas Coram]] Home. The production featured a young [[Ben Cross]] as Dickens, with a supporting cast that included [[Dinsdale Landen]] and [[Kenneth Haigh]]. It was broadcast by [[Channel 4]] in Christmas 1983, with a repeat screening the following Christmas.

In July 1988 Williams made an [[After Dark (TV series)#.22Save the Whale.2C Save the World.3F.22|extended appearance]] on the [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'', alongside [[Petra Kelly]], [[James Lovelock]], [[C. W. Nicol|C.W. Nicol]] and others.

In March 1993, Williams was the subject of a half-hour spoof arts documentary, a meditation on fame and fandom titled ''Every Time I Cross the Tamar I Get into Trouble''. Screened by Channel Four in its ''Without Walls'' slot, the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] film database characterises the film thus: "An account of Heathcote William's work, and Al Pacino's obsession with his writing. Includes an interview with Harold Pinter and footage from Pacino's film ''The Local Stigmatic''."<ref name="BFI synopsis">{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/486380?view=synopsis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601000921/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/486380?view=synopsis |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 June 2009 |title=BFI &#124; Film & TV Database &#124; EVERY TIME I CROSS THE TAMAR I GET INTO TROUBLE (1993) |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date=16 April 2009 |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/19139 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202044159/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/19139 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 December 2007 |title=BFI &#124; Film & TV Database &#124; WITHOUT WALLS |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> The half-hour film was presented by the comedian and musician [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]], an avid collector of Williams memorabilia.

==Personal life==
Williams lived in [[Oxford]] with the former partner Diana Senior. They had two daughters and three grandchildren.<ref name=coveney>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jul/02/heathcote-williams-obituary|title=Heathcote Williams obituary|first=Michael|last=Coveney|author-link=Michael Coveney|date=2 July 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=2 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702191132/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jul/02/heathcote-williams-obituary| archive-date=2 July 2017}}</ref> Williams also had a son, Charlie, born in 1989, from a previous relationship with novelist and journalist [[Polly Samson]]. In 1994 Samson married  [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]], who became Charlie's adoptive father.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13309662 |title=BBC News – Charlie Gilmour admits student fees protest violence |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=6 May 2011 |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref>

Williams and Samson had become involved with each other during the publication of ''Whale Nation'', Samson being responsible for publicising what she succeeded in turning into a best-selling volume despite its author's reluctance to promote his work (''see ''[[#Poetry|§Poetry]]'', above'').<ref>{{cite news|url=http://guardian.co.uk/books/2010/nov/07/polly-samson-interview-carole-cadwalladr|title='Please don't call me Mrs Gilmour'|publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date=6 May 2011 |access-date=23 March 2013}}</ref>

Williams's personal life was always turbulent. An affair with the model [[Jean Shrimpton]] resulted in the writer setting himself alight on her doorstep. Whether this was intentional or the upshot of a magical stunt gone wrong{{spaced ndash}}Williams at the time was an ardent fire-eater{{spaced ndash}}is unknown. Although at the time, it was assumed Shrimpton had ended the relationship, in her autobiography published in the early 1990s, Shrimpton asserted that it was Williams who walked out on her.

==Illness and death==
Williams died on 1 July 2017 in [[Oxford]], of kidney failure after a long stay in hospital for a chest infection.
