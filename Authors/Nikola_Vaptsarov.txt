Despite the fact that he only ever published one poetry book, he is considered one of the most important Bulgarian poets. Because of his underground communist activity against the government of [[Boris III]] and the German troops in [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], Vaptsarov was arrested, tried, sentenced and executed the same night by a firing squad.

In April and May 1932, Vaptsarov visited [[Istanbul]], [[Famagusta]], [[Alexandria]], [[Beirut]], [[Port Said]], and [[Haifa]] as a crew member of the Burgas vessel.

Later, he went to work in a factory in the village of [[Kocherinovo]] - at first as a stoker and eventually as a mechanic. He was elected Chairman of the Association, protecting worker rights in the factory. Vaptsarov was devoted to his talent and spent his free time writing and organizing amateur theater pieces. He got fired after a technical failure in 1936. This forced him to move to Sofia, where he worked for the [[Bulgarian State Railways|state railway service]] and the municipal incinerating furnace.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 May 2019 |title=БДЖ организира пътуване с парния локомотив Баба Меца |url=https://dariknews.bg/regioni/sofiia/bdzh-organizira-pytuvane-s-parniia-lokomotiv-baba-meca-2164473 |accessdate=6 May 2020}}</ref> He continued writing, and a number of newspapers published poems of his. The "Romantika" poem won him a poetry contest.

Over time, Vaptsarov absorbed a lot of Communist ideas and started taking an active part in the ideological movement.<ref name="britannica">{{Cite web |date=20 July 1998 |title=Bulgarian literature |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Bulgarian-literature |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=6 May 2020}}</ref> In 1940, he participated in the so-called "Sobolev action," gathering signatures for a pact of friendship between [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[USSR]]. The illegal activity earned him an arrest and an internment in the village of [[Godech]]. After his release in September 1940, Vaptsarov got involved with the Central Military Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. His task was to organize the supply of guns and documents for the communist resistance. He was arrested in March 1942. On 23 July 1942, he was sentenced to death and shot down on the same evening along with 11 other men.

==Literary works==

==Legacy==
In 1949, the Bulgarian Naval Academy was renamed ''[[Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy]]''. On 3 December 1953, he received posthumously the International Peace Award. His ''Selected Poems'' were published in London in 1954, by [[Lawrence & Wishart]], translated into English with a foreword by British poet Peter Tempest. His poetry has been translated in 98 languages throughout the world. [[Vaptsarov Peak]] in eastern [[Livingston Island]], [[Antarctica]] is named after the famous Bulgarian poet.
Today, Nikola Vaptsarov's childhood home in Bansko and residence in Sofia are both museums.
