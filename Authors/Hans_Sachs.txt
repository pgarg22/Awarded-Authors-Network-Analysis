'''Hans Sachs''' (5 November 1494 – 19 January 1576) was a [[Germany|German]] ''[[Meistersinger]]'' ("mastersinger"), [[poetry|poet]], [[playwright]], and [[shoemaking|shoemaker]].

==Biography==
Hans Sachs was born in [[Nuremberg]] ({{Lang-de|Nürnberg}}). As a child he attended a singing school that was held in the church of Nuremberg. This helped to awaken in him a taste for [[poetry]] and [[music]].<ref name="Reform">2009 Jean Henri Merle D'Aubign, History of the Great Reformation of the Sixteenth Century in Germany, Switzerland. General Books</ref> His father was a [[tailor]]. He attended [[Latin school]] ({{Lang-de|Lateinschule}}) in [[Nuremberg]]
. When he was 14 he took up an [[apprentice]]ship as a [[shoemaker]].

After the apprenticeship, at age 17, he was a [[journeyman]] and set out on his [[Journeyman years]] (''Wanderjahre'' or ''Walz''), that is, travelling about with companions and students.<ref name="Reform" /> Over several years he worked at his craft in many towns, including [[Regensburg]], [[Passau]], [[Salzburg]], [[Munich]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Lübeck]], and [[Leipzig]].<ref name="eb1911">

In 1513 he reached the small town of [[Wels]], where he remained for a time, devoting himself to the cultivation of the fine arts.<ref name="Reform" /> The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] chanced to pass through this town with his dazzling retinue, and the young poet allowed himself to be carried away by the splendour of the court.<ref name="Reform" /> The prince placed him in the halls of the palace of [[Innsbruck]]. Later Hans Sachs quit the court and went to Schatz and [[Munich]].

In the same year, he took up a kind of apprenticeship to become a mastersinger at Munich. Lienhard Nunnenbeck, a [[linen]] weaver, was his master. In 1516 he settled in Nuremberg and stayed there for the rest of his life. On 1 September 1519 he married Kunigunde Creutzer (1502–1560). He had seven children, but all died while he was still alive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Sachs|title=Hans Sachs &#124; German poet and composer|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>  He married again on 2 September 1561, this time to the young widow Barbara Harscher.

The great event of his intellectual life was the coming of the [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]]; he became an ardent adherent of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], and in 1523 wrote in Luther's honor the poem beginning “The [[nightingale]] of [[Wittenberg]], which is heard everywhere” ({{Lang-de|Die wittenbergisch Nachtigall, Die man jetzt höret überall}}), and four remarkable dialogues in prose, in which his warm sympathy with the reformer was tempered by counsels of moderation. In spite of this, his advocacy of the new faith earned him a reproof from the town council of Nuremberg, and he was forbidden to publish any more “pamphlets or rhymes” ({{Lang-de|Büchlein oder Reimen}}). It was not long, however, before the council itself openly threw in its lot with the Reformation.<ref name="eb1911"/>

==Works==
[[File:Sachs, Hans – Sämtliche Fabeln und Schwänke vol 1, 1893 – BEIC 3281469.jpg|thumb|''Sämtliche Fabeln und Schwänke. 1'' (1893)]]
He wrote over 6000 pieces of various kinds. Exact numbers vary widely in secondary literature, mainly because it is not always clear if a piece is an independent work or part of a larger work. Also, certain works may be put in different categories by different authors. His productivity is especially remarkable because he kept working as a shoemaker throughout his life. (As far as is known, the Mastersingers did not as a common practice write or sing for money.) His works include

*[[Meistersinger|Mastersongs]] ({{Lang-de|Meisterlieder}}) proper (about 4200)
*other [[poem]]s and songs
*Carnival plays
*[[Tragedy|Tragedies]]
*[[Comedy|Comedies]]
*Prose dialogues
*[[Fable]]s
* Religious tracts, including “A wonderful prophecy of the papacy about how things will go for it up until the end of the world” ({{Lang-de|Eyn wunderliche Weyssagung von dem Babsttumb, wie es ihm biz an das endt der welt gehen sol}}) in collaboration with [[Andreas Osiander]] (1527).<ref>''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', S.M. Jackson et al., eds., Funk and Wagnalls: New York, 1911, v. 10, p. 139.</ref>

==Assessment==
His mastersongs were not published, being intended solely for the use of the Nuremberg Meistersinger school, of which Sachs was the leading spirit. His fame rests mainly on the “spoken poems” ({{Lang-de|Spruchgedichte}}) which include his dramatic writings. His “tragedies” and “comedies” are, however, little more than stories told in dialogue, and are divided by convenient pauses into a varying number of acts. Sachs had little idea of the essentials of dramatic construction or the nature of dramatic action.

The subjects are drawn from the most varied sources, but particularly the Bible, the classics and the Italian novelists. He succeeds best in the short anecdotal ''Fastnachtsspiel'' or Shrovetide play, where characterisation and humorous situation are of more importance than dramatic form or construction.

Some of his farces have been played on the modern stage.<ref name="eb1911"/> Among these are:
* ''Der fahrende Schüler im Paradies'' (1550)
* ''Das Wildbad'' (1550)
* ''Das heiss Eisen'' (1551)
* ''Der Bauer im Fegefeuer'' (1552)

==As a fictional character==
Hans Sachs is the subject of an opera (1840) by [[Albert Lortzing]]. He is a leading character in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' (1868).
