'''Ramón de la Cruz''' (28 March 1731 – 5 March 1794) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish Enlightenment literature|neoclassical]] [[dramatist]].

Born in [[Madrid]], he was a clerk in the ministry of finance. He is the author of three hundred ''[[sainete]]s'', little farcical sketches of city life, written to be played between the acts of a longer play. He published a selection in ten volumes (Madrid, 1786–1791). The best of his pieces, such as ''Las Tertulias de Madrid'', are specimens of satiric observation.
