He was a prolific polemicist and extremely influential in Norwegian public life and Scandinavian cultural debate.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=J.J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11814265|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985–1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=46|oclc=11814265}}</ref> Bjørnson is considered to be one of [[The Four Greats (Norwegian writers)|The Four Greats]] (''De Fire Store'') among Norwegian writers, the others being [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]], and [[Alexander Kielland]].<ref name=Groendahl>{{cite book  | last = Grøndahl   | first = Carl Henrik |author2=Tjomsland, Nina  | title = The Literary masters of Norway: with samples of their works  | publisher = Tanum-Norli   | year = 1978| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EwROAAAACAAJ&q=The+literary+masters+of+norway  | isbn =978-82-518-0727-2 }}</ref> Bjørnson is also celebrated for his lyrics to the Norwegian National Anthem, "[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]".<ref name=SNL>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bjørnstjerne Martinius Bjørnson|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]  |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last= Beyer   |first= Edvard & Moi, Bernt Morten   |year=2007 |url=http://www.snl.no/Bjørnstjerne_Martinius_Bjørnson |language=no |access-date= 9 September 2009}}</ref> Composer [[Fredrikke Waaler]] based a composition for voice and piano (''Spinnersken'') on text by Bjørnson, as did composer [[Anna Teichmüller]] (''Die Prinzessin'').

==Childhood and education==
[[File:Bjørgan by Gerhard-Munthe.png|thumb|left|alt=a painting of the farmyard in winter shows the barn, house and outbuildings around a central yard.|[[Bjørgan parsonage|Bjørgan]] farmyard in Kvikne. Drawing by [[Gerhard Munthe (painter)|Gerhard Munthe]]]]
Bjørnson was born at the farmstead of [[Bjørgan parsonage|Bjørgan]] in [[Kvikne]], a secluded village in the [[Østerdalen]] district, some sixty miles south of [[Trondheim]]. In 1837 Bjørnson's father [[Peder Bjørnson]], who was the pastor of Kvikne, was transferred to the parish of [[Nesset]], outside [[Molde]] in [[Romsdal]]. It was in this scenic district that Bjørnson spent his childhood, living at the [[Nesset Parsonage]].

After a few years studying in the neighbouring city [[Molde]], Bjørnson was sent at the age of 17 to Heltberg Latin School (''Heltbergs Studentfabrikk'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] to prepare for university. This was the same school that trained [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Lie]], and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje|Vinje]].

Bjørnson had realized that he wanted to pursue his talent for poetry (he had written verses since age eleven). He matriculated at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1852, soon embarking upon a career as a journalist, focusing on criticism of drama.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=Nobel>{{cite web  | title = Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson – The Nobel Prize in Literature 1903  | publisher = The Nobel Foundation (From Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901–1967, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969.

==Early production==
In 1857 Bjørnson published ''[[Synnøve Solbakken (novel)|Synnøve Solbakken]]'', the first of his peasant novels. In 1858 this was followed by ''[[Arne (novel)|Arne]]'', in 1860 by ''[[En glad Gut]]'' (A Happy Boy), and in 1868 by ''Fiskerjentene'' (The Fisher Girls). These are the most important specimens of his ''bonde-fortellinger'' or peasant tales.<ref name=PG>{{Gutenberg|no=4582|name=Björnstjerne Björnson|bullet=none}}. A biographical essay, 1910, by [[William Morton Payne]], a translator of various works by Bjørnson.</ref> At least seven Danish composers wrote music based on Arne: [[Morten Eskesen]], C. J. Frydensberg, [[Peter Arnold Heise|Peter Heise]], Anton Nielsen, [[Oluf Ring]], [[Henrik Rung]], and [[Sigrid Henriette Wienecke]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arnes sang - Det Kongelige Bibliotek|url=http://www5.kb.dk/da/nb/samling/ma/fokus/bjoernson/arnessang.html|access-date=2020-08-24|website=www5.kb.dk}}</ref>

Bjørnson was anxious "to create a new saga in the light of the peasant," as he put it, and he thought this should be done, not merely in prose fiction, but in national dramas or ''folke-stykker''. The earliest of these was a one-act piece set in the 12th century, ''Mellem Slagene'' (Between the Battles), written in 1855 and produced in 1857. He was especially influenced at this time by the study of [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen]] and [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger]], during a visit to [[Copenhagen]]. ''Mellem Slagene'' was followed by ''Halte-Hulda'' (Lame Hulda) in 1858, and ''Kong Sverre'' (King Sverre) in 1861. His most important work to date was the poetic trilogy of ''[[Sigurd Slembe (trilogy)|Sigurd Slembe]]'' (Sigurd the Bad), which Bjørnson published in 1862.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=PG/>

==The mature author==
At the close of 1857 Bjørnson had been appointed director of the theatre at [[Bergen]], a post which he held for two years, when he returned to [[Oslo|Christiania]]. From 1860 to 1863 he travelled widely throughout Europe. Early in 1865 he undertook the management of the Christiania theatre,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmiesing, Ann |year=2002|title=Bjørnson and the Inner Plot of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=74|issue=4|pages=465–482|jstor=40920401}}</ref> and brought out his popular comedy of ''De Nygifte'' (The Newly Married) and his romantic tragedy of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in Scotland. In 1870 he published ''Poems and Songs'' and the epic cycle ''Arnljot Gelline''; the latter volume contains the ode ''Bergliot'', one of Bjørnson's finest contributions to [[lyrical poetry]].

Between 1864 and 1874, Bjørnson displayed a slackening of the intellectual forces very remarkable in a man of his energy; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager. This was the period of Bjørnson's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator. In 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout [[Scandinavia]].

From 1874 to 1876 Bjørnson was absent from [[Norway]], and in the peace of voluntary exile he recovered his imaginative powers. His new departure as a dramatic author began with ''En fallit'' (A Bankruptcy) and ''Redaktøren'' (The Editor) in 1874, social dramas of an extremely modern and realistic cast.

==Collaborations with Grieg==
In the 1870's Bjørnson and the composer [[Edvard Grieg]], who shared his interests in Norwegian self-government, became friends. Grieg set several of his poems to music, including ''Landkjenning'' and ''Sigurd Jorsalfar''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.573045&catNum=573045&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English|title = GRIEG, E.: Orchestral Music, Vol. 7 - Olav Trygvason / Landkjenning / Sigurd Jorsalfar (Excerpts) (Malmo Symphony, Engeset)}}</ref> Eventually they decided on an opera based on King Olav Trygvason, but a dispute as to whether music or lyrics should be created first, led to Grieg being diverted to working on incidental music for [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play [[Peer Gynt]], which naturally offended Bjørnson . Eventually their friendship was resumed. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://griegmuseum.no/en/about-grieg|title = ..About Edvard Grieg &#124; Troldhaugen}}</ref>

==The "national poet"==
[[File:Bjørnson bldsa BB0786.jpg|thumb|Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Karoline Bjørnson at Aulestad]]
Bjørnson settled on his estate of [[Aulestad]] in [[Gausdal]]. In 1877 he published another novel, ''Magnhild'', in which his ideas on social questions were seen to be in a state of fermentation, and gave expression to his [[republicanism|republican]] sentiments in the polemical play ''Kongen'' (The King). In a later edition of the play, he prefixed an essay on "Intellectual Freedom" in further explanation of his position. ''Kaptejn Mansana'' (Captain Mansana), an episode of the [[Italian unification|war of Italian independence]], was written in to 1878.

Extremely anxious to obtain full success on the stage, Bjørnson concentrated his powers on a drama of social life, ''Leonarda'' (1879), which raised a violent controversy. A satirical play, ''Det nye System'' (The New System), was produced a few weeks later. Although these plays of Bjørnson's second period were greatly discussed, few were financially successful.

Bjørnson produced a social drama, ''En Handske'' (A Gauntlet), in 1883, but was unable to persuade any manager to stage it except in a modified form. In the autumn of the same year, Bjørnson published a mystical or symbolic drama ''Over Ævne'' (Beyond Powers), dealing with the abnormal features of religious excitement with extraordinary force; this was not acted until 1899, when it achieved a great success.

==Political interests==
[[File:Bjørnson blds 01655.jpg|right|thumb|Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1908]]
From his youth and forwards, Bjørnson admired [[Henrik Wergeland]], and became a vivid spokesman for the Norwegian Left-wing movement. In this respect, he supported [[Ivar Aasen]], and joined forces in the political struggles in the 1860s and 1870s. When the great monument over Henrik Wergeland were to be erected in 1881, it came to political struggle between left and right, and the left-wing got the upper hand. Bjørnson presented the speech on behalf of Wergeland, and also honouring the constitution and the farmers.<ref name=Groendahl/>

Bjørnson's political opinions had brought upon him a charge of high [[treason]], and he took refuge for a time in Germany, returning to Norway in 1882. Convinced that the theatre was practically closed to him, he turned back to the novel, and published in 1884 ''Det flager i Byen og paa Havnen'' (Flags are Flying in Town and Port), embodying his theories on heredity and education. In 1889 he printed another long and still more remarkable novel, ''Paa Guds veje'' (On God's Path), which is chiefly concerned with the same problems. The same year saw the publication of a comedy, ''[[Geografi og Kærlighed]]'' (Geography and Love), which met with success.<ref name=Groendahl/>

A number of short stories, of a more or less [[didactic]] character, dealing with startling points of emotional experience, were collected and published 1894. Later plays were a political tragedy called ''Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg'' (1898), a second part of ''Over Ævne'' (Beyond Powers II) (1895), ''Laboremus'' (1901), ''På Storhove'' (At Storhove) (1902), and ''Daglannet'' (Dag's Farm) (1904). In 1899, at the opening of the National Theatre, Bjørnson received an ovation, and his saga-drama of King [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd the Crusader]] was performed at the opening of [[Nationaltheatret]] in Oslo.

A subject which interested him greatly was the question of the [[Nynorsk|bondemaal]], the adopting of a national language for Norway distinct from the ''dansk-norsk'' (Dano-Norwegian), in which most Norwegian literature had hitherto been written. At an early stage, before 1860, Bjørnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in [[Nynorsk|landsmål]]. The interest, however, did not last, and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether. Afterwards, he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language. Bjørnson's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal, and his lectures and pamphlets against the ''målstræv'' in its extreme form were very effective. His attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881, as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point. Although he seems to have been supportive of [[Ivar Aasen]] and friendly towards farmers (in the peasant-novels), he later denounced this, and stated in 1899 that there was limits to a farmer's cultivation. ''I can draw a line on the wall. The farmer can cultivate himself to this level, and no more'', he wrote in 1899. Rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point, and uttered the statement in sheer anger. In 1881, he spoke of the farmer's clothing borne by Henrik Wergeland, and his opinion then states that this garment, worn by Wergeland, was "of the most influential things" in the initiation of the national day. Bjørnson's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous. His father himself was a farmer's son.
During the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major European papers. He attacked the French justice in the Dreyfus Affair, and he fought for the rights of children in Slovakia to learn their own mother tongue. "To detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts," he wrote.
Bjørnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the [[Černová massacre]] under the title The greatest industry of Hungary – which was supposedly '[[Magyarization|to produce Magyars]]'.

==Last years==
[[File:En politisk telegramveksling.jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''[[Vikingen]]'' of a telegram exchange between Michelsen and Bjørnson.]]
Bjørnson was, from the beginning of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], a staunch supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], and, according to a contemporary, wrote "article after article in the papers and proclaimed in every manner his belief in his innocence". <!-- http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm -->

Bjørnson was one of the original members of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], that awards the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], where he sat from 1901 to 1906.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |title=The Norwegian Nobel Committee Since 1901 |author=Nobel Foundation |author-link=Nobel Foundation |access-date=14 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619105728/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |archive-date=19 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1903 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

Bjørnson had done as much as any other man to rouse Norwegian nationalistic feeling, but in 1903, on the verge of the rupture between [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], he preached conciliation and moderation to the Norwegians. However, in 1905 he largely remained silent.

'''When Norway was attempting to dissolve the forced union with Sweden, Bjørnson sent a telegram to the Norwegian Prime minister stating, "Now is the time to unite." The minister replied, "Now is the time to shut up."'''<ref name=Groendahl/>

This was in fact a satirical illustration published in ''[[Vikingen]]'', but the story got so popular and widespread that Bjørnson had to deny it, claiming that "Michelsen has never asked me to shut up; it would not help if he did".<ref>(Norwegian) [http://tux1.aftenposten.no/bakgr/970505/idag.htm Øystein Sørensen: Apokryft om å holde kjeft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212024545/http://tux1.aftenposten.no/bakgr/970505/idag.htm |date=12 February 2015 }}, Aftenposten 5 May 1997</ref>

He died on 26 April 1910 in Paris, where for some years he had spent his winters, and was buried at home with every mark of honour. The Norwegian [[coastal defence ship]] {{HNoMS|Norge||6}} was sent to convey his remains back to his own land.

==Bjørnson's family==
[[File:Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and his Family.jpg|thumb|Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and his family, 1882.]]
Bjørnson was the son of the Reverend Mr. Peder Bjørnson and Inger Elise Nordraach. He married [[Karoline Reimers]] (1835–1934) in 1858.<ref name=SNL/> They had six children, five of whom lived to adulthood:
*[[Bjørn Bjørnson]] (1859–1942)
*Einar Bjørnson (1864–1942)
*[[Erling Bjørnson]] (1868–1959)
*[[Bergliot Ibsen|Bergliot Bjørnson]] (1869–1953)
*Dagny Bjørnson (1871–1872)
*Dagny Bjørnson (1876–1974)

[[Karoline Bjørnson]] remained at Aulestad until her death in 1934.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Om Aulestad  | publisher = maihaugen.no  | url = http://www.maihaugen.no/no/Aulestad/Hjemmet/  | format = Norwegian  | access-date = 9 September 2009  | url-status = dead  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090515134902/http://www.maihaugen.no/no/Aulestad/Hjemmet/  | archive-date = 15 May 2009  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>

In his early fifties, Bjørnson had an affair with 17-year-old Guri Andersdotter (d. 1949), which resulted in the birth of their son, Anders Underdal (1880–1973). The affair was kept a secret, though early on Anders Underdal, a poet, would talk about his origins with his children. Later in life he stopped discussing the matter, no reason was given. Anders was the father of Norwegian-Swedish author [[Margit Sandemo]]. Audun Thorsen has written a book about Bjørnson's affair; "Bjørnsons kvinne og Margit Sandemos "familiehemmelighet"  (Genesis forlag, Oslo 1999).
