==Life==
[[File:Aspioti Mansion Villa Rossa in Corfu.jpg|thumb|The Aspioti Mansion in Corfu]]
Aspioti was born into a wealthy family who lived in the ''Villa Rosa'' mansion in a suburb of the old town of Corfu. She was the daughter of Konstantinos Aspiotis, a man who became wealthy by mass-producing, in his [[printing shop]], a kind of exclusive [[playing cards]] illustrated by his grandfather Nikolaos Aspiotis who was a painter. Eventually his company moved to Athens and became ''[[Aspioti-ELKA]]'', a well-known printing and publishing company and one of the largest of its kind in Greece.<ref name="National Centre of the Book"/><ref name="Program1995"/>

In 1930 Marie Aspioti published the book ''Corfu'' in French in co-operation with French writer René Puaux. Lawrence Durrell in the introduction of his publication ''Lear's Corfu'' in 1965 mentions: {{quotation| She is, I think, the first Greek friend I made and as a girl in her twenties she wrote a book about Corfu in French which was the first study of the island to fall into my hands. Indeed her knowledge is as comprehensive as her scholarship is scrupulous and unobtrusive.<ref name="Lillios2004"/>}}

During World War II she became a volunteer nurse at the Corfu General Hospital. In January 1950 she published the magazine ''Prosperos, editions of Art and Literature of the British Council'', inspired by Lawrence Durrell's work ''Prospero's Cell''.<ref name="National Centre of the Book"/>

In Corfu she was the director of the Corfu Branch of the [[British Council]] from 1946 to 1955,<ref name="Lillios2004"/> and was a family friend of [[Prince Philip]].<ref name="Osler2011"/> In 1955 she resigned her position as the director of the British Council in protest against the British policies in Cyprus against [[enosis]] in trying to suppress Cypriot self-determination. At the same time she returned to the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] the MBE she had received.<ref name="Lillios2004"/><ref name="José Ruiz Mas"/> She also accused Durrell of betraying his [[philhellenism]] for a few coins.<ref name="José Ruiz Mas"/>

She also wrote poems and theatrical plays. In 1956 her first theatrical play ''O Κουρσεμένος Γάμος'' (''The Pirated Wedding'') was performed in Corfu. Her other literary works were published in ''Prosperos'' magazine and other publications in Corfu.<ref name="National Centre of the Book"/>

Later in life, Marie Aspiotis could no longer afford to maintain her ''Villa Rosa'' mansion and although the building became dilapidated she continued living there with her mother.<ref name="Tennant2001"/>
