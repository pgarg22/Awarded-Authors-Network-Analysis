==Early life and     career==
Zusak was born in Sydney, Australia. His mother Lisa is originally from Germany and his father Joseph is from Austria. They emigrated to Australia in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/1286/the-angel-of-death-narrates-a-new-tale-for-young-r/ |title=The Angel of Death Narrates a New Tale for Young Readers – |publisher=Forward.com |access-date=12 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/author/markus-zusak/ |title=Biography of Markus Zusak &#124; List of Works, Study Guides & Essays |publisher=GradeSaver |access-date=12 February 2014}}</ref> Markus is the youngest of four children and has two sisters and one brother. He attended [[Engadine High School]] and briefly returned there to teach English while writing. He studied English and history at the [[University of New South Wales]], from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a [[Diploma of Education]].

Zusak is the author of six books. His first three books, ''The Underdog'', ''Fighting Ruben Wolfe'', and ''When Dogs Cry'', released between 1999 and 2001, were all published internationally. ''The Messenger'', published in 2002, won the 2003 CBC Book of the Year Award (Older Readers) and the 2003 NSW Premier's Literary Award (Ethel Turner Prize) in Australia and was a runner-up for the [[Printz Award]] in America.

''[[The Book Thief]]'' was published in 2005 and has since been translated into more than 40 languages. ''The Book Thief'' was [[film adaptation|adapted]] as a [[The Book Thief (film)|film of the same name]] in 2013. In 2014, Zusak delivered [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-_8QIdm4hA a Ted Talk], called 'The Failurist' at the Sydney Opera House. It focused on his drafting process and journey to success through writing ''[[The Book Thief]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markus Zusak |title=The Failurist: Markus Zusak |url=https://tedxsydney.com/talk/the-failurist-markus-zusak/ |website=TED Sydney |access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>

''[[The Messenger (Zusak novel)|The Messenger]]'' (''I Am the Messenger'' in the United States) was published in 2002 and was one of Zusak's first novels. This novel has won awards such as the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Ethel Turner Prize for Young People's Literature|New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards: Ethel Turner Prize for Young People's Literature]].<ref>wiki</ref>

In March 2016 Zusak talked about his then unfinished novel ''[[Bridge of Clay]].'' He stated that the book was 90% finished but that, "... I’m a completely different person than the person who wrote ''The Book Thief''. And this is also the scary thing—I’m a different person to the one who started ''[[Bridge of Clay]]'' eight, nine years ago ...  I’ve got to get it done this year, or else I’ll probably finally have to set it aside."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/the-book-thief-10-years-later-markus-zusak-reflect.html?p=2|title=The Book Thief 10 Years Later: Markus Zusak Reflects on His Iconic Novel 14 March 2016|website=Paste Magazine|access-date=28 March 2017}}</ref>
