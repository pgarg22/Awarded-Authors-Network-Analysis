Albery was born in London. On leaving school he entered an architect's office and started to write plays. His [[farce]] ''A Pretty Piece of Chiselling'' was given its first production by the Ingoldsby Club in 1864. After some failures, his adaptation, ''Dr Davy'', was produced at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] (1866). His most successful piece, ''Two Roses'', a comedy, was produced at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in 1870, in which [[Sir Henry Irving]] made one of his earliest London successes as Digby Grant.<ref name=EB1911/> The production ran for 300 performances.

Albery was the author of a large number of other plays and adaptations, including ''Coquettes'' (1870); ''Pickwick'', a four-act drama (based on [[Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1871); ''[[The Pink Dominos]]'' (1877), a [[farce]] that ran for an extremely successful 555 performances and was one of a series of adaptations from the French which he made for the [[Criterion Theatre]], where his wife, the actress and theatrical manager [[Mary Moore (stage actress)|Mary Moore]] (who after his death became Lady [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Wyndham]] (1861–1931)), played the leading parts; ''Jingle'' (a farcical version of ''Pickwick''), produced at the Lyceum in 1878;<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Albery, James|inline=1}}</ref> and ''Oriana'' (with music by [[Frederic Clay]]).

His one-act [[operetta]], ''[[The Spectre Knight]]'', with music by [[Alfred Cellier]], ran as a companion piece to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' and then ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]] in 1878 and on tour.<ref>Walters, Michael and George Low.
