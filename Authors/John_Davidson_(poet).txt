'''John Davidson''' (11 April 1857 – 23 March 1909) was a Scottish poet, playwright and novelist, best known for his [[ballad]]s.<ref name=lee>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Davidson, John |first=Francis|last=Bickley}}</ref><ref>''The Times'', (27, 30 March 1, 19 April 20, 22 Sep (1909)</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152669/John-Davidson "John Davidson"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th edit.,</ref> He also did translations from French and German. In 1909, financial difficulties, as well as physical and mental health problems, led to his suicide.

==Life and works==
===Scotland===

He was born at [[Barrhead]], [[East Renfrewshire]] as the son of Alexander Davidson, an [[Evangelical Union (Scotland)|Evangelical Union]] minister and Helen ''née'' Crocket of Elgin.<ref name=lee/><ref>Victor Plarr (1895) ''Men and Women of the Time''</ref> His family removed to [[Greenock]] in 1862 where he was educated at [[Wellington Academy#Feeder primary schools|Highlanders' Academy]] there and entered the chemical laboratory of Walker's Sugarhouse refinery in his 13th year, returning after one year to school as a pupil teacher.  In Public Analysts' Office, 1870–71. In these employments he developed an interest in science which became an important characteristic of his poetry.<ref name=lee/> In 1872 he returned for four years to the Highlanders' Academy as a pupil-teacher, and, after a year at [[Edinburgh University]] (1876–77), received in 1877 his first scholastic employment at Alexander's Charity, Glasgow. During the next six years he held positions in the following schools : Perth Academy (1878–81), Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow (1881–82), and Hutchinson's Charity, Paisley (1883–84). He varied his career by spending a year as clerk in a Glasgow thread firm (1884–85), and subsequently taught in Morrison's Academy, Crieff (1885–88), and in a private school at Greenock (1888–89).<ref name=lee/>

===London===
Having taken to literature, he went in 1889 to London where he frequented '[[Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese]]'  and joined the '[[Rhymers' Club]]'.<ref>''The Oxford Guide to Literary Britain & Ireland'' (2009) Oxford University Press</ref><ref name=farqu>Robert Farquharson Sharp (1904) ''A Dictionary of English Authors, Biographical and Bibliographical'', K. Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co., London</ref> Davidson's first published work was '' Bruce,'' a chronicle play in the Elizabethan manner, which appeared with a Glasgow imprint in 1886. Four other plays, ''Smith, a Tragic Farce'' (1888), ''An Unhistorical Pastoral'' (1889), ''Aromantic Farce'' (1889), and the brilliant pantomimic ''Scaramouch in Naxos'' (1889) were also published while he was in Scotland.<ref name=lee/><ref name=ham>Ian Hamilton (1996) ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English'', Oxford University Press</ref>

Besides writing for the ''Speaker,'' the ''Glasgow Herald,'' and other papers, he produced several novels and tales, of which the best was ''Perfervid'' (1890). But these prose works were written for a livelihood.

===Verse===
[[Image:John Davidson (poet) 001.jpg|thumb|180px|John Davidson]]
Davidson's true medium was verse. '' In a Music Hall and other Poems'' (1891) suggested what ''Fleet Street Eclogues'' (1893) proved, that Davidson possessed a genuine and distinctive poetic gift. The late nineteenth century English novelist [[George Gissing]] read both these volumes in one day in 1893 at the British Museum Library.<ref>Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.317</ref> [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]] had words of praise for ''In a Music Hall''. He called it, "An example of a new writer seeking out 'new subject matter, new emotions'". Yeats wrote of his emotional dispute with Davidson in ''Autobiographies'' (1955).<ref name=ham/> The second collection established his reputation among the discerning few. His early plays were republished in one volume in 1894, and henceforward he turned his attention more and more completely to verse. A volume of vigorous ''Ballads and Songs'' (1894), his most popular work, which Davidson sent a copy of to [[George Gissing]], who wrote that it "gave me thoughts",<ref>Coustillas, p.356.</ref> was followed in turn by a second series of ''Fleet Street Eclogues'' (1896) and by ''New Ballads'' (1897) and ''The Last Ballad'' (1899).<ref name=lee/>

===Dramatic works===
For a time he abandoned lyric for the drama, writing several original plays.

==='Testaments'===
Finally Davidson engaged on a series of "Testaments", in which he gave definite expression to his philosophy. These volumes were entitled ''The Testament of a Vivisector'' (1901),''The Testament of a Man Forbid'' (1901), ''The Testament of an Empire Builder'' (1902), and ''The Testament of John Davidson'' (1908). Though he disclaimed the title of philosopher, he expounded an original philosophy which was at once materialistic and aristocratic. The cosmic process, as interpreted by evolution, was for him a fruitful source of inspiration.

His later verse, which is often fine rhetoric rather than poetry, expressed the belief which is summed up in the last words that he wrote, "Men are the universe become conscious; the simplest man should consider himself too great to be called after any name." The corollary was that every man was to be himself to the utmost of his power, and the strongest was to rule. Davidson professed to reject all existing philosophies, including that of [[Nietzsche]], as inadequate, but Nietzsche's influence is traceable in his argument. The poet planned ultimately to embody his revolutionary creed in a trilogy entitled '' God and Mammon''. Only two plays, however, were written, ''The Triumph of Mammon'' (1907) and ''Mammon and his Message'' (1908).<ref name=lee/>

===Family===
In 1885 Davidson married Margaret, daughter of John McArthur of Perth.<ref>''Who's Who: An Annual Biographical Dictionary'' (1898) A. & C. Black</ref> She survived him with two sons, Alexander (b. 1887) and Menzies (b. 1889).<ref name=lee/>

===Other works===
[[File:Portrait of John Davidson by William Rothenstein.JPG|thumb|140px|Portrait of John Davidson by William Rothenstein in ''The Yellow Book'', Vol. 4 (1895)]]
Davidson was a prolific writer. Besides the works cited, he wrote many other works, including ''[[The Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender]]''  (1895), a novel which included flagellation erotica, and he contributed an introduction to Shakespeare's ''Sonnets'' (Renaissance edition, 1908), which, like his various prefaces and essays, shows him a subtle literary critic.<ref name=lee/>

===Translations===
He translated Montesquieu's ''Lettres Persanes'' (1892), [[François Coppée]]'s ''Pour la Couronne'' in 1896 and [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''Ruy Blas'' in 1904, the former being produced as, ''For the Crown'', at the Lyceum Theatre in 1896, the latter as ''A Queen's Romance'' at the Imperial Theatre.<ref name=lee/>

===Portraits===
[[Image:John Davidson by Robert Bryden.jpg|thumb|140px|Woodcut of John Davidson by [[Robert Bryden]] 1902]]
Davidson's portrait was drawn by [[Walter Sickert]] and by [[Robert Bryden]].<ref>William Archer (1902) ''Poets of the Younger Generation'', with thirty-three full page portraits from woodcuts by Robert Bryden, J. Lane, The Bodley Head, London [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_jpdYAAAAMAAJ]</ref> A caricature by [[Max Beerbohm]] appeared in ''The Chapbook,'' (1907),<ref name=lee/> and [[William Rothenstein]] did a portrait of him for ''The Yellow Book''. In ''Men and Memories'' (1931), Rothenstein said that when Max Beerbohm looked at his pictures of Davidson, he had complimented him on the 'subtle way he had handled his toupée'. Rothenstein wrote that he had not noticed that he was wearing one.<ref>William Rothenstein (1931) ''Men and Memories, A History of the Arts 1872 to 1922''</ref>

Frank Harris, a member of the Rhymers' Club described him in 1889 thus:<blockquote>"... a little below middle height, but strongly built with square shoulders and remarkably fine face and head; the features were almost classically regular, the eyes dark brown and large, the forehead high, the hair and moustache black. His manners were perfectly frank and natural; he met everyone in the same unaffected kindly human way; I never saw a trace in him of snobbishness or incivility. Possibly a great man, I said to myself, certainly a man of genius, for simplicity of manner alone is in England almost a proof of extraordinary endowment."<ref>Frank Harris (1915) ''Contemporary Portraits'', Mitchell Kennerley, New York [https://books.google.com/books?id=TAwZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s]</ref><ref name=rhymers>Norman Alford (1996) ''The Rhymers' Club: Poets of the Tragic Generation '', Palgrave Macmillan {{ISBN|0-312-16460-2}}</ref></blockquote>

===Drowning===
[[File:Davidson reward.jpg|thumb|200px|'Missing' poster 1909]]
In 1906 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 ''per annum'' and [[George Bernard Shaw]] did what he could to help him financially, but poverty, ill-health, and his declining powers, exacerbated by the onset of cancer, caused profound hopelessness and clinical depression.<ref name=ham/> Late in 1908, Davidson left London to reside at [[Penzance]]. On 23 March 1909, he disappeared from his house there, under circumstances which left little doubt that he had drowned himself. Among his papers was found the manuscript of a new work, ''Fleet Street Poems'', with a letter containing the words, "This will be my last book." His body, which was discovered by some fishermen in Mount's Bay on 18 September, was, in accordance with his known wishes, buried at sea. In his will he desired that no biography should be written, none of his unpublished works published, and  "no word except of my writing is ever to appear in any book of mine as long as the copyright endures."<ref name=lee/>

The assumption that he took his own life is consistent with what is known of his temperament and his ideas. In ''The Testament of John Davidson'', published the year before his death, he anticipates this fate:

:"None should outlive his power. . . . Who kills
: Himself subdues the conqueror of kings;
: Exempt from death is he who takes his life;
: My time has come."<ref>Holbrook Jackson (1914) ''The eighteen nineties'', a review of art and ideas at the close of the nineteenth century</ref>

===Influence on other poets===
Davidson's poetry was a key early influence on important Modernist poets, in particular, his compatriot [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' (2010) Oxford University Press</ref> and [[Wallace Stevens]]. [[T.S. Eliot]] was especially fond of the poem 'Thirty Bob a Week' (In ''Ballads and Songs'' (1894)).  Davidson's poem "In the Isle of Dogs", for example, is a clear intertext of later poems such as Eliot's "[[The Waste Land]]" and Stevens' "[[The Idea of Order at Key West]]".<ref>''The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature'' (2007)</ref>
