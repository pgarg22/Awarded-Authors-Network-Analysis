'''Henry Fielding''' (22 April 1707 – 8 October 1754) was an English novelist and dramatist known for earthy humour and satire. His comic novel ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' is still widely appreciated. He and [[Samuel Richardson]] are seen as founders of the traditional English novel. He also holds a place in the history of law enforcement, having used his authority as a magistrate to found the [[Bow Street Runners]], London's first intermittently funded, full-time police force.

==Early life==
Fielding was born at [[Sharpham]], [[Somerset]], and educated at [[Eton College]], where he began a lifelong friendship with [[William Pitt the Elder]].<ref name="dorset">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedorsetpage.com/people/Henry_Fielding.htm |title=Henry Fielding |work=People |publisher=The Dorset Page |access-date=9 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815111041/http://www.thedorsetpage.com/people/Henry_Fielding.htm |archive-date=15 August 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His mother died when he was 11. A suit for custody was brought by his grandmother against his charming but irresponsible father, Lt Gen. [[Edmund Fielding]]. The settlement placed Henry in his grandmother's care, but he continued to see his father in London.<ref name="Henry Fielding Facts">{{Cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/henry-fielding |title=Henry Fielding Facts |website=biography.yourdictionary.com |language=en |access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref>

In 1725, Henry tried to abduct his cousin, Sarah Andrews, while she was on her way to church. He fled to avoid prosecution.<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB |last1=Battestin |first1=Martin C. |title=Fielding, Henry (1707–1754), author and magistrate |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-9400 |access-date=6 April 2019 |language=en |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/9400 |date=23 September 2004}} {{subscription}}</ref>

In 1728, Fielding travelled to [[Leiden]] to study classics and law at the university.<ref name="dorset"/> However, penury forced him back to London, where he began writing for the theatre. Some of his work savagely criticised the government of Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Walpole]].

==Dramatist and novelist==
The [[Licensing Act 1737|Theatrical Licensing Act]] of 1737 is said to be a direct response to his activities in writing for the theatre.<ref name="dorset"/><ref name="booksandwriters">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hfieldin.htm |title=Henry Fielding |website=Books and Writers |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706134943/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hfieldin.htm |archive-date=6 July 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although the play that triggered the act was the unproduced, anonymously authored ''[[The Golden Rump]]'', Fielding's dramatic satires had set the tone. Once it was passed, political satire on stage became all but impossible. Fielding retired from the theatre and resumed his legal career to support his wife Charlotte Craddock and two children by becoming a [[barrister]],<ref name="dorset"/><ref name="booksandwriters"/> joining the [[Middle Temple]] in 1737 and being [[called to the bar]] there in 1740.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Register of Admissions to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, Volume I |page=322}}</ref>

Fielding's lack of financial acumen meant the family often endured periods of poverty, but were helped by [[Ralph Allen]], a wealthy benefactor, on whom Squire Allworthy in ''Tom Jones'' would be based. Allen went on to provide for the education and support of Fielding's children after the writer's death.

[[File:Henry Fielding c 1743 etching from Jonathan Wild the Great.jpg|thumb|''Henry Fielding'', about 1743, etching by Jonathan Wild]]
Fielding never stopped writing political satire and satires of current arts and letters. ''[[The Tragedy of Tragedies]]'' (for which [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] designed the frontispiece) was, for example, quite successful as a printed play. Based on his earlier ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', this was another of Fielding's irregular plays published under the name of H. Scriblerus Secundus, a pseudonym intended to link himself ideally with the [[Scriblerus Club]] of literary satirists founded by [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Alexander Pope]] and [[John Gay]].<ref name="ODNB"/> He also contributed several works to journals.

From 1734 to 1739, Fielding wrote anonymously for the leading [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] periodical, ''The Craftsman'', against the Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Walpole]].<ref name="Battestin1989">{{Cite book |last=Battestin |first=Martin C. |title=New Essays by Henry Fielding: His Contributions to the Craftsman, 1734-1739 and Other Early Journalism |year=1989 |publisher=University Press of Virginia |isbn=978-0-8139-1221-9 |chapter=Introduction |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/newessaysbyhenry00fiel }}, p. xvi</ref> His patron was the opposition Whig MP [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]], a boyhood friend from Eton to whom he later dedicated ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''. Lyttelton followed his leader [[Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]] in forming a Whig opposition to Walpole's government called the [[Cobhamites]], which included another of Fielding's Eton friends, William Pitt.<ref>Battestin (1989), p. xx.</ref> In ''The Craftsman'', Fielding voiced an opposition attack on bribery and corruption in British politics.<ref>Battestin (1989), p. xiii.</ref> Despite writing for the opposition to Walpole, which included Tories as well as Whigs, Fielding was "unshakably a Whig" and often praised Whig heroes such as the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>Battestin (1989), p. 61.</ref>

Fielding dedicated his play ''Don Quixote in England'' to the opposition Whig leader [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]. It appeared on 17 April 1734, the same day writs were issued for the [[1734 British general election|general election]].<ref>Battestin (1989), p. xxiii.</ref> He dedicated his 1735 play ''[[The Universal Gallant]]'' to [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]], a political follower of Chesterfield.<ref>Battestin (1989), p. xxv.</ref> The other prominent opposition paper, ''Common Sense'', founded by Chesterfield and Lyttelton, was named after a character in Fielding's ''[[Pasquin (play)|Pasquin]]'' (1736). Fielding wrote at least two articles for it in 1737 and 1738.<ref>Battestin (1989), p. 299n and 62.</ref>

Fielding continued to air political views in satirical articles and newspapers in the late 1730s and early 1740s. He was the main writer and editor from 1739 to 1740 for the satirical paper ''The Champion'', which was sharply critical of Walpole's government and of pro-government literary and political writers. He sought to evade libel charges by making its political attacks so funny or embarrassing to the victim that a publicized court case would seem even worse. He later became chief writer for the Whig government of [[Henry Pelham]].<ref>Battestin (1989), p. 4.</ref>

Fielding took to novel writing in 1741, angered by [[Samuel Richardson]]'s success with ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''. His first success was an anonymous parody of that novel, called ''[[An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews|Shamela]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Sham Marriages and Proper Plots: Henry Fielding's Shamela and Joseph Andrews |journal=English Studies |date=18 August 2015 |issn=0013-838X |pages=636–53 |volume=96 |issue=6 |doi=10.1080/0013838X.2015.1045728 |first=Anaclara |last=Castro-Santana |s2cid=163073219}}</ref> This follows the model of Tory satirists of the previous generation, notably Swift and Gay.

Fielding followed this with ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742), an original work supposedly dealing with Pamela's brother, Joseph.<ref name="dorset"/> His purpose, however, was more than parody, for as stated in the preface, he intended a "kind of writing which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language." In what Fielding called a "comic epic poem in prouse", he blended two classical traditions: that of the epic, which had been poetic, and that of the drama, but emphasizing the comic rather than the tragic. Another distinction of ''Joseph Andrews'' and the novels to come was use of everyday reality of character and action, as opposed to the fables of the past.<ref name="Henry Fielding Facts"/> While begun as a parody, it developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is seen as Fielding's debut as a serious novelist. In 1743, he published a novel in the ''Miscellanies'' volume III (which was the first volume of the Miscellanies): ''[[The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great]]'', which is sometimes counted as his first, as he almost certainly began it before he wrote ''Shamela'' and ''Joseph Andrews''. It is a satire of Walpole equating him and [[Jonathan Wild]], the gang leader and highwayman. He implicitly compares the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party in [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] with a gang of thieves run by Walpole, whose constant desire to be a "Great Man" (a common epithet with Walpole) ought to culminate in the antithesis of greatness: hanging.

Fielding's anonymous ''[[Mary Hamilton (transvestite)|The Female Husband]]'' (1746) fictionalizes a case in which a female transvestite was tried for duping another woman into marriage; this was one of several small pamphlets costing sixpence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cross |first= Wilbur L. |title= The History of Henry Fielding |volume=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofhenryf02crosuoft |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |place=New Haven, CT |year=1918}}</ref> Though a minor piece in his life's work, it reflects his preoccupation with fraud, shamming and masks.

His greatest work is ''The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling'' (1749), a meticulous comic novel with elements of the picaresque and the [[Bildungsroman]], telling a convoluted, hilarious tale of how a foundling came into a fortune. The plot is too ingenious for a simple summary; it tells of Tom's alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. It triumphs as a presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented and through them every shade of moral behaviour. Fielding's varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel and his authorial comment before each chapter adds a dimension to a conventional, straightforward narrative.<ref name="Henry Fielding Facts"/>

===Sister===
Fielding's younger sister, [[Sarah Fielding|Sarah]], also became a successful writer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=1525 |title=Henry Fielding (1707–1754) |publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia |access-date=9 September 2009}} {{subscription}}</ref> Her novel ''[[The Governess, or The Little Female Academy]]'' (1749) is thought to be the first in English aimed expressly at children.<ref>H.

==Marriages==
Fielding married Charlotte Craddock in 1734 at the [[Church of St Mary, Charlcombe|Church of St Mary]] in [[Charlcombe]], Somerset.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Henry Fielding (I1744) |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I1744&ged=auden-bicknell.ged |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref> She died in 1744, and he later modelled the heroines of ''Tom Jones'' and of ''Amelia'' on her. They had five children; their only daughter Henrietta died at the age of 23, having already been "in deep decline" when she married a military engineer, [[James Gabriel Montresor]], some months before. Three years after Charlotte's death, Fielding disregarded public opinion by marrying her former maid Mary Daniel, who was pregnant.<ref name="booksandwriters"/> Mary bore five children: three daughters who died young, and two sons, William and Allen.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Battestin |year=2000 |title=A Henry Fielding Companion |url=https://archive.org/details/henryfieldingcom00batt |url-access=limited |place=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood |pages=[https://archive.org/details/henryfieldingcom00batt/page/n38 10], 15|isbn=9780313297076}}</ref>

==Jurist and magistrate==

Despite the scandal, Fielding's consistent anti-Jacobitism and support for the [[Church of England]] led to his appointment a year later as London's chief magistrate, while his literary career went from strength to strength. Most of his work concerned London's criminal population of thieves, informers, gamblers and prostitutes. Though living in a corrupt and callous society, he became noted for impartial judgements, incorruptibility and compassion for those whom social inequities led into crime. The income from his office ("the dirtiest money upon earth") dwindled as he refused to take money from the very poor.<ref name="Henry Fielding Facts"/> Joined by his younger half-brother [[John Fielding|John]], he helped found what some call London's first police force, the [[Bow Street Runners]], in 1749.<ref name="spart">{{Cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Jfielding.htm |title=Henry Fielding |publisher=Spartacus Educational |access-date=9 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517094957/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Jfielding.htm |archive-date=17 May 2009}}</ref>

According to the historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]], the Fieldings were two of the best magistrates in 18th-century London, who did much to enhance judicial reform and improve prison conditions. Fielding's influential pamphlets and enquiries included a proposal for abolishing public hangings. This did not, however, imply opposition to capital punishment as such – as is evident, for example, in his presiding in 1751 over the trial of the notorious criminal [[James Field (criminal)|James Field]], finding him guilty in a robbery and sentencing him to hang. John Fielding, despite being blind by then, succeeded his older brother as chief magistrate, becoming known as the "Blind Beak of Bow Street" for his ability to recognise criminals by their voices alone.<ref name="words">{{Citation |contribution=Words, Words, Words |title=From the Beginnings to the 18th Century |publisher=La Spiga languages |year=2003}}.</ref>

In January 1752 Fielding started a fortnightly, ''[[The Covent-Garden Journal]]'', published under the pseudonym "Sir Alexander Drawcansir, Knt., Censor of Great Britain" until November of that year. Here Fielding challenged the "armies of [[Grub Street]]" and periodical writers of the day in a conflict that became the [[Paper War of 1752–1753]].

Fielding then published ''Examples of the Interposition of Providence in the Detection and Punishment of Murder'' (1752), a treatise rejecting deistic and materialistic visions of the world in favour of belief in God's presence and divine judgement,<ref>Henry Fielding, 1988. ''An Enquiry Into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers and Related Writings''. Oxford: Clarendon, 1988.</ref> arguing that the murder rate was rising due to neglect of the Christian religion.<ref>Claire Valier, 2005. ''Crime and Punishment in Contemporary Culture''. Routledge. p. 20.</ref> In 1753 he wrote ''Proposals for Making an Effectual Provision for the Poor''.

Fielding's humanitarian commitment to justice in the 1750s (for instance in support of [[Elizabeth Canning]]) coincided with rapid deterioration in his health. [[Gout]], [[asthma]] and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver left him on crutches,<ref name="ODNB"/> and with other afflictions sent him to Portugal in 1754 to seek a cure, only to die two months later in [[Lisbon]], reportedly in pain and mental distress.<ref name="booksandwriters"/><ref name="Hawley ed">{{Cite book |last=Fielding |first=Henry |editor-last=Hawley |editor-first=Judith |title=Joseph Andrews/Shamela |date=1999 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14043386-9 |page=ii}}</ref> His tomb there is in the [[British Cemetery, Lisbon|British Cemetery]] (''Cemitério Inglês''), the graveyard of [[St. George's Church, Lisbon]].
