'''Richard Gary Brautigan'''  (January 30, 1935 –  c.<!-- The abbreviation c. 'approximately' is used in citing a date which is not known exactly. --> September 16, 1984) was an American novelist, poet, and short story writer. A prolific writer, he wrote throughout his life and published ten novels, two collections of short stories, and four books of poetry. Brautigan's work has been published both in the United States and internationally throughout Europe, Japan, and China. He is best known for his novels ''[[Trout Fishing in America]]'' (1967), ''[[In Watermelon Sugar]]'' (1968), and ''[[The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966]]'' (1971). 

Brautigan began his career as a poet, with his first collection being published in 1957. He made his debut as a novelist with ''[[A Confederate General from Big Sur]]'' (1964), about a seemingly delusional man who believes himself to be the descendant of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general from [[Big Sur]]. Brautigan would go on to publish numerous prose and poetry collections until 1982. He died by suicide in 1984.

==Early life==
===Background===
Brautigan was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], the only child of Bernard Frederick "Ben" Brautigan Jr. (July 29, 1908 – May 27, 1994), a factory worker and laborer, and Lulu Mary "Mary Lou" Keho (April 7, 1911 – September 24, 2005), a waitress. In May 1934, eight months before Richard's birth, Bernard and Mary Lou separated. Brautigan said that he met his biological father only twice, although after Richard's death, Bernard was said to be unaware that Richard was his child, saying "He's got the same last name, but why would they wait 45 to 50 years to tell me I've got a son?"<ref>"[http://www.brautigan.net/obituaries.html#bernard2 Brautigan.]" UPI News. October 27, 1984.</ref>

In 1938, Brautigan and his mother began living with a man named Arthur Martin Titland. The couple produced a daughter named Barbara Ann, born on May 1, 1939, in Tacoma. Brautigan claimed that he had a very traumatic experience when, at age six, his mother left him and his two-year-old sister unattended in a motel room in [[Great Falls, Montana]], for two days.

On January 20, 1943, Mary Lou married a fry cook named Robert Geoffrey Porterfield. The couple had a daughter named Sandra Jean, born April 1, 1945, at Salem General Hospital in Salem, Oregon.<ref name=jubilee/> Mary Lou told Brautigan that Porterfield was his biological father, and Brautigan began using ''Richard Gary Porterfield'' as his name. Mary Lou separated from Porterfield in 1946, and married William David Folston Sr. on June 12, 1950. The couple produced a son named William David Jr., born on December 19, 1950, in Eugene. Folston was recalled as being a violent alcoholic, whom Richard had seen [[domestic abuse|abusing]] his mother.

Brautigan was raised in poverty; he told his daughter stories of his mother sifting rat feces out of their supply of flour before making flour-and-water pancakes.<ref name="Ianthe">Brautigan, Ianthe: ''You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir.'' St. Martin's Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-84195-025-4}}.</ref> Brautigan's family found it difficult to obtain food, and on some occasions they did not eat for days. The family lived on [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and moved about the [[Pacific Northwest]] for nine years before settling in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in August 1944. Many of Brautigan's childhood experiences are included in the poems and stories that he wrote from as early as the age of 12. His novel ''[[So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away]]'' is loosely based on childhood experiences, including an incident in which Brautigan accidentally shot the brother of a close friend in the ear, injuring him only slightly.

On September 12, 1950, Brautigan enrolled at [[Eugene High School]], having graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson Junior High School (Eugene, Oregon)|Woodrow Wilson Junior High School]]. He wrote for his high school newspaper, the ''Eugene High School News''. He also played on his school's basketball team, and stood {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} tall by the time of his graduation. On December 19, 1952, Brautigan's first published poem, "The Light", appeared in the school newspaper. Brautigan graduated with honors from Eugene High School on June 9, 1953. After graduation, he moved in with his best friend Peter Webster, and Peter's mother Edna Webster became a surrogate mother to Brautigan. According to several accounts, Brautigan stayed with Webster for about a year before leaving for San Francisco for the first time in August 1954. He returned to Oregon several times, apparently for lack of money.<ref name=BrautBio>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/biography.html|title=Biography|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|access-date=18 December 2007}}</ref>

On December 14, 1955, Brautigan was arrested for throwing a rock through a police station window, supposedly to be sent to prison and fed. He was arrested for [[disorderly conduct]] and fined $25. He was then committed to the [[Oregon State Hospital]] on December 24, 1955, after police noticed patterns of erratic behavior.

At the Oregon State Hospital Brautigan was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and clinical depression, and was treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] 12 times.<ref>Enzinna, Wes, "Man Underwater", ''Harper's Magazine''. December 2012: 76–80.</ref> While institutionalized, he began writing ''The God of the Martians'', a manuscript of 20 very short chapters totaling 600 words. The manuscript was sent to at least two editors but was rejected by both, and remains unpublished.<ref name="brautigan.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/novels.html |title=Richard Brautigan: Novels—Introduction |publisher=Brautigan.net |date=August 27, 1956 |access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> (A copy of the manuscript was recently discovered with the papers of the last of those editors, [[Harry Hooton]].) On February 19, 1956, Brautigan was released from the hospital and briefly lived with his mother, stepfather, and siblings in Eugene. He then left for San Francisco, where he would spend most of the rest of his life except for periods in Tokyo and [[Montana]].<ref name=BrautBio/><ref name=brautigan>{{cite book|title=Richard Brautigan: Essays on the Writings and Life|first=John F.|last=Barber|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=McFarland & Co.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7864-2525-9|pages=25, 99, 225, 253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsXuel52NFsC&q=montana+&pg=PA225}}</ref>

==Career==
In San Francisco, Brautigan sought to establish himself as a writer. He was known for handing out his poetry on the streets and performing at poetry clubs. In early 1956, Brautigan typed a three-page manuscript and sent it to [[The Macmillan Company]] for publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/speciality.html |title=Richard Brautigan: Speciality Publications of His Writings |publisher=Brautigan.net |access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> The manuscript consisted of two pages with 14 poems and a page with the dedication "for Linda". Of the poems, only "stars" and "hey" were titled. In a letter dated May 10, 1956, Macmillan rejected the manuscript, stating, "... there is no place where it will fit in". In 2005, the X-Ray Book Company published the manuscript as a [[chapbook]] titled ''Desire in a Bowl of Potatoes''.

Brautigan's first poetry book publication was ''[[The Return of the Rivers]]'' (1957),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/rivers.html |title=Richard Brautigan: The Return of the Rivers |publisher=Brautigan.net |date=September 11, 1957 |access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> a single poem, followed by two collections of poetry: ''[[The Galilee Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1958) and ''[[Lay the Marble Tea]]'' (1959). During the 1960s Brautigan became involved in the burgeoning San Francisco [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture scene]], often appearing as a performance poet at concerts and participating in the various activities of [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]. He contributed several short pieces to be used as broadsides by the Communication Company. Brautigan was also a writer for  ''Change'', an [[underground newspaper]] created by [[Ron Loewinsohn]].

In the summer of 1961, while camping in southern Idaho with his wife and daughter, Brautigan completed the novels ''[[A Confederate General From Big Sur]]'' and ''[[Trout Fishing in America]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/trout.html|title=Richard Brautigan: Trout Fishing in America|website=brautigan.net|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>[[Little Redfish Lake]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}} ''A Confederate General from Big Sur'' was his first published novel and met with little critical or commercial success. But when  ''Trout Fishing in America'' was published in 1967, Brautigan was catapulted to international fame. Literary critics labeled him the writer most representative of the emerging countercultural youth movement of the late 1960s, even though he was said to be contemptuous of [[hippies]].<ref name=BrautMemoirs>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/memoirs.html#wright|title=Memoirs|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|access-date=18 December 2007}}</ref> ''Trout Fishing in America'' has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.

During the 1960s Brautigan published four collections of poetry as well as another novel, ''[[In Watermelon Sugar]]'' (1968). In the spring of 1967 he was Poet-in-Residence at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. During this year, he published ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (poetry collection)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', a chapbook published by The Communication Company. It was printed in an edition of 1,500 copies and distributed free. From 1968 to 1970 Brautigan had 23 short pieces published in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.<ref>[http://brautigan.cybernetic-meadows.net/tiki-index.php?page=Rolling%20Stone ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001091828/http://brautigan.cybernetic-meadows.net/tiki-index.php?page=Rolling%20Stone |date=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> From late 1968 to February 1969, Brautigan recorded a spoken-word album for [[The Beatles]]' short-lived record-label, [[Zapple]]. The label was shut down by [[Allen Klein]] before the recording could be released, but it was eventually released in 1970 on [[Harvest Records]] as ''Listening to Richard Brautigan''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/recordings.html#listening|title=Recordings|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|access-date=18 December 2007}}</ref>

In the 1970s Brautigan experimented with literary genres. He published five novels (the first of which, ''[[The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966]]'', had been written in the mid-1960s) and a collection of short stories, ''[[Revenge of the Lawn]]'' (1971). In 1974 The Cowell Press collected seven of his broadside poems into the book ''Seven Watermelon Suns''. The limited edition of ten copies included embossed color etchings by Ellen Meske.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21guitars.com/documents/brautigan.html |title=Richard Brautigan |publisher=21guitars.com |date=January 30, 1935 |access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> "When the 1960s ended, he was the [[Throw out the baby with the bath water|baby thrown out with the bath water]]," said his friend and fellow writer, [[Thomas McGuane]]. "He was a gentle, troubled, deeply odd guy." Generally dismissed by literary critics and increasingly abandoned by his readers, Brautigan's popularity waned throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. His work remained popular in Europe, however, as well as in Japan, where Brautigan visited several times.<ref name=Braut70>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/chronology1970.html|title=Biography: 1970s|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|access-date=18 December 2007}}</ref> To his critics, Brautigan was willfully naive. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] said of him, "As an editor I was always waiting for Richard to grow up as a writer. It seems to me he was essentially a naïf, and I don't think he cultivated that childishness, I think it came naturally. It was like he was much more in tune with the trout in America than with people."<ref name=Manso>Manso, Peter; McClure, Michael. "Brautigan's Wake." ''Vanity Fair'', May 1985: 62–68, 112–116.</ref>

Brautigan's writings are characterized by a remarkable and humorous imagination. The permeation of inventive metaphors lent even his prose works the feeling of poetry. Evident also are themes of [[Zen]] Buddhism like the duality of the past and the future and the impermanence of the present. Zen Buddhism and elements of the Japanese culture can be found in his novel ''Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel''. Brautigan's last publication before his death in 1984 was his novel ''[[So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away]]'', published in 1982.{{original research|date=August 2020}}

''The Edna Webster Collection of Undiscovered Writings'' was published in 1999. This collection of writings was gifted by a twenty-one year old Richard Brautigan to Edna Webster in 1955, when he left Oregon for San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Edna Webster collection of undiscovered writings|last=Richard.|first=Brautigan|date=1999|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Webster, Edna.|isbn=0395974690|location=Boston|oclc=41412011|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ednawebstercolle0000brau}}</ref>

In 2002, a proposed edition of Brautigan's collected poems was rejected by his estate.<ref>''Richard Brautigan: Essays on the Writings and Life'' (McFarland, 2007), p. 188.</ref> In November 2016 the French publisher Le Castor Astral published a bilingual edition entitled ''Tout ce que j'ai à déclarer: œuvre poétique complète.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castorastral.com/livre/cest-jai-a-declarer/|title=C'est tout ce que j'ai à déclarer|website=castorastral.com|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On June 8, 1957, Brautigan married Virginia Dionne Alder in [[Reno, Nevada]]. The couple had one daughter together, [[Ianthe Elizabeth Brautigan]], born on March 25, 1960, in San Francisco. Brautigan's alcoholism and depression caused him to become increasingly abusive<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2009/12/25/virginia-aste/|title="Freedom?": Richard Brautigan's first wife, VIRGINIA ASTE, speaks in a new interview|date=December 26, 2009|website=arthurmag.com|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref> and Alder ended the relationship on December 24, 1962, though the divorce was not finalized until July 28, 1970. Brautigan continued to reside in San Francisco after the separation, while Alder settled in [[Manoa, Hawaii]], and became a [[feminism|feminist]] and an [[opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] activist.

Brautigan remarried on December 1, 1977, to the Japanese-born Akiko Yoshimura, whom he met in July 1976 while living in Tokyo. The couple settled in Pine Creek, [[Park County, Montana]], for two years. Brautigan and Yoshimura divorced in 1980.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Brautigan had a relationship with Marcia Clay of San Francisco from 1981 to 1982. He also pursued a brief relationship with Janice Meissner, a woman from the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] community of San Francisco. Other relationships were with Marcia Pacaud, who appears on the cover of ''[[The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster]]''; Valerie Estes, who appears on the cover of ''Listening to Richard Brautigan''; and Sherry Vetter, who appears on the cover of ''Revenge of the Lawn''.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Brautigan was an alcoholic throughout his adult life and suffered years of despair; according to his daughter, he often mentioned suicide over a period of more than a decade before ending his life.<ref name="Ianthe"/>

In 1984, at age 49, Richard Brautigan had moved to [[Bolinas, California]], where he was living alone in a large, old house that he had bought with his earnings years earlier. He died of a self-inflicted [[.44 Magnum]] gunshot wound to the head. His decomposed body was found by Robert Yench, a friend and private investigator, on October 25, 1984. The body was found on the living room floor, in front of a large window that, though shrouded by trees, looked out over the Pacific Ocean. Due to the decomposition of the body it is speculated that Brautigan had ended his life over a month earlier, on September 16, 1984, days after talking to friend Marcia Clay on the telephone (neighbors heard a loud noise that Sunday while watching an NFL game<ref name=jubilee>{{Cite book

According to Michael Caines, writing in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the story that Brautigan left a suicide note that simply read: "Messy, isn't it?" is apocryphal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suicide – The Ultimate Choice|url=http://siliclone.tripod.com/books/elvis/E061.html|work=Scot & Silicone}}</ref> Ianthe Brautigan has confirmed that her father did not leave such a message.<ref>Caines, Michael.

==Legacy==
Because Brautigan frequently wrote in first-person and included locations and events with which he is associated, readers might assume his work is autobiographical. Writing in 1972, Long Island University professor Terrence Malley points out that "Brautigan's books are for the most part both directly autobiographical and curiously elusive . . . It's usually difficult to separate confession from whimsy in Brautigan's writing" (18).<ref>Malley, Terence. Richard Brautigan. Writers for the Seventies. New York: Warner Paperback Library, 1972</ref> 

Several later authors have cited Brautigan as an influence, including [[Haruki Murakami]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/murakami/site.php?id= |title=Haruki Murakami |publisher=Randomhouse.com |access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> [[W.

The Library for Unpublished Works envisioned by Brautigan in his novel ''The Abortion'' was housed at the Brautigan Library in [[Burlington, Vermont]], until 1995 when it was moved to the nearby Fletcher Free Library where it remained until 2005. Although there were plans to move it to the Presidio branch of the San Francisco Public Library, these never materialized. However, after an agreement was made between Brautigan's daughter, Ianthe Brautigan, and the [[Clark County Historical Museum]] (in Vancouver, Washington), the Brautigan Library was moved to the museum in 2010.<ref>[http://www.brautigan.net/legacy.html#library ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229134613/http://www.brautigan.net/legacy.html#library |date=December 29, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news

The short story 'Your Clothes are Dead' by [[Dave McKean]], included in a collection of short comics called [[Pictures That Tick]], is about a meeting provoked by memories of, and buying a copy of, Brautigan's [[The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966|''The Abortion: An Historical Romance'']].

Brautigan's daughter, [[Ianthe Elizabeth Brautigan]], describes her memories of her father in her book ''You Can't Catch Death'' (2000).

In March 2018, poet Francis Daulerio published "Please Plant This Book" – a reinterpretation of and homage to Brautigan's [[Please Plant This Book|book of the same name]] on its 50th anniversary. The book contained seeds to be planted, packed in sleeves which carry poems by Daulerio and illustrations by [[Scott Hutchison]]. Profits from the book were to go to The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Hutchison took his own life in May 2018, and in September an expanded version of the book was published, after the original edition had sold out.
