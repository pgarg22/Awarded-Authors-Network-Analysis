'''Jacinto Benavente y Martínez''' (12 August 1866 – 14 July 1954) was one of the foremost Spanish dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1922 "for the happy manner in which he has continued the illustrious traditions of the Spanish drama".<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacinto Benavente - Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1922/benavente-facts.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=27 December 2015}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Madrid]], the son of a celebrated pediatrician, he returned drama to reality by way of social criticism: declamatory verse giving way to prose, melodrama to comedy, formula to experience, impulsive action to dialogue and the play of minds. Benavente showed a preoccupation with aesthetics and later with ethics.

A [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[monarchist]] and a critic of [[socialism]], he was a reluctant supporter of [[Francoist Spain]] as the only viable alternative to what he considered the disastrous republican experiment of 1931–1936. In 1936 Benavente's name became associated with the assassination of the Spanish poet and dramatist [[Federico García Lorca]]. This happened when the Nationalist newspapers ''Estampa'', ''El Correo de Andalucia,'' and ''Ideal'' circulated a fake news story that Lorca had been killed as a reprisal for the Republican murder of Benavente.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Ian|title=The Assassination of Federico García Lorca|date=1987|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|pages=152–153}}</ref> Benavente died in Aldeaencabo de Escalona ([[Toledo (province)|Toledo]]) at the age of 87. He never married. According to many sources, he was [[homosexual]].<ref name="villena">{{citation|last=Villena|first=Luis Antonio de (ed.)|year=2002|title=Amores iguales.
