== Quotes about Huth ==
:"Huth inhabits all the lonely people with great compassion and makes them seem unbearably poignant. But she balances delicately, introducing comedy at awful, unlikely moments… Her eye for detail sometimes makes me think of [[Alan Bennett]]." — ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''

:"Huth has an eye for perfect short-story material… She demonstrates an enviable ability to capture in small vignettes the very English quality of 'hanging on in quiet desperation'… A full technicolour storyteller who clearly enjoys herself." ''[[The Spectator]]''
