'''Adolf Bartels''' (15 November 1862 – 7 March 1945) was a pastor,<ref> Thomas Albert Howard, ''Remembering the Reformation: An Inquiry into the Meanings of Protestantism'', (p. 96).</ref> [[German people|German]] journalist and poet.  Known for his ''[[völkisch]]'' worldview, he has been seen as a harbinger of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[anti-Semitism]].<ref name="rs">Roderick

Bartels was born at [[Wesselburen]], in [[Holstein]], and educated at [[Leipzig]] and [[Berlin]].  An artisan's son, Bartels studied literature.  After 1895 a free-lance journalist in [[Weimar]], he gained a reputation as a [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel|Hebbel]] scholar.  In 1897 he wrote a history of German literature that was marked by racist evaluations and rabid antisemitism; it became a pioneering work for National Socialist literary reviews.  According to Bartels, even authors whose names sounded Jewish, who wrote for the "Jewish press", or who were friendly with Jews were "contaminated with Jewishness".  The noblest task of ''völkisch'' cultural policy would therefore be a radical [[de-Jewing]] of the arts, and thus the "salvation of National Socialist Germany" ({{lang-de|National-sozialistisches Deutschlands Rettung}}; 1924). Bartels led a successful campaign to prevent the unveiling of a statue of [[Heinrich Heine]] in 1906. After World War One, Bartels' work experienced an upsurge in popularity, with his followers forming the ''Bartelsbund'' (Bartels Society) to promote his ideas; the Bartelsbund later merged with
[[Erich Ludendorff]]'s [[Tannenbergbund]] group.<ref name="rs" /> Bartels' work achieved "quasi-official" status in Nazi Germany, and Hitler personally awarded Bartels the [[Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches|Adlerschild]] medal, Nazi Germany's highest civilian honour, in 1937.<ref name="rs" />

Bartels died in Weimar on 7 March 1945.  Bartels's further literary productions included ''Die Dithmarscher'' (1898), a historical novel based on his native region advocating [[ruralism]], which sold over 200,000 copies by 
the 1920s,<ref>[[Richard J. Evans]], ''[[The Coming of the Third Reich]]''.  2004, Penguin Books, London.  {{ISBN|0-14-100975-6}}  (p. 122).</ref> and ''[[Martin Luther]]'' (1903).
