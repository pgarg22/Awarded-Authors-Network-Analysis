'''Lucas Fernández''' (c. 1474 – 1542) was a Spanish dramatist and musician, writer in [[Leonese language]].

He was born and educated at [[Salamanca]], and was a professor of music there from 1522.

The surviving work of Lucas Fernández consists of six plays.  Although showing the influence of his rival [[Juan del Encina]], they are notable for their dialogue, humor, and the effective interleaving of song and music with the action of play. The best of the works is an Easter play ''Auto de la Pasión'', while his ''Dialogo para cantar'' is an early example of the [[zarzuela]].
