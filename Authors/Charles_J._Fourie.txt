==Writing==
{{over-quotation|section|date=July 2015}}
Fourie's early writing has been compared by literary and theatre critics with that of [[Athol Fugard]] and [[Sam Shepard|Sam Shephard]]. Other notable literary influences on his early plays are [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Anton Chekhov|Antonin Chekov]] and [[Jean Genet]].

“Comparisons with Athol Fugard – the granddaddy of South African theater – are inevitable, and indeed that towering presence lurks behind this drama in which black meets white at close quarters during the final years of [[apartheid]]."  (Mark Cook – ''[[London Evening Standard|This Is London]]'' – review of ''Big Boys''){{volume needed|date=July 2015}}

“Unlike his compatriot, Athol Fugard, he has the knack of simplification, a major talent in this country these days." – (Paul Nelson – ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' – review of 'Big Boys'){{volume needed|date=July 2015}}
 
His stories engage socio-political themes in award-winning plays like ''Big Boys'', ''Vrygrond'', ''Stander'', ''Vrededorp'', ''Kurtz'', ''The Parrot Woman'',<ref name="Broadway World">{{cite web|title=Charles J.

“Florence Jenkins must rate pretty high on the all-time best list and writer Charles J. Fourie has done grandly in devising a show which leaves little unturned in his depiction of the life and times of the American opera diva [[Florence Foster Jenkins]], a character if ever there was one." (Wilhelm Snyman – ''[[Cape Times]]'' – review of ''Goddess of Song'')

Fourie was the first writer to bring Jenkins' story to the stage professionally and in 2015 a film based on her life will be released featuring Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant with director Stephen Frears.

His play ''Sacrifice'' was staged in 2013 in both Afrikaans and English to critical acclaim with actor [[imdbname:0125089|Peter Butler]] in the lead.

“The play examines the painful twins of vengeance and sacrifice, and explores how a young man can be driven to kill in order to avenge his sister’s rape.  It attempts to explain the reasons for the tension between some communities of white South Africans and the deep-rooted fear they have that black people are out to kill them. " (Nelisa Ngqulana – ''[[Whatson]]'' – review of ''Sacrifice''){{volume needed|date=July 2015}}

In 2014 he wrote the one-man play ''Happy'' which premiered at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival where after it toured to Cape Town and Pretoria. The play is currently being adapted into a film script for production in 2022.

“South Africa has never dealt adequately with its obsession with race. To that end the second production, which details the story of Happy Sindane, is as fascinating as it is tragic." (Benn van der Westhuizen – ''[[Artslink]]'' – review of ''Happy''){{volume needed|date=July 2015}}

2014 also saw the re-staging of ''Ella's Horses'' at the Grahamstown National Arts festival where it received a Standarbank Ovation award, with subsequent performances in Cape Town during 2015, and a new tour is planned in 2017.

“Ella’s Horses is a strange chronicle of the determinedly solitary Scottish émigré, Ella Gordon, and her confidant, Reverend Schaberg. Famed theatre and television actress Deirdre Wolhuter spins a stirring take on Ella’s cantankerous and headstrong philosophical beliefs. Leonard Moss’ Reverend Schaberg vies for the spotlight, and at times emerges as the victor with his absolute ‘voice of reason’ proverbs." (Benn van der Westhuizen – ''[[Whatson]]'' – review of ''Ella's Horses''){{volume needed|date=July 2015}}

==Plays and adaptations==
