'''Djuna Barnes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|n|aː}}, June 12, 1892 – June 18, 1982) was an American artist, illustrator, journalist, and writer who is perhaps best known for her novel ''[[Nightwood]]'' (1936), a cult classic of [[Lesbian literature|lesbian fiction]] and an important work of [[Literary modernism|modernist literature]].<ref name="Parsons, 165-6">Parsons, 165-6.</ref>

In 1913, Barnes began her career as a freelance journalist and illustrator for the ''[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]''.<ref>Herring, 66, 75.</ref> By early 1914, Barnes was a highly sought feature reporter, interviewer, and illustrator whose work appeared in the city's leading newspapers and periodicals.<ref name="Parsons, 166">Parsons, 166.</ref> Later, Barnes's talent and connections with prominent [[Greenwich Village]] bohemians afforded her the opportunity to publish her prose, poems, illustrations, and one-act plays in both avant-garde literary journals and popular magazines, and publish an illustrated volume of poetry, ''The Book of Repulsive Women'' (1915).<ref name="Parsons, 166"/><ref>Messerli, 3.</ref>

In 1921, a lucrative commission with ''[[McCall's]]'' took Barnes to Paris, where she lived for the next 10 years.<ref name="Parsons, 166"/> In this period she published ''A Book'' (1923), a collection of poetry, plays, and short stories, which was later reissued, with the addition of three stories, as ''A Night Among the Horses'' (1929), ''[[Ladies Almanack]]'' (1928), and ''[[Ryder (novel)|Ryder]]'' (1928).<ref>Messerli, 4-11.</ref>

During the 1930s, Barnes spent time in England, Paris, New York, and North Africa.<ref>Herring, xxv.</ref> It was during this restless time that she wrote and published ''Nightwood''. In October 1939, after nearly two decades living mostly in Europe, Barnes returned to New York.<ref>Herring, 247.</ref> She published her last major work, the verse play ''[[The Antiphon]]'', in 1958, and she died in her apartment at Patchin Place, Greenwich Village in June 1982.<ref>Messerli, 15.</ref><ref>Herring, 311.</ref>

==Life and writing==

===Early life (1892–1912)===

Barnes was born in a log cabin on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]], near [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York]]. Her paternal grandmother [[Zadel Barnes Gustafson|Zadel Barnes]] was a writer, journalist, and [[Women's Suffrage]] activist who had once hosted an influential [[salon (gathering)|literary salon]]. Her father, Wald Barnes (born Henry Aaron Budington),<ref>Barnes's father was born Henry Aaron Budington but used a variety of names during his life, including Wald Barnes and Brian Eglington Barnes. Herring, 4.</ref> was an unsuccessful composer, musician, and painter. An advocate of [[polygamy]], he married Barnes's mother Elizabeth J. Barnes (née Chappell) in 1889; his mistress Frances "Fanny" Clark moved in with them in 1897, when Barnes was five.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elizabeth Chappell Barnes, wearing a hat -- (On verso: "Mother about April 1936."), April 1936 {{!}} Archival Collections|url=https://archives.lib.umd.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/10176|access-date=2020-10-13|website=archives.lib.umd.edu}}</ref> They had eight children (five from Elizabeth: sons Thurn, Zendon, Saxon and Shangar and daughter Djuna; four from Fanny: sons Duane and Brian and daughters Muriel and Sheila), whom Wald made little effort to support financially. One half-sibling died in childhood. Zadel, who believed her son was a misunderstood artistic genius, struggled to provide for the entire family, supplementing her diminishing income by writing begging letters to friends and acquaintances.<ref>Herring, 5–29.</ref>

As the second oldest child, Barnes spent much of her childhood helping care for siblings and half-siblings. She received her early education at home, mostly from her father and grandmother, who taught her writing, art, and music but neglected subjects such as math and spelling.<ref>Herring, xviii.</ref> She claimed to have had no formal schooling at all; some evidence suggests that she was enrolled in public school for a time after age ten, though her attendance was inconsistent.<ref>Herring, 40.</ref>

It is possible that at the age of 16 she was raped, either by a neighbor with the knowledge and consent of her father, or possibly by her father. However, these are rumors and unconfirmed by Barnes, who never managed to complete her autobiography. What is known is that Barnes and her father continued to write warm letters to one another until his death in 1934. Barnes does refer to a rape obliquely in her first novel ''Ryder'' and more directly in her furious final play ''The Antiphon''. Sexually explicit references in correspondence from her grandmother, with whom she shared a bed for years, suggest incest, or overly familiar teasing, but Zadel—dead for 40 years by the time ''The Antiphon'' was written&mdash;was left out of its indictments.<ref>Herring, xvi–xvii, 54–57, 268–271.</ref> Shortly before her 18th birthday she reluctantly "married" Fanny Clark's brother Percy Faulkner in a private ceremony without benefit of clergy. He was 52. The match had been strongly promoted by her father, grandmother, mother, and brother, but she stayed with him for no more than two months.<ref>Herring, xxiv, 59–61.</ref>

===New York City (1912–1921)===
In 1912 Barnes's family, facing financial ruin, split up. Elizabeth moved to New York City with Barnes and three of her brothers, then filed for divorce, freeing Wald to marry Fanny Clark. The move gave Barnes an opportunity to study art formally for the first time; she attended the [[Pratt Institute]] for about six months from 1912 to 1913 and at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Student's League of New York]] from 1915 to 1916,<ref name="Djuna Barnes papers ArchivesUM">{{Cite web|url=https://digital.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=MdU.ead.litms.0021.xml|title=Djuna Barnes papers > ArchivesUM|website=digital.lib.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}</ref> but the need to support herself and her family—a burden that fell largely on her—soon drove her to leave school and take a job as a reporter at the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]''. Upon arriving at the ''Daily Eagle'', Barnes declared, "I can draw and write, and you'd be a fool not to hire me", words that were inscribed inside the [[Brooklyn Museum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Klarl|first=Joseph|title=Djuna Barnes: Newspaper Fiction: The New York Journalism of Djuna Barnes, 1913–1919|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=April 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/04/artseen/djuna-barnes-newspaper-fiction-the-new-york-journalism-of-djuna-barnes-19131919}}</ref>

Over the next few years her work appeared in almost every newspaper in New York, including the ''[[New York Press]]'', ''The World'' and ''McCall's''; she wrote interviews, features, theatre reviews, and a variety of news stories, often illustrating them with her own drawings. She also published short fiction in the ''New York Morning Telegraph''{{'}}s Sunday supplement and in the [[pulp magazine]] ''All-Story Cavalier Weekly''.<ref>Herring, 40–41, 64–66, 75–76, 84–87.</ref>
[[Image:Djuna Barnes Clipping.jpg|thumb|left|Clipping from ''World Magazine'', September 6, 1914]]
Much of Barnes's journalism was subjective and experiential. Writing about a conversation with [[James Joyce]], she admitted to missing part of what he said because her attention had wandered, though she revered Joyce's writing. Interviewing the successful playwright [[Donald Ogden Stewart]], she shouted at him for "roll[ing] over and find[ing] yourself famous" while other writers continued to struggle, then said she wouldn't mind dying; as her biographer Phillip Herring points out, this is "a depressing and perhaps unprecedented note on which to end an interview."<ref>Herring, 96–101.</ref> For "The Girl and the Gorilla", published by ''New York World Magazine'' in October 1914 she has a conversation with Dinah, a female gorilla at the [[Bronx Zoo]].

For another article in ''New York World'' in 1914, she submitted to [[force-feeding]], a technique then being used on [[Hunger strike|hunger-striking]] [[suffragettes|suffragists]]. Barnes wrote "If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits." She concluded "I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex."<ref name="Mills">Mills, 163–166.</ref>

While she mocked conservative suffrage activist [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] when Catt admonished would-be suffrage orators never to "hold a militant pose", or wear "a dress that shows your feet in front",<ref>Green, 82; Espley.</ref> Barnes was supportive of progressive suffragists. Barnes suggested that Catt's conservatism was an obstacle to the suffrage movement when Catt tried to ostracize fellow suffragists [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]], who sought the vote for women through media attention directed at their strikes and non-violent protesting. It was their mistreatment that motivated Barnes to experience for herself the torture of being force-fed.<ref name="NPR.org">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/16/154846844/embracing-the-quirkiness-of-djuna-barnes|title=Embracing The Quirkiness Of Djuna Barnes|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}</ref>

Barnes immersed herself in risky situations in order to access experiences that a previous generation of homebound women had been denied. Writing about the traditionally masculine domain of [[boxing]] from the ringside, Barnes explored boxing as a window into women's modern identities. In 1914, she first posed the question "What do women want at a fight?" in an article titled "My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight" published in ''New York World'' magazine.<ref>Gammel, "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bloomsbury/cash/2012/00000009/00000003/art00004?crawler=true Lacing up the Gloves]", 376.</ref> According to [[Irene Gammel]], "Barnes' essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women".<ref>Gammel, "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bloomsbury/cash/2012/00000009/00000003/art00004?crawler=true Lacing up the Gloves]", p. 377.</ref> Barnes's interest in boxing continued into 1915 when she interviewed heavyweight champion [[Jess Willard]].<ref>http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bloomsbury/cash/2012/00000009/00000003/art00004?crawler=true Lacing up the Gloves</ref>[[Image:Djuna Barnes - Villager.gif|thumb|right|This satirical drawing of a dandyish Greenwich Village resident accompanied Barnes's 1916 article "How the Villagers Amuse Themselves".]]
In 1915 Barnes moved out of her family's flat to an apartment in Greenwich Village, where she entered a thriving [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] community of artists and writers.<ref name="Djuna Barnes papers ArchivesUM"/> Among her social circle were [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Berenice Abbott]], and the [[Dadaist]] artist and poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]], whose biography Barnes tried to write but never finished. She came into contact with [[Guido Bruno]], an entrepreneur and promoter who published magazines and [[chapbook]]s from his garret on [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]]. Bruno had a reputation for unscrupulousness, and was often accused of exploiting Greenwich Village residents for profit&mdash;he used to charge tourists admission to watch Bohemians paint&mdash;but he was a strong opponent of censorship and was willing to risk prosecution by publishing Barnes's 1915 collection of "rhythms and drawings"<ref>http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/barnes/repulsive/repulsive.html</ref>

Despite a description of sex between women in the first poem, the book was never legally challenged; the passage seems explicit now, but at a time when lesbianism was virtually invisible in American culture, the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] may not have understood its imagery.<ref>Field, 65–76.</ref> Others were not as naïve, and Bruno was able to cash in on the book's reputation by raising the price from fifteen to fifty cents and pocketing the difference.<ref>Barnes, ''Collected Poems'', 43.</ref> Twenty years later Barnes used Bruno as one of the models for Felix Volkbein in ''Nightwood'', caricaturing his pretensions to nobility and his habit of bowing down before anyone titled or important.<ref>Field, 77–78.</ref>
[[Image:Djuna Barnes - Well of the Saints.png|thumb|left|Illustration by Barnes of a scene from J. M. Synge's play ''[[The Well of the Saints]]'']]
Barnes was a member of the [[Provincetown Players]], an amateur theatrical collective whose emphasis on artistic rather than commercial success meshed well with her own values. The Players' Greenwich Village theater was a converted stable with bench seating and a tiny stage; according to Barnes it was "always just about to be given back to the horses." Yet it played a significant role in the development of American drama, featuring works by [[Susan Glaspell]], [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Wallace Stevens]], and [[Theodore Dreiser]], as well as launching the career of [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Three one-act plays by Barnes were produced there in 1919 and 1920; a fourth, ''The Dove'', premiered at Smith College in 1925, and a series of short [[closet drama]]s were published in magazines, some under Barnes's pseudonym Lydia Steptoe.

These plays show the strong influence of the Irish playwright [[J. M. Synge]]; she was drawn to both the poetic quality of Synge's language and the pessimism of his vision. Critics have found them derivative, particularly those in which she tried to imitate Synge's Irish dialect, and Barnes may have agreed, since in later years she dismissed them as mere [[juvenilia]].<ref>Herring, 118–126. Similar opinions of the early plays are expressed by Field, 92, Retallack, 49, and Messerli.</ref> Yet in their content, these stylized and enigmatic early plays are more experimental than those of her fellow playwrights at Provincetown.<ref>Larabee, 37; see also Messerli.</ref> A ''New York Times'' review by [[Alexander Woollcott]] of her play ''Three From the Earth'' called it a demonstration of "how absorbing and essentially dramatic a play can be without the audience ever knowing what, if anything, the author is driving at ... The spectators sit with bated breath listening to each word of a playlet of which the darkly suggested clues leave the mystery unsolved."<ref>Quoted in Field, 90.</ref>

Greenwich Village in the 1910s was known for its atmosphere of sexual as well as intellectual freedom. Barnes was unusual among Villagers in having been raised with a philosophy of [[free love]], espoused both by her grandmother and her father. Her father's idiosyncratic vision had included a commitment to unlimited procreation, which she strongly rejected; criticism of childbearing would become a major theme in her work.<ref>Field, 169.</ref> She did, however, retain sexual freedom as a value. In the 1930s she told Antonia White that "she had no feeling of guilt whatever about sex, about going to bed with any man or woman she wanted";<ref>Herring, 239.</ref> correspondence indicates that by the time she was 21 her family was well aware of her bisexuality,<ref>Herring, 71.</ref> and she had a number of affairs with both men and women during her Greenwich Village years.

Of these, the most important was probably her engagement to [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]], a Harvard graduate who ran the American branch of his family's art publishing house. Hanfstaengl had once given a piano concert at the White House and was a friend of then-New York State Senator [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], but he became increasingly angered by anti-German sentiment in the United States during World War I. In 1916, he told Barnes he wanted a German wife; the painful breakup became the basis of a deleted scene in ''Nightwood''. He later returned to Germany and became a close associate of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Starting in 1916 or 1917, she lived with a [[socialist]] philosopher and critic named Courtenay Lemon, whom she referred to as her common-law husband, but this too ended, for reasons that are unclear. She also had a passionate romantic relationship with Mary Pyne, a reporter for the ''New York Press'' and fellow member of the Provincetown Players. Pyne died of tuberculosis in 1919, attended by Barnes until the end.<ref>Herring, ''Djuna'', 66–74 and 108–112.</ref>

===Paris (1921–1930)===

In the 1920s, Paris was the center of [[modernism]] in art and literature.<ref>Quoted in Kennedy, 185.</ref> Barnes first traveled there in 1921 on an assignment for ''McCall's''. She interviewed her fellow [[expatriate]] writers and artists for U.S. periodicals and soon became a well-known figure on the local scene; her black cloak and her acerbic wit are remembered in many memoirs of the time. Even before her first novel was published, her literary reputation was already high, largely on the strength of her story "A Night Among the Horses," which was published in ''The Little Review'' and reprinted in her 1923 collection ''A Book''.<ref>Flanner, xvii.</ref> She was part of the inner circle of the influential salon hostess [[Natalie Clifford Barney|Natalie Barney]], who became a lifelong friend and patron, as well as the central figure in Barnes's satiric chronicle of Paris lesbian life, ''Ladies Almanack.'' The most important relationship of Barnes's Paris years was with the artist [[Thelma Wood]]. Wood was a Kansas native who had come to Paris to become a sculptor, but at Barnes's suggestion took up [[silverpoint]] instead, producing drawings of animals and plants that one critic compared to [[Henri Rousseau]]. By the winter of 1922 they had set up housekeeping together in a flat on the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]].<ref>Herring, 130–58.</ref> Another close friendship that developed during this time was with the Dada artist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, with whom Barnes began an intensive correspondence in 1923.<ref>Gammel, ''[http://ryerson.ca/mlc/inside29.html Baroness Elsa]'', 343.</ref> "Where Wood gave Barnes a doll as a gift to represent their symbolic love child, the Baroness proposed an erotic marriage whose love-child would be their book."<ref>Gammel, ''[http://ryerson.ca/mlc/inside29.html Baroness Elsa]'', 348-349.</ref> From Paris, Barnes supported the Baroness in Berlin with money, clothing, and magazines. She also collected the Baroness's poems and letters.

[[Image:Djuna Barnes - Joyce.gif|thumb|right|Barnes's drawing of James Joyce illustrated her 1922 interview with him in ''Vanity Fair''.]]
Barnes arrived in Paris with a letter of introduction to [[James Joyce]], whom she interviewed for ''Vanity Fair'' and who became a friend. The headline of her ''Vanity Fair'' interview billed him as "the man who is, at present, one of the more significant figures in literature," but her personal reaction to ''Ulysses'' was less guarded: "I shall never write another line ... Who has the nerve to after that?"<ref>Quotations from Field (109) and Whitley, respectively.</ref> It may have been reading Joyce that led Barnes to turn away from the late 19th century [[Decadent movement|Decadent]] and [[Aesthetic]] influences of [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/barnes/repulsive/repulsive.html ''The Book of Repulsive Women''] toward the modernist experimentation of her later work.<ref>Whitley; Herring, 98–102.</ref> They differed, however, on the proper subject of literature; Joyce thought writers should focus on commonplace subjects and make them extraordinary, while Barnes was always drawn to the unusual, even the grotesque.<ref>Herring, 77.</ref> Then, too, her own life was an extraordinary subject. Her autobiographical first novel ''Ryder'' would not only present readers with the difficulty of deciphering its shifting literary styles—a technique inspired by ''Ulysses''—but also with the challenge of piecing together the history of an unconventional polygamous household, far removed from most readers' expectations and experience.<ref>Field, 110.</ref>

Despite the difficulties of the text, ''Ryder''{{'}}s bawdiness drew attention, and it briefly became a ''New York Times'' bestseller. Its popularity caught the publisher unprepared; a first edition of 3,000 sold out quickly, but by the time more copies made it into bookstores, public interest in the book had died down. Still, the advance allowed Barnes to buy a new apartment on Rue Saint-Romain, where she lived with Thelma Wood starting in September 1927. The move made them neighbors of [[Mina Loy]], a friend of Barnes's since Greenwich Village days, who appeared in ''Ladies Almanack'' as Patience Scalpel, the sole heterosexual character, who "could not understand Women and their Ways."<ref>Herring, 141–153. Quotation from Barnes, ''Ladies Almanack'', 11.</ref>

Due to its subject matter, ''Ladies Almanack'' was published in a small, privately printed edition under the pseudonym "A Lady of Fashion." Copies were sold on the streets of Paris by Barnes and her friends, and Barnes managed to smuggle a few into the United States to sell. A bookseller, Edward Titus, offered to carry ''Ladies Almanack'' in his store in exchange for being mentioned on the title page, but when he demanded a share of the royalties on the entire print run, Barnes was furious. She later gave the name Titus to the abusive father in ''The Antiphon''.<ref>Herring, 141–153.</ref>

Barnes dedicated ''Ryder'' and ''Ladies Almanack'' to Thelma Wood, but the year both books were published—1928—was also the year that she and Wood separated. Barnes had wanted their relationship to be monogamous, but had discovered that Wood wanted her "along with the rest of the world."<ref>Letter to Emily Coleman, November 22, 1935. Quoted in Herring, 160.</ref> Wood had a worsening dependency on alcohol, and she spent her nights drinking and seeking out casual sex partners; Barnes would search the cafés for her, often winding up equally drunk. Barnes broke up with Wood over her involvement with heiress Henriette McCrea Metcalf (1888–1981), who would be scathingly portrayed in ''Nightwood'' as Jenny Petherbridge.<ref>Herring, 160–162.</ref>

===1930s===
Much of ''Nightwood'' was written during the summers of 1932 and 1933, while Barnes was staying at Hayford Hall, a country manor in [[Devon]] rented by the art patron [[Peggy Guggenheim]]. Fellow guests included [[Antonia White]], [[John Ferrar Holms]], and the novelist and poet [[Emily Coleman]]. Evenings at the manor—nicknamed "Hangover Hall" by its residents—often featured a party game called Truth that encouraged brutal frankness, creating a tense emotional atmosphere. Barnes was afraid to leave her work in progress unattended because the volatile Coleman, having told Barnes one of her secrets, had threatened to burn the manuscript if Barnes revealed it. But once she had read the book, Coleman became its champion. Her critiques of successive drafts led Barnes to make major structural changes, and when publisher after publisher rejected the manuscript, it was Coleman who pressed [[T. S. Eliot]], then an editor at [[Faber and Faber]], to read it.<ref>Plumb, x–xxv.</ref>

Faber published the book in 1936. Though reviews treated it as a major work of art,<ref>Marcus, "Mousemeat", 204.</ref> the book did not sell well. Barnes received no advance from Faber and the first royalty statement was for only [[Pound sterling|£]]43; the U.S. edition published by [[Harcourt, Brace]] the following year fared no better.<ref>Field, 215.</ref> Barnes had published little journalism in the 1930s and was largely dependent on Peggy Guggenheim's financial support. She was constantly ill and drank more and more heavily—according to Guggenheim, she accounted for a bottle of whiskey per day. In February 1939 she checked into a hotel in London and attempted suicide. Guggenheim funded hospital visits and doctors, but finally lost patience and sent her back to New York. There she shared a single room with her mother, who coughed all night and who kept reading her passages from [[Mary Baker Eddy]], having converted to [[Christian Science]]. In March 1940, her family sent her to a sanatorium in upstate New York to dry out.<ref>Herring, 241–250; Field, 220.</ref> Furious, Barnes began to plan a biography of her family, writing to Emily Coleman that "there is no reason any longer why I should feel for them in any way but hate." This idea would eventually come to fruition in her play ''The Antiphon''. After she returned to New York City, she quarreled bitterly with her mother and was thrown out on the street.<ref>DeSalvo, 247; Herring, 249–250.</ref>

===Return to Greenwich Village (1940–1982)===
[[Image:Patchin Place.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patchin Place]], where Barnes lived for 42 years]]
Left with nowhere else to go, Barnes stayed at Thelma Wood's apartment while Wood was out of town, then spent two months on a working ranch in Arizona with [[Emily Coleman]] and Coleman's lover Jake Scarborough. She returned to New York and, in September, moved into the small apartment at 5 [[Patchin Place]] in Greenwich Village where she would spend the last 41 years of her life.<ref name="Daley">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/20/obituaries/djuna-barnes-dies-poet-and-novelist.html|title=Djuna Barnes Dies; Poet and Novelist|last=Daley|first=Suzanne|date=1982-06-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Throughout the 1940s, she continued to drink and wrote virtually nothing. Guggenheim, despite misgivings, provided her with a small stipend, and Coleman, who could ill afford it, sent US$20 per month (about $310 in 2011). In 1943, Barnes was included in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s show ''[[The Art of This Century gallery#Exhibition by 31 Women|Exhibition by 31 Women]]'' at the [[Art of This Century gallery]] in New York.<ref name="MOMAbook">{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Cornelia H.|last2=Schwartz|first2=Alexandra|title=Modern Women: Women Artists at The Museum of Modern Art|date=2010|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York|isbn=9780870707711|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernwomenwomen0000unse/page/45 45]|url=https://archive.org/details/modernwomenwomen0000unse/page/45}}</ref>
In 1946, she worked for [[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt]] as a manuscript reader, but her reports were invariably caustic, and she was fired.<ref>Herring, 250–253.</ref>

In 1950, realizing that alcoholism had made it impossible for her to function as an artist, Barnes stopped drinking in order to begin work on her verse play ''The Antiphon''. The play drew heavily on her own family history, and the writing was fueled by anger; she said "I wrote ''The Antiphon'' with clenched teeth, and I noted that my handwriting was as savage as a dagger."<ref>Herring, 258–263.</ref> When he read the play, her brother Thurn accused her of wanting "revenge for something long dead and to be forgotten". Barnes, in the margin of his letter, described her motive as "justice", and next to "dead" she inscribed, "not dead".<ref>Herring, 281.</ref>

After ''The Antiphon'', Barnes returned to writing poetry, which she worked and reworked, producing as many as 500 drafts. She wrote eight hours per day despite a growing list of health problems, including arthritis so severe that she had difficulty even sitting at her typewriter or turning on her desk lamp. Many of these poems never were finalized, and only a few were published in her lifetime.<ref>Levine, 186–200.</ref>

During her Patchin Place years, Barnes became a notorious recluse, intensely suspicious of anyone she did not know well. [[E.E.

==Works==
===''The Book of Repulsive Women''===
[[Image:Djuna Barnes - Book of Repulsive Women.png|thumb|right|Illustration from ''The Book of Repulsive Women'']]
Barnes's [[chapbook]] [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/barnes/repulsive/repulsive.html ''The Book of Repulsive Women''] (1915) collects eight "rhythms" and five drawings. The poems show the strong influence of late 19th century [[Decadent movement|Decadence]], and the style of the illustrations resembles [[Aubrey Beardsley]]'s. The setting is New York City, and the subjects are all women: a cabaret singer, a woman seen through an open window from the [[L (New York City Subway service)|elevated train]], and, in the last poem, the corpses of two suicides in the morgue. The book describes women's bodies and sexuality in terms that have indeed struck many readers as repulsive, but, as with much of Barnes's work, the author's stance is ambiguous. Some critics read the poems as exposing and satirizing cultural attitudes toward women.<ref>Benstock, 240–241; Galvin, chapter 5.</ref>

Barnes came to regard ''The Book of Repulsive Women'' as an embarrassment; she called the title "idiotic," left it out of her curriculum vitae, and even burned copies. But because the copyright had never been registered, she was unable to prevent it from being republished, and it became one of her most reprinted works.<ref>Hardie.</ref>

===''[[Ryder]]''===
Barnes's novel ''[[Ryder (novel)|Ryder]]'' (1928) draws heavily on her childhood experiences in Cornwall-on-Hudson. It covers 50 years of history of the Ryder family: Sophia Grieve Ryder, like Zadel a former [[salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess fallen into poverty; her idle son Wendell; his wife Amelia; his resident mistress Kate-Careless; and their children. Barnes appears as Wendell and Amelia's daughter Julie. The story has a large cast and is told from a variety of points of view; some characters appear as the protagonist of a single chapter only to disappear from the text entirely. Fragments of the Ryder family chronicle are interspersed with children's stories, songs, letters, poems, parables, and dreams. The book changes style from chapter to chapter, parodying writers from [[Chaucer]] to [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].<ref>Ponsot, 94–112.</ref>

Both ''Ryder'' and ''Ladies Almanack'' abandon the Beardsleyesque style of her drawings for ''The Book of Repulsive Women'' in favor of a visual vocabulary borrowed from French folk art. Several illustrations are closely based on the engravings and woodcuts collected by Pierre Louis Duchartre and René Saulnier in the 1926 book ''L'Imagerie Populaire''—images that had been copied with variations since medieval times.<ref>Burke, 67–79.</ref> The bawdiness of ''Ryder'''s illustrations led the U.S. Postal Service to refuse to ship it, and several had to be left out of the first edition, including an image in which Sophia is seen urinating into a [[chamberpot]] and one in which Amelia and Kate-Careless sit by the fire knitting [[codpiece]]s. Parts of the text were also expurgated. In an acerbic introduction, Barnes explained that the missing words and passages had been replaced with asterisks so that readers could see the "havoc" wreaked by censorship. A 1990 [[Dalkey Archive Press|Dalkey Archive]] edition restored the missing drawings, but the original text was lost with the destruction of the manuscript in World War II.<ref>Martyniuk, 61–80.</ref>

===''[[Ladies Almanack]]''===
[[Image:Djuna Barnes - Ladies Almanack cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Ladies Almanack'']]
[[Image:H U S - from L'imagerie populaire.png|thumb|right|''H U S'', from ''L'Imagerie Populaire'']]
''[[Ladies Almanack]]'' (1928) is a [[roman à clef]] about a predominantly lesbian social circle centering on [[Natalie Clifford Barney]]'s salon in Paris. It is written in an archaic, [[Rabelaisian]] style, with Barnes's own illustrations in the style of [[Elizabethan]] woodcuts.

Clifford Barney appears as Dame Evangeline Musset, "who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly."<ref>Barnes, ''Ladies Almanack'', 6.</ref> "[A] Pioneer and a Menace" in her youth, Dame Musset has reached "a witty and learned Fifty";<ref>Barnes, ''Ladies Almanack'', 34, 9.</ref> she rescues women in distress, dispenses wisdom, and upon her death is elevated to sainthood. Also appearing pseudonymously are [[Élisabeth de Gramont]], [[Romaine Brooks]], [[Dolly Wilde]], [[Radclyffe Hall]] and her partner [[Una Troubridge]], [[Janet Flanner]] and [[Solita Solano]], and [[Mina Loy]].<ref>Weiss, 151–153.</ref>

The obscure language, inside jokes, and ambiguity of ''Ladies Almanack'' have kept critics arguing about whether it is an affectionate satire or a bitter attack, but Barnes loved the book and reread it throughout her life.<ref>Barnes, ''Ladies Almanack'', xxxii–xxxiv.</ref>

===''[[Nightwood]]''===
Barnes's reputation as a writer was made when ''[[Nightwood]]'' was published in England in 1936 in an expensive edition by [[Faber and Faber]], and in America in 1937 by [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt, Brace and Company]], with an added introduction by [[T.S. Eliot]], Barnes's editor.<ref name="Djuna Barnes papers ArchivesUM"/> The avant-garde novel, written under the patronage of Peggy Guggenheim,<ref name="Djuna Barnes papers ArchivesUM"/> made Barnes famous in feminist circles.<ref name="NPR.org"/>

The novel, set in Paris in the 1920s, revolves around the lives of five characters, two of whom are based on Barnes and Wood, and it reflects the circumstances surrounding the ending of their relationship. In his introduction, Eliot praises Barnes's style, which, while having "prose rhythm&nbsp;... and the musical pattern which is not that of verse, is so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it."

Due to concerns about censorship, Eliot edited ''Nightwood'' to soften some language relating to sexuality and religion. An edition restoring these changes, edited by Cheryl J. Plumb, was published by [[Dalkey Archive Press]] in 1995.

[[Dylan Thomas]] described ''Nightwood'' as "one of the three great prose books ever written by a woman," and [[William Burroughs]] called it "one of the great books of the twentieth century." It was number 12 on a list of the top 100 gay books compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingtriangle.org/100best.asp|title=Publishing Triangle|website=www.publishingtriangle.org|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

===''[[The Antiphon]]''===
Barnes's verse play ''[[The Antiphon]]'' (1958) is set in England in 1939. Jeremy Hobbs, in disguise as Jack Blow, has brought his family together at their ruined ancestral home, Burley Hall. His motive is never explicitly stated, but he seems to want to provoke a confrontation among the members of his family and force them to confront the truth about their past.<ref>Herring, 259.</ref> His sister Miranda is a stage actress, now "out of patron and of money";<ref>Barnes, ''Selected Works'', 101.</ref> her materialistic brothers, Elisha and Dudley, see her as a threat to their financial well-being. Elisha and Dudley accuse their mother Augusta of complicity with their abusive father Titus Hobbs. They take advantage of Jeremy's absence to don animal masks and assault both women, making cruel and sexually suggestive remarks; Augusta treats this attack as a game.<ref>Altman, 279–280.</ref> Jeremy returns with a doll house, a miniature version of the house in America where the children grew up. As she examines it, he charges her with making herself "a madam by submission" because she failed to prevent Titus from orchestrating Miranda's rape by "a travelling Cockney thrice [her] age."<ref>Barnes, ''Selected Works'', 185–186.</ref> The last act finds Miranda and Augusta alone together. Augusta, at once disapproving and envious of her daughter's more liberated life, exchanges clothes with her daughter and wants to pretend she is young again, but Miranda refuses to enter into this play.<ref>Altman, 282</ref> When Augusta hears Elisha and Dudley driving away, she blames Miranda for their abandonment and beats her to death with a [[curfew]] bell, falling dead at her side from the exertion.

The play premiered in 1961 in Stockholm in a Swedish translation by [[Karl Ragnar Gierow]] and U.N. Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]].

The play was translated in French and set at the Odeon Theater in Paris by the “Comedie Française” in March 1990.

===''Creatures in an Alphabet''===
[[Image:Madame Récamier painted by Jacques-Louis David in 1800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Jacques-Louis David's [[portrait of Madame Récamier]]. In ''Creatures in an Alphabet'', Barnes wrote:

{{poemquote|The Seal, she lounges like a bride,
Much too docile, there's no doubt;
Madame Récamier, on side,
(if such she has), and bottom out.}}]]

Barnes's last book, ''Creatures in an Alphabet'' (1982), is a collection of short rhyming poems. The format suggests a children's book, but it contains enough allusiveness and advanced vocabulary to make it an unlikely read for a child: the entry for T quotes [[William Blake|Blake]]'s "[[The Tyger]]," a seal is compared to [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s portrait of [[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier|Madame Récamier]], and a braying donkey is described as "practicing ''[[solfege|solfeggio]]''." ''Creatures'' continues the themes of nature and culture found in Barnes's earlier work, and their arrangement as a bestiary reflects her longstanding interest in systems for organizing knowledge, such as encyclopedias and almanacs.<ref>Casselli, 89–113; Scott, 73, 103–105.</ref>

===Unpublished non-fiction===
During the 1920s and 1930s, Barnes made an effort to write a biography of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven and edited her poems for publication. Unsuccessful in finding a publisher for the Baroness's poetry, Barnes abandoned the project. After writing a number of chapter drafts of the biography, she abandoned that project, too, after submitting the first chapter to [[Emily Coleman]] in 1939, whose response was not encouraging. Barnes's efforts at writing the biography are detailed in [[Irene Gammel]]'s ''Baroness Elsa'' biography.<ref>Gammel, ''[http://ryerson.ca/mlc/inside29.html Baroness Elsa]'', 357-61.</ref>

==Legacy==
Barnes has been cited as an influence by writers as diverse as [[Truman Capote]], [[William Goyen]], [[Karen Blixen]], [[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]], [[Bertha Harris]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[David Foster Wallace]], and [[Anaïs Nin]]. Writer [[Bertha Harris]] described her work as "practically the only available expression of lesbian culture we have in the modern western world" since Sappho.<ref>Harris, Bertha 'The More Profound Nationality of Their Lesbianism (1973), 87.</ref>

Barnes's biographical notes and collection of manuscripts have been a major source for scholars who have brought the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven forth from the margins of Dada history. They were key in producing ''[[Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'' (2011), the first major English collection of the baroness's poems, and a biography titled ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity'' (2002).

==Fictional portrayals==
[[Cynthia Grant (director)|Cynthia Grant]] and [[Svetlana Zylin]] co-wrote the play ''Djuna: What of the Night'' based on Barnes's life and works. The play premiered in 1991.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wagner|first=Vit|date=1991-05-14|title=Djuna a stylish theatre piece|page=F3|work=[[Toronto Star]]|issn=0319-0781}}</ref>

Emmanuelle Uzan played Barnes in a brief cameo role with no dialogue in [[Woody Allen]]'s 2011 film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]''.
