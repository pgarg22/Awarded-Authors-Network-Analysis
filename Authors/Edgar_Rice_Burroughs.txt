'''Edgar Rice Burroughs''' (September 1, 1875&nbsp;– March 19, 1950) was an American [[speculative fiction]] writer, best known for his prolific output in the [[adventure fiction|adventure]], science fiction and fantasy [[genre fiction|genres]]. His most well-known creations include [[Tarzan (book series)|Tarzan of the Apes]] and [[John Carter of Mars]] (''[[Barsoom]]'' series)

He is also known for the [[Subterranean fiction|hollow Earth]]-themed ''[[Pellucidar]]'' series, beginning with ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'' (1914), Carson Napier of Venus (''[[Amtor]]'' series) and the [[Lost world (genre)|lost world]]-themed ''[[Caprona (island)|Caspak]]'' trilogy, beginning with ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (novel)|The Land that Time Forgot]]'' (1918).

Burroughs' California ranch is now the center of the [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana neighborhood]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Burroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago (he later lived for many years in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]), the fourth son of Major George Tyler Burroughs (1833–1913), a businessman and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran, and his wife, Mary Evaline (Zieger) Burroughs (1840–1920). His middle name is from his paternal grandmother, Mary Coleman Rice Burroughs (1802–1889).<ref>{{Citation | publisher = [[Edmund Rice (1638)]] Association | year = 2010 | title = Descendants of Edmund Rice: The First Nine Generations}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edmund-rice.org/era5gens/ |title= Edmund Rice Six-Generation Database Online |publisher= Edmund Rice (1638) Association |access-date= January 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725005839/http://www.edmund-rice.org/era5gens/ |archive-date= July 25, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref name="Schneider 2004 296">{{Citation | last = Schneider | first = Jerry L | year = 2004 | title = The Ancestry of Edgar Rice Burroughs | publisher = Erbville Press | isbn = 978-1-4357-4972-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcBg6irPpVcC | format = Google Books |page= 296}}</ref> He was of almost entirely English ancestry, with a family line that had been in North America since the [[colonialist|Colonial]] era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalfirstsandfacts.com/2017/08/16/edgar-rice-burroughs/|title=Edgar Rice Burroughs|date=August 16, 2017|access-date=March 12, 2018|archive-date=March 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312083449/http://globalfirstsandfacts.com/2017/08/16/edgar-rice-burroughs/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Through his Rice grandmother, Burroughs was descended from [[settler]] [[Edmund Rice (colonist)|Edmund Rice]], one of the English [[Puritan]]s who moved to [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in the early 17th century. He once remarked, "I can trace my ancestry back to [[Deacon]] Edmund Rice." The Burroughs side of the family was also of English origin and also emigrated to Massachusetts around the same time. Many of his ancestors fought in the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]]. Some of his ancestors settled in Virginia during the colonial period, and Burroughs often emphasized his connection with that side of his family, seeing it as romantic and warlike,<ref name="Schneider 2004 296"/><ref>Taliaferro, John. ''Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan''. pp. 15, 27.</ref> and, in fact, could have counted among his close cousins no less than seven signers of the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]], including his third cousin, four times removed, 2nd President of the United States [[John Adams]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://famouskin.com/famous-kin-menu.php?name=12 |title= Famous Kin of Edgar Rice Burroughs |publisher= FamousKin.com |access-date= October 19, 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Burroughs was educated at a number of local schools. He then attended [[Phillips Academy]], in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], and then the [[Michigan Military Academy]]. Graduating in 1895, and failing the entrance exam for the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, he became an enlisted soldier with the [[7th U.S. Cavalry]] in [[Fort Grant, Arizona|Fort Grant]], [[Arizona Territory]]. After being diagnosed with a heart problem and thus ineligible to serve, he was discharged in 1897.<ref name = "slotkin">{{Cite book | last = Slotkin | first = Richard | author-link = Richard Slotkin | title = Gunfighter Nation | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | page = 196 | isbn = 0-8061-3031-8| year = 1998}}</ref>

After his discharge Burroughs worked a number of different jobs. During the Chicago [[influenza]] epidemic of 1891, he spent half a year at his brother's ranch on the [[Raft River]] in [[Idaho]], as a [[cowboy]], drifted somewhat afterward, then worked at his father's Chicago battery factory in 1899, marrying his childhood sweetheart, Emma Hulbert (1876–1944), in January 1900.

In 1903, Burroughs joined his brothers, [[Yale]] graduates George and Harry, who were, by then, prominent Pocatello area ranchers in southern Idaho, and partners in the Sweetser-Burroughs Mining Company, where he took on managing their ill-fated [[Snake River]] [[gold dredge]], a classic bucket-line dredge. The Burroughs brothers were also the sixth cousins, once removed, of famed miner [[Kate Rice]], a brilliant and statuesque Maths professor who, in 1914, became the first female prospector in the Canadian North. Journalist and publisher [[C. Allen Thorndike Rice]] was also his third cousin.<ref>[http://edmund-rice.org/library/ERA_Entertainers.pdf Rice, Michael A.] ''Edmund Rice (1638) Association, Inc.'': "Meet Some of Edmund Rice's Descendants: Notable Writers & Entertainers", page 11, Accessed October 11, 2017.</ref>

When the new mine proved unsuccessful, the brothers secured for Burroughs a position with the [[Oregon Short Line Railroad]] in Salt Lake City.<ref>[https://offbeatoregon.com/1503b.edgar-rice-burroughs-in-oregon.html John, Finn J.D.] ''Offbeat Oregon'': "Ill-starred gold-mining venture worked out well for Tarzan fans", March 8, 2015, Accessed October 11, 2017.</ref> Burroughs resigned from the railroad in October 1904.{{Sfn | Holtsmark | 1986 | pp = [https://archive.org/details/edgarriceburroug0000holt <!-- quote="Idaho and his father in Chicago". --> 3]–[https://archive.org/details/edgarriceburroug0000holt <!-- quote=Emma. --> 4]}}

===Author===
By 1911, after seven years of low wages as a pencil-sharpener wholesaler, Burroughs began to write fiction. By this time, Emma and he had two children, Joan (1908–1972), and Hulbert (1909–1991).{{Sfn | Holtsmark | 1986 | p = 5}} During this period, he had copious spare time and began reading [[pulp magazine|pulp-fiction magazines]]. In 1929, he recalled thinking that

{{Quote | ...if people were paid for writing rot such as I read in some of those magazines, that I could write stories just as rotten. As a matter of fact, although I had never written a story, I knew absolutely that I could write stories just as entertaining and probably a whole lot more so than any I chanced to read in those magazines.<ref>{{cite web|first=Edgar Rice|last=Burroughs |date=October 27, 1929|url= http://www.erbzine.com/mag0/0052.html |title=How I Wrote the Tarzan Stories |work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], [[New York World]] (Sunday supplement) |publisher=ERBZine.com}}</ref>}}

In 1913, Burroughs and Emma had their third and last child, [[John Coleman Burroughs]] (1913–1979), later known for his illustrations of his father's books.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Obituaries / Danton Burroughs, 1944 – 2008; Tarzan Creator's Heir Protected the Legacy.|last=Nelson|first=V. J.|date=May 15, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|via=ProQuest}}</ref>

In the 1920s, Burroughs became a pilot, purchased a [[Security Airster S-1]], and encouraged his family to learn to fly.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=AOPA Pilot|date=May 2014|title=A Plane-Crazy America}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Joan Burroughs|url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag11/1104.html|access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref>

Daughter Joan married ''Tarzan'' film actor, [[James Pierce]], starring with her husband, as the voice of ''Jane'', during 1932–1934 for the ''[[Tarzan (radio program)|Tarzan]]'' radio series. The pair were wed for more than forty years, until her death in 1972.

Burroughs divorced Emma in 1934 and, in 1935, married the former actress [[Florence Gilbert|Florence Gilbert Dearholt]], who was the former wife of his friend (who was then himself remarrying), [[Ashton Dearholt]], with whom he had co-founded Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises while filming ''The New Adventures of Tarzan''. Burroughs adopted the Dearholts' two children. He and Florence divorced in 1942.{{Sfn | Holtsmark | 1986 | pp = 12–13}}

Burroughs was in his late 60s and was in [[Honolulu]] at the time of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rising Sun|url=https://archive.org/details/risingsundecline00tola|url-access=registration|last=Toland|first=John|date=1970|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-8129-6858-1|edition=2003 Modern Library Paperback|page=220}}<!--|access-date=September 23, 2015 --></ref> Despite his age, he applied for and received permission to become a [[war correspondent]], becoming one of the oldest U.S. war correspondents during [[World War II]]. This period of his life is mentioned in [[William Brinkley]]'s bestselling novel ''[[Don't Go Near the Water (novel)|Don't Go Near the Water]]''.

===Death===
After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to [[Encino, California]], where after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost 80 novels. He is buried in Tarzana, California, US.{{Sfn | Holtsmark | 1986 | pp = 13–15}}

When he died, he was believed to have been the writer who had made the most from films, earning over $2&nbsp;million in royalties from 27 Tarzan pictures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety177-1950-03#page/n198/mode/1up|title='Tarzan' Paid Off Big to Burroughs|page=7|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 22, 1950|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>

==Literary career==
Aiming his work at the [[Pulp magazine|pulps]]—under the name "Norman Bean" to protect his reputation—Burroughs had his first story, ''[[Under the Moons of Mars]]'', [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] by [[Frank Munsey]] in the February to July 1912 issues of ''[[The All-Story]]''.<ref name=isfdb/><ref name="moonsofmars">"[https://www.erbzine.com/mag4/0419.html The Hillmans' Virtual Visit to The Nell Dismukes McWhorter Memorial Edgar Rice Burroughs Collection]" (with photographs).

It was first published as a book by [[A. C. McClurg]] of Chicago in 1917, entitled ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'', after three Barsoom sequels had appeared as serials and McClurg had published the first four serial [[Tarzan]] novels as books.<ref name=isfdb />

Burroughs soon took up writing full-time, and by the time the run of ''Under the Moons of Mars'' had finished, he had completed two novels, including ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'', published from October 1912 and one of his most successful series.

Burroughs also wrote popular science fiction and fantasy stories involving adventurers from Earth transported to various planets (notably [[Barsoom]], Burroughs's fictional name for [[Mars]], and [[Venus series|Amtor]], his fictional name for [[Venus]]), lost islands ([[Caprona (island)|Caspak]]), and into the interior of the [[Hollow Earth]] in his ''[[Pellucidar]]'' stories. He also wrote Westerns and historical romances. Besides those published in ''All-Story'', many of his stories were published in ''[[Argosy (magazine)|The Argosy]]'' magazine.

[[Tarzan]] was a cultural sensation when introduced. Burroughs was determined to capitalize on Tarzan's popularity in every way possible. He planned to exploit Tarzan through several different media including a syndicated Tarzan [[comic strip]], movies, and merchandise. Experts in the field advised against this course of action, stating that the different media would just end up competing against each other. Burroughs went ahead, however, and proved the experts wrong – the public wanted Tarzan in whatever fashion he was offered. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a [[cultural icon]].

In either 1915 or 1919, Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of Los Angeles, California, which he named "Tarzana". The citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch voted to adopt that name when their community, [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana, California]], was formed in 1927.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = NOAA | url = http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/sd/communityprofiles/California/Tarzana_CA.pdf | place = US | title = Tarzana Community Profile | access-date = July 4, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204074346/http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/sd/communityprofiles/California/Tarzana_CA.pdf | archive-date = February 4, 2012 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}.</ref> Also, the unincorporated community of [[Tarzan, Texas]], was formally named in 1927 when the [[US Postal Service]] accepted the name,<ref name="holtsmark9-10">{{Harvnb | Holtsmark | 1986 | pp = 9–10}}.</ref> reputedly coming from the popularity of the first (silent) ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' film, starring [[Elmo Lincoln]], and an early "Tarzan" comic strip.

In 1923, Burroughs set up his own company, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]], and began printing his own books through the 1930s.

==Reception and criticism==
Because of the part Burroughs's science fiction played in inspiring real exploration of Mars, [[Burroughs (crater)|an impact crater]] on Mars was named in his honor after his death.<ref name="sagan19780528">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/growing-up-with.html |title=Growing up with Science Fiction |last=Sagan |first=Carl |date=May 28, 1978 |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 12, 2018 |page=SM7 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In a ''[[Paris Review]]'' interview, [[Ray Bradbury]] said of Burroughs that "Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out – and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly – Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/ray-bradbury-the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|first=Interviewed by Sam|last=Weller|date=February 4, 2019|volume=Spring 2010|issue=192|via=www.theparisreview.org}}</ref> Bradbury continued that "By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special."

In ''[[Something of Myself]]'' (published posthumously in 1937) [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote: "My ''Jungle Books'' begat Zoos of <nowiki>[imitators]</nowiki>. But the genius of all the genii was one who wrote a series called ''Tarzan of the Apes''. I read it, but regret I never saw it on the films, where it rages most successfully. He had 'jazzed' the motif of the ''Jungle Books'' and, I imagine, had thoroughly enjoyed himself. He was reported to have said that he wanted to find out how bad a book he could write and 'get away with', which is a legitimate ambition."<ref>{{cite book|first=Rudyard|last=Kipling|title=Something of Myself|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.525263|year=1937|publisher=Macmillan & Co.|location=London|chapter=8: Working Tools}}</ref>

By 1963, [[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' wrote when discussing reprints of several Burroughs novels by [[Ace Books]], "an entire generation has grown up inexplicably Burroughs-less". He stated that most of the author's books had been out of print for years and that only the "occasional laughable Tarzan film" reminded public of his fiction.<ref name="gale196306">{{Cite magazine

Burroughs strongly supported [[eugenics]] and [[scientific racism]]. His views held that English nobles made up a particular heritable elite among [[Anglo-Saxons]]. [[Tarzan]] was meant to reflect this, with him being born to English nobles and then adopted by talking apes (the [[Mangani]]). They express eugenicist views themselves, but Tarzan is permitted to live despite being deemed "unfit" in comparison, and grows up to surpass not only them but [[black Africans]], whom Burrough clearly presents as inherently inferior, even not wholly human. In one Tarzan story, he finds an ancient civilization where eugenics has been practiced for over 2,000 years, with the result that it is free of all crime. Criminal behavior is held to be entirely hereditary, with the solution having been to kill not only criminals but also their families. ''[[Lost on Venus]]'', a later novel, presents a similar [[utopia]] where forced sterilization is practiced and the "unfit" killed. Burroughs explicitly supported such ideas in his unpublished nonfiction essay ''I See A New Race''. Additionally, his ''Pirate Blood'', which is not [[speculative fiction]] and remained unpublished after his death, portrayed the characters as victims of their hereditary criminal traits (one a descendant of the corsair [[Jean Lafitte]], another from the [[Jukes family]]).<ref>[https://meridian.allenpress.com/idd/article/39/3/221/8262/Disney-s-Tarzan-Edgar-Rice-Burroughs-Eugenics-and ''Disney's Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs' Eugenics, and Visions of Utopian Perfection]'', J.

* ''Part I: The Moon Maid'' (1923, serialized in ''Argosy'', May 5 – June 2, 1923)
* ''Part II: The Moon Men'' (1925, serialized in ''Argosy'', February 21 – March 14, 1925)
* ''Part III: The Red Hawk'' (1925 serialized in ''Argosy'', September 5–19, 1925)
These three texts have been published by various houses in one or two volumes. Adding to the confusion, some editions have the original (significantly longer) introduction to Part I from the first publication as a magazine serial, and others have the shorter version from the first book publication, which included all three parts under the title ''The Moon Maid''.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.erbzine.com/mag7/0767.html | title = ERBzine}}.</ref>
