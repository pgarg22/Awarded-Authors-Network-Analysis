==Life and career==
Lucille Clifton (born Thelma Lucille Sayles, in [[Depew, New York|Depew]], New York)<ref>Elizabeth Alexander, [http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/remembering-lucille-clifton "Remembering Lucille Clifton"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 17, 2010.</ref> grew up in Buffalo, New York, and graduated from [[Fosdick-Masten Park High School]] in 1953.<ref name="Years, Hilary Holladay 2010, p.48" /> She attended [[Howard University]] with a scholarship from 1953 to 1955, leaving to study at the [[State University of New York at Fredonia]] (near Buffalo).<ref name="Years, Hilary Holladay 2010, p.48">Hilary Holladay, ''73 Poems for 73 Years'', James Madison University, September 21, 2010, p. 48.</ref>

In 1958, Lucille Sayles married Fred James Clifton, a professor of philosophy at the [[University at Buffalo]], and a sculptor whose carvings depicted African faces.  Lucille and her husband had six children together, and she worked as a claims clerk in the New York State Division of Employment, Buffalo (1958–60), and then as literature assistant in the Office of Education in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1960–71). Writer [[Ishmael Reed]] introduced Lucille to Clifton while he was organizing the Buffalo Community Drama Workshop. Fred and Lucille Clifton starred in the group's version of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', which was called "poetic and sensitive" by the ''Buffalo Evening News''.

In 1966, Reed took some of Clifton's poems to [[Langston Hughes]], who included them in his anthology ''The Poetry of the Negro''. In 1967, the Cliftons moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland.<ref name="Years, Hilary Holladay 2010, p.48"/> Her first poetry collection, ''Good Times'', was published in 1969, and listed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of the year's ten best books. From 1971 to 1974, Clifton was poet-in-residence at [[Coppin State University|Coppin State College]] in Baltimore. From 1979 to 1985, she was [[Poet Laureate]] of the state of [[Maryland]].<ref name="MSA">[http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/poet.html "Maryland Poets Laureate"], webpage of [http://www.msa.md.gov/ Maryland State Archives].

In 1984, her husband died of cancer.<ref name="Years, Hilary Holladay 2010, p.48"/>

From 1985 to 1989, Clifton was a professor of literature and creative writing at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].<ref name="MWHF">Maryland State Archives and Maryland Commission for Women.

In 2006, she was a fellow at [[Dartmouth College]]. She died in Baltimore on February 13, 2010.

In 2019, daughter Sidney Clifton reacquired the family's home near Baltimore, aiming to establish the Clifton House as a place to support young artists and writers through in-person and virtual workshops, classes, seminars, residencies, and a gallery. The Clifton House received preservation funding through the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s [https://savingplaces.org/african-american-cultural-heritage#.YJW9QGjYpD8 African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund].<ref>Amy Stolls and Jessica Flynn, [https://www.arts.gov/stories/blog/2020/clifton-house-labor-love-and-legacy "The Clifton House: A Labor of Love and Legacy"], ''National Endowment for the Arts blog'', July 30, 2020.

==Poetic work==
[[File:For Cornelia.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque outside the [[New York Public Library]] ]]

Lucille Clifton traced her family's roots to the West African Kingdom of [[Dahomey]], now the [[Republic of Benin]].  Growing up she was told by her mother, "Be proud, you're from Dahomey women!"<ref>Lupton (2006), p. 60.</ref>  She cites as one of her ancestors the first black woman to be "legally hanged" for manslaughter in the state of [[Kentucky]] during the time of [[Slavery in the United States]].  Girls in her family are born with an extra finger on each hand, a genetic trait known as [[polydactyly]]. Lucille's two extra fingers were amputated surgically when she was a small child, a common practice at that time for reasons of superstition and social stigma. Her "two ghost fingers" and their activities became a theme in her poetry and other writings.  Health problems in her later years included painful [[gout]] which gave her some difficulty in walking.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Her poetry "examine[d] the inner world of her own body", used the body as a "theatre for her poetry". After her uterus was removed, for example, she spoke of her body "as a home without a kitchen".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailycal.org/2021/02/04/late-poet-lucille-clifton-still-speaks-to-the-covid-era/ |first=Blue |last=Fay |title=Late poet Lucille Clifton still speaks to the COVID era |date=February 4, 2021 |newspaper=[[The Daily Californian]] |accessdate=February 13, 2021}}</ref>

Her series of children's books about a young black boy began with 1970's ''Some of the Days of Everett Anderson.'' Everett Anderson, a recurring character in many of her books, spoke in African American English and dealt with real life social problems. Her work features in anthologies such as ''My Black Me: A Beginning Book of Black Poetry'' (ed. Arnold Adoff), ''A Poem of Her Own: Voices of American Women Yesterday and Today'' (ed. Catherine Clinton), ''Black Stars: African American Women Writers'' (ed. Brenda Scott Wilkinson), ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'' (ed. [[Margaret Busby]]), and ''Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology'' (eds Lauret E. Savoy, [[Eldridge M. Moores]], and Judith E. Moores ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity University Press|Trinity University Press]]). Studies about Clifton's life and writings include ''Wild Blessings: The Poetry of Lucille Clifton'' (LSU Press, 2004) by Hilary Holladay, and ''Lucille Clifton: Her Life and Letters'' (Praeger, 2006) by Mary Jane Lupton.

=== ''Two-Headed Woman'': "homage to my hips" ===
In 1980 Clifton published "homage to my hips" in her book of poems, ''Two-Headed Woman''. ''Two-Headed Woman'' won the 1980 Juniper Prize and was characterized by its "dramatic tautness, simple language … tributes to blackness, [and] celebrations of women", which are all traits reflected in the poem "homage to my hips".<ref>Jessie Carney Smith, ''Notable Black American Women, Book 2'' (Detroit, MI: Gale Research Inc., 1996), 110.
</ref> This particular collection of poetry also marks the beginning of Clifton's interest in depicting the "transgressive black body."<ref>Michael Bennett, Vanessa D. Dickerson, ''Recovering the Black Female Body: Self-representations by African American Women'' (New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press, 2001), 127.</ref> "homage to my hips" was preceded by the poem "homage to my hair" – and acts as a complementary work that explores the relationship between African-American women and men and aimed to reinvent the negative stereotypes associated with the black female body. "Homage to my hips" and "homage to my hair" both relate the African-American body to mythological powers – a literary technique common among many literary works by African American women. Jane Campbell poses the idea that "the specific effect of mythmaking upon race relations … constitutes a radical act, inviting the audience to subvert the racist mythology that thwarts and defeats Afro-Americans, and to replace it with a new mythology rooted in the black perspective."<ref>Bennett & Dickerson, ''Recovering the Black Female Body'' (2001), 126.</ref> Therefore, Clifton utilizes "homage to my hips" to celebrate the African-American female body as a source of power, sexuality, pride, and freedom.

==Awards==
Lucille Clifton received a Creative Writing Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1970 and 1973, and a grant from the [[Academy of American Poets]]. She received the Charity Randall prize, the Jerome J. Shestack Prize from the ''[[American Poetry Review]]'', and an [[Emmy Award]]. Her children's book ''Everett Anderson's Good-bye'' won the 1984 [[Coretta Scott King Award]]. In 1988, Clifton became the first author to have two books of poetry named finalists for one year's [[Pulitzer Prize]]. (The award dates from 1918, the announcement of finalists from 1980.)<ref name=pulitzer/> She won the 1991/1992 [[Shelley Memorial Award]], the 1996 [[Lannan Literary Award for Poetry]], and for ''Blessing the Boats: New and Collected Poems 1988–2000'' the 2000 [[National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref name=nba2000/> From 1999 to 2005, she served on the Board of Chancellors of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. In 2007, she won the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]]; the $100,000 prize honors a living U.S. poet whose "lifetime accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition." Clifton received the [[Robert Frost Medal]] for lifetime achievement from the Poetry Society of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/awards/frost_and_shelley/frost_winners/2010|title=Lucille Clifton, Winner of the 2010 Frost Medal}}</ref>
