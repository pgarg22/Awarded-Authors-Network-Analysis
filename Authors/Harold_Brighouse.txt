He was a prominent member, together with [[Allan Monkhouse]] and [[Stanley Houghton]], of a group known as the [[Manchester School (writers)|Manchester School]] of dramatists.

==Early life==

Harold Brighouse was born in [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], [[Lancashire]], the eldest child of John Southworth Brighouse, a manager in a cotton-spinning firm, and Charlotte Amelia née Harrison, a headmistress.  Harold went to a local school, then won a [[scholarship]] to [[Manchester Grammar School]].  He left school aged 17 and started work as a textile buyer in a shipping merchant's office.  In 1902 he went to London to set up an office for his firm.  There he met Emily Lynes and married her in [[Lillington, Warwickshire|Lillington]], [[Leamington Spa]] in 1907.  He was promoted at work and returned to [[Manchester]], but in 1908 he became a full-time writer.<ref name=dnb>{{Cite ODNB | last = Hollingworth| first = Brian Charles| title= Brighouse, Harold (1882–1958)| orig-year = 2004| year = 2008| doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/57105| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57105| access-date = 3 August 2013 }} ({{ODNBsub}})</ref>

==Writing career==

The first play written by Brighouse was ''Lonesome Like'', but the first to be produced was ''The Doorway''.  This was performed in 1909 at [[Annie Horniman]]'s [[Gaiety Theatre, Manchester|Gaiety Theatre]] in [[Manchester]] and produced by [[Ben Iden Payne]].  Horniman and Payne gave strong support to Brighouse in the early stages of his career.  Many of his plays were one-act pieces; three of the best of these (''The Northerners'', ''[[Zack (play)|Zack]]'' and ''The Game'') were published together as ''Three Lancashire Plays'' in 1920.  All of these plays were set in Lancashire but Brighouse also wrote plays of a different type, such as ''The Oak Settle'' and ''Maid of France''.  His most successful play was ''[[Hobson's Choice (play)|Hobson's Choice]]'', first produced in 1915 in [[New York City|New York]] where Payne was working.  It was first produced in England in 1916 at the [[Apollo Theatre]], London, where it ran for 246 performances.  The play was made into a film, directed by [[David Lean]], in 1953, and it was produced at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] at the [[Old Vic]], London, in 1964.<ref name=dnb/>  The [[Crucible Theatre]] [[Sheffield]] staged a revival in June 2011 directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring  [[Barrie Rutter]], Zoe Waites and [[Philip McGinley]].

Brighouse also wrote novels, including ''Hepplestalls'', concerning a Lancashire mill-owning family in the 19th century.  In addition he wrote many reviews and other pieces for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.  He was a member of the Dramatists' Club and in 1930–31 was chairman of the [[Society of Authors]]' dramatic committee.  After 1931 he wrote no more full-length plays.  His autobiography ''What I Have Had'' was published in 1953.<ref name=dnb/>

In the [[World War I|First World War]], Brighouse was declared unfit for combat, but joined what later became the [[Royal Air Force]], and was seconded to the [[Air Ministry]] [[Military intelligence|Intelligence]] [[Staff (military)|Staff]], where in his spare time he wrote ''Hobson's Choice''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tactnyc.org/show.php?sid=3&id=71 |title= Zack |access-date= 23 November 2008 |publisher= The Actors Company Theatre |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509010834/http://tactnyc.org/show.php?sid=3&id=71 |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>  In 1919 he moved to [[Hampstead]], London.
