{{short description|Nigerian writer}}
'''Niyi Osundare''' is a leading [[African people|African]] poet, dramatist, linguist, and literary critic. Born on March 12, 1947 in Ikere-Ekiti, Nigeria, his poetry is influenced by the oral poetry of his Yorùbá culture, which he capaciously hybridizes with other poetic traditions of the world, including African American, Latin American, Asian, and European. Osundare is a champion of free speech and his creative and critical writings are closely associated with political activism, decolonization, black internationalism, and the environment. He is the recipient of numerous prizes, including the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) Poetry Prize, the Commonwealth Poetry Prize, the Tchicaya U Tam'si Poetry Prize, and the ANA/Cadbury Poetry Prize (twice). In 1991, Osundare became the first Anglophone African poet to win the Noma Award (Africa's most prestigious book award), and in 1998, he was awarded the Fonlon/Nichols Prize for his "excellence in literary creativity combined with significant contributions to Human Rights in Africa." In 2014, he was admitted to the National Order of Merit, his country's highest honor for intellectual distinction and creative achievement. Osundare is Emeritus Distinguished Professor of English at the University of New Orleans.

== Family and education ==
Osundare gained degrees in English at the [[University of Ibadan]] (BA), the [[University of Leeds]] (MA), and [[York University]], Canada (PhD, 1979). Previously professor (from 1989) and Head of English (1993–97) at the University of Ibadan, he became professor of English at the [[University of New Orleans]] in 1997. Osundare has a wife, Kemi, and three children, two girls and a son who still lives in Nigeria. His deaf daughter is the reason Niyi settled in the United States. She could not go to school in Nigeria so they found a school in the U.S. for her, and moved so as to be closer to her. He has been used in many schools as an example of a poet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ui.edu.ng/uiicons/prof-osundare|title=PROF NIYI OSUNDARE – UNIVERSITY OF IBADAN|accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>

== Career ==
He has always been a vehement champion of the right to [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and is a strong believer in the power of words, saying, "to utter is to alter". Osundare is renowned for his commitment to socially relevant art and artistic activism and has written several open letters to the former President of Nigeria ([[Olusegun Obasanjo]]), whom Osundare has often publicly criticised.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2003/jul/072.html|title=Nigeriaworld Feature Article - Letter to President Obasanjo|accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nigeriavillagesquare.com/articles/dear-president-obasanjo-another-letter.html|title=Dear President Obasanjo: Another Letter|accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>

Osundare believes that there is no choice for an [[Africa]]n poet but to be political:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thenationonlineng.net/niyi-osundare-society-lost-sense-shame|title=NIYI OSUNDARE 'Our society has lost its sense of shame'|accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref><blockquote>
"You cannot keep quiet about the situation in the kind of countries we find ourselves in, in Africa.  When you wake up and there is no running water, when you have a massive power outage for days and nights, no food on the table, no hospital for the sick, no peace of mind; when the image of the ruler you see everywhere is that of a dictator with a gun in his hand; and, on the international level, when you live in a world in which your continent is consigned to the margin, a world in which the colour of your skin is a constant disadvantage, everywhere you go – then there is no other way than to write about this, in an attempt to change the situation for the better."
</blockquote>

Under the rule of the dictator General [[Sani Abacha]] (1993–98), Osundare regularly contributed poems to a Nigerian national newspaper (now part of the collection ''Songs of the Season'') that criticised the regime and commented upon the lives of people in Nigeria. As a result, he was frequently visited by security agents and asked to explain his poems and to whom they referred:<blockquote>
"By that time I realized that the Nigerian security apparatus had become quite 'sophisticated', quite 'literate' indeed!"</blockquote><blockquote>"A couple of my students at the University of Ibadan had become informers; a few even came to my classes wired. And when I was reading abroad, someone trailed me from city to city. At home, my letters were frequently intercepted."
</blockquote>

In 1997, he accepted a teaching and research post at the University of New Orleans. In 2005 Osundare was caught in [[Hurricane Katrina]], and he and his wife were stuck in their attic for 26 hours. Their neighbour, who at the time was driving by in his boat, heard their shouts for help. They were rescued and bounced around from rescue shelters until they ended up in [[Rindge, New Hampshire]], where Osundare could get a teaching job as a professor at [[Franklin Pierce College]] and things settled down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/how-i-survived-hurricane-katrina-niyi-osundare.html|title=How I survived Hurricane Katrina - Niyi Osundare|accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>

== Honors and recognition ==
Osundare is a holder of numerous awards for his poetry, as well as the Fonlon/Nichols award for "excellence in literary creativity combined with significant contributions to Human Rights in Africa".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://new.uno.edu/academic-affairs/endowed-chairs/niyi-osundare|title=Niyi Osundare, Ph.D. {{!}} The University of New Orleans|accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>

His 60th birthday literary fete took place at venues in [[Ikere-Ekiti]], [[Ibadan]] and [[Lagos]] state of Nigeria in March 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osundare60fete.blogspot.com/2007/02/announcing.html|title=Announcing|work=Niyi Osundare at 60 Literary Fete|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>

His poem "[[Not My Business]]" is compulsory study in the [[AQA]] A syllabus for [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] English Language.

In 2011, an Associate Professor of English at The [[University of Lagos]], [[Christopher Anyokwu]], wrote an article on ''Niyi Osundare's Poetry and the Yoruba World View'', where he analysed the use of Indigenous Yoruba concepts found in Niyi Osundare's texts. The associate professor, went further to assume that Osundare unified in his work the concepts and traditions of [[Yoruba culture]] and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist ideology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Anyokwu|first1=C.
