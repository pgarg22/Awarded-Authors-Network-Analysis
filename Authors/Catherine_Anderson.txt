==Biography==
Adeline Catherine was born on 22 December 1948 in [[Grants Pass]], [[Oregon]], [[United States|USA]], daughter of Benjamin Early La May, a chef.<ref name="encyclopedia.com">{{Citation|title=Catherine Anderson at encyclopedia.com|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3070300015/anderson-catherine-1948.html|date=2012-05-22}}</ref> Her mother was a writer, and some of her earliest memories are of hearing her mother type stories on an old typewriter, and then read the finished work aloud.  With this inspiration, she began writing her own stories as a child.<ref name="rbl"/> Feeling that a career as a published writer was out of reach, however, she decided to major in accounting when she attended college so that she could help her husband, Sidney D. Anderson, keep the books at his company.<ref name="rbl2"/> After realizing that numbers did not make her happy, and with her husband's full blessing, Anderson dropped out of college so that she could pursue a writing career.

Catherine Anderson's first four published books were category romance, under the Harlequin Intrigue romantic suspense line.  Her subsequent single-title works have alternated between contemporary and historical romances.<ref name="rbl2">{{cite web | author =  Kelly| title = CATHERINE ANDERSON Ketchup | work= | pages = | language = | publisher = RBL Romantica | date = May 2005 | url =http://www.geocities.com/rblinterviews/andersoninterview.html | accessdate = 2007-03-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025033533/http://geocities.com/rblinterviews/andersoninterview.html|archivedate=2009-10-25}}</ref>  Many of her novels feature a character with a disability, be it physical or mental, and show the reader how those disabilities can be overcome.  Animals are also a recurrent theme in her stories, with many books set on or near ranches.<ref name="rbl"/>  ''Romantic Times Magazine'' describes her novels as "moving, heartwarming,...celebrat[ing] the ideals of perfect love in an imperfect world.  Her characters are complex, often conflicted individuals who triumph over substantial odds."<ref name="phantom">{{cite web|title=Cameo/Excerpt: Phantom Waltz|publisher=Romantic Times|year=2007|url=http://www.romantictimes.com/books_review.php?cameo=1&book=13579|accessdate=2007-07-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Reader acclaims describe her books as funny, delightful, heartwrenching, beautiful, superb, and of classic proportions.

Anderson, who is part [[Shoshone]], and her husband, Sidney D. Anderson, live on {{convert|160|acre|km2}} in [[Oregon]].  They have two grown sons,  Sidney D. Anderson, Jr. and John G. Anderson.  The pair love the wildlife on their pristine mountain ridge and greatly enjoy the solitude of their wilderness lifestyle, which is, Anderson says, a writer's dream.  Their estate, heavily guarded by electronic surveillance, is off limits to hunters, providing all wild creatures sanctuary.  Their three dogs are allowed to run at large on the property.<ref name="rbl">{{cite web | author =  Kelly| title = RBL Presents!
