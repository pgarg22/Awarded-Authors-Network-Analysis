'''Alfred Sutro''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (7 August 1863 – 11 September 1933) was an English author, dramatist and translator. In addition to a succession of successful plays of his own in the first quarter of the 20th century, Sutro made the first English translations of works by the Belgian writer [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].

==Life and career==
Sutro was born in London, the third and youngest son of Sigismund Sutro, a medical practitioner and authority on continental spas and their cures. Sutro senior, who was of German and Spanish [[Sephardic]] ancestry, had come to England from Germany as a young man and become a British subject.<ref name=arch>Hyamson, A M.

Rubinstein]], Michael Jolles, [[Hilary L. Rubinstein]], ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 971</ref> 

Sutro was educated at the [[City of London School]] and in Brussels.<ref name=times/> He worked as a clerk in the [[City of London|City]] and when he was twenty he entered into partnership with his elder brother Leopold, trading as wholesale merchants. In 1894 he married Esther Stella, daughter of Joseph Michael Isaacs, a fruit broker and importer in [[Covent Garden]]; her brother, [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], became a prominent lawyer and politician.<ref name=arch/> Stella Isaacs was a painter, and insisted that Sutro should give up business and earn his living in the arts.<ref name=dnb/>

The Sutros lived for a time in Paris; among the friends they made there was [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], with whom Sutro established a lifelong friendship.<ref name=dnb/> Sutro undertook to translate Maeterlinck's works into English, and it was his versions of  ''[[The Treasure of the Humble]]'' (1897), ''Wisdom and Destiny'' (1898) and ''The Life of the Bee'' (1901) that introduced Maeterlinck to anglophone readers.<ref name=times>"Obituary – Mr Alfred Sutro", ''The Times'', 13 September 1933, p. 12</ref> Sutro's other Maeterlinck translations, some made jointly with his friend [[Alexander Teixeira de Mattos]], include ''Aglavaine and Selysette'', ''Joyzelle'', ''The Life of the White Ant'', ''The Buried Temple'', ''Monna Vanna'', ''The Death of Tintagiles'', and ''The Magic of the Stars''.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&q=Maeterlinck+Sutro "Maeterlinck Sutro"], WorldCat, accessed 4 August 2013</ref>

Sutro's own work was chiefly as a playwright. After many false starts he achieved a moderate success in 1895 with ''The Chili Widow'', an adaptation of a French work, made jointly with [[Arthur Bourchier]].<ref name=times/> His first great success was not for a further nine years, when his mildly satirical comedy ''The Walls of Jericho'' was presented at the [[Garrick Theatre]], with Bourchier in the lead.  [[Arthur Bingham Walkley|A B Walkley]] in ''[[The Times]]'' was not greatly impressed by the play but correctly predicted a long run.<ref>"Garrick Theatre", ''The Times'', 1 November 1904, p. 9</ref> It ran for 423 performances,<ref>Gaye, p.1540</ref> and established Sutro among the leading English dramatists.<ref name=arch/>

From then until his retirement, Sutro wrote more than twenty plays, most of them popular successes. ''The Times'' singled out for mention
*''Mollentrave on Women'' (1905),
*''The Perfect Lover'' (1905),
*''The Fascinating Mr Vanderveldt'' (1906),
*''John Glayde’s Honour'' (1907),
*''The Barrier'' (1907), 
*''The Builder of Bridges'' (1908),
*''Making a Gentleman'' (1909),
*''The Perplexed Husband'' (1911),
*''The Fire-Screen'' (1912),
*''The Two Virtues'' (1914),
*''The Clever Ones'' (1914),
*''The Choice'' (1919) and
*''A Man with a Heart'' (1925).<ref name=times/>

Sutro's biographer Katherine Chubbuck writes that in the 1920s "He had been overtaken by a new school of dramatists led by [[Noël Coward]]".<ref name=dnb/> After the poor reception of his final play, ''Living Together'' (1929) he retired from the theatre.<ref name=dnb>Chubbuck, Katharine, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36374 "Sutro, Alfred (1863–1933)"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 August 2013 {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

Sutro also published a volume of stories (''The Foolish Virgins'', 1904), a collection of sketches (''About Women'', 1931), and a volume of memoirs, (''Celebrities and Simple Souls'', 1933).<ref name=arch/>

Sutro died after a few days' illness at his home in [[Witley]], Surrey, on 11 September 1933. His widow died the following year. They had no children.<ref name=times/>
