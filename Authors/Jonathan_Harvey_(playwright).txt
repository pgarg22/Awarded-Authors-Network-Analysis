'''Jonathan Paul Harvey''' (born 13 June 1968) is an English screen actor and [[playwright]].

==Life and works==
Harvey was born at [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]] in 1968 to Maureen and Brian Harvey.<ref>{{Citation|title=Harvey, Jonathan Paul, (born 13 June 1968), writer and playwright, since 1987|date=2016-12-01|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-276381|work=Who's Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u276381|isbn=978-0-19-954088-4|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> He has a brother, Timothy, who is a music teacher in Chester. A former secondary school English teacher, his first serious attempt as a playwright was in 1987. He entered a competition, with a first prize of £1,000, for young writers at the [[Liverpool Playhouse]], with his play ''The Cherry Blossom Tree'', a blend of suicide, murder and nuns. He won National Girobank Young Writer of the Year Award for ''The Cherry Blossom Tree''. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Encouraged by this success he wrote ''Mohair''<ref>{{cite book |last1= Dodgson |first1= Elyse  |date=1990 |title= First Lines - Young Writers at the Royal Court |location= London |publisher= Hodder & Stoughton |isbn=0340522585}}</ref> (1988), ''Wildfire'' (1992) and ''Babies'' (1993), the latter won the '[[George Devine Award]]' for 1993 and [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#Most Promising Playwright|The Evening Standard's 'Most Promising Playwright Award']] for 1994. In 1993, Harvey, premiered ''[[Beautiful Thing (play)|Beautiful Thing]]'', a gay-themed play-turned-film for which he won the [[John Whiting Award]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/playwrights/jonathan-harvey-iid-12351 |title=Harvey, Jonathan |work=Drama Online |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |access-date=9 May 2020 }}</ref>

In 1995 his play ''Boom Bang-a-Bang'' premiered at the [[Bush Theatre]], London, and was originally directed by [[Kathy Burke]]. Harvey cites it as "my most comic play ever, but with some dark bits". Centred on a group of friends gathering to watch the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], the play was a sell-out. Also in 1995 ''Rupert Street Lonely Hearts Club'' was premiered. ''Guiding Star'' (1998), is a portrayal of a man's struggle to come to terms with the [[Hillsborough disaster]], while ''Hushabye Mountain'' (1999) deals with a world that has learned to live with [[HIV/AIDS]]. Television and film works include: ''West End Girls'' (Carlton); ''Love Junkie'' (BBC); ''Beautiful Thing'' ([[Channel Four]]/Island World Productions); the 1999-2001 hit/cult comedy series starring Kathy Burke and [[James Dreyfus]], ''[[Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)|Gimme Gimme Gimme]]'' (Tiger Aspect); ''[[Murder Most Horrid]]'' ([[BBC]]); and ''[[Coronation Street]]'' ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]).

He wrote the book for ''[[Closer to Heaven (musical)|Closer to Heaven]]'', a stage musical with songs and music written by [[Pet Shop Boys]]. ''Closer to Heaven'' ran for nine months at the [[Arts Theatre]] in London during 2001 and in Australia in 2005. In 2003, on hearing the singer-actress [[Abi Roberts]] perform, he offered to write a solo show for her. ''Taking Charlie'' was the outcome, staged at the 2004 [[Edinburgh Festival]] with Roberts starring, under the direction of [[Susan Tully]]. The piece was darkly comic and focused on the destructive nature of an insecure, 30 year-old addict.<ref name=pinklist>{{Cite news |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2 July 2006 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |title=Gay Power: The pink list |access-date=5 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107115957/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |archive-date= 7 January 2008 }}</ref>
