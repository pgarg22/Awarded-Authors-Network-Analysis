==Works==
A one-act play, ''Bernard Palissy'', written in collaboration with M. Gaston Salandri, was produced in 1879, but he had to wait eleven years before he obtained another hearing, his ''Ménage d'artistes'' being produced by [[André Antoine (actor)|André Antoine]] at the Théâtre Libre in 1890.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Brieux, Eugène|volume=4|page=563}}</ref>

His plays are essentially didactic, being aimed at some weakness or iniquity of the social system. ''Blanchette'' (1892) pointed out the civic results of [[education of girls]] of the working classes; ''Monsieur de Réboval'' (1892) was directed against [[pharisaism]]; ''L'Engrenage'' (1894) against corruption in politics; ''Les Bienfaiteurs'' (1896) against the frivolity of fashionable charity; and ''L'Évasion'' (1896) satirized an indiscriminate belief in the doctrine of [[heredity]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

''Les trois filles de M. Dupont '' (1897) is a powerful, somewhat brutal, study of the miseries imposed on poor middle-class girls by the French system of [[dowry]]; ''Le Résultat des courses'' (1898) shows the evil results of betting among the Parisian workmen; ''La Robe rouge'' (1900) was directed against the injustices of the law; ''Les Remplaçantes'' (1901) against the practice of putting children out to nurse.<ref name="EB1911"/>

''Les Avariés'' (1901), ''Damaged Lives'' in English, was banned by the censor, due to its medical details of [[syphilis]], was read privately by the author at the [[Théâtre Antoine]]; and ''Petite amie'' (1902) describes the life of a Parisian shop-girl.
Later plays are ''La Couvée'' (1903, acted privately at Rouen in 1893), ''Maternité'' (1904), ''La Déserteuse'' (1904), in collaboration with M. [[Jean Sigaux]], and ''Les Hannetons'', a comedy in three acts (1906).<ref name="EB1911"/>

Brieux wrote four more plays in the ensuging decade. The first was ''La Foi, for which
[[Camille Saint-Saëns]] wrote [[incidental music]] in 1909. It was presented in [[Monte Carlo]] on 10 April, and at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, on 20 September.<ref>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th edition, vol. VIII, p. 368</ref> This was followed by ''La Femme Seule'' (1913), ''Le Bourgeois aux champs'' (1914), and ''Les Américains chez nous'' (1920). He also wrote some travelogues: ''Voyages aux Indes et à Indo-Chine'' (1910) and ''Au Japon par Java, la Chine, la Corée'' (1914). He also wrote wartime pamphlets, paying special attention to the care of those blinded by their wounds.<ref>{{Cite EB1922|title=Brieux, Eugène|volume=30|page=504|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabri30chisrich/page/504}}</ref>

Eugène Brieux died in 1932 and was interred in the [[Cimetière du Grand Jas]] in [[Cannes]] on the [[French Riviera]].
