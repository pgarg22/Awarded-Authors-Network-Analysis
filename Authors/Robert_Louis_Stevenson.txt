'''Robert Louis Stevenson''' (born '''Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson'''; 13 November 1850 – 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, essayist, poet and travel writer. He is best known for works such as ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' and ''[[A Child's Garden of Verses]]''.

Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life, but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Leslie Stephen]] and [[William Ernest Henley|W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Henley]], the last of whom may have provided the model for [[Long John Silver]] in ''Treasure Island''. In 1890, he settled in [[Samoa]] where, alarmed at increasing European and American influence in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]] islands, his writing turned away from [[Romance (literary fiction)|romance and adventure fiction]] toward a darker realism. He died in his island home in 1894 at age 44.<ref name=":0" />

A celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson's critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though today his works are held in general acclaim. In 2018 he was ranked, just behind [[Charles Dickens]], as the 26th-most-translated author in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Osborn |first=Jacob |title=49 most-translated authors from around the world |url=https://stacker.com/stories/720/49-most-translated-authors-around-world?page=3 |access-date=26 October 2020 |website=Stacker |publisher=Stacker}}</ref>

==Family and education==
===Childhood and youth===

Stevenson was born at 8 Howard Place, [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to [[Thomas Stevenson]] (1818–1887), a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife, Margaret Isabella (born Balfour, 1829–1897). He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of "Lewis" to "Louis", and he dropped "Balfour" in 1873.<ref>Mehew (2004). The spelling "Lewis" is said to have been rejected because his father violently disliked another person of the same name, and the new spelling was not accompanied by a change of pronunciation (Balfour (1901) I, 29 n. 1.</ref><ref>Furnas (1952), 23–4; Mehew (2004)).</ref>

Lighthouse design was the family's profession; Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was civil engineer [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]], and Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) [[Alan Stevenson|Alan]] and [[David Stevenson (engineer)|David]] were in the same field.<ref name="Paxton 2004">Paxton (2004).</ref> Thomas's maternal grandfather [[Thomas Smith (engineer)|Thomas Smith]] had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were [[gentry]], tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of [[Lindores|Inchrye]] in Fife in the fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Life_of_Robert_Louis_Stevenson_by_Si/6pTWDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22alexander+Balfour%22+%22robert+louis+stevenson%22+inchrye&pg=PT24&printsec=frontcover|isbn = 9781786568007|title = The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson by Sir Graham Balfour - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)|date = 17 July 2017|publisher = Delphi Classics}}</ref> His mother's father [[Lewis Balfour]] (1777–1860) was a minister of the [[Church of Scotland]] at nearby [[Colinton]],<ref>Balfour (1901), 10–12; Furnas (1952), 24; Mehew (2004).</ref> and her siblings included physician [[George William Balfour]] and marine engineer [[James Balfour (engineer)|James Balfour]]. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. "Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister," Stevenson wrote. "I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them."<ref>''[[Memories and Portraits]]'' (1887), [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/stevenson/robert_louis/s848mp/chapter7.html Chapter VII. The Manse].</ref>

Lewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1 Inverleith Terrace in 1851.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Robert Louis Stevenson Timeline (born Nov. 13th 1850 in Edinburgh, died Dec. 3rd 1894 in Samoa) |url=http://www.robert-louis-stevenson.org/timeline |access-date=14 May 2012 |publisher=Robert-louis-stevenson.org}}</ref> The family moved again to the sunnier 17 Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was 11. Illness was a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin.<ref>Furnas (1952), 25–8; Mehew (2004).</ref> Contemporaneous views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was [[bronchiectasis]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Holmes |first=Lowell |url=https://archive.org/details/treasuredislands00holm |title=Treasured Islands: Cruising the South Seas with Robert Louis Stevenson |publisher=Sheridan House, Inc. |year=2002 |isbn=1-57409-130-1}}</ref> or even [[sarcoidosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sharma |first=O.

Stevenson's parents were both devout [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], but the household was not strict in its adherence to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] principles.

Stevenson was an only child, both strange-looking and eccentric, and he found it hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age 6, a problem repeated at age 11 when he went on to the [[Edinburgh Academy]]; but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at [[Colinton]].<ref>Furnas (1952), 34–6; Mehew (2004). Alison Cunningham's recollection of Stevenson balances the picture of an oversensitive child, "like other bairns, whiles very naughty": Furnas (1952), 30.</ref> His frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, learning at age 7 or 8, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse,<ref name="Mehew 2004">Mehew (2004).</ref> and he compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father found them and told him to "give up such nonsense and mind your business."<ref name="Paxton 2004" /> He paid for the printing of Robert's first publication at 16, entitled ''The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666''. It was an account of the [[Covenanters#Restoration and the "Killing Time"|Covenanters' rebellion]] which was published in 1866, the 200th anniversary of the event.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 67; Furnas (1952), pp. 43–45.</ref>

In September 1857, Stevenson went to ''Mr Henderson's School'' in India Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and did not return until October 1859. During his many absences, he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, he went to [[Edinburgh Academy]], an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in [[Isleworth]] in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, he was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=26438&back= Stephenson, Robert Louis (1850–1894) – Childhood and schooling]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Retrieved: 1 August 2013.</ref> In November 1867, Stevenson entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study engineering. He showed from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in [[The Speculative Society]] (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, [[Fleeming Jenkin]], whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write.<ref>Furnas (1952), 51–54, 60–62; Mehew (2004)</ref> Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as "Bob"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 86–8; 90–4; Furnas (1952), 64–9</ref>

Each year during the holidays, Stevenson travelled to inspect the family's engineering works—to [[Anstruther]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] in 1868, with his father on his official tour of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of [[Erraid]] in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of [[Walter Scott]] with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 70–2; Furnas (1952), 48–9; Mehew (2004)</ref> In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was "wonderfully resigned" to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read Law (again at Edinburgh University) and [[Admission to practice law|be called to the Scottish bar]].<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 85–6</ref> In his 1887 poetry collection ''Underwoods'', Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession:<ref>''Underwoods'' (1887), Poem XXXVIII</ref>
<blockquote>
Say not of me that weakly I declined<br>
The labours of my sires, and fled the sea,<br>
The towers we founded and the lamps we lit,<br>
To play at home with paper like a child.<br>
But rather say: ''In the afternoon of time''<br>
''A strenuous family dusted from its hands''<br>
''The sand of granite, and beholding far''<br>
''Along the sounding coast its pyramids''<br>
''And tall memorials catch the dying sun,''<br>
''Smiled well content, and to this childish task''<br>
''Around the fire addressed its evening hours.''
</blockquote>

===Atheism===
[[File:Rsl1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Stevenson at 35 in 1885]]
In other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress.<ref>Furnas (1952), 69–70; Mehew (2004)</ref> Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels.<ref>Furnas (1952), 53–7; Mehew (2004.</ref> More importantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an [[Atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Theo Tait |date=30 January 2005 |title=Like an intelligent hare – Theo Tait reviews Robert Louis Stevenson by Claire Harman |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3635932/Like-an-intelligent-hare.html |access-date=4 August 2013 |quote=A decadent dandy who envied the manly Victorian achievements of his family, a professed atheist haunted by religious terrors, a generous and loving man who fell out with many of his friends – the Robert Louis Stevenson of Claire Harman's biography is all of these and, of course, a bed-ridden invalid who wrote some of the finest adventure stories in the language. [...] Worse still, he affected a Bohemian style, haunted the seedier parts of the Old Town, read Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and declared himself an atheist. This caused a painful rift with his father, who damned him as a "careless infidel".}}</ref> In January 1873, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: "Disregard everything our parents have taught us". Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth.<ref>Furnas (1952), 69 with n. 15 (on the club); 72–6</ref> Stevenson no longer believed in God and had grown tired of pretending to be something he was not: "am I to live my whole life as one falsehood?" His father professed himself devastated: "You have rendered my whole life a failure." His mother accounted the revelation "the heaviest affliction" to befall her. "O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is", Stevenson wrote to his friend Charles Baxter, "to have just damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world."<ref name="Stevenson letters">{{Cite book |last=Stevenson |first=Robert Loui |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h269hZQCyHoC&pg=PA29 |title=Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-09124-9 |location=New Have CT |page=29 |access-date=23 October 2020}}</ref>

==="An Apology for Idlers"===
Justifying his rejection of an established profession,  in 1877 Stevenson offered "An Apology for Idlers". "A happy man or woman", he reasoned, "is a better thing to find than a five-pound note. He or she is a radiating focus of goodwill" and a practical demonstration of "the great Theorem of the Liveableness of Life". So that if they cannot be happy in the "handicap race for sixpenny pieces", let them take their own "by-road".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Robert Louis Stevenson "An Apology for Idlers" (first appeared in Cornhill Magazine, July 1877) |language=en-us |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2018/01/robert-louis-stevenson-apology-idlers/ |url-status=live |access-date=2021-03-18 |issn=1059-1028}}</ref>

==Early writing and travels==
===Literary and artistic connections===
[[File:Stevenson at Barbizon in 1876.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stevenson at age 26 in 1876 at [[Barbizon]], France]]
[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson at 26.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stevenson at age 26 by [[Charles Wirgman]]]]
Stevenson was visiting a cousin in England in late 1873 (Stevenson was 23) when he met two people who became very important to him: [[Sidney Colvin]] and Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell. Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, who was separated from her husband. She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin, who married her in 1901. Stevenson was also drawn to her, and they kept up a warm correspondence over several years in which he wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he addressed her as "[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]]").<ref>Furnas (1952), 81–2; 85–9; Mehew (2004)</ref> Colvin became Stevenson's literary adviser and was the first editor of his letters after his death. He placed Stevenson's first paid contribution in ''[[The Portfolio]]'', an essay entitled "Roads".<ref>Furnas (1952), 84–5</ref>

Stevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edmund Gosse]]<ref>Furnas (1952), 95; 101</ref> and [[Leslie Stephen]], the editor of ''[[The Cornhill Magazine]]'' who took an interest in Stevenson's work. Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the [[Edinburgh Infirmary]] named [[William Ernest Henley]], an energetic and talkative poet with a wooden leg. Henley became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888, and he is often considered to be the inspiration for [[Long John Silver]] in ''Treasure Island''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 123-4; Furnas (1952) 105–6; Mehew (2004)</ref>

Stevenson was sent to [[Menton]] on the French Riviera in November 1873 to recuperate after his health failed. He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that.<ref>Furnas (1952), 89–95</ref> He made long and frequent trips to the neighbourhood of the [[Forest of Fontainebleau]], staying at [[Barbizon]], [[Grez-sur-Loing]] and [[Nemours]] and becoming a member of the artists' colonies there. He also travelled to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 128–37</ref> He qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, and his father added a brass plate to the Heriot Row house reading "R.L. Stevenson, Advocate". His law studies did influence his books, but he never practised law;<ref>Furnas (1952), 100–1</ref> all his energies were spent in travel and writing. One of his journeys was a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson, a friend from the Speculative Society, a frequent travel companion, and the author of ''The Art of Golf'' (1887). This trip was the basis of his first travel book ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878).<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 127</ref>

Stevenson had a long correspondence with fellow Scot [[J.M. Barrie]]. He invited Barrie to visit him in [[Samoa]], but the two never met.<ref>Shaw, Michael (ed.) (2020), ''A Friendship in Letters: Robert Louis Stevenson & J.M. Barrie'', Sandstone Press, Inverness {{ISBN|978-1-913207-02-1}}</ref>

===Marriage===
[[File:Fanny Osbourne 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, c. 1876]]

The canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez in September 1876, where he met [[Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne]] (1840–1914), born in [[Indianapolis]]. She had married at age 17 and moved to [[Nevada]] to rejoin husband Samuel after his participation in the [[American Civil War]]. Their children were [[Isobel Osbourne|Isobel]] (or "Belle"), [[Lloyd Osbourne|Lloyd]] and Hervey (who died in 1875). But anger over her husband's infidelities led to a number of separations. In 1875, she had taken her children to France where she and Isobel studied art.<ref>Furnas (1952), 122–9; Mehew (2004)</ref> By the time Stevenson met her, Fanny was herself a magazine short-story writer of recognized ability.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Van de Grift Sanchez |first=Nellie |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24332?msg=welcome_stranger |title=The Life of Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson |date=1920 |publisher=C. Scribner's Sons |location=New York |access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref>

Stevenson returned to Britain shortly after this first meeting, but Fanny apparently remained in his thoughts, and he wrote the essay "On falling in love" for ''The Cornhill Magazine''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 145–6; Mehew (2004)</ref> They met again early in 1877 and became lovers. Stevenson spent much of the following year with her and her children in France.<ref>Furnas (1952), 130–6; Mehew (2004)</ref> In August 1878, she returned to San Francisco and Stevenson remained in Europe, making the walking trip that formed the basis for ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879). But he set off to join her in August 1879, against the advice of his friends and without notifying his parents. He took a second-class passage on the steamship ''[[Scillonian (1955)|Devonia]]'', in part to save money but also to learn how others travelled and to increase the adventure of the journey.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 164–5; Furnas (1952), 142–6; Mehew (2004)</ref> He then travelled overland by train from New York City to California. He later wrote about the experience in ''[[The Amateur Emigrant]]''. It was a good experience for his writing, but it broke his health.
[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson House, 530 Houston Street, Monterey (Monterey County, California).jpg|thumb|French Hotel (now "[[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]]"), [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]] where he stayed in 1879]]
[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson and family.jpg|thumb|right|Family in 1893: Wife [[Fanny Stevenson|Fanny]], Stevenson, his stepdaughter [[Isobel Osbourne|Isobel]], and his mother Margaret Balfour]]
He was near death when he arrived in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]], where some local ranchers nursed him back to health. He stayed for a time at the French Hotel located at 530 Houston Street, now a museum dedicated to his memory called the "[[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]]". While there, he often dined "on the cuff," as he said, at a nearby restaurant run by Frenchman Jules Simoneau, which stood at what is now Simoneau Plaza; several years later, he sent Simoneau an inscribed copy of his novel ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), writing that it would be a stranger case still if Robert Louis Stevenson ever forgot Jules Simoneau. While in Monterey, he wrote an evocative article about "the Old Pacific Capital" of Monterey.

By December 1879, Stevenson had recovered his health enough to continue to San Francisco where he struggled "all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts,"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, January 1880, ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter IV|Chapter IV]]</ref> in an effort to support himself through his writing. But by the end of the winter, his health was broken again and he found himself at death's door. Fanny was now divorced and recovered from her own illness, and she came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. "After a while," he wrote, "my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success."<ref>"To Edmund Gosse, Monterey, Monterey Co., California, 8 October 1879," ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter IV|Chapter IV]]</ref> When his father heard of his condition, he cabled him money to help him through this period.

Fanny and Robert were married in May 1880, although he said that he was "a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom."<ref>"To P. G. Hamerton, Kinnaird Cottage, Pitlochry [July 1881]," ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter V|Chapter V]]</ref> He travelled with his new wife and her son Lloyd<ref>Isobel was married to artist Joseph Strong.</ref> north of San Francisco to [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] and spent a summer honeymoon at an abandoned mining camp on [[Mount Saint Helena]] (today designated [[Robert Louis Stevenson State Park]]). He wrote about this experience in ''[[The Silverado Squatters]]''. He met [[Charles Warren Stoddard]], co-editor of the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'' and author of ''South Sea Idylls'', who urged Stevenson to travel to the South Pacific, an idea which returned to him many years later. In August 1880, he sailed with Fanny and Lloyd from New York to Britain and found his parents and his friend [[Sidney Colvin]] on the wharf at [[Liverpool]], happy to see him return home. Gradually, his wife was able to patch up differences between father and son and make herself a part of the family through her charm and wit.

===England, and back to the United States===

The Stevensons shuttled back and forth between Scotland and the Continent, finally settling in 1884 in the [[Westbourne, Dorset|Westbourne]] district of the English seaside town of [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]]. They lived in a house Stevenson named 'Skerryvore' after a Scottish lighthouse built by his uncle Alan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bournemouth {{!}} Robert Louis Stevenson |url=http://robert-louis-stevenson.org/bournemouth/ |access-date=2021-01-29 |website=robert-louis-stevenson.org}}</ref>

From April 1885 Stevenson had the company of the novelist [[Henry James]]. They had met previously in London and had recently exchanged views in journal articles on the “art of fiction” and thereafter in a correspondence in which they expressed their admiration for each other’s work. After James had moved to Bournemouth to help support his invalid sister, [[Alice James|Alice]], he took up the invitation to pay daily visits to Skerryvore for conversation at the Stevensons' dinner table.<ref name="O">{{Cite journal |last=O'Hagan |first=Andrew |date=2020 |title=Bournemouth |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n10/andrew-o-hagan/bournemouth |journal=The London Review of Books |volume=42 |issue=10 |issn=0260-9592}}</ref>

Largely bedridden, Stevenson described himself as living "like a weevil in a biscuit." Yet, despite ill health, during his three years in Westbourne, Stevenson wrote the bulk of his most popular work: ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (which established his wider reputation), ''[[The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses]]'', ''[[A Child's Garden of Verses]]'' and ''[[Underwoods]]''.

Thomas Stevenson died in 1887 leaving his son feeling free to follow the advice of his physician to try a complete change of climate. Stevenson headed for Colorado with his widowed mother and family. But after landing in New York, they decided to spend the winter in the [[Adirondacks]] at a cure cottage now known as [[Stevenson Cottage]] at [[Saranac Lake, New York]]. During the intensely cold winter, Stevenson wrote some of his best essays, including ''Pulvis et Umbra''. He also began ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' and lightheartedly planned a cruise to the southern Pacific Ocean for the following summer.<ref>"To W.E. Henley, Pitlochry, if you please, [August] 1881," ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter V|Chapter V]]</ref>

==Reflections on the art of writing==
Stevenson's critical essays on literature contain "few sustained analyses of style or content".<ref name="Brandeis">{{Cite web |title=Robert Louis Stevenson Biography |url=http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/stevensonbio.html |access-date=27 October 2020 |website=people.brandeis.edu |publisher=Brandeis University}}</ref> In "A Penny Plain and Two-pence Coloured" (1884) he suggests that his own approach owed much to the exaggerated and romantic world that, as a child, he had entered as proud owner of Skelt's Juvenile Drama—a toy set of cardboard characters who were actors in melodramatic dramas. "A Gossip on Romance" (1882) and "A Gossip on a Novel of Dumas's" (1887) imply that it is better to entertain than to instruct.
[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894).jpg|left|thumb]]
Stevenson very much saw himself in the mould of Sir Walter Scott, a storyteller with an ability to transport his readers away from themselves and their circumstances. He took issue with what he saw as the tendency in French realism to dwell on sordidness and ugliness. In "The Lantern-Bearer" (1888) he appears to take [[Emile Zola]] to task for failing to seek out nobility in his protagonists.<ref name="Brandeis" />

In "A Humble Remonstrance", Stevenson answers [[Henry James]]'s claim in "The Art of Fiction" (1884) that the novel competes with life. Stevenson protests that no novel can ever hope to match life's complexity; it merely abstracts from life to produce a harmonious pattern of its own.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stevenson |first=Robert Louis |title=A Humble Remonstrance |url=http://virgil.org/dswo/courses/novel/stevenson-remonstrance.pdf |access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref><blockquote>Man's one method, whether he reasons or creates, is to half-shut his eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality...Life is monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt and poignant; a work of art, in comparison, is neat, finite, self-contained, rational, flowing, and emasculate...The novel, which is a work of art, exists, not by its resemblances to life, which are forced and material ... but by its immeasurable difference from life, which is designed and significant.</blockquote> It is not clear, however, that in this there was any real basis for disagreement with James.<ref name="O" /> Stevenson had presented James with a copy of ''Kidnapped'', but it was ''Treasure Island'' that James favoured. Written as a story for boys, Stevenson had thought it in “no need of psychology or fine writing", but its success is credited with liberating children's writing from the "chains of Victorian [[didacticism]]".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Livesey |first=Margot |date=November 1994 |title=The Double Life of Robert Louis Stevenson |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/11/the-double-life-of-robert-louis-stevenson/306474/ |journal=The Atlantic |access-date=26 October 2020}}</ref>

During his college years, Stevenson briefly identified himself as a "red-hot socialist". But already by age 26 he was writing of looking back on this time "with something like regret. ... Now I know that in thus turning Conservative with years, I am going through the normal cycle of change and travelling in the common orbit of men's opinions."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stevenson, Robert Louis |title=Crabbed Age and Youth and Other Essays |publisher=Thomas B.

C. |location=Iowa City |page=30}}</ref> In 1866, Stevenson did vote for [[Benjamin Disraeli]], the [[One-nation conservatism|Tory democrat]] and future Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for the Lord Rectorship of the University of Edinburgh. But this was against a markedly illiberal challenger, the historian [[Thomas Carlyle]].<ref>Reginald Charles Terry (1996). "Robert Louis Stevenson: Interviews and Recollections". p. 49. University of Iowa Press,</ref>  Carlyle was notorious for his anti-democratic and pro-slavery views.<ref>Goldberg, David Theo (2008).

In "The Day after Tomorrow", appearing in ''The Contemporary Review'' (April 1887),<ref>Stevenson, Robert Louis (1887), ''The Contemporary Review'', Vol. LI, April, pp. 472-479.</ref><ref>Robert Louis Stevenson (1895) ''Collected works of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Edinburgh edition, Volume 11, 1895, &nbsp;https://digital.nls.uk/rlstevenson/browse/archive/90460506</ref> Stevenson suggested: "we are all becoming Socialists without knowing it". Legislation "grows authoritative, grows philanthropical, bristles with new duties and new penalties, and casts a spawn of inspectors, who now begin, note-book in hand, to darken the face of England".<ref>Collected Works pp. 286-287</ref> He is referring to the steady growth in social legislation in Britain since the first of the Conservative-sponsored [[Factory Acts]] (which, in 1833, established a professional [[Factory inspector|Factory Inspectorate]]). Stevenson cautioned that this "new waggon-load of laws" points to a future in which our grandchildren might "taste the pleasures of existence in something far liker an ant-heap that any previous human polity".<ref>Collected Works pp. 288</ref> Yet in reproducing the essay his latter-day libertarian admirers omit his express understanding for the abandonment of [[Whiggism|Whiggish]], [[Classical Liberalism|classical-liberal]] notions of [[laissez faire]]. "Liberty", Stevenson wrote, "has served us a long while" but like all other virtues "she has taken wages". <blockquote>[Liberty] has dutifully served Mammon; so that many things we were accustomed to admire as the benefits of freedom and common to all, were truly benefits of wealth, and took their value from our neighbour's poverty...Freedom to be desirable, involves kindness, wisdom, and all the virtues of the free; but the free man as we have seen him in action has been, as of yore, only the master of many helots; and the slaves are still ill-fed, ill-clad, ill-taught, ill-housed, insolently entreated, and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of famine.<ref>Collected Works pp. 287-288</ref></blockquote>

In January 1888, in response to American press coverage of the [[Land War]] in Ireland, Stevenson penned a political essay (rejected by ''Scribner's'' magazine and never published in his lifetime) that advanced a broadly conservative theme: the necessity of "staying internal violence by rigid law". Notwithstanding his title, "Confessions of a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]]", Stevenson defends neither the [[Acts of Union 1800|union with Britain]] (she had "majestically demonstrated her incapacity to rule Ireland") nor "landlordism" (scarcely more defensible in Ireland than, as he had witnessed it, in the goldfields of California). Rather he protests the readiness to pass "lightly" over crimes—"unmanly murders and the harshest extremes of [[Boycott|boycotting]]"—where these are deemed "political". This he argues is to "defeat law" (which is ever a "compromise") and to invite "anarchy": it is "the sentimentalist preparing the pathway for the brute".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stevenson |first=Robert Louis |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044086813177&view=1up&seq=10 |title=Confessions of a Unionist |date=1921 |publisher=Privately Printed by G.G.

In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht ''Casco'' and set sail with his family from San Francisco. The vessel "plowed her path of snow across the empty deep, far from all track of commerce, far from any hand of help."<ref>Quoted from Stevenson's diary in Overton, Jacqueline M. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15547/15547-h/15547-h.htm The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson for Boys and Girls]''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933</ref> The sea air and thrill of adventure for a time restored his health, and for nearly three years he wandered the eastern and central Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he became a good friend of King [[Kalākaua]]. He befriended the king's niece Princess [[Ka'iulani|Victoria Kaiulani]], who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time at the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Tahiti]], New Zealand and the [[Samoan Islands]]. During this period, he completed ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'', composed two ballads based on the legends of the islanders, and wrote ''[[The Bottle Imp]]''. He preserved the experience of these years in his various letters and in his ''In the South Seas'' (which was published posthumously).<ref>''In the South Seas'' (1896) & (1900) Chatto & Windus; republished by The Hogarth Press (1987).

Stevenson left [[Sydney]], Australia, on the ''Janet Nicoll'' in April 1890 for his third and final voyage among the South Seas islands.<ref name="fanny1914">[https://archive.org/details/cruiseofjanetnic00stevuoft ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol Among the South Sea Islands''], Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson, [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], New York, 1914</ref> He intended to produce another book of travel writing to follow his earlier book ''In the South Seas'', but it was his wife who eventually published her journal of their third voyage.

===Political engagement in Samoa===
In December 1889 Stevenson and his extended family arrived at the port of Apia in the Samoan islands and there he and Fanny decided to settle. In January 1890 they purchased 314¼ acres at Vailima, some miles inland from Apia the capital, on which they built the islands’ first two-storey house. Fanny's sister, Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez, wrote that “it was in Samoa that the word ‘home’ first began to have a real meaning for these gypsy wanderers”.<ref name="Farrell 2019">{{Cite news |last=Farrell |first=Joseph |date=8 September 2019 |title=The story of Samoa's love for Robert Louis Stevenson |work=The National |url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/17887450.story-samoas-love-robert-louis-stevenson/ |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> In May 1891, they were joined by Stevenson's mother, Margaret. While his wife set about managing and working the estate, Stevenson took the native name Tusitala (Samoan for "Teller of Tales"), and began collecting local stories. Often he would exchange these for his own tales. The first work of literature in Samoan was his translation of ''The Bottle Imp'',<ref name="Farrell 2019" /> which presents a Pacific-wide community as the setting for a moral fable.

Immersing himself in the islands' culture, occasioned a "political awakening": it placed Stevenson "at an angle" to the rival [[great power]]s, Britain, [[German Empire|Germany]] and the United States whose [[warship]]s were common sights in Samoan harbours.<ref name="Jamie">{{Cite news |last=Jamie |first=Kathleen |date=20 August 2017 |title=Scot of the South Seas: Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa |work=New Statesman |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/08/scot-south-seas-robert-louis-stevenson-samoa |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="Farrell" /> He understood that, as in the [[Scottish Highlands]] (comparisons with his homeland "came readily"), an indigenous clan society was unprepared for the arrival of foreigners who played upon its existing rivalries and divisions. As the external pressures upon Samoan society grew, tensions soon descended into several inter-clan wars.<ref name="Calder">Jenni Calder, Introduction, {{Cite book |last=Stevenson |first=Robert Louis |title=Island Landfalls |date=1987 |publisher=Cannongate |isbn=0-86241-144-0 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref>

No longer content to be a "romancer", Stevenson became a reporter and an agitator, firing off letters to ''[[The Times]]'' which "rehearsed with an ironic twist that surely owed something to his Edinburgh legal training", a tale of European and American misconduct.<ref name="Calder" /> His concern for the [[Polynesians]] is also found in the ''South Sea Letters'', published in magazines in 1891 (and then in book form as ''In the South Seas'' in 1896). In an effort he feared might result in his own deportation, Stevenson helped secure the recall of two European officials. ''[[A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa]]'' (1892) was a detailed chronicle of the intersection of rivalries between the great powers and the first [[Samoan Civil War]].

As much as he said he disdained politics—"I used to think meanly of the plumber", he wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin, "but how he shines beside the politician!"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, 17 April 1893, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XXVIII|Chapter XXVIII]]</ref>—Stevenson felt himself obliged to take sides. He openly allied himself with chief Mataafa, whose rival Malieta was backed by the Germans whose firms were beginning to monopolise [[copra]] and cocoa bean processing.<ref name="Farrell" />

Stevenson was alarmed above all by what he perceived as the Samoans' economic innocence. In 1894 just months before his death, he addressed the island chiefs:<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lang |first=Andrew |url=https://www.readcentral.com/mobile/chapters/Andrew-Lang/The-Works-of-Robert-Louis-Stevenson-Vol-25/011 |title=The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson Vol 25, Appendix II |date=1911 |publisher=Chatto and Windnes |location=London |access-date=23 October 2020}}</ref><blockquote>There is but one way to defend Samoa. Hear it before it is too late. It is to make roads, and gardens, and care for your trees, and sell their produce wisely, and, in one word, to occupy and use your country...  if you do not occupy and use your country, others will. It will not continue to be yours or your children's, if you occupy it for nothing. You and your children will, in that case, be cast out into outer darkness".</blockquote> He had "seen these judgments of God", not only in Hawaii where abandoned native churches stood like tombstones "over a grave, in the midst of the white men’s sugar fields", but also in Ireland and "in the mountains of my own country Scotland".<blockquote>These were a fine people in the past brave, gay, faithful, and very much like Samoans, except in one particular, that they were much wiser and better at that business of fighting of which you think so much. But the time came to them as it now comes to you, and it did not find them ready...</blockquote>

Five years after Stevenson's death, the Samoan Islands were partitioned between Germany and the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=German Colonies in the Pacific {{!}} National Library of Australia |url=https://www.nla.gov.au/selected-library-collections/german-colonies-in-the-pacific |access-date=2021-01-29 |website=www.nla.gov.au}}</ref>

==Last works==
[[File:Stevenson Barnett.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Portrait by [[Henry Walter Barnett]], 1893]]
Stevenson wrote an estimated 700,000 words during his years on Samoa. He completed ''[[The Beach of Falesá]]'', the first-person tale of a Scottish [[copra]] trader on a South Sea island. Wiltshire is heroic in terms neither of his actions nor a preoccupation with his own soul. Rather he is a man of limited understanding and imagination, comfortable with his own prejudices: where, he wonders, can he find "whites" for his "half caste" daughters. The villains are white, their behaviour towards the islanders ruthlessly duplicitous.

Stevenson saw "The Beach of Falesá" as the ground-breaking work in his turn away from romance to realism. Stevenson wrote to his friend [[Sidney Colvin]]:
{{quote|It is the first realistic South Seas story; I mean with real South Sea character and details of life. Everybody else that has tried, that I have seen, got carried away by the romance, and ended in a kind of sugar candy sham epic, and the whole effect was lost... Now I have got the smell and look of the thing a good deal. You will know more about the South Seas after you have read my little tale than if you had read a library.<ref name="owc">[[Roslyn Jolly]] (editor). ''Robert Louis Stevenson: South Sea Tales''. The World's Classics. Oxford University Press. 1996. See "Introduction".</ref>}}

''[[The Ebb-Tide]]'' (1894), the misadventures of three deadbeats marooned in the [[Tahiti]]an port of [[Papeete]], has been described as presenting "a microcosm of imperialist society, directed by greedy but incompetent whites, the labour supplied by long-suffering natives who fulfil their duties without orders and are true to the missionary faith which the Europeans make no pretence of respecting".<ref name="sst">[[Roslyn Jolly]], "Introduction" in ''Robert Louis Stevenson: South Sea Tales'' (1996)</ref> It confirmed the new Realistic turn in Stevenson's writing away from romance and adolescent adventure. The first sentence reads: "Throughout the island world of the Pacific, scattered men of many European races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and disseminate disease". No longer was Stevenson writing about human nature "in terms of a contest between Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde": "the edges of moral responsibility and the margins of moral judgement were too blurred".<ref name="Calder" /> As with ''The Beach of Falesà'', in ''The Ebb Tide'' contemporary reviewers find parallels with several of Conrad's works: ''[[Almayer’s Folly]]'', ''[[An Outcast of the Islands]]'', ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]’'', ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', ''[[Lord Jim]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tabachnick |first=Stephen |date=January 2011 |title=Robert Louis Stevenson and Joseph Conrad: Writers of Transition (review) |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236819296 |journal=English Literature in Transition 1880-1920 |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=247–250 |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="Sandison">{{Cite book |last=Sandison |first=Alan |title=Robert Louis Stevenson and the Appearance of Modernism |date=1996 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-39295-7 |location=London |pages=317–368}}</ref><ref name="Farrell">{{Cite book |last=Farrell |first=Joseph |title=Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa |date=2017 |publisher=Maclehose Press |isbn=978-0-85705-995-6 |location=London}}</ref>

With his imagination still residing in Scotland and returning to earlier form, Stevenson also wrote ''[[Catriona (novel)|Catriona]]'' (1893), a sequel to his earlier novel ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' (1886), continuing the adventures of its hero David Balfour.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Robert Louis Stevenson – Bibliography: Detailed list of works |url=http://www.robert-louis-stevenson.org/works |access-date=20 April 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson and "Jack".jpg|right|thumb|<center>Stevenson on horseback</center>]]
On 3 December 1894, Stevenson was talking to his wife and straining to open a bottle of wine when he suddenly exclaimed, "What's that?", asked his wife "does my face look strange?", and collapsed.<ref name=":0">Balfour, Graham (1906).

Stevenson was seen for much of the 20th century as a second-class writer. He became relegated to children's literature and horror genres,<ref name="arata" /> condemned by literary figures such as [[Virginia Woolf]] (daughter of his early mentor [[Leslie Stephen]]) and her husband [[Leonard Woolf]], and he was gradually excluded from the canon of literature taught in schools.<ref name="arata" /> His exclusion reached its nadir in the 1973 2,000-page ''Oxford Anthology of English Literature'' where he was entirely unmentioned, and ''[[The Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' excluded him from 1968 to 2000 (1st–7th editions), including him only in the 8th edition (2006).<ref name=arata/>

[[File:Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Portrait in 1893 by Barnett]]
The late 20th century brought a re-evaluation of Stevenson as an artist of great range and insight, a literary theorist, an essayist and social critic, a witness to the colonial [[history of the Pacific Islands]] and a humanist.<ref name=arata/> He was praised by [[Roger Lancelyn Green]], one of the Oxford [[Inklings]], as a writer of a consistently high level of "literary skill or sheer imaginative power" and a pioneer of the Age of the Story Tellers along with [[H. Rider Haggard]].<ref>introduction to 1965 [[Everyman's Library]] edition of the one-volume ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]''</ref> He is now evaluated as a peer of authors such as [[Joseph Conrad]] (whom Stevenson influenced with his South Seas fiction) and [[Henry James]], with new scholarly studies and organisations devoted to him.<ref name="arata">Stephen Arata (2006). "Robert Louis Stevenson". David Scott Kastan (ed.). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature''. Vol. 5: 99–102</ref> Throughout the vicissitudes of his scholarly reception, Stevenson has remained popular worldwide. According to the [[Index Translationum]], Stevenson is ranked the 26th-most-translated author in the world, ahead of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name="indextrans">{{Cite web |title=Top 50 Authors |url=http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 |access-date=17 January 2019 |website=Index Translationum |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization}}</ref>

On the subject of Stevenson's modern reputation, American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in 1996,

{{quote|I was talking to a friend the other day who said he'd never met a child who liked reading Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island''.

Neither have I, I said. And he'd never met a child who liked reading Stevenson's ''Kidnapped''. Me neither, I said. My early exposure to both books was via the [[Classics Illustrated]] comic books. But I did read the books later, when I was no longer a kid, and I enjoyed them enormously. Same goes for Stevenson's ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde''.

The fact is, Stevenson is a splendid writer of stories for adults, and he should be put on the same shelf with [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Jack London]] instead of in between [[Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Peter Pan]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=1996-02-16 |title=Muppet Treasure Island |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/muppet-treasure-island-1996 |access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>}}

===United States===
The [[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]] at 530 Houston Street in [[Monterey, California]], formerly the French Hotel, memorializes Stevenson's 1879 stay in "the Old Pacific Capital", as he was crossing the United States to join his future wife, Fanny Osbourne. The Stevenson House museum is graced with a [[bas-relief]] depicting the sickly author writing in bed.

[[Spyglass Hill Golf Course]], originally called Pebble Beach Pines Golf Club, was renamed "Spyglass Hill" by [[Samuel Finley Brown Morse|Samuel F. B. Morse]] (1885–1969), the founder of Pebble Beach Company, after a place in Stevenson's ''Treasure Island''. All the holes at Spyglass Hill are named after characters and places in the novel.

The Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in St. Helena, California, is home to over 11,000 objects and artifacts, the majority of which belonged to Stevenson. Opened in 1969, the museum houses such treasures as his childhood rocking chair, writing desk, toy soldiers and personal writings among many other items. The museum is free to the public and serves as an academic archive for students, writers and Stevenson enthusiasts.

In [[San Francisco]] there is an outdoor [[Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial]] in [[Portsmouth Square]].

===England and France===
A garden was designed by the Bournemouth Corporation in 1957 as a memorial to Stevenson, on the site of his [[Westbourne, Dorset|Westbourne]] house, "Skerryvore", which he occupied from 1885 to 1887. A statue of the [[Skerryvore]] lighthouse is present on the site. Robert Louis Stevenson Avenue in Westbourne is named after him.

The Chemin de Stevenson ([[GR 70]]) is a popular long-distance footpath in France that approximately follows Stevenson's route as described in ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]''. There are numerous monuments and businesses named after him along the route, including a fountain in the town of [[Saint-Jean-du-Gard]] where Stevenson sold his donkey Modestine and took a stagecoach to [[Alès]].<ref name="castle">{{Cite book |last=Castle |first=Alan |title=The Robert Louis Stevenson Trail |date=2007 |publisher=Cicerone |isbn=978-1-85284-511-7 |edition=2nd}}</ref>
