'''Barbara Hambly''' (born August 28, 1951) is an American [[novelist]] and [[screenwriter]] within the genres of [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], and [[historical fiction]]. She has a bestselling mystery series featuring a [[free people of color|free man of color]], a musician and physician, in New Orleans in the antebellum years. She also wrote a novel about [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].

Her science fiction novels occur within an explicit [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]], as well as within previously existing settings (notably as established by ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'').

== Early life and education ==
Hambly was born in [[San Diego, California]] and grew up in [[Montclair, California|Montclair]], [[California]].  Her parents, Everett Edward Hambly Jr. and Florence Elizabeth (Moraski) Hambly, are from Fall River, Massachusetts; and Scranton, Pennsylvania (respectively).  She has an older sister, Mary Ann Sanders, and a younger brother, Everett Edward Hambly, III.  In her early teens, after reading [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', she affixed images of dragons to her bedroom door. She became interested in costumery from an early age, and has been a long-time participant in [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] activities. In the mid-1960s, the Hambly family spent a year in Australia.

Hambly has a Masters in [[Medieval History]] from the [[University of California, Riverside]]. She completed her degree in 1975 and spent a year in [[Bordeaux, France|Bordeaux]] as part of her studies.

== Career ==
She chose work that allowed her time to write;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarahambly.com/hambio.htm |title=Biography of Barbara Hambly |publisher=Barbarahambly.com |date=1999-09-17 |access-date=2013-02-07}}</ref> all of her novels contain a biography paragraph with a litany of jobs: high school [[teacher]], [[Model (person)|model]], waitress, technical editor, all-night liquor store clerk, and Shotokan [[karate]] instructor. Her first published novel was ''[[The Time of the Dark]]'' (1982).

Hambly served as President of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] from 1994 to 1996.  Her works have been nominated for many awards in the [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]] categories, winning a [[Locus Award]] for Best Horror Novel ''[[Those Who Hunt The Night|Those Who Hunt the Night]]'' (1989) (released in the UK as ''Immortal Blood'') and the [[Lord Ruthven Award]] for fiction for its sequel, ''[[Traveling with the Dead]]'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarahambly.com/hambooks.htm |title=Books and awards |publisher=Barbarahambly.com |access-date=2013-02-07}}</ref>

== Marriage and personal life ==
Hambly was married for some years to [[George Alec Effinger]], a science fiction writer. He died in 2002. She lives in Los Angeles.  Hambly speaks freely of suffering from [[seasonal affective disorder]], which was undiagnosed for some time.

== Themes within fantasy ==
Hambly's work has several themes. She has a penchant for unusual characters within the fantasy genre, such as the menopausal witch and reluctant scholar-lord in the ''Winterlands'' trilogy, or the [[Philology|philologist]] secret service agent in the vampire novels.<ref>[http://www.strangehorizons.com/2000/20000911/Article_Hambly_Pellegrino.shtml "Review of female characters in Barbara Hambly novels"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114031303/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2000/20000911/Article_Hambly_Pellegrino.shtml |date=2006-11-14 }}, ''Strange Horizons''</ref>

Her writing is filled with rich descriptions and characters whose actions bear consequences for both their lives and relationships, suffusing her series with a sense of loss and regret.<ref name="AS">{{cite web|author=yGen User |url=http://www.andromedaspaceways.com/inter_0002.htm |title=Interview with Andromeda Spaceways |publisher=Andromedaspaceways.com |date=2005-12-25 |access-date=2013-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211165838/http://www.andromedaspaceways.com/inter_0002.htm |archive-date=2012-02-11 }}</ref> Hambly's characters suffer  the pain of frustrated aspirations to a degree that is uncommon in most fantasy novels.<ref name="clute">Clute, J. & Grant, J. (1999).  ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy''. Orbit: London (UK)</ref>

Though using many standard clichés and plot devices of the fantasy genre, her works explore the ethical implications of the consequences of these devices, and what their effect is for the characters, were they real people. In avoiding the "...easy consolatory self-identification of genre fantasy"<ref name="clute"/> (p.&nbsp;449) and refusing to let her work be guided more explicitly by conventions and the desires of her audience, Hambly may have missed out on more remunerative success and acclaim.<ref name="clute"/>

Although magic exists in many of her settings, it is not used as an easy solution but follows rules and takes energy from the wizards. The unusual settings are generally rationalized as alternative universes.

Hambly heavily researches her settings, either in person or through books, frequently drawing upon her degree in medieval history for background and depth.<ref name="futurefiction">[http://www.futurefiction.com/barbara_hambly.htm Review of Barbara Hambly as an author] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614185931/http://futurefiction.com/barbara_hambly.htm |date=2006-06-14 }}, Future Fiction website</ref>

===[[Benjamin January]] mysteries===
This [[historical mystery]] series begins with ''A Free Man of Color'' (1997) and features [[The Benjamin January Mysteries|Benjamin January]], a brilliant, classically educated, free colored surgeon and musician living in [[New Orleans]] during the [[antebellum South|antebellum]] years of the 1830s. At the time, New Orleans had a large and prosperous population of free people of color. Born a slave, as his mother was enslaved, January was freed as a young child by his mother's lover, under the [[plaçage]] system. Provided with an excellent education, he gained fluency in several classical and modern languages, and was thoroughly versed in the whole of classical Western learning and arts.  He studied medicine in Paris, where he trained as a surgeon. He returned to Louisiana to escape the memory of his late wife, a woman from North Africa. As a free black in Louisiana, he cannot find work as a surgeon. He earns a modest living by his exceptional talent as a musician.
