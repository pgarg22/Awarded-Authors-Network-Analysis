'''Ulrich Becher''' (2 January 1910 – 15 April 1990) was a German [[author]] and [[playwright]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Becher ulrich 1924.png|thumb|270px|Becher ulrich 1924]]
Becher was born in [[Berlin]], where, after attending the Freie Schulgemeinde in [[Wickersdorf]], he studied law.  During his school years he had already made the acquaintance of [[George Grosz]], who had taken on the talented youth as his only pupil.

In 1932, his novella series ''Männer machen Fehler'' ("Men Make Mistakes") was published by [[Rowohlt Verlag]]. In the same year Becher became a member of PEN. On the assumption of power by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] in 1933, his work was condemned as "degenerate" literature, and he was the youngest writer to have his works thrown into a book-burning fire (see [[degenerate art]] for more information). On 11 November 1933, he married Dana, daughter of the Austrian author [[Alexander Roda Roda]] and consequently took Austrian citizenship.  As the son of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] pianist Elisabeth Ulrich, he hoped he would be able to live in Switzerland as an author, however in the eyes of the Swiss authorities his [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] stance went against Switzerland's neutrality policy.  He was consequently denied a work permit and was driven to emigrate.  At the last minute, Becher and his wife succeeded in escaping to Brazil via Portugal in 1941.  Efforts to obtain a visa to enter the United States were to last three years.  At last, Becher was granted permission to enter the country and settled in [[New York City]] near his parents and parents-in-law.

In 1948, he returned to Europe with ''Der Bockerer'' ("Bockerer"), a completed theatre play that he had created with Peter Preses, which went on to have great success in [[Vienna]] (and which was turned into a film in [[1981 in film|1981]] by [[Franz Antel]]).  In 1954 he settled in Basel, and in 1976 he won the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Swiss Schiller Foundation.  He died in [[Basel]], aged 80.
