==Overview==
Williams was born in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] to Thomas Benjamin and Georgette Williams, and raised in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. He attended [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]] in Washington, and then [[Princeton University]],<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/jonathan-williams The Poetry Foundation]</ref> before dropping out to pursue the arts. Williams studied painting with [[Karl Knaths]] at the Phillips Gallery in Washington DC, and engraving and graphic arts with [[Stanley William Hayter]] at Atelier 17 in New York,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/06/culture.obituaries|title=Obituary: Jonathan Williams|last=Hrebeniak|first=Michael|date=2008-06-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> followed by a semester at the [[Chicago Institute of Design]]. In 1951, he arrived at [[Black Mountain College]] to study photography with [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] and [[Aaron Siskind]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackmountainstudiesjournal.org/volume3/3-2-ross-hair/|title=Jonathan Williams and Black Mountain by Ross Hair|website=BMCS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref> At Black Mountain College, Williams met and was influenced by the College's rector, [[Charles Olson]].

Also in 1951,  Williams founded Jargon Books (later [[The Jargon Society]]) together with David Ruff, with the goal of publishing obscure writers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Lacy|date=2017-07-26|title=Black Mountain Poetry|url=https://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-580|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.580|isbn=9780190201098}}</ref> Based in [[Scaly Mountain, North Carolina]], as well as the Yorkshire Dales in England, Jargon was long associated with the [[Black Mountain Poets]]. The press has published work by [[Charles Olson]], [[Paul Metcalf]], [[Lorine Niedecker]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Mina Loy]], [[Joel Oppenheimer]], [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]], [[James Broughton]], [[Alfred Starr Hamilton]] and many other works by the American and British [[avant-garde]]. Since Williams' death, The Jargon Society has continued publication through the [[Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jargonbooks.com/|title=The Jargon Society|website=jargonbooks.com|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>

Once described as "a busy gadfly who happened somehow to pitch on a slope in western North Carolina," Williams was a living link between the experimental poets of [[Modernist literature|Modernism]]'s "second wave" and the unknown vernacular artists of [[Appalachia]].<ref>[http://www.ncwriters.org/services/lhof/inductees/jwilliam.htm Biography of Jonathan Williams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113072200/http://www.ncwriters.org/services/lhof/inductees/jwilliam.htm |date=2006-01-13 }}.</ref>  [[Guy Davenport]] likened Williams' use of "found language" to the use of "found footage" by avant-garde filmmakers, as well as describing Williams as a species of [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]].  Williams for his part explained the fascination of such material in plainer terms:

{{quote|Well, as you know, a lot of my poetry is found and that's, I think, because I think I'm quite a good listener and I'm willing to lay back and listen, and I think it's something do with living in the country. I mean, this place, Skywinding Farm, there are times when Tom Meyer and I will only see somebody from the outside world once or twice a week. And we've known each other so long that we don't talk as much as we might. Tom can talk up a storm, He's up there in the Duncan/Olson class. So I like to listen and I like to hear things, so if you listen carefully then you do find things. I do it all the time. I mean, you know the early book, Blues and Roots, which was done in the course of walking a big piece of the Appalachian Trail, I listened to mountain people for over a thousand miles and I really heard some amazing stuff. And I left it pretty much as I heard it. I didn't have to do anything but organize a little bit, crystallize it, you know. That's the thing I love about found material, you wake it up, you "make" it into something.}}

The literary critic [[Hugh Kenner]] described Williams as the "[[truffle hound]] of American poetry."

Williams was also a longtime contributing editor of the photography journal ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]].''

Williams divided his time between England and Scaly Mountain, North Carolina. He died March 16, 2008 in Highlands, North Carolina from pneumonia.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/books/30williams.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Jonathan+williams&st=nyt&oref=slogin Jonathan Williams, Publisher, Dies at 79], New York Times Article (March 30, 2008)</ref> He was survived by his longtime partner, Thomas Meyer.
