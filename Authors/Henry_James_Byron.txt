[[Image:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 47.jpg|right|thumb|Byron in the 1870s]]
'''Henry James Byron''' (8 January 1835 – 11 April 1884) was a prolific English dramatist, as well as an editor, journalist, director, theatre manager, novelist and actor.

After an abortive start at a medical career, Byron struggled as a provincial actor and aspiring playwright in the 1850s.  Returning to London and beginning to study for the [[Bar examination|Bar]], he finally found playwriting success in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and other punny plays.  In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with [[Marie Wilton]], of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, ''[[Our Boys]]''.  In his last years, he grew frail from [[tuberculosis]] and died at the age of 49.

==Biography==
Byron was born in [[Manchester]], England, the son of Henry Byron (1804–1884, second cousin to the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and descendant of many Lord Byrons), at one time British consul in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and Elizabeth Josephine ''née'' Bradley.  He was educated in [[Essex]] and then at St. Peter's Collegiate School in [[Eaton Square]], London.  Although his mother wanted him to pursue a career in the Navy, Byron did not do so.  Instead, he first became a physician's clerk in London for four years and then studied medicine with his grandfather, Dr. James Byron Bradley, in [[Buxton]].  Byron married Martha Foulkes (1831–1876) in London in 1856.  He entered the [[Middle Temple]] as a student briefly in 1858, but he had already begun writing for the stage and soon returned to that vocation.<ref name=dnb>Thomson, Peter.

===Early career===
[[File:Byron-jack-the-giant-killer.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for Byron's 1859–60 pantomime, ''Jack the Giant Killer'']]
Byron joined several provincial companies as an actor from 1853–57, sometimes in his own plays and sometimes in those of [[T. W. Robertson]] (with whom he acted and starved) or others, but had little success.  He described his early attempts at acting, and the hardships of the journeyman touring actor, in an 1873 essay for ''The Era Almanack and Annual'' called "Eighteen Parts a Week".  He began writing [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] of melodramas and [[extravaganza]]s in the mid-1850s.  In 1857, his burlesque of ''Richard of the Lion Heart'' premièred at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]].  His successful works in 1858 included ''The Lady of Lyons, or, Twopenny Pride and Pennytence'' and ''Fra Diavolo Travestie; or, The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl'', also at the Strand, which later played in New York.  This was so well received that Byron abandoned the law to concentrate full-time on theatre.<ref name=dnb/> Another successful Strand burlesque in 1858 was ''The Maid and the Magpie; or, The Fatal Spoon'' an early play to include a dance at the end of a song.  This starred [[Marie Wilton]] as Pippo and was also revived in New York.  In 1859, he wrote another successful burlesque, ''The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds''.  He soon wrote other burlesques for the Strand, the [[Olympic Theatre]], and the [[Adelphi Theatre]], as well as a sequence of Christmas [[pantomime]]s for the [[Princess's Theatre]], beginning in 1859 with ''Jack the Giant Killer, or, Harlequin, King Arthur, and ye Knights of ye Round Table''<ref name=Lee>Lee, Amy Wai Sum.

Byron also wrote for periodicals, and in 1861, he became the first editor of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine, where he showcased the comic talents of the then-unknown [[W. S. Gilbert]].  He became editor of ''Comic News'' in 1863.  He also founded the short-lived ''Comic Trials'' and wrote a [[three-volume novel]], ''Paid in Full'', in 1865.  In 1867, he became the editor of ''Wag'', another humour magazine.<ref name=Lee/> He wrote numerous dramatic critiques and humorous essays for magazines, including the rival of ''Fun'', ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.<ref name=Timesobit>''[[The Times]]'', 14 April 1884, p. 7, col. C</ref> During this period, he was a well-known man-about-town, joining, and popular as a guest at, various London dining clubs and, in 1863, becoming a founding member of the Arundel Club.<ref name=dnb/> [[Henry Morley]] acknowledged with dismay Byron's position in the literary world as chief punster but found in him "a true power of fun that makes itself felt by high and low".<ref>''Journal of a London Playgoer'', 1866, p. 209</ref> He became a Member of the Dramatic Authors' Society by 1860.<ref>[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script of Byron's ''Robinson Crusoe; or, Harlequin Friday'' (1860)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

At the same time, he continued writing for the Strand, the Adelphi, the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and the Princess's, among other London theatres.<ref name=dnb/> Among Byron's dozens of plays in the early 1860s, his early successes were mostly burlesques, such as ''Bluebeard from a New Point of Hue'' (1860); ''Cinderella'' (1860); ''Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp'' (1861);<ref>Byron's 1861 ''Aladdin'' featured the début of the [[pantomime]] character, [[Widow Twankey]], first played by James Rogers.</ref> and ''Esmeralda, or, The Sensation Goat'' (1861), all in rhymed couplets.<ref>Stedman, Jane. [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=23619681# ''W.S. Gilbert: A Classic Victorian and His Theatre''], Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> Another success was ''George de Barnwell; or Harlequin Folly in the Realms of Fancy'' (1862).  Several of these early plays were revived in Britain and received New York productions.<ref name=Lee/>

[[File:Dearer-than-life-1868.png|thumb|left|350px|1868 production of ''Dearer Than Life'' showing seated l. to r. [[J.L. Toole|Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and [[Henry Irving|Irving]]]]
Between 1865 and 1867, he joined [[Marie Wilton]], whom he had met through his early work at the Strand, in the management of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  She provided the capital, and he was to write the plays.  His first was a burlesque of ''[[La sonnambula]]''.  However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, but he agreed to write his first prose comedies, ''War to the Knife'' (a success in 1865) and ''A Hundred Thousand Pounds'' (1866).  They also staged one of T. W. Robertson's biggest successes, ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', in 1865.<ref name=dnb/> Upon his severing the partnership and starting theatre management on his own account in the provinces, he lost money, ending up in bankruptcy court in 1868.  However, he produced many of his plays at these theatres while continuing to write for London theatres.  One successful provincial work was ''Dearer than Life'' (1867), which received many revivals, beginning with a London revival in 1868 starring [[J. L. Toole]] and the young [[Henry Irving]].  Another, the same year, was ''The Lancashire Lass; or, Tempted, Tried and True'' (1867), a melodrama, also revived in London in 1868.  He even collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on ''Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife'', which played in 1867 at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.<ref name=Lee/>

===Return to acting and later years===
He returned to acting, making his London acting début, in 1869, achieving much greater success than in his early attempts, as Sir Simon Simple in his comedy ''Not Such a Fool as He Looks''.<ref name=utility>Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero"], ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, The Johns Hopkins University Press</ref> He followed this with successful outings as Fitzaltamont in ''The Prompter's Box: A Story of the Footlights and the Fireside'' (1870), ''The Prompter's Box'' (1870, revived in 1875 and often thereafter, and later renamed ''The Crushed Tragedian''), Captain Craven in ''Daisy Farm'' (1871) and Lionel Leveret in ''Old Soldiers'' (1873).  Byron's acting was again admired in ''An American Lady'' in 1874, with which he began as the manager of the [[Criterion Theatre]], and then ''Married in Haste'' (1875) which was much revived.  In 1876, he played in his ''The Bull by the Horns'' and ''Old Chums''.  Other roles included Dick Simpson in ''Conscience Money'' (1878), Charles Chuckles in his ''An English Gentleman'' (1879) and John Blunt in his ''Michael Strogoff'' (1881).<ref name=Lee/> In 1881, he played the role of Cheviot Hill in a revival of his friend Gilbert's eccentric comedy, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]''.<ref name=utility/> He continued acting until 1882, when ill health forced him to retire.  Not surprisingly, Byron achieved his greatest acting successes in timing of the delivery of his own witty lines.<ref name=dnb/>  ''The Times'' explained that "in such parts as Gibson Greene in ''Married in Haste'', a self-possessed, observant, satirical, well-bred man of the world, [Byron] was beyond the reach of rivalry.  To ease and grace of manner he united a peculiar aptitude for the delivery of the good things he put into his own mouth."<ref name=Timesobit/>

[[File:Ourboys2a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Our Boys'', 1875]]
Byron continued to write prose comedies with the ambitious semi-autobiographical ''Cyril's Success'' (1868), ''The Upper Crust'' (starring Toole), ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' (1870, starring Henry Irving), ''An English Gentleman'' (1871, starring [[Edward Sothern]]),<ref>''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12</ref> ''Weak Woman'' (1875, starring [[Marion Terry]]), and his greatest success, ''[[Our Boys]]'' (1875–79, [[Vaudeville Theatre]]).<ref name=Lee/> With 1,362 performances in its original production, ''Our Boys'' set the record for the longest-running play in history and held it for almost two decades.<ref>Booth, Michael R. Review of plays by H. J. Byron including ''Our Boys'' in ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 82, No. 3, pp. 716-17, July 1987, Modern Humanities Research Association</ref> It was also much revived, especially in America.<ref name=Timesobit/> 

From 1876 to 1879, he wrote several successful burlesques for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], such as a burlesque of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''Don Caesar de Bazan'' called ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'',<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Information about ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'' and the Gaiety Theatre] at VictorianWeb.org</ref> and ''The Gaiety Gulliver'' (1879).  Also during that period, he edited the humour magazine ''Mirth''.<ref name=Lee/> In 1878, he co-wrote a highly successful charity pantomime, ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'', together with [[Robert Reece]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[F. C. Burnand]]. In 1880, four volumes of his plays were published, with fourteen plays in each book.<ref>Byron, Henry James. "Plays Volumes One to Four", Samuel French & Thomas Lacy (1880)</ref> After 1880, as his health greatly declined, so did Byron's playwriting output.<ref name=Timesobit/> The popular three-act comedy ''The Guv'nor'', credited to "E. G. Lankester" and first performed in the 1880s, has been attributed to Byron on stylistic grounds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14003316 |title=Amusements |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=17,909 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 August 1895 |accessdate=6 October 2021 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Byron is described by Jim Davis in the introduction to his 1984 collection, ''Plays by H. J. Byron'', as the most prolific playwright of the mid-Victorian period, as he produced over 150 dramatic pieces.  ''The Times'' called Byron a master of "genial wit and humour".<ref>"Funeral of the Late Mr. H. J. Byron", ''The Times'', '18 April 1884, p. 10, col. C</ref> It also commented that "The secret of his success... lay chiefly in his dialogue, which is seldom otherwise than neat, pointed and amusing.  He fires verbal shots in such rapid succession that one laugh has scarcely died away when another is raised.  In the delineation of character, too, he is often extremely happy".<ref name=Timesobit/>

By 1874, he was showing symptoms of [[tuberculosis]], which caused his retirement in 1882. His first wife died in 1876 at the age of 45, and the same year he remarried Eleanor Mary ''née'' Joy, the daughter of Edward Joy, a lawyer.  His son Henry and daughter Crede (a pun on ''Crede Byron'', the Byron family motto) also became actors, and he had another son.<ref name=dnb/>

During the last few years of his life Byron was in frail health, and he died at his home in [[Clapham]], London, England, in 1884 at the age of 49. He is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.<ref name=Lee/>
