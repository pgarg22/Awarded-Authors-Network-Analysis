'''Audre Lorde''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|d|r|i|_|l|ɔr|d}}; born '''Audrey Geraldine Lorde'''; February 18, 1934 – November 17, 1992) was an American writer, [[feminist]], [[Womanism|womanist]], [[librarian]], and [[civil rights]] activist. She was a self-described "black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet," who "dedicated both her life and her creative talent to confronting and addressing injustices of [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[classism]], and [[homophobia]]."<ref name="foundation"/>

As a poet, she is best known for technical mastery, and emotional expression, as well as her poems that express anger and outrage at civil and social injustices she observed throughout her life. As a [[spoken word]] artist, her delivery has been called powerful, melodic, and intense by the Poetry Foundation.<ref name="foundation">{{cite web|access-date=March 28, 2021|title=Audre Lorde 1934-1992|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde|publisher=Poetry Foundation|archive-date=November 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127194430/https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde|url-status=live}}</ref> Her poems and prose largely deal with issues related to civil rights, feminism, lesbianism, illness and disability, and the exploration of black female identity.<ref name="OutHistory">{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Dionn|title=Audre Lorde.

==Early life==
Lorde was born in New York City to Caribbean immigrants, her father from [[Barbados]] and her mother [[Grenada|Grenadian]] from the island of [[Carriacou]], Frederick Byron Lorde (known as Byron) and Linda Gertrude Belmar Lorde, who settled in [[Harlem]]. Lorde's mother was of mixed ancestry but could "[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]" for '[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Spanish]]',<ref name="Lorde" /> which was a source of pride for her family. Lorde's father was darker than the Belmar family liked, and they only allowed the couple to marry because of Byron Lorde's charm, ambition, and persistence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Veaux|first1=Alexis|title=Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde|date=2004|publisher=W.

At the age of four, she learned to talk while she learned to read, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in eighth grade.

Born as Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the "y" from her first name while still a child, explaining in ''[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]'' that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the "e"-endings in the two side-by-side names "Audre Lorde" than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended.<ref name=Parks>{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Rev.

Lorde's relationship with her parents was difficult from a young age. She spent very little time with her father and mother, who were both busy maintaining their real estate business in the tumultuous economy after [[Great Depression|the Great Depression.]] When she did see them, they were often cold or emotionally distant. In particular, Lorde's relationship with her mother, who was deeply suspicious of people with darker skin than hers (which Lorde had) and the outside world in general, was characterized by "tough love" and strict adherence to family rules.<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Veaux|first1=Alexis|title=Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde|date=2004|publisher=W.

As a child, Lorde struggled with communication, and came to appreciate the power of poetry as a form of expression.<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc">{{cite book|author1=Kimerly W.

Raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], Lorde attended parochial schools before moving on to [[Hunter College High School]], a secondary school for intellectually gifted students. She graduated in 1951. While attending Hunter, Lorde published her first poem in ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine after her school's literary journal rejected it for being inappropriate. Also in high school, Lorde participated in poetry workshops sponsored by the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], but noted that she always felt like somewhat of an outcast from the Guild. She felt she was not accepted because she "was both crazy and [[queer]] but [they thought] I would grow out of it all."<ref name="W. W.

==Career==
[[File:Audre lorde.jpg|thumb|Audre Lorde. Photograph by [[Elsa Dorfman]].]]
In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University of Mexico]], a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal. During this time, she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as both a lesbian and a poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|title=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=October 28, 2017|archive-date=November 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121211926/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> On her return to New York, Lorde attended [[Hunter College]], and graduated in the class of 1959. While there, she worked as a librarian, continued writing, and became an active participant in the [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures#LGBT culture|gay culture]] of [[Greenwich Village]]. She furthered her education at [[Columbia University]], earning a master's degree in [[library science]] in 1961. During this period, she worked as a public librarian in nearby [[Mount Vernon, New York]].<ref name="Kulii">{{cite web|last=Kulii|first=Beverly Threatt|title=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|work=University of Illinois Department of English website|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|access-date=March 8, 2013|author2=Ann E.

In 1968 Lorde was writer-in-residence at [[Tougaloo College]] in Mississippi.<ref name="poets.org">{{cite web|title=Audre Lorde|publisher=Poets.org|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/306|access-date=July 9, 2009|archive-date=March 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309030149/http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/306|url-status=live}}</ref>
Lorde's time at Tougaloo College, like her year at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University of Mexico]], was a formative experience for her as an artist. She led workshops with her young, black undergraduate students, many of whom were eager to discuss the civil rights issues of that time. Through her interactions with her students, she reaffirmed her desire not only to live out her "crazy and queer" identity, but also to devote attention to the formal aspects of her craft as a poet. Her book of poems, ''Cables to Rage,'' came out of her time and experiences at Tougaloo.<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc"/>

From 1972 to 1987, Lorde resided on [[Staten Island]]. During that time, in addition to writing and teaching she co-founded [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Audre Lorde Residence|url=https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/audre-lorde-residence/|publisher=NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-date=November 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106172140/https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/audre-lorde-residence/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1977, Lorde became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}&nbsp; The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|access-date=June 21, 2017|archive-date=March 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327102342/http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|url-status=live}}</ref> WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Lorde taught in the Education Department at [[Lehman College]] from 1969 to 1970,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lorde-audre-1934-1992|title=Lorde, Audre (1934–1992)|last=Morehouse|first=Susan Perry|year=2002|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=October 28, 2017|archive-date=October 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029012549/http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lorde-audre-1934-1992|url-status=live}}</ref> then as a professor of English at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] (part of the [[City University of New York]], CUNY) from 1970 to 1981.

In 1980, together with [[Barbara Smith]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]], she co-founded [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]], the first U.S. publisher for women of color. Lorde was State Poet of New York from 1991 to 1992.<ref name="enotes"/>

In 1981, Lorde was among the founders of the Women's Coalition of St. Croix,<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc" /> an organization dedicated to assisting women who have survived sexual abuse and [[intimate partner violence]]. In the late 1980s, she also helped establish Sisterhood in Support of Sisters (SISA) in South Africa to benefit black women who were affected by [[apartheid]] and other forms of injustice.<ref name="foundation"/>

In 1985, Audre Lorde was a part of a delegation of black women writers who had been invited to [[Cuba]]. The trip was sponsored by ''[[The Black Scholar]]'' and the Union of Cuban Writers. She embraced the shared sisterhood as black women writers. They visited Cuban poets [[Nancy Morejon]] and [[Nicolas Guillen]]. They discussed whether the Cuban revolution had truly changed racism and the status of lesbians and gays there.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Veaux|first=Alexis|s2cid=162038861|year=2000|title=Searching for Audre Lorde|jstor=3299519|journal=Callaloo|volume=23|issue=1|pages=64–67|doi=10.1353/cal.2000.0010}}</ref>

=== The Berlin years ===
In 1984, Lorde started a visiting professorship in [[West Berlin]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. She was invited by FU lecturer [[Dagmar Schultz]] who had met her at the UN "World Women's Conference" in Copenhagen in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/bios.html#.WWtAzojyiM-|title=Audre Lorde – The Berlin Years|website=audrelorde-theberlinyears.com|access-date=July 16, 2017|archive-date=March 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330075932/http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/bios.html#.WWtAzojyiM-|url-status=live}}</ref> During her time in Germany, Lorde became an influential part of the then-nascent Afro-German movement.<ref name=":1">[[Dagmar Schultz]] (2015).

==Poetry==
[[File:Audre Lorde, Meridel Lesueur, Adrienne Rich 1980.jpg|thumb|right| Audre Lorde (left) with writers [[Meridel Le Sueur]] (middle) and [[Adrienne Rich]] (right) at a writing workshop in Austin, Texas, 1980]]

Lorde focused her discussion of difference not only on differences between groups of women but between conflicting differences within the individual. "I am defined as other in every group I'm part of," she declared. Audre Lorde states that "the outsider, both strength and weakness. Yet without community there is certainly no liberation, no future, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice between me and my oppression".<ref name="Lorde1997">{{cite book|author=Audre Lorde|title=The Cancer Journals|url=https://archive.org/details/cancerjournals00lord_0|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-73-2}}</ref>{{rp|12–13}} She described herself both as a part of a "continuum of women"<ref name="Lorde1997"/>{{rp|17}} and a "concert of voices" within herself.<ref name="Lorde1997"/>{{rp|31}}

Her conception of her many layers of selfhood is replicated in the multi-genres of her work. Critic Carmen Birkle wrote: "Her multicultural self is thus reflected in a multicultural text, in multi-genres, in which the individual cultures are no longer separate and autonomous entities but melt into a larger whole without losing their individual importance."<ref>Birkle, p. 180.</ref> Her refusal to be placed in a particular category, whether social or literary, was characteristic of her determination to come across as an individual rather than a stereotype. Lorde considered herself a "lesbian, mother, warrior, poet" and used poetry to get this message across.<ref name="foundation"/>

===Early works===

Lorde's poetry was published very regularly during the 1960s – in [[Langston Hughes]]' 1962 ''New Negro Poets, USA''; in several foreign anthologies; and in black literary magazines. During this time, she was also politically active in [[civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[peace movement|anti-war]], and [[feminist movement]]s.

In 1968, Lorde published ''The First Cities'', her first volume of poems. It was edited by [[Diane di Prima]], a former classmate and friend from Hunter College High School. ''The First Cities'' has been described as a "quiet, introspective book,"<ref name="foundation" /> and [[Dudley Randall]], a poet and critic, asserted in his review of the book that Lorde "does not wave a black flag, but her Blackness is there, implicit, in the bone".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Dudley|author2=various|title=Books Noted|journal=Negro Digest|date=September 1968|volume=17|issue=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjoDAAAAMBAJ|access-date=March 8, 2013|editor1-first=Johnson|editor1-last=John H.|page=13|archive-date=January 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130222411/https://books.google.com/books?id=PjoDAAAAMBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

Her second volume, ''Cables to Rage'' (1970), which was mainly written during her tenure as poet-in-residence at [[Tougaloo College]] in Mississippi, addressed themes of love, betrayal, childbirth, and the complexities of raising children. It is particularly noteworthy for the poem "Martha," in which Lorde openly confirms her homosexuality for the first time in her writing: "[W]e shall love each other here if ever at all."

Nominated for the [[National Book Award]] for poetry in 1973, ''From a Land Where Other People Live'' ([[Broadside Lotus Press|Broadside Press]]) shows Lorde's personal struggles with identity and anger at social injustice. The volume deals with themes of anger, loneliness, and injustice, as well as what it means to be a black woman, mother, friend, and lover.<ref name="Kulii"/>

1974 saw the release of ''New York Head Shop and Museum'', which gives a picture of Lorde's New York through the lenses of both the civil rights movement and her own restricted childhood:<ref name="foundation"/> stricken with poverty and neglect and, in Lorde's opinion, in need of political action.<ref name="Kulii"/>

===Wider recognition===

Despite the success of these volumes, it was the release of ''[[Coal (book)|Coal]]'' in 1976 that established Lorde as an influential voice in the [[Black Arts Movement]], and the large publishing house behind it – Norton – helped introduce her to a wider audience. The volume includes poems from both ''The First Cities'' and ''Cables to Rage'', and it unites many of the themes Lorde would become known for throughout her career: her rage at racial injustice, her celebration of her black identity, and her call for an intersectional consideration of women's experiences. Lorde followed ''Coal'' up with ''Between Our Selves'' (also in 1976) and ''Hanging Fire'' (1978).

In Lorde's volume ''The Black Unicorn'' (1978), she describes her identity within the mythos of African female deities of creation, fertility, and warrior strength. This reclamation of African female identity both builds and challenges existing Black Arts ideas about [[pan-Africanism]]. While writers like [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Ishmael Reed]] utilized African [[cosmology]] in a way that "furnished a repertoire of bold male gods capable of forging and defending an aboriginal Black universe," in Lorde's writing "that warrior ethos is transferred to a female vanguard capable equally of force and fertility."<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimerly W.

Lorde's poetry became more open and personal as she grew older and became more confident in her sexuality. In ''[[Sister Outsider|Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches]]'', Lorde states, "Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought… As they become known to and accepted by us, our feelings and the honest exploration of them become sanctuaries and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring ideas."<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Taylor | first= Sherri | s2cid= 143084316 | title = Acts of remembering: relationship in feminist therapy | journal = Women & Therapy | volume = 36 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 23–34 | doi = 10.1080/02703149.2012.720498 |year = 2013 }}</ref> ''Sister Outsider'' also elaborates Lorde's challenge to European-American traditions.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley| isbn= 978-0895941411|title-link=Sister Outsider|year=1984}}</ref>

''[[The Cancer Journals]]'' (1980) and ''A Burst of Light'' (1988) both use non-fiction prose, including essays and journal entries, to bear witness to, explore, and reflect on Lorde's diagnosis, treatment, recovery from breast cancer, and ultimately fatal recurrence with liver metastases.<ref name="W.

Lorde's deeply personal book ''[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]'' (1982), subtitled a "biomythography", chronicles her childhood and adulthood. The narrative deals with the evolution of Lorde's sexuality and self-awareness.<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc"/>

=== ''Sister Outsider'' ===
In ''[[Sister Outsider|Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches]]'' (1984), Lorde asserts the necessity of communicating the experience of marginalized groups to make their struggles visible in a repressive society.<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc"/> She emphasizes the need for different groups of people (particularly white women and African-American women) to find common ground in their lived experience, but also to face difference directly, and use it as a source of strength rather than alienation. She repeatedly emphasizes the need for community in the struggle to build a better world. How to constructively channel the anger and rage incited by oppression is another prominent theme throughout her works, and in this collection in particular.<ref name="Kulii"/>

Her most famous essay, "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House", is included in ''Sister Outsider''. Lorde questions the scope and ability for change to be instigated when examining problems through a racist, patriarchal lens. She insists that women see differences between other women not as something to be tolerated, but something that is necessary to generate power and to actively "be" in the world. This will create a community that embraces differences, which will ultimately lead to liberation. Lorde elucidates, "Divide and conquer, in our world, must become define and empower."<ref name="Lorde, Audre 2015">Lorde, Audre. "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House." ''This Bridge Called My Back,'' edited by Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua, State University of New York Press, 2015, 94–97.</ref> Also, people must educate themselves about the oppression of others because expecting a marginalized group to educate the oppressors is the continuation of racist, patriarchal thought. She explains that this is a major tool utilized by oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the master's concerns. She concludes that to bring about real change, we cannot work within the racist, patriarchal framework because change brought about in that will not remain.<ref name="Lorde, Audre 2015"/>

Also in ''Sister Outsider'' is a short essay, "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action". Lorde discusses the importance of speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. Many people fear to speak the truth because of the real risks of retaliation, but Lorde warns, "Your silence does not protect you." Lorde emphasizes that "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger."<ref name="Lorde, Audre 2007">Lorde, Audre. "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" ''Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches,'' Ten Speed Press, 2007, 40–44.</ref> People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. Lorde adds, "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid."<ref name="Lorde, Audre 2007"/> "People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth." Lorde writes that we can learn to speak even when we are afraid.

In ''Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference'', Lorde emphasizes the importance of educating others. However, she stresses that in order to educate others, one must first be educated. Empowering people who are doing the work does not mean using privilege to overstep and overpower such groups; but rather, privilege must be used to hold door open for other allies. Lorde describes the inherent problems within society by saying, "racism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to dominance. Sexism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one sex over the other and thereby the right to dominance. Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. Classism." Lorde finds herself among some of these "deviant" groups in society, which set the tone for the status quo and what "not to be" in society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Out There: Marginalization and Contemporary Cultures|last=Ferguson|first=Russell|publisher=The New Museum of Contemporary Art and Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=1990|isbn=0-262-56064-X|location=United States of America|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262560641}}</ref> Lorde argues that women feel pressure to conform to their "oneness" before recognizing the separation among them due to their "manyness", or aspects of their identity. She stresses that this behavior is exactly what "explains feminists' inability to forge the kind of alliances necessary to create a better world."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|first=Rosemarie|last=Tong|isbn=0813332958|edition=Second|location=Boulder, Colorado|oclc=38016566|date = February 27, 1998}}</ref>

In relation to non-[[intersectional feminism]] in the United States, Lorde famously said:<ref name=":0" /><ref>[https://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908185656/https://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf |date=September 8, 2019 }} Audre Lorde</ref>

==Film==
Lorde had several films that highlighted her journey as an activist in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Aman, Y. K. R. (2016). A READING IN THE POETRY OF THE AFRO-GERMAN MAY AYIM FROM DUAL INHERITANCE THEORY PERSPECTIVE: THE IMPACT OF AUDRE LORDE ON MAY AYIM. ''International Journal of Arts & Sciences, 9''(3), 27-52. Retrieved from {{proquest|1858849753}}</ref>

''The Berlin Years: 1984–1992'' documented Lorde's time in Germany as she led [[Afro-Germans]] in a movement that would allow black people to establish identities for themselves outside of stereotypes and discrimination. After a long history of systemic racism in Germany, Lorde introduced a new sense of empowerment for minorities. As seen in the film, she walks through the streets with pride despite stares and words of discouragement. Including moments like these in a documentary was important for people to see during that time. It inspired them to take charge of their identities and discover who they are outside of the labels put on them by society. The film also educates people on the history of racism in Germany. This enables viewers to understand how Germany reached this point in history and how the society developed. Through her promotion of the study of history and her example of taking her experiences in her stride, she influenced people of many different backgrounds.<ref>Florvil, T. (2014).

The film documents Lorde's efforts to empower and encourage women to start the Afro-German movement. What began as a few friends meeting in a friend's home to get to know other black people, turned into what is now known as the Afro-German movement. Lorde inspired black women to refute the designation of "[[Mulatto]]", a label which was imposed on them, and switch to the newly-coined, self-given "[[Afro-German]]", a term that conveyed a sense of pride. Lorde inspired Afro-German women to create a community of like-minded people. Some Afro-German women, such as [[Ika Hügel-Marshall]], had never met another black person and the meetings offered opportunities to express thoughts and feelings.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jason |first1=Deborah |title=The Subject in Black and White: Afro-German Identity Formation in Ika Hügel-Marshall's Autobiography Daheim unterwegs: Ein deutsches Leben |journal=Women in German Yearbook: Feminist Studies in German Literature & Culture |date=2005 |volume=21 |pages=66–84 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/392567/pdf |access-date=27 May 2020 |archive-date=June 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601064503/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/392567/pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Theory==
Her writings are based on the "theory of difference", the idea that the binary opposition between men and women is overly simplistic; although feminists have found it necessary to present the illusion of a solid, unified whole, the category of women itself is full of subdivisions.<ref>Olson, Lester C.; "Liabilities of Language: Audre Lorde Reclaiming Difference."</ref>

Lorde identified issues of race, class, age and ageism, sex and sexuality and, later in her life, chronic illness and disability; the latter becoming more prominent in her later years as she lived with cancer. She wrote of all of these factors as fundamental to her experience of being a woman. She argued that, although differences in gender have received all the focus, it is essential that these other differences are also recognized and addressed. "Lorde," writes the critic Carmen Birkle, "puts her emphasis on the authenticity of experience. She wants her difference acknowledged but not judged; she does not want to be subsumed into the one general category of 'woman.'"<ref>Birkle, p. 202.</ref> This theory is today known as [[intersectionality]].

While acknowledging that the differences between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde's works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily – race and sexuality. In Ada Gay Griffin and [[Michelle Parkerson]]'s documentary ''A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde'', Lorde says, "Let me tell you first about what it was like being a Black woman poet in the '60s, from jump. It meant being invisible. It meant being really invisible. It meant being doubly invisible as a Black feminist woman and it meant being triply invisible as a Black lesbian and feminist".<ref name="Bomb">Griffin, Ada Gay; Michelle Parkerson.

Retrieved 28 March 2021.}}</ref>

In her essay "The Erotic as Power", written in 1978 and collected in ''Sister Outsider'', Lorde theorizes [[the Erotic]] as a site of power for women only when they learn to release it from its suppression and embrace it. She proposes that the Erotic needs to be explored and experienced wholeheartedly, because it exists not only in reference to sexuality and the sexual, but also as a feeling of enjoyment, love, and thrill that is felt towards any task or experience that satisfies women in their lives, be it reading a book or loving one's job.<ref name="New York 2007">Audre Lorde, "The Erotic as Power" [1978], republished in Audre Lorde, Sister Outsider (New York: Ten Speed Press, 2007), 53–58</ref> She dismisses "the false belief that only by the suppression of the erotic within our lives and consciousness can women be truly strong. But that strength is illusory, for it is fashioned within the context of male models of power."<ref>Lorde, Audre. "Uses of the Erotic: Erotic as Power." ''Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches,'' The Crossing Press, 2007, pp. 53–59.</ref> She explains how patriarchal society has misnamed it and used it against women, causing women to fear it. Women also fear it because the erotic is powerful and a deep feeling. Women must share each other's power rather than use it without consent, which is abuse. They should do it as a method to connect everyone in their differences and similarities. Utilizing the erotic as power allows women to use their knowledge and power to face the issues of racism, patriarchy, and our anti-erotic society.<ref name="New York 2007"/>

===Feminist thought===
Lorde set out to confront issues of racism in feminist thought. She maintained that a great deal of the scholarship of white feminists served to augment the oppression of black women, a conviction that led to angry confrontation, most notably in a blunt open letter addressed to the fellow radical lesbian feminist [[Mary Daly]], to which Lorde claimed she received no reply.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sister Outsider|last=Lorde|first=Audre|year=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3Ct8Qw3de8C|isbn=1-58091-186-2|access-date=September 23, 2016|archive-date=March 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318145530/https://books.google.com/books?id=r3Ct8Qw3de8C|url-status=live}}</ref> Daly's reply letter to Lorde,<ref>''Amazon Grace'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 1st ed. 2006), pp. 25–26 (reply text).</ref> dated four months later, was found in 2003 in Lorde's files after she died.<ref>''Amazon Grace'', supra, pp. 22–26, esp. pp. 24–26 & nn. 15–16, citing ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', by Alexis De Veaux (N.Y.: W. W. Norton, 1st ed. 2004) ({{ISBN|0-393-01954-3}} or {{ISBN|0-393-32935-6}}).</ref>

This fervent disagreement with notable white feminists furthered Lorde's persona as an outsider: "In the institutional milieu of [[black feminist]] and black lesbian feminist scholars ... and within the context of conferences sponsored by white feminist academics, Lorde stood out as an angry, accusatory, isolated black feminist lesbian voice".<ref>De Veaux, p. 247.</ref>

The criticism was not one-sided: many white feminists were angered by Lorde's brand of feminism. In her 1984 essay "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House",<ref>''Sister Outsider'', pp. 110–14.</ref> Lorde attacked what she believed was underlying racism within feminism, describing it as unrecognized dependence on the [[patriarchy]]. She argued that, by denying difference in the category of women, white feminists merely furthered old systems of oppression and that, in so doing, they were preventing any real, lasting change. Her argument aligned white feminists who did not recognize race as a feminist issue with white male slave-masters, describing both as "agents of oppression".<ref>De Veaux, p. 249.</ref>

===Lorde's comments on feminism===
Lorde held that the key tenets of feminism were that all forms of oppression were interrelated; creating change required taking a public stand; differences should not be used to divide; revolution is a process; feelings are a form of self-knowledge that can inform and enrich activism; and acknowledging and experiencing pain helps women to transcend it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.writingonglass.com/audre-lorde/|title=The Essential Audre Lorde|website=Writing on Glass|access-date=October 28, 2017|archive-date=October 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029013049/https://www.writingonglass.com/audre-lorde/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Lorde's "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference," she writes: "Certainly there are very real differences between us of race, age, and sex. But it is not those differences between us that are separating us. It is rather our refusal to recognize those differences, and to examine the distortions which result from our misnaming them and their effects upon human behavior and expectation." More specifically she states: "As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define woman in terms of their own experience alone, then women of color become 'other'."<ref name="Crossing Press" /> Self-identified as "a forty-nine-year-old Black lesbian feminist socialist mother of two,"<ref name="Crossing Press" /> Lorde is considered as "other, deviant, inferior, or just plain wrong"<ref name="Crossing Press" /> in the eyes of the normative "white male heterosexual capitalist" social hierarchy. "We speak not of human difference, but of human deviance,"<ref name="Crossing Press" /> she writes. In this respect, her ideology coincides with [[womanism]], which "allows Black women to affirm and celebrate their color and culture in a way that feminism does not."

In "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference", Western European History conditions people to see human differences. Human differences are seen in "simplistic opposition" and there is no difference recognized by the culture at large. There are three specific ways Western European culture responds to human difference. First, we begin by ignoring our differences. Next, is copying each other's differences. And finally, we destroy each other's differences that are perceived as "lesser".

Lorde defines racism, sexism, ageism, heterosexism, elitism and classism altogether and explains that an "ism" is an idea that what is being privileged is superior and has the right to govern anything else. Belief in the superiority of one aspect of the mythical norm. Lorde explains that a mythical norm is what all bodies '''should''' be. The mythical norm of US culture is white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, financially secure.

===Influences on black feminism===
Lorde's work on [[black feminism]] continues to be examined by scholars today. [[Jennifer C. Nash]] examines how black feminists acknowledge their identities and find love for themselves through those differences.<ref name="Nash, Jennifer C 2011">Nash, Jennifer C. "Practicing Love: Black Feminism, Love-Politics, And Post-Intersectionality." ''Meridians: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism 2'' (2011): 1. ''Literature Resource Center''. Web. December 4, 2016.</ref> Nash cites Lorde, who writes: "I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices."<ref name="Nash, Jennifer C 2011"/> Nash explains that Lorde is urging black feminists to embrace politics rather than fear it, which will lead to an improvement in society for them. Lorde adds, "Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men. Too frequently, however, some Black men attempt to rule by fear those Black women who are more ally than enemy."<ref>{{cite web|access-date=March 18, 2018|title=Audre Lorde on Being a Black Lesbian Feminist|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/feminist.htm|website=english.illinois.edu|publisher=Modern American Poetry|archive-date=August 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802091129/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/feminist.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lorde's 1979 essay "Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface" is a sort of rallying cry to confront sexism in the black community in order to eradicate the violence within it.<ref name="Wire">{{Cite news|
last1= Nixon|first1=Angelique V.|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/02/the-magic-and-fury-of-audre-lorde-feminist-praxis-and-pedagogy/|title=The Magic and Fury of Audre Lorde: Feminist Praxis and Pedagogy|date=February 24, 2014|work=The Feminist Wire|access-date=March 28, 2021|archive-date=October 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029064926/http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/02/the-magic-and-fury-of-audre-lorde-feminist-praxis-and-pedagogy/|url-status=live}}</ref> Lorde insists that the fight between black women and men must end to end racist politics.

In 1981, Lorde and a fellow writer friend, Barbara Smith founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press which was dedicated to helping other black feminist writers by provided resources, guidance and encouragement. Lorde encouraged those around her to celebrate their differences such as race, sexuality or class instead of dwelling upon them, and wanted everyone to have similar opportunities.

=== Personal identity ===
Throughout Lorde's career she included the idea of a collective identity in many of her poems and books. She did not just identify with one category but she wanted to celebrate all parts of herself equally.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kemp |first=Yakini B. |s2cid=140922405 |year=2004 |title=Writing Power: Identity Complexities and the Exotic Erotic in Audre Lorde's writing |journal=Studies in the Literary Imagination |volume=37 |pages=22–36 }}</ref>

She was known to describe herself as black, lesbian, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel ''[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]'', Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She shows us that personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of one's life, based in lived experience, and that one's authority to speak comes from this lived experience. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor = 23266042|title = The Classic Coming Out Novel: Unacknowledged Challenges to the Heterosexual Mainstream|last1 = Xhonneux|first1 = Lies|journal = College Literature|year = 2012|volume = 39|issue = 1|pages = 94–118|doi = 10.1353/lit.2012.0005}}</ref>

In ''[[The Cancer Journals]]'' she wrote "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive." This is important because an identity is more than just what people see or think of a person, it is something that must be defined by the individual. "The House of Difference" is a phrase that has stuck with Lorde's identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is the collective differences that make us who we are, instead of one little thing. Focusing on all of the aspects of identity brings people together more than choosing one piece of an identity.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/486572 |doi=10.1353/cal.2012.0100 |issn=1080-6512 |title="Which Me Will Survive": Rethinking Identity, Reclaiming Audre Lorde |year=2012 |last1=Leonard |first1=Keith D. |s2cid=161352909 |journal=Callaloo |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=758–777 |access-date=December 4, 2016 |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220052903/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/486572 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lorde's works "Coal" and "The Black Unicorn" are two examples of poetry that encapsulates her black, feminist identity. Each poem, including those included in the book of published poems focus on the idea of identity, and how identity itself is not straightforward. Many Literary critics assumed that "Coal" was Lorde's way of shaping race in terms of coal and diamonds. Lorde herself stated that those interpretations were incorrect because identity was not so simply defined and her poems were not to be oversimplified.

While highlighting Lorde's intersectional points through a lens that focuses on race, gender, socioeconomic status/class and so on, we must also embrace one of her salient identities; Lorde was not afraid to assert her differences, such as skin color and sexual orientation, but used her own identity against toxic black male masculinity. Lorde used those identities within her work and used her own life to teach others the importance of being different. She was not ashamed to claim her identity and used it to her own creative advantages.

While highlighting Lorde's intersectional points through a lens that focuses on race, gender, socioeconomic status/class and so on, we must also embrace one of her salient identities; lesbianism. She was a lesbian and navigated spaces interlocking her womanhood, gayness and blackness in ways that trumped white feminism, predominantly white gay spaces and toxic black male masculinity. Lorde used those identities within her work and ultimately it guided her to create pieces that embodied lesbianism in a light that educated people of many social classes and identities on the issues black lesbian women face in society.

=== Contributions to the third-wave feminist discourse ===
Around the 1960s, [[second-wave feminism]] became centered around discussions and debates about capitalism as a "biased, discriminatory, and unfair"<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Development and Social Change: A Global Perspective|last=McMichael|first=Phillip|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2008|location=Thousand Oaks, California}}</ref> institution, especially within the context of the rise of [[globalization]].

[[Third-wave feminism]] emerged in the 1990s after calls for "a more differentiated feminism" by first-world women of color and women in developing nations, such as Audre Lorde, who maintained her critiques of first world feminism for tending to veer toward "third-world homogenization." This term was coined by radical dependency theorist, [[Andre Gunder Frank]], to describe the inconsideration of the unique histories of developing countries (in the process of forming development agendas).<ref name=":4" /> Audre Lorde was critical of the first world feminist movement "for downplaying sexual, racial, and class differences" and the unique power structures and cultural factors which vary by region, nation, community, etc.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=Theories of Development: Contentions, Arguments, Alternatives|last1=Hartwick|first1=Elaine|last2=Peet|first2=Richard|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1999|edition=2nd|location=New York City|pages=161–172}}</ref>

Other feminist scholars of this period, like [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty]], echoed Lorde's sentiments. Collectively they called for a "feminist politics of location, which theorized that women were subject to particular assemblies of oppression, and therefore that all women emerged with particular rather than generic identities".<ref name=":5" /> While they encouraged a global community of women, Audre Lorde, in particular, felt the [[cultural homogenization]] of third-world women could only lead to a disguised form of oppression with its own forms of "othering" ([[Other (philosophy)]]) women in developing nations into figures of deviance and non-actors in theories of their own development.

====Essay====
Audre Lorde cautioned against the "institutionalized rejection of difference" in her essay, "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference", fearing that when "we do not develop tools for using human difference as a springboard for creative change within our lives[,] we speak not of human difference, but of human deviance".<ref name=":0" /> Lorde saw this already happening with the lack of inclusion of literature from women of color in the second-wave feminist discourse. She found that "the literature of women of Color [was] seldom included in women's literature courses and almost never in other literature courses, nor in women's studies as a whole"<ref name=":0" /> and pointed to the "othering" of women of color and women in developing nations as the reason. By homogenizing these communities and ignoring their difference, "women of Color become 'other,' the outside whose experiences and tradition is too 'alien' to comprehend",<ref name=":0" /> and thus, seemingly unworthy of scholarly attention and differentiated scholarship.

Audre Lorde called for the embracing of these differences. In the same essay, she proclaimed, "now we must recognize difference among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each others' difference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles"<ref name=":0" />&nbsp; Doing so would lead to more inclusive and thus, more effective global feminist goals. Lorde theorized that true development in Third World communities would and even "the future of our earth may depend upon the ability of all women to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across differences."<ref name=":0" />&nbsp; In other words, the individual voices and concerns of women and color and women in developing nations would be the first step in attaining the autonomy with the potential to develop and transform their communities effectively in the age (and future) of [[globalization]].

====Speeches====

In a keynote speech at the National Third-World Gay and Lesbian Conference on October 13, 1979 titled, "When will the ignorance end?" Lorde reminded and cautioned the attendees, "There is a wonderful diversity of groups within this conference, and a wonderful diversity between us within those groups. That diversity can be a generative force, a source of energy fueling our visions of action for the future. We must not let diversity be used to tear us apart from each other, nor from our communities that is the mistake they made about us. I do not want us to make it ourselves….and we must never forget those lessons: that we cannot separate our oppressions, nor yet are they the same" <ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=I Am Your Sister: Collected and Unpublished Writings of Audre Lorde|last=Lorde|first=Audre|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|editor-last=Byrd|editor-first=Rudolph|location=Oxford|pages=209–212|editor-last2=Cole|editor-first2=Johnetta|editor-last3=Guy-Sheftall|editor-first3=Beverly}}</ref>&nbsp; In other words, while common experiences in racism, sexism, and homophobia had brought the group together and that commonality could not be ignored, there must still be a recognition of their individualized humanity.

Years later, on August 27, 1983, Audre Lorde delivered an address apart of the "Litany of Commitment" at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]. "Today we march," she said, "lesbians and gay men and our children, standing in our own names together with all our struggling sisters and brothers here and around the world, in the Middle East, in Central America, in the Caribbean and South Africa, sharing our commitment to work for a joint livable future. We know we do not have to become copies of each other to be able to work together. We know that when we join hands across the table of our difference, our diversity gives us great power. When we can arm ourselves with the strength and vision from all of our diverse communities, then we will in truth all be free at last."<ref name=":6" />

====Interview====

Afro-German feminist scholar and author Dr. Marion Kraft interviewed Audre Lorde in 1986 to discuss a number of her literary works and poems. In this interview, Audre Lorde articulated hope for the next wave of feminist scholarship and discourse. When asked by Kraft, "Do you see any development of the awareness about the importance of differences within the white feminist movement?" Lorde replied with both critiques and hope:<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Audre Lorde's Transnational Legacies|last1=Broeck|first1=Sabine|last2=Bolaski|first2=Stella|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2015|location=Boston|pages=45–50}}</ref><blockquote>"Well, the feminist movement, the white feminist movement, has been notoriously slow to recognize that racism is a feminist concern, not one that is altruistic, but one that is part and parcel of feminist consciousness... I think, in fact, though, that things are slowly changing and that there are white women now who recognize that in the interest of genuine coalition, they must see that we are not the same. [[Black feminism]] is not white feminism in [[Blackface]]. It is an intricate movement coming out of the lives, aspirations, and realities of Black women. We share some things with white women, and there are other things we do not share. We must be able to come together around those things we share.</blockquote>Miriam Kraft summarized Lorde's position when reflecting on the interview; "Yes, we have different historical, social, and cultural backgrounds, different sexual orientations; different aspirations and visions; different skin colors and ages. But we share common experiences and a common goal. Our experiences are rooted in the oppressive forces of racism in various societies, and our goal is our mutual concern to work toward 'a future which has not yet been' in Audre's words."<ref name=":7" />

==Lorde and womanism==
Lorde's criticism of feminists of the 1960s identified issues of race, class, age, gender and sexuality. Similarly, author and poet [[Alice Walker]] coined the term "[[womanist]]" in an attempt to distinguish black female and minority female experience from "[[feminism]]". While "feminism" is defined as "a collection of movements and ideologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women" by imposing simplistic opposition between "men" and "women",<ref name="Crossing Press">{{cite book|last1=Lorde|first1=Audre|title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches|url=https://archive.org/details/sisteroutsideres00lord|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sisteroutsideres00lord/page/114 114–23]}}</ref> the theorists and activists of the 1960s and 1970s usually neglected the experiential difference caused by factors such as race and gender among different social groups.

===Womanism and its ambiguity===
Womanism's existence naturally opens various definitions and interpretations. Alice Walker's comments on womanism, that "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender," suggests that the scope of study of womanism includes and exceeds that of feminism. In its narrowest definition, womanism is the black feminist movement that was formed in response to the growth of racial stereotypes in the feminist movement.

In a broad sense, however, womanism is "a social change perspective based upon the everyday problems and experiences of Black women and other women of minority demographics," but also one that "more broadly seeks methods to eradicate inequalities not just for Black women, but for all people" by imposing [[socialist]] ideology and equality. However, because womanism is open to interpretation, one of the most common criticisms of womanism is its lack of a unified set of tenets. It is also criticized for its lack of discussion of sexuality.

Lorde actively strove for the change of culture within the feminist community by implementing womanist ideology. In the journal "Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing the [[National Women's Studies Association]]", it is stated that her speech contributed to communication with scholars' understanding of human biases. While "anger, marginalized communities, and US Culture" are the major themes of the speech, Lorde implemented various communication techniques to shift subjectivities of the "white feminist" audience.<ref name="Academic Search Complete">{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Lester|s2cid=144222551|title=Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing The National Women's Studies Association|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=2011|volume=97|issue=3|pages=283–308|doi=10.1080/00335630.2011.585169|url=https://zenodo.org/record/889836|access-date=June 24, 2019|archive-date=June 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624222244/https://zenodo.org/record/889836|url-status=live}}</ref>

She further explained that "we are working in a context of oppression and threat, the cause of which is certainly not the angers which lie between us, but rather that virulent hatred leveled against all women, people of color, lesbians and gay men, poor people – against all of us who are seeking to examine the particulars of our lives as we resist our oppressions, moving towards coalition and effective action."<ref name="Academic Search Complete"/>

===Critique of womanism===
A major critique of womanism is its failure to explicitly address homosexuality within the female community. Very little womanist literature relates to lesbian or bisexual issues, and many scholars consider the reluctance to accept homosexuality accountable to the gender simplistic model of womanism. According to Lorde's essay "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference", "the need for unity is often misnamed as a need for homogeneity." She writes: "A fear of lesbians, or of being accused of being a lesbian, has led many Black women into testifying against themselves."

Contrary to this, Lorde was very open to her own sexuality and sexual awakening. In ''Zami: A New Spelling of My Name'', her "biomythography" (a term coined by Lorde that combines "biography" and "mythology") she writes, "Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way I smelled that day, I would have a fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and her apron untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying on the couch, and then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other's most secret places."<ref name="Academic Search Complete-2">{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=Anh|title=Audre Lorde's Zami, Erotic Embodied Memory, and the Affirmation of Difference|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|year=2015|volume=36|issue=1|pages=113–35|doi=10.5250/fronjwomestud.36.1.0113|s2cid=141543319}}</ref> According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection – menstruation, female sexuality, and female incest with the mother – into powerful scenes of female relationship and connection, thus subverting patriarchal heterosexist culture.<ref name="Academic Search Complete-2" />

With such a strong ideology and open-mindedness, Lorde's impact on lesbian society is also significant. An attendee of a 1978 reading of Lorde's essay [[The Erotic|"Uses for the Erotic: the Erotic as Power"]] says: "She asked if all the lesbians in the room would please stand. Almost the entire audience rose."<ref name=JSTOR>{{cite journal|last1=Aptheker|first1=Bettina|title=Audre Lorde, Presente|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2012|volume=autumn/winter|pages=289–94}}</ref> Lorde donated some of her manuscripts and personal papers to the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]].<ref name="Klinger">{{cite book|last=Klinger|first=Alisa|title=Same-Sex Cultures and Sexualities: An Anthropological Reader|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-0-470-77676-6|pages=75–79|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsTzWk5r6U4C&pg=PA73|chapter=Resources for Lesbian Ethnographic Research in the Lavender Archives|access-date=July 31, 2020|archive-date=January 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130222340/https://books.google.com/books?id=EsTzWk5r6U4C&pg=PA73|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1962, Lorde married attorney Edwin Rollins, who was a white, gay man.<ref name="foundation"/> She and Rollins divorced in 1970 after having two children, Elizabeth and Jonathan. In 1966, Lorde became head librarian at Town School Library in New York City, where she remained until 1968.<ref name="Kulii"/>

During her time in Mississippi in 1968, she met Frances Clayton, a white lesbian and professor of psychology who became her romantic partner until 1989. Their relationship continued for the remainder of Lorde's life.<ref name="de_Veaux" />

From 1977 to 1978, Lorde had a brief affair with the sculptor and painter [[Mildred Thompson]]. The two met in Nigeria in 1977 at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture ([[FESTAC 77]]). Their affair ran its course during the time that Thompson lived in Washington, D.C.<ref name="de_Veaux">{{Cite book|title=A Biography of Audre Lorde|last=De Veaux|first=Alexis|publisher=W.W.
