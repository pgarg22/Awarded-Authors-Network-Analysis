'''Gwendolyn B. Bennett''' (July 8, 1902 – May 30, 1981) was an American artist, writer, and journalist who contributed to ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life]]'', which chronicled cultural advancements during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Though often overlooked, she herself made considerable accomplishments in art, poetry, and prose. She is perhaps best known for her short story "Wedding Day", which was published in the magazine ''[[Fire!!]]'' and explores how gender, race, and class dynamics shape an interracial relationship.<ref name="english.illinois.edu">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bennett/life.htm|title=Gwendolyn Bennett's Life and Career|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Bennett was a dedicated and self-preserving woman, respectfully known for being a strong influencer of African-American women rights during the Harlem Renaissance. Throughout her dedication and perseverance, Bennett raised the bar when it came to women's literature and education. One of her contributions to the Harlem Renaissance was her literary acclaimed short novel ''Poets Evening''; it helped the understanding within the African-American communities, resulting in many African Americans coming to terms with identifying and accepting themselves.

==Early life and education==
Gwendolyn Bennett Bennett was born July 8, 1902, in [[Giddings, Texas]], to Joshua Robbin Bennett<ref>Sandra Y. Govan, [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bennett/life.htm "Gwendolyn Bennett's Life and Career"], Modern American Poetry.</ref> and Mayme F. (Abernethy) Bennett. She spent her early childhood in [[Wadsworth, Nevada]], on the [[Paiute Indian Reservation]]. Her parents taught in the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] Service for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].

In 1906, when Bennett was four years old, her family moved to 1454 T Street NW, [[Washington D.C.]],<ref>[http://dcwriters.poetrymutual.org/Pages/bennett.html "Gwendolyn Bennett" profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028181630/http://dcwriters.poetrymutual.org/pages/bennett.html |date=October 28, 2018 }}</ref> so Joshua could study law at [[Howard University]] and Mayme could train to be a [[beautician]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-19|title=J. Robbin Bennett|url=https://digitalharrisburg.com/commonwealth/100names/bennett-joshua/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Digital Harrisburg|language=en}}</ref>

Gwendolyn's parents divorced when she was seven years old. Mayme gained custody of Gwendolyn; however, Joshua kidnapped his daughter. They lived in hiding, along with her stepmother, Marechal Neil, in various places in the East, including [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], and [[Brooklyn]], New York, where she attended Brooklyn's Girls' High from 1918 to 1921.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1602837|title=Gwendolyn Bennett|last=Miller|first=Theresa Leininger|date=2018|website=American National Biography|doi=10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1602837|isbn=978-0-19-860669-7|access-date=May 10, 2018}}</ref>

While attending Girls' High, Bennett was awarded first place in a school wide art contest, and was the first African American to join the literary and dramatic societies. She wrote her high-school play and was also featured as an actress. She also wrote both the class graduation speech and the words to the graduation song.<ref>GOVAN, S. Y. (1980). ''Gwendolyn Bennett: Portrait Of An Artist Lost'' (Order No. 8101931). Page 62. Available from {{ProQuest|303092580}}</ref>

After her graduation in 1921, Bennett took art classes at [[Columbia University]] and the [[Pratt Institute]].<ref name="Britannica"/> In her undergraduate studies, her poem "Heritage" was published in ''[[The Crisis]]'', magazine of the [[NAACP]], during November 1923; in December of the same year, "Heritage" was included in ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life|Opportunity]]'', a magazine published by the [[National Urban League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/bennett-gwendolyn-1902-1981|title=Bennett, Gwendolyn (1902-1981) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|date=March 28, 2009|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref> In 1924, her poem "To Usward" was chosen as a dedication for the introduction of [[Jessie Fauset]]'s novel ''There Is Confusion'' at a Civic Club dinner hosted by Charles S.

Bennett graduated from Columbia and Pratt in 1924 and received a position at [[Howard University]], where she taught design, watercolor painting and crafts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=African American Authors, 1745–1945: Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook|last=Nelson|first=Emmanuel Sampath|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2000|isbn=0313309108|location=Westport Connecticut|pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericana00nels_0/page/19 19]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericana00nels_0/page/19}}</ref> A scholarship enabling her to study in [[Paris]], [[France]], at the [[Sorbonne]], was awarded to Bennett during December 1924.

==Harlem==
Bennett was a prominent figure and best known for the poetry and writing she produced that had a direct influential impact on the motives and essence of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Some ideologies that her works brought into perspective include the emphasis of [[Racialism (racial categorization)|Racial pride]] and the reminiscence of African values, such as [[African Music|music]] and [[African dance|dance]]. One of her most influential poems, ''Fantasy'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/fantasy|title=Fantasy|last=aapone|date=2007-06-12|website=Fantasy|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> not only emphasized the racial pride of African-Americans, but also for women in general by shining light on possibilities that may not have been necessarily attainable for women during this time period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/double-bind-three-women-harlem-renaissance|title=Double-Bind: Three Women of the Harlem Renaissance|last=aapone|date=2014-02-04|website=Double-Bind: Three Women of the Harlem Renaissance|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=I can't tell if this site allows user submissions or if this is something official (ie, edited) by the site|date=May 2018}}

When Bennett left Paris in 1926, she headed back to New York to become the assistant to the editor for ''Opportunity''.<ref>"Gwendolyn B. Bennett", [[Margaret Busby]], ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', Cape, 1992, p. 215.</ref> During her time at ''Opportunity'', she received the [[Barnes Foundation]] fellowship for her work in graphic design and the fine arts. Her artwork was also used for ''Crisis'' and ''Opportunity'' covers with themes that included diverse races, ages, classes, and/or genders allowing Bennett to display of the beauty in diversity.<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/> Later, during the same year, she returned to Howard University once again to teach fine arts. While assistant to the editor at ''Opportunity'' she published articles discussing topics involving literature and the fine arts, and her column titled "The Ebony Flute" (1926–28)<ref name="Britannica">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gwendolyn-Bennett "Gwendolyn Bennett"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref> distributed news about the many creative thinkers involved with the Harlem Renaissance.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bennett {{!}} Pennsylvania Center for the Book|url=https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/bennett__gwendolyn|access-date=2021-11-05|website=pabook.libraries.psu.edu}}</ref>

In 1926, she was also a co-founder and editor of the short-lived literary journal ''[[Fire!!]]''<ref name="Fire">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fire-American-magazine "Fire!!!"], ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. Retrieved October 18, 2018.</ref> Conceived by [[Langston Hughes]] and Richard Nugent, Bennett served as an editor for the single edition of ''[[Fire!!]]'', along with [[Zora Neale Hurston]], John Davis, and [[Aaron Douglas (artist)|Aaron Douglas]].<ref name="Fire"/> The failed publication is now reportedly regarded in some circles as a key cultural moment of the Harlem Renaissance.<ref name="Fire"/>

Finding inspiration through [[William Rose Benét|William Rose Bennet]]'s poem "Harlem", she founded and named her self-proclaimed literary column "The Ebony Flute", another way in which Bennett was able to impact the Harlem Renaissance. "The Ebony Flute" was another contribution that Bennett gave to the Harlem Renaissance, as she emphasized [[Harlem Renaissance|Harlem]] culture and social life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://029c28c.netsolhost.com/blkren/bios/bennettg.html|title=Gwendolyn Bennett - The Black Renaissance in Washington, DC|website=029c28c.netsolhost.com|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> To keep updated with news, Bennett counted on her network contacts to foster the thriving and diverse environment that the Harlem Renaissance had to offer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bennett/life.htm|title=Gwendolyn Bennett's Life and Career|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> Bennett found ways to influence and contribute to her community without even publishing her own assemblage of poetic and literary works.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Along with her emphasis on [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]] and her literary column, "The Ebony Flute", Bennett also shared a romantic vision of being African through [[Romantic poetry|romantic]] [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]. One way she expressed and shared this vision was through "To a Dark Girl", one of her more famous works of poetry. Creating an empowering aspect to African-American women features, Bennett's imagery and comparisons to queens are used to influence African-American women in embracing their blackness.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gwendolynbbennett.wordpress.com/analysis-of-gwendolyn-bennett/|title=Analysis of Gwendolyn B. Bennett's poetry|date=2016-02-11|work=The Harlem Renaissance|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> Bennett admired African-American artists and they made her feel proud to be part of that community, despite experiencing judgement from whites in the past.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Diaries of Gwendolyn Bennett|journal = Women's Studies Quarterly|volume = 17|issue = 3/4|pages = 66–73|last=Hoffmann|first=Leonore|jstor = 40003093|year = 1989}}</ref>

Although homosexuality was heavily criticized at the time, it had become common for both homosexual and straight female poets to write of lesbianism, and this included Bennett. Female, African-American poets had never before written about this topic, and even though it was considered taboo then, she and many other poets inspired other women to follow in their footsteps several years later.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imdjmLx3tWAC&q=gwendolyn+bennett+poet&pg=PR19|title=Shadowed Dreams: Women's Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance|last=Honey|first=Maureen|access-date=2019-05-17|isbn=9780813538860|year=2006}}</ref>

Harlem Circles, created by Bennett, were intended to be a place for writers to gather, share ideas, and spark inspiration. Over a period of eight years, some of the most famous Harlem Renaissance figures, such as [[Wallace Thurman]] and [[Langston Hughes]] met up in these groups and produced significant works as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myblackhistory.net/Gwendolyn_Bennett.htm|title=Gwendolyn Bennett: Harlem Renaissance|website=www.myblackhistory.net|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>

==Criticism==

Her work during this period of her life was praised by her fellow writers in Harlem. The playwright [[Theodore Ward]] declared that Bennett's work was one of the "most promising of the poets out of the Harlem Renaissance" and also called Bennett a "dynamic figure... noted for her depth and understanding." [[J. Mason Brewer]], an African-American [[folklorist]] and storyteller, called Bennett a "nationally known artist and poetess." Since Brewer was also a native Texan, he further stated that as a result of Bennett's [[Texas]] birthplace, "Texans feel that they have a claim on her and that the beautiful and poignant lyrics she writes resulted partially from the impression of her early Texas surroundings." Activist and author [[James Weldon Johnson]] described Bennett's work as "delicate" and "poignant".<ref name=":2" /> This was an opportune time for female poets as many of them were not only taken seriously by peers and those in their community, but were also successful. Receiving such positive criticism from other members of the Harlem Renaissance helped Bennett gain recognition.

==Later life and Harlem influence==
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2020}}
After marrying Dr. Albert Joseph Jackson in 1927, Bennett resigned from [[Howard University]] as the school's administration disapproved of their relationship. That same year, the couple moved to  [[Eustis, Florida]]. Her time in Florida had a negative impact on her work as it was too far from Harlem to promptly receive news for her to write about in her column for ''Opportunity''.

Due to the racism they encountered and their town's financial problems, they remained in Florida for only three years and moved to [[Long Island]] in 1930. Bennett began to write more frequently after working with the Federal Writers Project and Federal Art Project. After losing their home in Long Island, Jackson died in 1936, and Bennett moved back to New York.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bennett/life.htm|title=Gwendolyn Bennett's Life and Career|last=Govan|first=Sandra}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/bios/Bennett__Gwendolyn|title=Gwendolyn Bennett|last=Haas|first=Theresa|date=2005}}</ref>

In 1940, she married educator and writer Richard Crosscup, who was of European ancestry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/gwendolyn-bennett-40863|title=Gwendolyn Bennett|website=Biography|access-date=May 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511012626/https://www.biography.com/people/gwendolyn-bennett-40863|archive-date=May 11, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their [[interracial marriage]] was not socially acceptable at Bennett's time. Harlem remained Bennett's passion, however, and during the late 1930s and the 1940s she remained in the arts. She served as a member of the [[Harlem Artists Guild]] in 1935, and the [[Harlem Community Art Center]] was under her leadership from 1939 to 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bennett/life.htm|title=Gwendolyn Bennett's Life and Career|last=Y.

During this time, she was active on the board of the Negro Playwright's Guild and involved with the development of the George Washington Carver Community School.<ref>{{Cite web|title=archives.nypl.org -- Gwendolyn Bennett papers|url=https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20863|access-date=2021-11-05|website=archives.nypl.org}}</ref><ref>GOVAN, S.

However, this experience caused her to remove herself from the public eye and she began working as a secretary for the [[Consumers Union]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Bennett retired in 1968 and moved with her husband, Richard Crosscup, to [[Kutztown|Kutztown, Pennsylvania]], where they opened an [[antiques shop]] called Buttonwood Hollow Antiques.<ref name=":0"/>

==Death==
In 1980, Crosscup died of heart failure, and Bennett herself died from cardiovascular complications on May 30, 1981, aged 78, at [[Reading Hospital]] in [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], Pennsylvania.<ref name="Britannica"/>

==Successes in poetry==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
Throughout her life, Bennett attained success in different fields of work. She was a poet, short-story writer, columnist, journalist, illustrator, graphic artist, arts educator, teacher and administrator on the New York City Works Progress Administration Federal Arts Project (1935–41).{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gwendolyn Bennett Papers|url=https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20863|url-status=live|access-date=November 4, 2021|website=New York Public Library Archives and Manuscripts}}</ref>
