'''Robert Edwin Lee''' (October 15, 1918 – July 8, 1994) was an [[United States|American]] playwright and lyricist. With his writing partner, [[Jerome Lawrence]], Lee worked for Armed Forces Radio during World War II; Lawrence and Lee became the most prolific writing partnership in radio, with such long-running series as ''[[Favorite Story]]'' among others.

==Life and career==
Lee was born in [[Elyria, Ohio]], the son of Elvira (née Taft), a teacher, and C. Melvin Lee, an engineer.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/36/Robert-E-Lee.html</ref> He attended [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].<ref name="amgbio"/>

Lawrence and Lee turned to the live theatre in 1955 with ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', which remains among the most-produced plays in the American theatre. They are also well known for the plays ''[[Auntie Mame]]'' and ''[[First Monday in October]]''. In 1965, Lawrence and Lee founded the American Playwrights' Theatre, a plan to bypass the commerciality of the Broadway stage, which foreshadowed the professional regional theatre movement. Their wildly successful play, ''[[The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail]]'', was produced through the American Playwrights Theatre, and premiered at Lawrence's alma mater, [[Ohio State University]], which also commissioned their play on the life and times of [[James Thurber]], ''[[Jabberwock (play)|Jabberwock]]'' (1972).

In all, they collaborated on 39 works, and, with [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]], a 1956 musical adaptation of Hilton's novel ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', entitled ''[[Shangri-La]]''. They also adapted ''[[Auntie Mame]]'' into the hit musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' with composer [[Jerry Herman]], which won a [[Tony Award]] for its star, [[Angela Lansbury]]. Less successful was the Lawrence and Lee collaboration with Herman, also starring Lansbury, ''[[Dear World]]'', a musical adaptation of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]''.

Several of Lawrence and Lee's plays draw on events from United States history to speak to contemporary issues. ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1955) addressed [[intellectual freedom]] and [[McCarthyism]] by speaking of a fictionalized [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. ''The Gang's All Here'' (1959) examined government corruption in the 1920s. ''[[The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail]]'' (1970) was a [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]-era exploration of [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]]'s resistance to an earlier war.<ref name="encyc_modern_drama">{{citation|last=Eisler|first=Garrett B.|title=Lawrence, Jerome (1915–2004), and Robert E.
