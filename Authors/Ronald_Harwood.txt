'''Sir Ronald Harwood''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE|FRSL}} (born '''Ronald Horwitz'''; 9 November 1934 – 8 September 2020) was a South African-born British author, playwright, and screenwriter, best known for his plays for the British stage as well as the screenplays for ''[[The Dresser (1983 film)|The Dresser]]'' (for which he was nominated for an Oscar) and ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', for which he won the 2003 [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. He was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'' (2007).

== Early life and career ==

Harwood was born Ronald Horwitz in [[Cape Town]], in what was then the [[Union of South Africa]], the son of Isobel (née Pepper) and Isaac Horwitz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/83/Ronald-Harwood.html|title=Ronald Harwood Biography (1934–)|website=www.filmreference.com}}</ref> After attending [[Sea Point High School]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTY2DwAAQBAJ&q=Ronald+Harwood+sea+point+school&pg=PT23|title=Speak Well of Me: The Authorised Biography of Ronald Harwood: The Authorised Biography of Ronald Harwood|first=W. Sydney|last=Robinson|date=1 June 2017|publisher=Oberon Books|isbn=9781786820440|via=Google Books}}</ref> Harwood moved from Cape Town to London in 1951 to pursue a career in the theatre. He changed his surname from Horwitz to Harwood after an English master told him it was too foreign and too Jewish for a stage actor.<ref>Walker, Tim [http://new.spectator.co.uk/2006/06/in-praise-of-the-patriotic-playwright/ "In Praise of the Patriotic Playwright"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119160039/http://new.spectator.co.uk/2006/06/in-praise-of-the-patriotic-playwright/# |date=19 November 2015 }}, ''[[The Spectator]]'', 14 June 2006</ref>

After training for the stage at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], he joined the Shakespeare Company of Sir [[Donald Wolfit]]. From 1953 to 1958, Harwood was Sir Donald's personal dresser.  He would later draw on this experience when he wrote the stage play, ''[[The Dresser]]'', and the biography, ''Sir Donald Wolfit CBE: His life and work in the Unfashionable Theatre''. In 1959, after leaving the Donald Wolfit Company, he joined the 59 Theatre Company for a season at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] during which time he played the role of Pablo both in the stage debut of [[Alun Owen]]'s play ''The Rough and Ready Lot'' and in its 1959 television adaptation.<ref name="Rough and Ready Lot">{{cite book | author-last= Owen | author-first= Alun | others= Cover design by [[Elisabeth Frink]] | title= The Rough and Ready Lot: A play in Three Acts |publisher= Encore Publishing Co.

In 1960, Harwood began a career as a writer and published his first novel, ''All the Same Shadows'' in 1961, the screenplay for ''[[Private Potter]]'' (1962) from his television drama, and the stage play, ''March Hares'' in 1964. Harwood continued at a prolific pace penning more than 21 stage plays, and 10 books. He also created more than 16 screen plays, but seldom wrote original material directly for the screen, usually acting as an adapter, sometimes of his own work (''The Dresser'').

One of the recurring themes in Harwood's work was his fascination with the stage, its performing artists and artisans, as displayed in ''The Dresser'', ''After the Lions'' (about [[Sarah Bernhardt]]), ''Another Time'' (a semi-autobiographical piece about a gifted South African pianist), ''[[Quartet (Harwood)|Quartet]]'' (about ageing opera singers), and his non-fiction book ''All the World's a Stage'', a general history of theatre.

Harwood also had a strong interest in the [[Nazi]] period, especially the situation of individuals who either voluntarily collaborated with the Nazis or, alternatively, who faced strong pressure to do so and had, in each case, to work out their own personal combination of resistance, deception and compromise.  His work focusing on this period includes the films ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (covering the assassination by the [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czechoslovakian Resistance]] of Nazi leader [[Reinhard Heydrich]]), ''[[The Statement (film)|The Statement]]'' (a fictionalized account of the post-War life-on-the-run of French collaborator [[Paul Touvier]]), ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the autobiography of the Jewish-Polish musician [[Władysław Szpilman]] covering his survival during the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]]), the play later adapted to film ''[[Taking Sides (play)|Taking Sides]]'' (focused on the post-War "de-Nazification" investigation of the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]), the play ''[[Collaboration]]'' (about the composer [[Richard Strauss]] and his partnership with the Jewish writer [[Stefan Zweig]]), and the play ''An English Tragedy'' (dealing with the British fascist [[John Amery]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f8279ab8-db64-11dc-9fdd-0000779fd2ac?nclick_check=1|title=Subscribe to read &#124; Financial Times|website=www.ft.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/show-23382966-details/An+English+Tragedy/showReview.do?reviewId=23439507 Evening Standard review, 19 February 2008]</ref>

Harwood also wrote the screenplay for the films ''[[The Browning Version (1994 film)|The Browning Version]]'' (1994) with Albert Finney, ''[[Being Julia]]'' (2004) with [[Annette Bening]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], and [[Roman Polanski]]'s version of ''[[Oliver Twist (2005 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (2005) with [[Ben Kingsley]].

He won an [[Academy Award]] for the script of ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', having already been nominated for ''[[The Dresser (1983 film)|The Dresser]]'' in 1983. Harwood received his third [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] in 2007 for his adaptation of the memoir by [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]], ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', for which he also won a [[BAFTA]] and the [[Prix Jacques Prévert du Scénario]] in 2008, for Best Adaptation. In 2008, Harwood was also awarded the [[Humanitas Award]] in recognition of ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly''.
