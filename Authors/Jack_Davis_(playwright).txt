== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
The first five years of Jack Davis’ life were spent on a farm in Waroona, Western Australia with his ten siblings.<ref name=":2" /> His family then moved to Yarloop in 1923 after a [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]] destroyed their farm. Davis and his family were members of the Bibbulmun and Nyoongah tribe and spoke the Nyoongah language.<ref name=":2" />

=== Family ===
His mother, whose name is not on record and father, William Davis, also known as "Bill", were both taken from their parents as they were considered by the government to be "[[Half-caste|half-castes]]".<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=Chesson, Keith, 1934-|title=Jack Davis : a life-story|date=1988|publisher=Dent|isbn=0-86770-075-0|location=Melbourne|oclc=28633883}}</ref> Under the Australian policy passed in 1890, children who had both a full blood Aboriginal parent and a non-Aboriginal parent were considered [[Half-Caste Act|half-castes]].<ref name=":7" /> His parents went to work for white families and never acquired an education, making them illiterate.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":7" />  His mother was seven years old when she went to work for the Stretch family as a servant in [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], Western Australia.<ref name=":7" />  His mother recalls that while they treated her well, she never felt part of the family.<ref name=":2" /> Her employers never educated his mother with their other children and she would be left to do domestic house work as they went to school.<ref name=":2" /> His father was eight years old when he went off to work, and took the surname of his boss "Davis" because he did not like his father’s last name "Sung" who was a Sikh man.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":2" /> Jack Davis’ father and mother met in Northam, Western Australia and were married soon after.<ref name=":7" /> During their marriage, they had six daughters and five sons.<ref name=":7" />

William Davis worked mostly in the timber industry as a log chopper and found it hard to support eleven children on his income.<ref name=":7" />  However, his love of [[hunting]] and the bush allowed him to still provide meat for the family.<ref name=":7" />

Jack Davis’ father died in 1933 after making his way home from a hunting accident.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":7" /> He was walking through a paddock in the early evening and was attacked by a bull.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":7" /> This left the family with no financial income, leading to the family selling up and moving out of Yarloop, a less remote area.<ref name=":7" />

After Jack Davis and his brother Harold went home to Yarloop after working at [[Moore River Native Settlement]], his brother Harold went to fight in [[World War II]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":7" />

=== Education ===
Jack Davis attended school in Yarloop with his ten brothers and sisters.<ref name=":7" /> As a result of Davis’ father having Australian citizenship status, his children were allowed to get the same education as children with European heritage.<ref name=":7" /> His father’s [[citizenship]] status also meant his children were not forced to go to an Aboriginal settlement.<ref name=":7" />

In early 1932, at age fourteen, Jack Davis and his brother Harold were offered work under false pretences at [[Moore River Native Settlement]] from the [[Protector of Aborigines]], [[A. O. Neville]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Haebich|first1=A.|title=Neville, Auber Octavius (1875–1954)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/neville-auber-octavius-7821/text13575|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2020-05-28|last2=Reece|first2=R.

The two boys were to work on the farm in exchange for labour and farm skills, however, this turned out to be an empty promise that they discovered once they arrived.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":2" /> The settlement [[Racial segregation|segregated]] white Australians and Aboriginals and prohibited the Aboriginals speaking their native languages.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Arbor|first=Ann|date=2006|title=Davis, Jack, 1917-|journal=ProQuest Biographies|via=Proquest central}}</ref> Davis and his brother were amongst four-hundred Aboriginals that were "offered" work at the Moore River Native Settlement considered as a social measure by the government.<ref name=":4" /> While some aboriginals were forced to work, this was not the case for Jack Davis and his brother.<ref name=":7" /> After nine months, the two boys left to go back to Yarloop.<ref name=":7" /> Davis’ experience on the Moore River Native Settlement later shaped his literary work.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

=== Career ===
Davis pursued many labour intensive jobs before he committed to writing, this included being a stockman, a horse trainer, a drover, a mill worker, a driver in various methods of transportation and a kangaroo hunter.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":3" /> In 1970, at the time of publishing his first collection of poems ''The First Born'', he dedicated himself to literature.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" /> He became the Manager of the Aboriginal Advancement Council Centre in Perth from 1969 -1973.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":9" /> He then transitioned into becoming an editor at the Aboriginal Publications Foundation from 1973 to 1979 which published a periodical magazine called ''Identity'' that focused on recognising Aboriginal literature.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":9" />

== Works ==
Jack Davis began his writing career by publishing a collection of poems called ''The First Born'' in 1970. He later published his second collection of poetry called ''Jagardoo'' in 1978.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /> After publishing two collections of poetry, he began to focus on playwriting, publishing a total of five plays and two children's plays:

Plays:
* ''Kullark'', 1979
* ''The Dreamers'', 1981
* ''No Sugar'', 1985
* ''Barungin'', 1989
* ''In Our Town'', 1990

Children’s plays:
* ''Honey Spot'', 1987
* ''Moorli and the Leprechaun'', 1994

Davis also wrote a monodrama called ''Wahngin Country,'' however, he never finished it.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /> Academic Bob Hodge, who wrote the peer reviewed journal ''Jack Davis and the Emergence of Aboriginal Writing'' in 1994 stated Davis was interested in "White History" and how it omitted the Aboriginal history and their perspective.<ref name=":4" />

According to Academics, Jack Davis wanted to offer an alternative narrative that included the Aboriginal story.<ref name=":4" /> Davis found the most effective format was through transforming the Indigenous tradition of oral story telling into written plays and performance<ref name=":4" /> Themes in his work encapsulate the history and discrimination of Aboriginal people,  including the first contact with white settlers. Academic Adam Shoemaker, has described his work as always alluding to the history of Aboriginals even when his plays are not mentioning the past.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shoemaker, Adam, 1957-|title=Black words, white page : Aboriginal literature 1929-1988|date=2004|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-0-9751229-6-9|edition=New|location=Canberra|oclc=223940371}}</ref>

=== Plays ===

==== Kullark ====
Davis’ play ''Kullark,'' translated to "home" is often considered by academics as a documentary, detailing the beginning of white settlement in Western Australia in 1829.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

''Kullark,'' published in 1979 translates to "home" in the Nyoongah language. The meaning of the play Is interpreted by academics as a protest, criticising the colonial recorded history of the 1829 white settlement in Western Australia.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

The play documents the history and first contact between Aboriginals and [[white settlers]] from the authors perspective using an Aboriginal family that have been effected by the history Davis is attempting to divulge.<ref name=":4" /> Davis uses a chronological and documentary like structure to present the play.<ref name=":1" />  He includes details such as the white settlers trading poisoned white flour and the massacres at [[Pinjarra massacre|Pinjarra]] in 1834.<ref name=":4" /> Academics have inferred that Davis includes the details of these events to give Aboriginal people a voice and a known history that have been previously omitted.<ref name=":4" /> ''Kullark'' was Davis’ first play to begin that journey of historical story telling<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

==== The Dreamers ====

The Dreamers was first performed in 1972 and published in 1981.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" /> The play centres its narrative around the memory of three Aboriginal men who worked at Moore River Native Settlement.<ref name=":3" /> Davis wrote that he aimed to confront white and black audiences with a truthful and uncompromising picture of urban Aboriginal life.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last=Rowett|first=Kelly|date=1993|title=Approaches to Aboriginal Drama|journal=Antipodes|volume=7|issue=1|pages=27–32|jstor=41956416|issn=0893-5580}}</ref>

====No Sugar====
Davis’ play ''No Sugar'' was first published in 1986 and achieved great acclaim; receiving the [[AWGIE Awards|Australian writers Guild Award]] (AWGIE) for best stage play, the year it was published.<ref name=":0" /> The play was set in the 1930s during the Great Depression and tells the story of an Aboriginal family that is removed from their home and forced to work on the Moore River Native Settlement.<ref name=":0" />  An article by the Sydney Morning Herald writes that the play is a rejection of white assimilation and the degradation of Aboriginal lives and culture.<ref name=":8" /> The Play includes many references of the Nyoongah language. Academics such as Bob Hodge consider this an attempt to validate the importance of Aboriginal culture, while also communicating the feelings of isolation when people cannot understand their own language and cultural customs.<ref name=":0" />

''No Sugar'' is currently in the Victorian High School Syllabus for students who are in the [[English as a second or foreign language|English as an Additional Language]] (EAL) course for the [[Higher School Certificate (Victoria)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC).<ref name=":6" /> However, as mentioned in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], there is debate over whether the themes and inclusion of the Nyoongah language are too complex for students who are trying to learn the fundamentals of the English.<ref name=":6" />

==== Barungin "Smell the Wind"  ====
Davis’ play Barungin was published in 1989 and translates to "Smell the Wind" in the Nyoongah language.<ref name=":1" /> The play focuses on the high [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody|incarceration]] rate of Aboriginals and the large number of deaths of Aboriginals in custody.<ref name=":1" /> During the year the play was published, Aboriginals accounted to ten percent of the national average of people in jail.<ref name=":1" /> Furthermore, the play is set in Western Australia where the incarceration rate of Aboriginals was thirty-five percent.<ref name=":1" />

== Themes and analysis ==

=== Aboriginality and Aboriginalism ===
Academics refer to the concepts Aboriginality and Aboriginalism when analysing Davis’ work. According to academics, Davis's work encapsulates these themes by constructing Western thought in his work and using the Nyoongah native language as a form of Aboriginal empowerment.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

Academic Bob Hodge, states that Aboriginalism is much like [[Orientalism]], where White society sees those of different race and  culture as 'the other'.<ref name=":4" /> The concept is portrayed as white society needing to fix those cultural differences, which is referenced in Davis’ plays.<ref name=":4" /> Academics have said that Davis and other Aboriginal writers such as [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal|Ooderoo Noonuccal]] from the sixties and seventies used literature as a form of activism against these ideals and as a powerful form of communication to write their own history.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

Aboriginality encompasses the response to Aboriginalism and the reaction of Indigenous writers in reclaiming their culture and history.<ref name=":1" /> It is seen as a protest against white [[imperialism]] and assimilation policies that dominated the beginning of white settlement in Australia.<ref name=":1" /> The concept, Aboriginality, within literature also includes proposals of how both white and Indigenous people can move forward.<ref name=":1" /> This concept was introduced in the 1960s when Aboriginal literature was first published, proposing a new way forward.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":4" />

Academics have analysed Davis’ work through the lens of Aboriginality as he uses the Western form of communication to connect to a white audience.<ref name=":4" /> Plays are seen as a Western form of communication, as Aboriginal history has revealed that Indigenous Australians told stories through oral communication, more commonly known as ‘[[Dreamtime]]’<ref name=":4" /> By including these Aboriginal overtones, academics believe he is trying to show a white audience another form of history through a communication method they know.<ref name=":4" /> ''Kullark,'' Davis’ first play in 1979 is used as an example by academics to show that Davis is confronting the issue of Aboriginalism<ref name=":4" /> Davis provides a historical and chronological account in ''Kullark'' including Aboriginals where they previously were not.<ref name=":4" /> According to academics, Davis believed that white [[historian]]s were unwilling to write the Aboriginal history and this, he felt, was necessary to record Aboriginal history in the Western way.<ref name=":4" /> His purpose for writing  was for people to know Aboriginals were omitted from white history, and to then provide the Aboriginal account.<ref name=":4" /> His goal, however, was for future generations to reflect and read history which included both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.<ref name=":4" /> Aboriginality encompasses the response and reaction of Indigenous writers in reclaiming their culture and history.<ref name=":1" /> It is seen as a protest against white imperialism and assimilation policies that dominated the beginning of white settlement in Australia.<ref name=":1" /> The concept 'Aboriginality' within literature also includes proposals of how both white and Indigenous people can move forward.<ref name=":1" />

===Survival===
According to academics the theme of survival is reoccurring in Davis’ work as it refers to the first settlement of white people and the long battle Aboriginal people have had to fight for their existence, land, culture, history and rights.<ref name=":4" /> Academics reveal the empowerment that Aboriginals feel when they see themselves on the stage acting in Davis’s plays, symbolising their ability to reclaim their sense of worth<ref name=":4" />

=== Influence ===
Davis’ life and history was a driving force and influence on his literary work.<ref name=":4" /> Davis’s experience on Moore River Native Settlement has shaped both his play ''Kullark'', ''No Sugar'' and ''The Dreamers.''<ref name=":4" /> In Davis’ play ''No Sugar'' he recreates the experience using different characters and detailing the large quantity of Aboriginals taken to Moore River Native Settlement<ref name=":4" /> Similarly, the Western Australian ‘Protector of Aboriginals’ [[A. O. Neville|A.O Neville]] who sent Davis and his brother to the Moore River Native Settlement features in his plays ''Kullark, No Sugar'' and ''The Dreamers.''<ref name=":4" /> Davis uses Neville’s speeches in his plays to portray the government’s perspective on Aboriginals.<ref name=":4" /> Additionally, According to academics,  Davis tries to demonstrate how the government believed they were doing the right thing for Aboriginal people but neglected to see the Aboriginal perspective and the pain and suffering that was the result.<ref name=":4" /> Academics infer that Davis evokes an understanding of the European mindset, yet shows how that attitude also shaped the way Aboriginal people see themselves.<ref name=":4" /> According to academics, Davis’ plays were not meant to be a place of conflict or a vent of anger but a place of clarity, empowerment and understanding.<ref name=":4" />

His poems were quoted in the Chinese Hugo Award writer Liu Cixin "Three Body 3", 

His childhood in Yarloop has been featured in his poetry<ref name=":7" /> His poem "Magpie" was influenced by his walk home from school through the jarrah forests and the wild life:<ref name=":7" />

<poem>
Magpie, Magpie,
Jaunty walk, cheeky eye,
You don’t seem to have an enemy,
I don’t know why.
Especially you, Mr Male,
With your elegant dress,
And your black and white tail.
I have seen you beat your mate
And make her squark as you berate,
Striding, running over my lawn,
Chattering in the early dawn,
As if you own that too.
On Second thoughts, as far as birds go
And what do they know,
You believe in land rights too!<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chesson|first=Keith|title=Jack Davis: A Life Story|publisher=Dent Publishing|year=1988|isbn=0867700750|location=Sydney|pages=14}}</ref></poem>

He wrote another poem about his experience of making his own bow and arrow and killing a robin redbreast which he felt great remorse for.<ref name=":7" />
