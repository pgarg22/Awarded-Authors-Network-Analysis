'''Henri-Léon-Gustave-Charles Bernstein''' (20 June 1876 – 27 November 1953) was a French [[playwright]] associated with [[Boulevard theatre (aesthetic)|Boulevard theatre]].

==Biography==
Bernstein was born in Paris. His earliest plays, including ''La Rafale'' (1905), ''Le Voleur'' (1907), ''Samson'' (1908), ''Israël'' (1908), and ''Le Secret'' (1913), are written in a realistic style and powerfully depict harsh realities of modern life and society.<ref name="Goitein"/>

The far-right [[Monarchism|royalist]] ''[[Camelots du Roi]]'' youth organization of the ''[[Action française]]'' organized an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[riot]] against a production of one of his plays in 1911. During the [[Second World War]], he fled to the [[United States]]<ref name="Goitein">{{cite EJ|last=Goitein|first=Denise R.|title=Bernstein, Henri-Leon|volume=3|page=479|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bernstein-henri-leon}}</ref> and lived in [[New York City]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]]. [[Jean-Pierre Aumont]] relates in his work ''Le Soleil et les Ombres'' ([[Robert Laffont]], 1976) the luxury in which he lived, as well as his general lack of interest in the war.

He is buried in the [[Cimetière de Passy]] in Paris.
