'''András Sütő''' (17 June 1927 – 30 September 2006) was an [[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarian]] journalist, writer, playwright and politician from [[Romania]], one of the leading writers in the [[Hungarian language]] in the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Sütő András-emlékház Pusztakamaráson.jpg|thumb|András Sütő Memorial House in Cămărașu]]
Sütő was born into a poor peasant family in [[Cămărașu]] ({{lang-hu|Pusztakamarás}}), [[Cluj County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of Romania. He received his primary and secondary school education in the Reformed College of [[Aiud]] and in the Reformed [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]. After secondary school, he studied [[Theatre direction|stage directing]] at the ''Szentgyörgyi István College of Dramatic Arts'' in Cluj.

==Career==
===Journalism===
Sütő quit college to become the editor in chief of the ''[[Falvak Népe]]'' weekly. He moved to [[Bucharest]] in 1951 because the editorial office was relocated there. Sütő could not identify himself with the political environment of the 1950s in the capital and returned in 1954 to [[Târgu Mureș]], in Transylvania, where he edited ''Igaz Szó'', a literary magazine. He held this post till 1957, after which he edited ''Uj Élet'', an illustrated magazine, until 1989.<ref name=indep>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andras-suto-426979.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925100817/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andras-suto-426979.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 September 2015|title=Andras Suto: Writer banned under Ceausescu|last= Gömöri|first=George|date=4 December 2006}}</ref>

===Literature===
Sütő's first work (''A Letter to a Romanian Friend'') was published by the Hungarian-language ''[[Világosság]]'' journal in Cluj, when he was 18. His writing career ranged across genres, with short stories (''Félrejáró Salamon'', 1955), satire (''Pompás Gedeon'', 1967), historical drama (''Egy lócsiszár virágvasárnapja'', 1974; ''Csillag a máglyán'', 1974; ''Szuzai menyegzo'', 1981), and myth and folklore (''Káin és Abel'', 1977; ''Advent a Hargitán'', 1987). The dramas, in particular, ''probed the duty of the individual, confronted by arbitrary authority, to preserve his dignity and identity even at the cost of his life''.<ref name=Banham1995/>

He served as vice-president of the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Association of Romania]] between 1974 and 1982.<ref name=indep/>

From 1980, aiming to curb his dissent against the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime's repression of Romania's Hungarian minorities, András Sütő's works were banned from publication and presentation. Consequently, between 1980 and 1989 he could publish only in [[Hungary]]. During this period, he and his family were constantly harassed by the authorities and the [[Securitate]].<ref name=wapo/>

===Politics===
A committed [[Communism|Communist]], Sütő was a member of the [[Great National Assembly]], the parliament of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]], between 1965 and 1977. He was also an alternate member of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] from 1969 to 1984. But his observations of the fate of the indigenous Romanian and Hungarian villagers in Transylvania under [[Collectivization in Romania|forced collectivisation]] in the 1950s and his discontent with the increasing centralisation of political power brought him into disfavour from the Ceaușescu government. Increasingly he also opposed the regime's pressure to "homogenise" the various nationalities in the country, such as restrictions against the use of the Hungarian language.<ref name=indep/>

By the time of Ceaușescu's removal from power during the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989, Sütő was a well-known public figure, respected for his support of the rights of the Hungarian people in Romania.<ref name=indep/>

===Awards===
In 1979, Sütő was awarded the [[Herder Prize]].<ref name="Banham1995">{{cite book|last=Banham|first=Martin |title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto0000banh|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University |isbn=978-0-521-43437-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto0000banh/page/1043 1043]}}</ref>

He also received the Gábor Bethlen Prize (1990), and the [[Kossuth Prize]] (1992).<ref name=hunlit>{{cite web|title=András SÜTŐ (1927 - 2006)|publisher=Petőfi Irodalmi Múzeum|work=Publishing Hungary|url=http://www.hunlit.hu/sutoandras,en|date=16 October 2014|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>

==Later life==
Sütő had his eye gouged out during the 1990 [[ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș]], and had to undergo treatment in Hungary. He died on 30 September 2006 in [[Budapest]], where he was undergoing treatment for cancer.<ref name=wapo>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402032.html|title=Ethnic Hungarian Writer and Activist Andras Suto, 79|first=Pablo|last=Gorondi|date=5 October 2006|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>
