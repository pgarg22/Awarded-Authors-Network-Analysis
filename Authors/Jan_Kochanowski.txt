'''Jan Kochanowski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈjan kɔxaˈnɔfskʲi|lang}}; 1530 – 22 August 1584) was a [[Polish Renaissance]] [[List of Polish language poets|poet]] who established poetic patterns that would become integral to the Polish [[Polish literature|literary]] language. He is commonly regarded as the greatest Polish poet before [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref name=amer>{{Americana|wstitle=Kochanowski, Jan|year=1920|inline=1}}</ref><ref name=ce>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Jan Kochanowski}}</ref>

==Life==
Jan Kochanowski was born at [[Sycyna]], near [[Radom]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]]. He was the older brother of [[Andrzej Kochanowski]], who would also become a poet and translator. Little is known of Jan's early education. At fourteen, fluent in [[Latin]], he was sent to the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]]. After graduating in 1547 at the age of seventeen, he attended the [[University of Königsberg]] (Królewiec), in [[Duchy of Prussia|Ducal Prussia]] (a [[fiefdom]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]), and [[University of Padua|Padua University]] in [[Italy]]. At Padua, Kochanowski came in contact with the great [[humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Francis Robortello|Francesco Robortello]]. Kochanowski closed his fifteen-year period of studies and travels with a final visit to [[France]], where he met the poet [[Pierre Ronsard]].

In 1559 Kochanowski returned to Poland for good, where he remained active as a humanist and [[Renaissance]] poet. He spent the next fifteen years close to the court of King [[Sigismund II Augustus]], serving for a time as royal secretary. In 1574, following the decampment of Poland's recently [[Royal elections in Poland|elected]] King [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]] (whose candidacy to the Polish throne Kochanowski had supported), Kochanowski settled on a family estate at [[Czarnolas, Zwoleń County|Czarnolas]] ("Blackwood") to lead the life of a country squire. In 1575 he married Dorota Podlodowska, with whom he had seven children.

Kochanowski is sometimes referred to in Polish as "''Jan'' z ''Czarnolasu''" ("John of Blackwood"). It was there that he wrote his most memorable works, including ''The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys'' and the ''[[Laments (Treny)|Laments]]''.

Kochanowski died, probably of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in [[Lublin]] on 22 August 1584.

Kochanowski never ceased to write in [[Latin]]; however, his main achievement was the creation of Polish-language [[verse form]]s that made him a [[classic]] for his contemporaries and posterity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jan Kochanowski - informacje o autorze, biografia|url=https://lekcjapolskiego.pl/analiza-i-interpretacja/jan-kochanowski,autor28/|access-date=2021-05-24|website=lekcjapolskiego.pl}}</ref>

His first major masterpiece was ''Odprawa posłów greckich'' (The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, 1578; recently translated into English by [[Indiana University]]'s [[Bill Johnston (translator)|Bill Johnston]]). This was a [[blank verse|blank-verse]] [[tragedy]]  that recounted an incident leading up to the [[Trojan War]]. It was the first tragedy written in Polish, and its [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the responsibilities of [[wikt:statesman|statesmanship]] continues to resonate to this day. The play was performed at the wedding of [[Jan Zamoyski]] and [[Krystyna Radziwiłł]] at [[Ujazdów Castle]] in [[Warsaw]] on 12 January 1578.<ref>[[Stefan Kieniewicz]], ed., ''Warszawa w latach 1526–1795'' (Warsaw in the Years 1526–1795), vol. II, Warsaw, 1984, {{ISBN|83-01-03323-1}}, pp. 157–58.</ref>

Kochanowski's best-known masterpiece is ''Treny'' ([[Threnody|Threnodies]], 1580), a series of nineteen [[elegy#Literary elegies|elegies]] on the death of his beloved two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Urszula (pet name, ''Urszulka''). It was translated into English (as ''[[Laments (Treny)|Laments]]'') in 1920 by Dorothea Prall, and in 1995 by [[Stanisław Barańczak]] and [[Seamus Heaney]].

Other well-known poems by Kochanowski are ''Proporzec albo hołd pruski'' (The Banner, or the Prussian Homage), the satiric poem ''Zgoda'' (Accord) published in 1564, and the merry ''Fraszki'' ([[Epigram]]s, published 1584), reminiscent of the ''[[Decameron]]''. His translation of the ''[[Psalms]]'' is highly regarded. He also wrote  in Latin, examples being ''Lyricorum libellus'' (Little Book of Lyrics, 1580), ''Elegiarum libri quatuor'' (Four Books of Elegies, 1584), and numerous poems composed for special occasions. He greatly enriched Polish poetry by naturalizing foreign poetic forms, which he knew how to imbue with a national spirit.<ref name="amer"/>

His writings were published collectively for the first time at Krakow in 1584–90, but the so-called jubilee publication, which appeared in Warsaw in 1884, is better. Many of his poems were translated into German by H. Nitschmann (1875).<ref name=nie>{{NIE|wstitle=Kochanowski, Jan|year=1905|inline=1}}</ref>
