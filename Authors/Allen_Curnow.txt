'''Thomas Allen Monro Curnow''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZ|CBE}} (17 June 1911 – 23 September 2001) was a New Zealand poet and journalist.

==Life==

Curnow was born in [[Timaru]], New Zealand, the son of a fourth generation New Zealander, an Anglican clergyman, and he grew up in a religious family. The family was of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] origin.<ref>White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames.(Curnow is himself mentioned by Rowse)</ref> During his early childhood they often moved, living in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], [[Belfast, New Zealand|Belfast]], [[Malvern, New Zealand|Malvern]], [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] and [[New Brighton, New Zealand|New Brighton]]. He was educated at [[Christchurch Boys' High School]], [[Canterbury University]], and [[Auckland University]].

After completing his education, Curnow worked from 1929 to 1930 at the ''[[Christchurch Sun]]'', before moving once again to Auckland to prepare for the Anglican ministry at [[St John's College, Auckland|St John's Theological College]] (1931–1933). In this period Curnow also published his first poems in University periodicals, such as ''Kiwi'' and ''Phoenix''.

In 1934 Curnow returned to the South Island, where he started a correspondence with [[Iris Wilkinson]] and [[Alan Mulgan]], as well as finding a job at ''[[The Press]]'', the Christchurch morning daily newspaper, having decided against a career in the Anglican ministry. At the same time, he also started a lifelong friendship with [[Denis Glover]] and contributed to the [[Caxton Press (New Zealand)|Caxton Press]], submitting some of his poems. He then taught English at Auckland University from 1950 to 1976.

==Personal life==
Curnow's first marriage, to [[Betty Curnow|Elizabeth "Betty" Le Cren]], was dissolved in 1965; they had a daughter and two sons, one of whom is New Zealand poet and art critic [[Wystan Curnow]]. His second marriage was to Jenifer Tole.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allen Curnow|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1358269/Allen-Curnow.html|website=The Telegraph|access-date=30 December 2015|date=3 October 2001}}</ref> He was buried at [[Purewa Cemetery]] in the Auckland suburb of [[Meadowbank, New Zealand|Meadowbank]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Notable graves |url= https://www.purewa.co.nz/notable-graves/ |publisher=Purewa Trust Board |access-date=15 February 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
Curnow wrote a long-running weekly satirical poetry column under the pen-name of ''Whim Wham'' for ''[[The Press]]'' from 1937, and then the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' from 1951, finishing in 1988 – a far-reaching period in which he turned his keen wit to many world issues,<ref>{{cite web|
url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/curnowa.html |title=Curnow, Allen In Brief|publisher=New Zealand Book Council |author=<!-- Staff Writer. No by-line -->}}</ref> from Franco, Hitler, Vietnam, Apartheid, and the [[White Australia policy]], to the internal politics of [[Walter Nash]] and the eras of [[Rob Muldoon]] and [[David Lange]], all interspersed with humorous commentary on New Zealand's obsession with rugby and other light-hearted subjects.

Curnow's publication ''Book of New Zealand Verse'' (1945) is seen as a landmark in [[New Zealand literature]]. He is, however, more celebrated as poet than as a satirist. His poetic works are heavily influenced by his training for the Anglican ministry, and subsequent rejection of that calling, with Christian imagery, myth and symbolism being included frequently, particularly in his early works (such as 'Valley of Decision'). He draws consistently on his experiences in childhood to shape a number of his poems, reflecting perhaps a childlike engagement with the environment in which he grew up, these poems bringing the hopeful, curious, questioning voice that a childlike view entails. Curnow's work of course is not all so innocently reflective. The satirist in Curnow is certainly not pushed aside in his poetic works, but is explored instead with a greater degree of emotional connectivity and self-reflection. 

Curnow's works concerning the New Zealand landscape and the sense of isolation experienced by one who lives in an island colony are perhaps his most moving and most deeply pertinent works regarding the New Zealand condition. His landscape/isolation centered poetry reflects varying degrees of engaged fear, guilt, accusation, rage and possessiveness, creating an important but, both previously and still, much neglected dialogue with the New Zealand landscape. He positions himself as an outside critic (he was far less religiously and politically involved than contemporaries like [[James K. Baxter]], and far more conventional in his lifestyle also) and though perhaps less impassioned in his writing  than his contemporaries, his poetic works are both prophetic and intelligent.
