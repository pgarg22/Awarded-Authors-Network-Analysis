== Biography ==
Wei Yingwu was born around 737{{sfnm|1a1=Ueki et al.|1y=1999|1p=106}} in [[Chang'an]]. His family was one of the prestigious Chinese noble clans of Tang dynasty;[[Wei clan of Jingzhao]]. He belongs to the Xiaoyaogong branch of the Wei clan. His great grandfather [[Wei Daijia]] was a chancellor during the reign of [[Wu Zetian]].

Yingwu became an imperial bodyguard of [[emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] when he was fifteen years old,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://sou-yun.com/PoemIndex.aspx?dynasty=Tang&author=%e9%9f%a6%e5%ba%94%e7%89%a9|title=韦应物|website=Souyun|language=zh|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> as a noble, he was not required to pass the [[imperial examination]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqE4CwAAQBAJ&q=%E6%97%A7%E5%94%90%E4%B9%A6+%E9%9F%A6%E5%BA%94%E7%89%A9&pg=PA39|title=唐代基層文官|last=Lai|first=Ruihe|publisher=聯經出版事業公司|year=2005|isbn=9789570827798|pages=39}}</ref>

After the death of emperor Xuanzong, he served as the magistrate of [[Huyi District|Hu county]] and [[Yanliang District|Yueyang]]. He was also the governor of Chuzhou(784), Jiangzhou(785), and Suzhou(787-792). He died in Suzhou in 792.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Lo1DwAAQBAJ&q=%E9%9F%A6%E5%BA%94%E7%89%A9&pg=PA63|title=唐詩選箋: 中唐-晚唐|last=Li|first=You|publisher=Showwe Information Co Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9789869499859|pages=63}}</ref>

According to [[John C. H. Wu]], the turbulence and lack of strong central leadership of China during Wei Yingwu's poetry-writing years was a major influencing factor upon his work. One example of such sociopolitical turmoil is the [[An Shi Rebellion]] of 755-763. Wu suggests that images such as the boat moving without a person steering in "At Chuzhou on the Western Stream" is a reference to the ship of state without a person at the helm.<ref>Wu, 162</ref>

== Poetry ==
Wei Yingwu was strongly influenced by the 5th century poet [[Tao Yuanming]]. His poems reflect his indifference to the world. Editors of [[Siku Quanshu]] commented that his poems are "Simple but not vulgar, rich but not pedantic". Wei's most praised works often take the form of [[Chinese poetry|five characters]]({{lang|zh|五言}}), His main focus of work was on the depiction of nature such as mountains, rivers and other natural landscape.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9cLQcdMgbkC&q=%E9%9F%A6%E5%BA%94%E7%89%A9+%E5%B1%B1%E6%B0%B4%E8%AF%97&pg=PA475|title=鲁迅古籍藏書漫谈, Part 1|last=Wei|first=Li|publisher=福建教育出版社|year=2006|isbn=9787533445423|location=Fuzhou|pages=475}}</ref> According to Bai Juyi, Wei's poems are inspired by the feelings which natural scenery stirs. "Elegant and idle", Bai Juyi praised Wei Yingwu with these two words.<ref>Bai Juyi, ''Letter to Yuanjiu'': 如近歲韋蘇州歌行，才麗之外，頗近興諷，其五言詩又高雅閑澹，自成一家之體</ref> Wei Yingwu was often paired with [[Liu Zongyuan]] by later generations of literary critics.

In his work [[Qizhui Ji]]({{lang|zh|七綴集}}), [[Qian Zhongshu]] draws a parallel between [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] and Wei Yingwu. He cited the theories of Italian literary critic [[Benedetto Croce]] when commenting the two, naming Wei "un grande-piccolo poeta" or "大的小詩人”(A minor poet among great poets) in contrast to Wang Wei who was "Un piccolo-grande poeta" or "小的大詩人”(A great poet among minor poets).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Qizhui Ji(七綴集)|last=Qian|first=Zhongshu|publisher=Joint Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9787108016775|location=Beijing|pages=22}}</ref>
