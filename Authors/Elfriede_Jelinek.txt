'''Elfriede Jelinek''' ({{IPA-de|ɛlˈfʁiːdə ˈjɛlinɛk|lang}}; born 20 October 1946) is an Austrian playwright and novelist. She is one of the most decorated authors writing in German today and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2004 for her "musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays that, with extraordinary linguistic zeal, reveal the absurdity of society's clichés and their subjugating power".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2004|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2004/press-release/|access-date=23 September 2020|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>
Next to [[Peter Handke]] and [[Botho Strauss]] she is considered to be the most important living playwright of the German language.

== Biography ==
Elfriede Jelinek was born on 20 October 1946 in [[Mürzzuschlag]], [[Steiermark|Styria]], the daughter of Olga Ilona (''née'' Buchner), a personnel director, and Friedrich Jelinek.<ref name="Notable" /> She was raised in [[Vienna]] by her [[Germans of Romania|Romanian-German]] Catholic mother and a [[Jewish secularism|non-observant]] [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Czech Jewish]] father (whose surname "Jelinek" means "little deer" in Czech).<ref name="Notable">{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-Fo-La/Jelinek-Elfriede.html|title=Elfriede Jelinek biography|publisher=notablebiographies.com|date=23 March 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/jelinek-elfriede|title=Elfriede Jelinek: Introduction|publisher=[[eNotes]]|date=15 June 2002}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/elfriede-jelinek Elfriede Jelinek profile], The Poetry Foundation website; retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref> Her mother came from a bourgeois background, while her father was a working-class socialist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=open_access_dissertations&a=bi&pagenumber=1&w=100 |title="Obscene Fantasies": Elfriede Jelinek's Generic Perversions |publisher=University of Massachusetts Amherst |access-date=5 December 2020}}</ref>

Her father was a [[chemist]], who managed to avoid persecution during the [[Second World War]] by working in strategically important industrial production. However, many of his relatives became victims of the [[Holocaust]]. Her mother, with whom she had a strained relationship, was from a formerly prosperous Vienna family. As a child, Elfriede attended a Roman Catholic convent school in Vienna. Her mother planned a career for her as a musical "[[Wunderkind]]". She was instructed in piano, organ, guitar, violin, viola, and recorder from an early age. Later, she went on to study at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]], where she graduated with an organist diploma; during this time, she tried to meet her mother's high expectations, while coping with her psychologically ill father.<ref name="Boiter" /> She studied [[art history]] and theater at the [[University of Vienna]]. However, she had to discontinue her studies due to an [[anxiety disorder]], which resulted in self-isolation at her parents' house for a year. During this time, she began serious literary work as a form of therapy. After a year, she began to feel comfortable leaving the house, often with her mother.<ref name="Boiter">{{cite book|last=Boiter|first=Vera|title=Elfriede Jelinek|publisher=Greenwood Press|series=Women Writers in German-Speaking Countries|year=1998|location=Westport, CT|pages=199–207}}</ref> She began writing poetry at a young age. She made her literary debut with ''Lisas Schatten'' (''Lisa's Shadow'') in 1967, and received her first literary prize in 1969. During the 1960s, she became active politically, read a great deal, and "spent an enormous amount of time watching television".<ref name="Boiter" />

She married Gottfried Hüngsberg on 12 June 1974.<ref name="nobel">[http://nobelprize.org/mediaplayer/index.php?id=591&view=1 "Portrait of the 2004 Nobel Laureate in Literature"], nobelprize.org; retrieved 13 July 2010.</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0406161 Gottfried Hüngsberg profile] IMDb.com; accessed 13 July 2010</ref>

It's a kind of ''[[Tale of Two Cities]]'' in the [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] sense. I've always commuted between Vienna and [[Munich]]. Vienna is where I've always lived because my friends are here and because I've never wanted to leave Vienna. In the end I've been caught up here. Munich is my husband's city and so I've always traveled to and from, and that's been good for our marriage.<ref name="nobel" />}}

== Work and political engagement ==
Despite the author's own differentiation from Austria (due to her criticism of Austria's Nazi past), Jelinek's writing is deeply rooted in the tradition of [[Austrian literature]], showing the influence of Austrian writers such as [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], [[Marlen Haushofer]], and [[Robert Musil]].<ref name="Theater" />

Jelinek's political positions, in particular her [[feminism|feminist]] stance and her Communist Party affiliations, are of vital importance to any assessment of her work. They are also a part of the reason for the controversy directed at Jelinek and her work. Editor Friederike Eigler states that Jelinek has three major and inter-related "targets" in her writing: what she views as capitalist consumer society and its [[commodification]] of all human beings and relationships, what she views as the remnants of Austria's fascist past in public and private life, and what she views as the systematic [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and oppression of women in a capitalist-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society.<ref>{{Citation|last = Eigler|first = Friederike|contribution = Jelinek, Elfriede|year = 1997|title = The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature|editor-last = Eigler|editor-first = Friederike|pages = 263–4|place = Westport, CT|publisher = Greenwood Press}}</ref> Jelinek has claimed in multiple interviews that the Austrian-Jewish [[Jewish humor|satirical tradition]] has been a formative influence on her writing, citing [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Elias Canetti]], and Jewish cabaret in particular. In an interview with [[Sigrid Löffler]], Jelinek claimed that her work is considered an oddity in contemporary Austria, where she claims satire is unappreciated and misunderstood, "because the Jews are dead." She has stressed her Jewish identity as the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, claiming a continuity with a Jewish-Viennese tradition that she believes has been destroyed by fascism and is dying out.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pizer |first1=John |date=1994 |title=Modern vs. Postmodern Satire: Karl Kraus and Elfriede Jelinek |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30153333 |journal=Monatshefte |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=500–513 |jstor=30153333 |access-date=5 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kremer |first=S.

She claims her own Jewish identity as the daughter of a Holocaust victim, her father, thereby suggesting that there is a continuity of Vienna's Jewish tradition (Berka 1993, 137f.; Gilman 1995, 3).}}</ref>

=== Work ===
Jelinek's output has included radio plays, poetry, theatre texts, polemical essays, anthologies, novels, translations, screenplays, musical compositions, libretti and ballets, film and video art.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=L.|title=Anti-War Theatre After Brecht|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-53887-1|pages=169–199|chapter=Elfriede Jelinek's ''Bambiland''|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-53888-8_7}}</ref>
Jelinek's work is multi-faceted, and highly controversial. It has been praised and condemned by leading [[literary criticism|literary critics]].<ref name="Gale">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Elfriede Jelinek|encyclopedia=Contemporary Literary Criticism|volume=169|pages=67–155|publisher=Gale|date=March 2003}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Fritzl incest case|Fritzl case]], for example, she was accused of "executing 'hysterical' portraits of Austrian perversity".<ref>"[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23643630-2703,00.html Wife of incest dad under suspicion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508191050/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23643630-2703,00.html|date=May 8, 2008}}". [[The Australian]], 5 May 2008.</ref> Likewise, her political activism has encountered divergent and often heated reactions. Despite the controversy surrounding her work, Jelinek has won many distinguished awards; among them are the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 1998; the [[Mülheim Dramatists Prize]] in 2002 and 2004; the [[Franz Kafka Prize]] in 2004; and the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], also in 2004.<ref name="Gale"/>

[[Female sexuality]], sexual abuse, and the battle of the sexes in general are prominent topics in her work. Texts such as ''Wir sind Lockvögel, Baby!'' (''We are Decoys, Baby!''), ''[[Women as Lovers (Book)|Die Liebhaberinnen]]'' (''Women as Lovers'') and ''Die Klavierspielerin'' (''The Piano Teacher'') showcase the brutality and power play inherent in human relations in a style that is, at times, ironically formal and tightly controlled. According to Jelinek, power and aggression are often the principal driving forces of [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. Likewise ''Ein Sportstück'' (''Sports Play'') explores the darker side of competitive sports.<ref>{{cite news|date=13 July 2012|title=Elfriede Jelinek: Game on|work=The Stage|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2012/elfriede-jelinek-game-on/|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref> Her provocative novel ''[[Lust (Jelinek novel)|Lust]]'' contains graphic description of sexuality, aggression and abuse. It received poor reviews by many critics, some of whom likened it to pornography. But others, who noted the power of the cold descriptions of moral failures, considered it to have been misunderstood and undervalued by them.<ref name="Gale"/>

Her novel ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]'' was the basis for the [[The Piano Teacher (2001 film)|2001 film of the same title]] by Austrian director [[Michael Haneke]], starring [[Isabelle Huppert]] as the protagonist. In April 2006, Jelinek spoke out to support [[Peter Handke]], whose play ''Die Kunst des Fragens'' (''The Art of Asking'') was removed from the repertoire of the [[Comédie-Française]] for his alleged support of [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Her work is less known in English-speaking countries. However, in July and August 2012, a major English language premiere of her play ''Ein Sportstück'' by Just a Must theatre company brought her dramatic work to the attention of English-speaking audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Accounts|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2012/07/elfriede-jelinek-game-on/|access-date=11 August 2016|website=thestage.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Postcards from the Gods: Sports Play – Nuffield Theatre, Lancaster|url=http://postcardsgods.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/sports-play-nuffield-theatre-lancaster.html|access-date=11 August 2016|website=postcardsgods.blogspot.co.uk|date=17 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Sports Play at the Nuffield, Lancaster {{!}} The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/stage/theatre/article3474101.ece|access-date=11 August 2016|language=en-GB|last1=Hutera|first1=Donald}}</ref> The following year, in February and March 2013, the Women's Project in New York staged the North American premiere of ''Jackie'', one of her ''Princess Dramas''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jackie – Women's Project Theater|url=http://wptheater.org/show/jackie/}}</ref>

=== Political engagement ===
Jelinek was a member of Austria's [[Communist Party of Austria|Communist Party]] from 1974 to 1991. She became a household name during the 1990s due to her vociferous clash with [[Jörg Haider]]'s [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=DAS KOMMEN|url=https://www.elfriedejelinek.com/fdaskommen.htm|access-date=4 September 2020|website=elfriedejelinek.com}}</ref> Following the 1999 [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] elections, and the subsequent formation of a coalition cabinet consisting of the Freedom Party and the [[Austrian People's Party]], Jelinek became one of the new cabinet's more vocal critics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C. G.|date=2004|title=The Struggle for a Civil Society and beyond: Austrian Writers and Intellectuals Confronting the Political Right|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4150478|journal=New German Critique|issue=93|pages=19–41|jstor=4150478|issn=0094-033X}}</ref>

Many foreign governments moved swiftly to ostracize Austria's administration, citing the Freedom Party's alleged nationalism and [[authoritarianism]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Badge|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRD2K80JYpYC|title=Nobel Faces: A Gallery of Nobel Prize Winners|date=3 December 2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-3-527-40678-4|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Festić|first=Fatima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCcrBwAAQBAJ|title=Gender and Trauma: Interdisciplinary Dialogues|date=15 November 2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-3533-6|language=en}}</ref> The cabinet construed the sanctions against it as directed against Austria as such, and attempted to prod the nation into a national rallying (''Nationaler Schulterschluss'') behind the coalition parties.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wodak|first=Ruth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tA2rBgAAQBAJ|title=Discursive Construction of National Identity|date=19 January 2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3735-5|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Waring|first=Alan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0S9DwAAQBAJ|title=The New Authoritarianism|date=30 March 2019|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-8382-1263-0|language=en}}</ref>

This provoked a temporary heating of the political climate severe enough for dissidents such as Jelinek to be accused of [[treason]] by coalition supporters.<ref name=":0"/><ref name=":1"/>

In the mid- to late-1980s, Jelinek was one of many Austrian intellectuals who signed a petition for the release of [[Jack Unterweger]], who was imprisoned for the murder of a prostitute, and who was regarded by intellectuals and politicians as an example of successful rehabilitation. Unterweger was later found guilty of murdering nine more women within two years of his release, and committed suicide after his arrest.<ref name="unterweger's suicide">[http://www.biography.com/people/jack-unterweger-12103266 Johann Unterweger biography], Johann Unterweger. (2014). The Biography.com website. Retrieved 11:10, 22 November 2014.</ref>

== The Nobel Prize ==
Jelinek said she felt very happy to receive the Nobel Prize, but felt "despair for becoming a known, a person of the public". Known for her modesty and subtle [[Irony#Metafiction|self-irony]], she – a reputed feminist writer – wondered if she had been awarded the prize mainly for "being a woman", and suggested that among authors writing in German, [[Peter Handke]], whom she praised as a "living classic", would have been a more worthy recipient.<ref name="Theater">{{cite journal|last=Honegger|first=Gitta|title=How to Get the Nobel Prize Without Really Trying|journal=Theater|volume=36|issue=2|pages=5–19|year=2006|doi=10.1215/01610775-36-2-4}}</ref> (Handke subsequently won the Nobel Prize in 2019.)

Jelinek was criticized for not accepting the prize in person; instead, a video message<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/2004/jelinek-lecture.html|title=Elfriede Jelinek – Nobel Lecture|website=nobelprize.org|access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref> was presented at the ceremony. Others appreciated how Jelinek revealed that she suffers from [[agoraphobia]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], paranoid conditions that developed when she first decided to write seriously.<ref name="nobel"/>

She has said her anxiety disorders make it impossible for her to go to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

In 2005, [[Knut Ahnlund]] left the [[Swedish Academy]] in protest, describing Jelinek's work as "whining, unenjoyable public pornography", as well as "a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure". He said later that her selection for the prize "has not only done irreparable damage to all progressive forces, it has also confused the general view of literature as an art".<ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/10/12/members_abrupt_resignation_rocks_nobel_prize_community "Member's abrupt resignation rocks Nobel Prize community"]. ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 12 October 2005.</ref>

In an interview Jelinek gave to the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' after receiving the Nobel Prize, Jelinek said that until then, she had written against great inner resistance ("like constantly having to vomit") out of a sense of social and political obligation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/books/review/Agee.t.html|title=Greed – Elfriede Jelinek – Books – Review|last=Agee|first=Joel|access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref>
