Dickey was best known for his novel ''[[Deliverance (novel)|Deliverance]]'' (1970) which was adapted into an [[Deliverance|acclaimed film of the same name]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Dickey was born to lawyer Eugene Dickey and Maibelle Swift in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where he attended [[North Fulton High School (Georgia)|North Fulton High School]] in Atlanta's [[Buckhead]] neighborhood. After graduation from North Fulton High in 1941, Dickey completed a postgraduate year at [[Darlington School]] in Rome, Georgia. Dickey asked to be dismissed from the Darlington rolls in a 1981 letter to the principal, deeming the school the most "disgusting combination of cant, hypocrisy, cruelty, class privilege and inanity I have ever since encountered at any human institution."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTQmNNdRjnsC&q=james+dickey+darlington&pg=PT146|title=James Dickey: The World as a Lie|last=Hart|first=Henry|date=2001-09-08|publisher=Picador|isbn=9781466828650|language=en}}</ref> In 1942, he enrolled at [[Clemson University|Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina]] and played on the football team as a tailback. After one semester, he left school to enlist in the Army Air Corps. Dickey served with the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] as a radar operator in a [[night fighter]] squadron during the Second World War, and in the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the Korean War. Between the wars, he attended [[Vanderbilt University]], graduating ''magna cum laude'' with a degree in English and philosophy (as well as minoring in astronomy) in 1949. He also received an M.A. in English from Vanderbilt in 1950.

===Career===
Dickey taught as an instructor of English at [[Rice University]] (then Rice Institute) in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1950 and, following his second Air Force stint, from 1952 to 1954. After teaching at the [[University of Florida]] during the 1955–1956 academic year, he worked for several years in advertising, most notably [[Copywriting|writing copy]] and helping direct creative work on the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Lay's]] potato chips campaign. He once said he embarked on his advertising career in order to "make some bucks." Dickey also said "I was selling my soul to the devil all day... and trying to buy it back at night." He was ultimately fired for shirking his work responsibilities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Currey|first=Mason|title=Keep Your Day Job|journal=Slate|date=2 May 2013|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2013/daily_rituals/is_the_key_to_becoming_a_great_writer_having_a_day_job.html}}</ref>

His first book, ''Into the Stone and Other Poems'', was published in 1960. ''Drowning with Others'' was published in 1962, which led to a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] (Norton Anthology, The Literature of the American South). ''[[Buckdancer's Choice]]'' (1965) earned him a [[National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref name=nba1966>

<br/>(With essay by Patrick Rosal from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)</ref>
Among his better-known poems are "The Performance", "[[Cherrylog Road]]", "The Firebombing", "May Day Sermon", "Falling", and "For The Last Wolverine."

He published his first volume of collected poems, ''Poems 1957-1967'' in 1967 after being named a poetry consultant for the [[Library of Congress]]. This publishing may represent Dickey's best work. After serving as a visiting lecturer at several institutions from 1963 to 1968 (including [[Reed College]], [[California State University, Northridge]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]), Dickey returned to academia in earnest in 1969 as a professor of English and writer-in-residence at the [[University of South Carolina]], a position he held for the remainder of his life. It was there that he was also inducted into [[Omicron Delta Kappa]], the National Leadership Honor Society, in 1970.

Dickey wrote the poem "The Moon Ground" for ''Life'' magazine in celebration of the Apollo 11 moon landing.  His reading of it was broadcast on ABC television on July 20, 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UNzoEeYhJI|title=James Dickey reads "The Moon Ground," 1969|last=James Dickey|via=YouTube}}</ref>

His popularity exploded after the [[Deliverance|film version]] of his novel ''[[Deliverance (novel)|Deliverance]]'' was released in 1972. Dickey wrote the screenplay and had a cameo in the film as a sheriff.

The poet was invited to read his poem [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171428 "The Strength of Fields"] at [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]'s inauguration in 1977.

===Personal life===
In November 1948 he married Maxine Syerson, and three years later they had their first son, [[Christopher Dickey|Christopher]]; a second son, Kevin, was born in 1958. 

Two months after Maxine died in 1976, Dickey married Deborah Dodson. Their daughter, Bronwen, was born in 1981. 

Christopher Dickey was a novelist and journalist, providing coverage from the Middle East for [[Newsweek]]. In 1998, Christopher wrote a book about his father and Christopher's own sometimes troubled relationship with him, titled ''Summer of Deliverance''. He died in July 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.thedailybeast.com/legendary-foreign-correspondent-chris-dickey-dies-in-paris|title=Legendary foreign correspondent chris dickey dies}}</ref>

Kevin Dickey is an [[interventional radiologist]] and lives in [[Winston-Salem, NC]]. 

Bronwen Dickey is a writer. Her first book, ''Pit Bull: The Battle Over an American Icon'',  was published in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/221117/pit-bull-by-bronwen-dickey/|title=Pit Bull by Bronwen Dickey - PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com}}</ref>

==Death==
Dickey died on January 19, 1997, aged 73, six days after his last class at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]], where from 1968 he taught as poet-in-residence. 
Dickey spent his last years in and out of hospitals, afflicted with severe alcoholism,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/08/the-burden-of-james-dickey/377173/|title=The Burden of James Dickey|first=Peter|last=Davison|date=August 1, 1998|website=The Atlantic}}</ref> [[jaundice]] and later [[pulmonary fibrosis]].
