'''Aaron Hill''' (10 February 1685 – 8 February 1750) was an [[England|English]] [[dramatist]] and [[miscellany]] writer.

==Biography==
The son of a country gentleman of [[Wiltshire]], Hill was educated at [[Westminster School]], and afterwards travelled in the East. He was the author of 17 plays, some of them, such as his versions of [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaire]]'' and ''[[Mérope]]'', being adaptations. He also wrote [[poetry]], which is of variable quality. Having written some satiric lines on [[Alexander Pope]], he received in return a mention in ''[[The Dunciad]]'', which led to a controversy between the two writers. Afterwards a reconciliation took place. He was a friend and correspondent of [[Samuel Richardson]], whose ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' he highly praised. In addition to his literary pursuits Hill was involved in many commercial schemes, usually unsuccessful.

Hill was the manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] when he was 24 years old, and before being summarily fired for reasons unknown, he staged the premier of [[George Frideric Handel]]'s ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]],'' the first [[Italian opera]] designed for a [[London]] audience. The composer was very involved in the production, and Hill collaborated on the [[libretto]], although it is disputed what his actual contributions were.<ref>Robert D. Hume.

A posthumous collection of Hill's essays, letters and poems was published in 1753. His ''Dramatic Works'' were published in 1760. His biography was recorded in ''Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Time of Dean Swift'', volume 5 (ostensibly by [[Theophilus Cibber]] but generally accepted to be of anonymous authorship).
