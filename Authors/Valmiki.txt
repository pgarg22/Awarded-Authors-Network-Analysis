The ''Ramayana'', originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 [[shloka]]s and seven [[canto]]s (kaṇḍas).<ref>{{cite web |title=Valmiki Ramayan |url=https://valmikiramayan.net/ |website=valmikiramayan.net |publisher=Desiraju Hanumanta Rao & K.

The ''Ramayana'' tells the story of a prince, [[Rama]] of the city of [[Ayodhya]] in the [[Kosala|Kingdom of Kosala]], whose wife [[Sita]] is abducted by [[Ravana]], the demon-king ([[Asura]]) of [[Lanka]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' is dated variously from 500 BCE to 100 BCE<ref>{{cite web|title=harking back : Myths and facts of the beginnings of Lahore|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1111338}}</ref> or about co-eval with early versions of the ''Mahabharata''.<ref>Goldman, Robert P., ''The Ramayana of Valmiki: An Epic of Ancient India'' pp. 23</ref> As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a process of interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.

British satirist [[Aubrey Menen]] says that Valmiki was "recognized as a literary genius," and thus was considered, "an outlaw," presumably because of his "[[philosophic scepticism]],"<ref>Menen, Aubrey (1954). "Introduction", ''The Ramayana'', p.4. Charles Scribner's Sons: New York. {{pre-ISBN}}. {{LCC|54-5919}}. {{LCCN|54035716}}.</ref> as part of an "Indian Enlightenment" period.<ref>Menen (1954). "The Indian Enlightenment", p.9.</ref> Valmiki is also quoted as being the contemporary of Rama. Menen claims Valmiki is "the first author in all history to bring himself into his own composition."<ref>Menen (1954). "The Heritage of the Gluttons", p.81.</ref>

== Early life ==
Valmiki was born as Agni Sharma to a Brahmin named Pracheta (also known as Sumali) of [[Bhrigu]] gotra,<ref>{{cite book|title=Sages, Nymphs, and Deities: Excursions in Indian Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DInXAAAAMAAJ&q=agnisharma|publisher=The Author|year=1998|author=Vishwanath S. Naravane|page=86}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=History Of Ancient India (a New Version) : From 7300 Bb To 4250 Bc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7gOBW8oDFgC|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Dist|year=2006|page=720|isbn = 9788126906154}}</ref> According to legend he once met the great sage [[Narada]] and had a discourse with him on his duties. Moved by Narada's words, Agni Sharma began to perform penance and chanted the word "Mara" which meant "die". As he performed his penance for several years, the word became "Rama", a name of the god Vishnu. Huge anthills formed around Agni Sharma and this earned him the name of Valmiki. Agni Sharma, rechristened as Valmiki, learnt the scriptures from Narada and became the foremost of ascetics, revered by everyone.

There also exist some legends about Valmiki having been a thief before turning into a rishi. The Nagara Khanda of the [[Skanda Purana]] in its section on the creation of Mukhara Tirtha mentions that Valmiki was born a [[Brahmin]], with the name of Lohajangha and was a devoted son to his parents. He had a beautiful wife and both of them were faithful to each other. Once, when there was no rain in the region of [[Anarta]], for twelve long years, Lohajangha, for the sake of his hungry family, started robbing people that he found in the forest. In the course of this life he met the seven sages or the [[Saptarishi]] and tried to rob them as well. But the learned sages felt pity on him and showed him the folly of his ways. One of them, [[Pulaha]] gave him a Mantra to meditate upon and the Brahmin turned thief got so engrossed in its recitation that ant-hills came up around his body. When the sages returned and heard the sound of the mantra coming from the ant-hill, they blessed him and said, "Since you achieved great Siddhi seated within a Valmīka (an anthill), you will become well-known in the world as Vālmīki."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Skanda Purana, Nagara Khanda, Chapter 124, Creation of Mukhara Tirtha|url=https://cloudup.com/cYfWSvnuieF}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Skanda Purana, Part 17, (Ancient Indian Tradition and Mythology Series, Vol. LXV)|url=https://www.abebooks.fr/Skanda-Purana-Part-Ancient-Indian-Tradition/7588930100/bd|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Pvt.

== The first shloka ==
[[File:Narada visits Valmiki.jpg|thumb|250px|The youthful sage [[Narada]] at the white-bearded Valmiki's hermitage]]

Valmiki was going to the river Ganges for his daily ablutions. A disciple by the name [[Bharadwaja]] was carrying his clothes. On the way, they came across the [[Tamsa river|Tamasa]] Stream. Looking at the stream, Valmiki said to his disciple, "Look, how clear is this water, like the mind of a good man! I will bathe here today." When he was looking for a suitable place to step into the stream, he saw a [[Crane (bird)|crane]] couple mating. Valmiki felt very pleased on seeing the happy birds. Suddenly, hit by an arrow, the male bird died on the spot. Filled by sorrow, its mate screamed in agony and died of shock. Valmiki's heart melted at this pitiful sight. He looked around to find out who had shot the bird. He saw a hunter with a bow and arrows, nearby. Valmiki became very angry. His lips opened and he cried out,

{{poemquote|
मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः।
यत्क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकमवधीः काममोहितम्॥'

''mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhā tvamagamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ''
''yat krauñcamithunādekam avadhīḥ kāmamohitam''<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rys/rys1002.htm Sacred-Texts.com] IAST encoded transliteration (modified from original source to accurately reflect sandhi rules)</ref>

You will find no rest for the long years of Eternity''
For you killed a bird in love and unsuspecting'' <ref>Buck, William and van Nooten, B. A. ''Ramayana''. 2000, page 7</ref>
}}

Emerging spontaneously from Valmiki's rage and grief, this is considered to be the first shloka in [[Sanskrit literature]]. Valmiki later composed the entire ''Ramayana'' with the blessings of the god [[Brahma]] in the same meter that issued forth from him as the shloka. Thus this shloka is revered as the first shloka in [[Hindu]] literature. Valmiki is revered as the first poet or ''Adi Kavi'' and Ramayana, the first [[kavya]] (poem).

== Role in ''Ramayana'' ==
Valmiki played an important role in ''Uttara Kanda,'' the last chapter of epic ''Ramayana''. It is believed that The Uttara Kanda was not original work of Valmiki. It is believed to be taken up from ''Sesha Ramayana.'' According to the legend Rama send Sita to forest. Sita finds refuge in Sage Valmiki's ashram, where she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]]. Lava and Kusha were Valmiki's first disciples to whom he taught the ''[[Ramayana]]''. [[Balakanda|Bala Kanda]] of the epic also telling the story of Valmiki narrating the Ramayana to his disciples Lava and Kusha.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Rao|first1=T. S.

''Vishnudharmottara Purana'' says that Valmiki was born in the [[Treta Yuga]] as a form of [[Brahma]] who composed ''Ramayana'' and that people desirous of earning knowledge should worship Valmiki.<ref>''Mythology of Vishnu and His Incarnations'' by Manohar Laxman Varadpande (2009), p. 166.</ref> He was later reincarnated as [[Tulsidas]], who composed the ''[[Ramcharitamanas]]'', which was the [[Awadhi]]-[[Hindi]] version of the ''[[Ramayana]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-04|title=When is Tulsidas Jayanti; why is it celebrated?|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/when-is/tulsidas-jayanti-celebrated-1502905999.html|access-date=2020-07-07|website=The Statesman|language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Balmiki sect]] of Hinduism reveres Valmiki, where he is also known as '''Lal Beg''' or '''Bala Shah''', as a [[patron]] saint, with a plethora of [[Ashram (Balmiki)|mandirs]] (temples) dedicated to him.<ref name="ISD2000"/><ref name="Dalal2014">{{cite book |last1=Dalal |first1=Roshen |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |date=18 April 2014 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |language=en}}</ref>

An area in [[Chennai]], [[Tiruvanmiyur]] is believed to derive its name from Sage Valmiki, Thiru-Valmiki-Oor. There is a temple for Valmiki located in this place, which is believed to be 1300 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archive News|url=https://www.thehindu.com/archive/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=The Hindu|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Maharishi Valmiki temple|url=http://www.columbuslost.com/2015/01/maharishi-valmiki-temple-at.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101000000/http://www.columbuslost.com/2015/01/maharishi-valmiki-temple-at.html|archive-date=2019-11-08|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Columbo Post}}</ref>

There is also Shree Valmiki Mata Maha Samsthana in Rajanahalli, [[Karnataka]].

== In popular culture ==
Several Indian films have been made on the life of the poet, beginning with G. V. Sane's ''Valmiki'' (1921); it was followed by Surendra Narayan Roy's ''Ratnakar'' (1921), [[Ellis Dungan]]'s ''Valmiki'' (1946), [[Bhalji Pendharkar]]'s ''Valmiki'' (1946), [[Sundar Rao Nadkarni|Sundarrao Nadkarni]]'s ''[[Valmiki (1946 film)|Valmiki]]'' (1946), [[C.S.R.
