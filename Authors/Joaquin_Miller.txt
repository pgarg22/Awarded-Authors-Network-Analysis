'''Cincinnatus Heine Miller'''<ref>His middle name is also spelled '''Hiner''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|n|ər}}.</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|n|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|ə|s|_|ˈ|h|aɪ|n|ə}}; September 8, 1837 – February 17, 1913), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Joaquin Miller''' ({{IPAc-en|hw|ɑː|ˈ|k|iː|n}}), was an [[United States|American]] poet, author, and frontiersman. He is nicknamed the "Poet of the Sierras" after the [[Sierra Nevada]], about which he wrote in his ''Songs of the Sierras'' (1871).

As a young man, he moved to northern [[California]] during the [[California Gold Rush]] years, and had a variety of adventures, including spending a year living in a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village, and being wounded in a battle with Native Americans. A number of his popular works, ''[[Life Amongst the Modocs]],''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvJkcXOKcTsC&q=life+amongst+the+modocs |title=Unwritten History: Life Amongst the Modocs - Joaquin Miller - Google Boeken |access-date=2012-08-19|last1=Miller |first1=Joaquin |year=1874 |isbn=9780598284372 }}</ref> ''An Elk Hunt'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.notfrisco.com/calmem/miller/elk.html |title=California Reader - Joaquin Miller |publisher=Notfrisco.com |access-date=2012-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717072952/http://www.notfrisco.com/calmem/miller/elk.html |archive-date=2012-07-17 }}</ref> and ''The Battle of [[Castle Crags]],'' draw on these experiences. He was wounded in the cheek and neck with an arrow during this latter battle, recuperating at the Gold Rush-era mining town of [[Portuguese Flat, California|Portuguese Flat]].

He credited her with saving his life, but said she had always been a platonic friend.<ref>

Spending a short time in the mining camps of northern Idaho, Miller found his way to [[Canyon City, Oregon|Canyon City]], Oregon by 1864 where he was elected the third Judge of [[Grant County, Oregon|Grant County]]. His old cabin in Canyon City is still standing.

Miller's exploits included a variety of occupations: mining-camp cook (who came down with [[scurvy]] from only eating what he cooked), lawyer and a judge, newspaper writer, [[Pony Express]] rider, and horse thief. On July 10, 1859, Miller was caught stealing a horse gelding valued at $80, a saddle worth $15, and other items.<ref>Peterson, 40</ref> He was jailed briefly in [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]] for the crime, and various accounts give other incidents of his repeating this crime in California and Oregon.
[[File:Maud Miller (Manhattan Mercury, 1899).png|thumb|Maud Miller]]
Miller earned an estimated $3,000 working as a Pony Express rider, and used the money to move to Oregon. With the help of his friend, Senator [[Joseph Lane]], he became editor of the ''Democratic Register'' in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]],<ref>Marberry, 44</ref> a role he held from March 15 to September 20, 1862.<ref>Peterson, 50</ref> Though no copies survive, it was known as sympathetic to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] until it was forced to shut down<ref>Marberry, 45</ref> because of its treasonable character.<ref name=ea/> That year, Miller married Theresa Dyer on September 12, 1862, in her home four days after meeting her<ref>Frost, 36</ref> in [[Port Orford, Oregon|Port Orford]], Oregon. He had corresponded with her after exchanging poems with her for critique and chasing away a competing suitor.<ref>Marberry, 45–46</ref> She published poetry under the pen name "Minnie Myrtle" and later, as [[Minnie Myrtle Miller]].<ref name=acab>{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Miller, Cincinnatus Heine|year=1900}}</ref> The couple had three children: Maud, George, and Henry, although Miller would later claim the baby Henry was not his own.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1868, Miller paid for the publication of 500 copies of his first book of poetry, ''Specimens''.<ref>Marberry, 55</ref> It was unnoticed and Miller gave away more copies than he sold. Few have survived.<ref>Frost, 55</ref> The author's despair and disappointment was reflected in his second book, ''Joaquin et al.'', the next year.<ref>Lewis, Nathaniel. ''Unsettling the Literary West: Authenticity and Authorship''. University of Nebraska Press, 2003: 98. {{ISBN|0-8032-2938-0}}</ref>

Dyer filed for divorce on April 4, 1870, claiming they had a third child, Henry Mark, the year before and that Miller was "wholly" neglectful.<ref>Frost, 44</ref> The court declared them divorced on April 19 and Dyer was granted custody of the baby while the two older children were left in the care of her mother. Miller was ordered to pay $200 per year in child support.<ref>Frost, 46</ref> Miller believed the divorce prevented him from being nominated for a seat on the [[Oregon Supreme Court]].<ref>Peterson, 58</ref> He never denied her charges that he was neglectful of her and their children and was rarely home.<ref>Marberry, 58–59</ref> He also may have had an affair with actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] shortly into the marriage.<ref>Marberry, 47–48</ref>

===Travels===
[[File:Photograph of Joaquin Miller.jpg|thumb|Joaquin Miller, 1903]]
Miller had sent a copy of ''Joaquin, et al.'' to [[Bret Harte]], who offered advice that he avoid "faults of excess" and encouragingly wrote, "you on your way to become a poet."<ref>Nissen, Axel. ''Bret Harte: Prince and Pauper''. University of Mississippi Press, 2000: 93–94. {{ISBN|978-1-57806-253-9}}</ref> The next summer, July 1870, Miller traveled to [[San Francisco]] with borrowed money and there befriended [[Charles Warren Stoddard]] and [[Ina Coolbrith]]. Stoddard was the first to meet him at the dock and, as he recalled, Miller's first words to him were, "Well, let us go and talk with the poets."<ref>Marberry, 64</ref>

Miller went to England, where he was celebrated as a frontier oddity. There, in May 1871, Miller published ''Songs of the Sierras'', the book which finalized his nickname as the "Poet of the Sierras".<ref>Marberry, 93–94</ref> It was well received by the British press and members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], particularly [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[William Michael Rossetti]].

While in England, he was one of the few Americans invited into the [[Savage Club]] along with [[Julian Hawthorne]], son of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. The younger Hawthorne referred to Miller as "a licensed libertine" but admitted to finding him "charming, amiable, and harmless".<ref>Marberry, 85–86</ref> Rather abruptly, Miller left England in September 1871 and landed in New York. At the encouragement of family, he made his way to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] to visit his dying brother before returning to Oregon; his father died shortly thereafter. Miller eventually settled in California, where he grew fruit and published his poems and other works.

In 1877, Miller adapted his ''First Fam'lies of the Sierras'' into a play, ''The Danites, or, the Heart of the Sierras''. It opened on August 22 in New York with [[McKee Rankin]] as the main character.<ref>Marberry, 158–159</ref> The anti-[[Mormons|Mormon]] play, which featured [[Danite]]s hunting the daughter of one of the murderers of [[Joseph Smith]], became one of the most commercially successful in a series of anti-Mormon dramas at the time. The ''[[Spirit of the Times]]'', however, attributed its success to curious audience members expecting a disastrous failure and instead discovering a good show: "The play proved to possess more than ordinary merit, and if it is not a great work, it is decidedly not a very bad one."<ref>Jones, Megan Sanborn. ''Performing American Identity in Anti-Mormon Melodrama''. Taylor & Francis, 2009: 103. {{ISBN|978-0-415-80059-4}}</ref> ''The Danites'' was extended from a run of only a few days to one of seven straight weeks before moving to another theatre and, ultimately, was performed to such a degree that it rivaled the popularity of ''[[Tom Shows|Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.<ref>Marberry, 159–160</ref> It was published in book form later in 1877.<ref name=Peterson179>Peterson, 179</ref> Miller later admitted that he regretted the anti-Mormon tone.<ref>Marberry, 160</ref>

Miller married for a third time on September 8, 1879 to Abigail Leland, in [[New York City]].

===Later years and death===
[[File:Joaquin Miller 1905.jpg|thumb|left|Miller circa 1905]]
In 1886, Miller published ''The Destruction of Gotham'', a book which was one of the earliest to depict a prostitute as a heroine.<ref name=Hapke21/> That year, he moved to Oakland, California, and built a home for himself he nicknamed "[[Joaquin Miller House|The Abbey]]" on property he called "[[Joaquin Miller Park|The Hights]]" {{sic}}. He remained there until his death in 1913.<ref name=chl>{{cite ohp |id=107 |name=Joaquin Miller Home |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>

Japanese poet [[Yone Noguchi]] came to The Hights in 1894 and spent the next four years there as an unpaid laborer in exchange for room and board. While living there, he published his first book, ''Seen or Unseen; or, Monologues of a Homeless Snail'' (1897). Though he referred to Miller as "the most natural man", Noguchi reflected on those years as his most difficult in the United States and later fictionalized his experience in ''[[The American Diary of a Japanese Girl]]''.<ref>Wyatt, David. ''Five Fires: Race, Catastrophe, and the Shaping of California''. Oxford University Press, 1999: 188. {{ISBN|0-19-512741-2}}</ref>

In 1897, Miller traveled to the [[Yukon]] as a newspaper correspondent.<ref>Marberry, 237</ref> He saw [[Alaska]] for the first time on July 30.<ref>Frost, 110</ref> His dispatches, many of which were written before reaching Alaska, incorrectly implied an easy and inexpensive trip. Miller himself nearly froze to death; two toes were lost to [[frostbite]].<ref>Marberry, 238–242</ref>

Miller died on February 17, 1913, surrounded by friends and family. His last words were recorded as "Take me away; take me away!"<ref name=Peterson179/> The poet had asked to be cremated by friends in the funeral pyre he built at The Hights with no religious ceremony and without being embalmed. His wishes were mostly ignored and the funeral on February 19 drew thousands of curious onlookers.<ref>Marberry, 280–281</ref> The preacher who spoke referred to Miller as "the last of America's great poets."<ref>Frost, 112</ref> On May 23, members of the [[Bohemian Club]] of San Francisco and the Press Club returned to Miller's funeral pyre to burn the urn which contained his ashes, allowing them to scatter. He had left no [[will (law)|will]] and his estate — estimated at $100,000 — was divided between his wife, Abigail and daughter, Juanita.<ref>Marberry, 282–283</ref>

==Critical response and reputation==
[[File:Joaquin Miller later years.jpg|thumb|Miller in later years]]
[[File:Miller cabin14.JPG|thumb|[[Joaquin Miller Cabin]] in Washington, D.C.'s [[Rock Creek Park]]]]
Miller was championed, although not enthusiastically, by [[Bret Harte]] and [[Ambrose Bierce]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}  In his time, Miller was known for his dishonesty and womanizing. Bierce, his friend and contemporary, said of him, "In impugning Mr. Miller's veracity, or rather, in plainly declaring that he has none, I should be sorry to be understood as attributing a graver moral delinquency than he really has. He cannot, or will not, tell the truth, but he never tells a malicious or thrifty falsehood."<ref>{{cite book |last=Gale |first=Robert L. |date=2001 |title=An Ambrose Bierce Companion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWZkmUJEGkQC |location=USA |publisher=Greenwood Press |page=187 |isbn= 9780313311307}}</ref> Miller's response was, "I always wondered why God made Bierce."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Called the "Poet of the Sierras" and the "Byron of the Rockies", he may have been more of a celebrity in England than in his native U.S. Much of his reputation, however, came not from his poetry but from the image he created for himself by capitalizing on the stereotypical image of Western frontiersmen.<ref>Lewis, Nathaniel. ''Unsettling the Literary West: Authenticity and Authorship''. University of Nebraska Press, 2003: 78. {{ISBN|0-8032-2938-0}}</ref> As poet [[Bayard Taylor]] bitterly noted in 1876, British audiences "place the simulated savagery of Joaquin Miller beside the pure and serene muse of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]."<ref>Loving, Jerome. ''Mark Twain: The Adventures of Samuel L. Clemens''. University of California Press, 2010: 234. {{ISBN|978-0-520-25257-8}}</ref> Critics made much of Miller's poor spelling and rhymes; he once rhymed "[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]" and "teeth". [[Henry Cuyler Bunner]] satirized the error in a poem titled "Shake, [[Molière|Mulleary]], and Go-ethe".<ref>Untermeyer, Louis. ''Modern American Poetry''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1921: 64.</ref> Miller himself once admitted, "I'm damned if I could tell the difference between a [[hexameter]] and a [[pentameter]] to save my scalp."<ref>Marberry, 90</ref>

The ''[[Westminster Review]]'' referred to Miller's poetry as "[[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] without the coarseness".<ref>Peterson, 66</ref> For a time, Miller's poem "Columbus" was one of the most widely known American poems, memorized and recited by legions of schoolchildren. Miller is remembered today, among other reasons, for lines from his poem in honor of "Burns and Byron":

:In men whom men condemn as ill
::I find so much of goodness still.
:In men whom men pronounce divine
::I find so much of sin and blot
:I do not dare to draw a line
::Between the two, where God has not.

==Legacy==
A historical marker for his birthplace was unveiled October 10, 1915, on U.S. 27 north of Liberty in Union County, Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoVQAQAAIAAJ&q=joaquin+miller+historic+marker+union+county+indiana&pg=PA52|title = Historical Markers in Indiana, Issue 14|author-link = Indiana Historical Commission|date = 1922|access-date = August 10, 2014|page = Section 3, page 52|last1 = Commission|first1 = Indiana Historical}}</ref> [[Joaquin Miller Cabin]] is located in Washington, DC. The Hights, the Oakland home Miller built at the end of his life, was purchased by the city of Oakland in 1919, and is known as the [[Joaquin Miller House]], located in [[Joaquin Miller Park]].<ref name=chl/> It is a designated [[California Historical Landmark]]. He planted the surrounding trees and he personally built, on the eminence to the north, his own [[funeral pyre]] and monuments dedicated to [[Moses]], General [[John C. Frémont]], and the poets [[Robert Browning]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]. Several schools in California are named for him, including Miller Middle School in San Jose, Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Oakland, and Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Burbank.

In 1965, the actor [[Sean McClory]] was cast as Miller, with [[June Lockhart]] in the role of Ina Coolbrith, in the episode "Magic Locket" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] western series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Ronald W. Reagan]]. In the story line, Coolbrith develops a tenuous friendship with the teen-aged "Dorita Duncan" ([[Kathy Garver]]), later known as the dancer [[Isadora Duncan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556668/combined|title="Magic Locket" on ''Death Valley Days''|date=March 17, 1965|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|access-date=August 22, 2015}}</ref>

Actor George Paulsin portrayed a youthful Joaquin Miller in the ''Death Valley Days'' episode "Early Candle Lighten", hosted by [[Dale Robertson]]. The episode, which aired April 24, 1970, marked Paulsin's first screen appearance and the last of the series' 452 episodes. In the story line, a cook at a gold camp in the [[Arizona Territory]] faces [[hanging]] for stealing nuggets from the miners. His assistant, "Nat Miller", played by Paulsin, thinks he can save his life by bringing the cook's sister from Tucson. It was at this gold camp that Miller perfected his penchant for western poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667335/?ref_=tt_cl_t4|title=George Paulsin|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>

In the 1978 British miniseries ''[[Lillie (TV series)|Lillie]]'', actor [[Bruce Boa]] as Miller startles guests when [[Lillie Langtry]] arrives at a ball by scattering rose petals in her path.  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077042/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt|title=Lillie (TV Mini-Series 1978)|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>
