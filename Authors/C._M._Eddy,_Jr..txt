'''Clifford Martin Eddy Jr.''' ('''C. M. Eddy Jr.'''; January 18, 1896 – November 21, 1967)<ref name=Fenham>Fenham Publishing, [http://fenhampublishing.com/2201.html About the Authors]</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[author]]  known for his [[Horror fiction|horror]], mystery and supernatural [[short story|short stories]]. He is best remembered for his work in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine and his friendship with [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

== Career ==
Eddy was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], on January 18, 1896. He went to [[Classical High School]] in Providence,<ref name=Brown>Brown University Archival & Manuscript Collections Online, [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/bamco/render.php?eadid=ms2008.015&view=eadbiog Historical note] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215122328/http://dl.lib.brown.edu/bamco/render.php?eadid=ms2008.015&view=eadbiog |date=2012-02-15 }}</ref> and as a child was a precocious reader and writer. He continued to be an avid reader and writer, interested in mythology and the occult. According to his wife Muriel, <blockquote>Cliff was always interested in the idea of parallel planes—where life on another level, either astral or otherwise, would be similar to that on earth—or where life might exist, but in another time or another form. He was also fascinated by the themes of [[teleportation]], [[vampirism]], [[ghosts]] and the mystery of unexplained phenomena...he spent hours in the library researching the unusual, the unique, the bizarre.<ref name="C.M. Eddy 1973">C.M. Eddy Jr. ''Exit into Eternity: Tales of the Bizarre and Supernatural'' Providence RI: Oxford Press, Inc, 1973. p. (iii).</ref></blockquote>

=== Horror writer ===
He began his career writing short stories for a broad range of [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] magazines such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'', ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'', and ''Snappy Stories''. His first published tale, "[[s:Sign of the Dragon|Sign of the Dragon]]" (''Mystery Magazine'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/mags/mystery_magazine.html|title=Mystery Magazine/Stories|website=www.philsp.com}}</ref> 1919), was a detective story. (In October 2012 it was released as a standalone e-book.)

Various tales of mystery, ghosts, and song-writing (he himself wrote songs, including "When We Met by the Blue Lagoon", "In My Wonderful Temple of Love", "Dearest of All", "Underneath the Whispering Pine", "Sunset Hour", and "Hello Mister Sunshine (Goodbye, Mister Rain)"), continued to appear through 1925 in various magazines. They included "A Little Bit of Good Luck" (a story about songwriting), ''Munsey's Magazine'', 1920; "Moonshine" (ghost story), ''Action Stories'', 1922; "The Unshorn Lamb (another story about songwriting) ''Snappy Stories'', 1922. Some stories written at this time were unpublished: "Pilgrimage of Peril", "The Vengeful Vision" and "A Solitary Solution" (all 1924) until collected in ''Exit Into Eternity'' (1973).

=== Friendship with H. P. Lovecraft ===
[[File:H. P. Lovecraft Portrait, June 1934.png|thumb|alt=H. P. Lovecraft in June 1934, facing left|H. P. Lovecraft in June 1934]]
The Eddys' first contact with [[H. P. Lovecraft]] occurred as early as 1918;<ref name="Eddy Family manuscript collection">Eddy Family manuscript collection</ref> They first met face to face in August 1923, according to Muriel Eddy being introduced by Eddy's and Lovecraft's mothers,who were both active in the [[women's suffrage]] movement.<ref name="C.M. Eddy 1973"/>

Lovecraft frequently visited the Eddys' home on Second Street in [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]], and later called on them at their home in the [[Fox Point, Providence, Rhode Island|Fox Point]] section of Providence. Eddy was a member of Lovecraft's inner circle of friends and authors, and he and Lovecraft edited each other's works.<ref name=Brown/> Both authors were also investigators for [[Harry Houdini]] and served the magician as [[ghostwriter]]s. The two collaborated on ''The Cancer of Superstition'', ghostwritten for Houdini, but the latter's death in October 1926 curtailed the project. (Notes and surviving fragments were published in ''[[The Dark Brotherhood and Other Pieces]]''.)

Eddy and Lovecraft took scenic walks, including one to the Old Stone Mill in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]; [[August Derleth]] later incorporated notes taken by Lovecraft on this occasion into ''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]'' (1945).

Eddy's wife Muriel typed many of Lovecraft's manuscripts and Lovecraft would often read the stories to the couple. Eddy wrote several stories that were published in [[Weird Tales]] during 1924 and 1925. These were "The Ghost Eater" (a [[werewolf]] tale), 1924; "[[The Loved Dead]]" (about demoniac desire for the dead i.e. [[necrophilia]]), 1924; and "Deaf, Dumb and Blind", a chronicle of Satanic sensations, 1925. Lovecraft's contribution seems to have ranged from making suggestions and perhaps a paragraph change. These tales are collected in ''The Loved Dead and Other Tales''.

Other stories by Eddy which appeared in ''Weird Tales'' during 1924 and 1925 were "Ashes" (an experiment by a chemistry professor), 1924; "With Weapons of Stone" (a story of prehistoric man), 1924; "Arhl-a of the Caves" (another prehistoric man tale); and "The Better Choice" (about a machine for reviving the dead), 1925.<ref name="C.M. Eddy 1973"/> These tales are also included in ''The Loved Dead and Other Tales'' (Fenham Publishing, Narragansett, RI 2008)

=== The Dark Swamp and "Black Noon" ===
On 4 November 1923 Eddy and Lovecraft sought the Dark Swamp, a place of which Lovecraft had heard rumours and which was said to lie "off the Putnam Pike, about halfway between [[Chepachet, Rhode Island]] and [[Putnam, Connecticut]]."<ref>C.M. Eddy Jr. "Walks with H. P. Lovecraft", in ''[[The Dark Brotherhood and Other Pieces]]''; reprint (in French) in ''L'Herne'' No. 12 (1969), the special Lovecraft issue; reprint in Muriel E. Eddy and C.M. Eddy Jr, ''The Gentleman from Angell Street: Memories of H. P. Lovecraft'', Narragansett, RI: Fenham Publishing Co, 2001</ref><ref>See also Lovecraft's ''Selected Letters I'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1965, pp.&nbsp;264–67</ref> The legend surrounding the place (which they never found) seems to have influenced the opening of Lovecraft's story "[[The Colour Out of Space]]" (1927).

The Dark Swamp was also the basis for Eddy's unfinished short story "Black Noon" (1967) (posthumously published in ''Exit into Eternity: Tales of the Bizarre and Supernatural'', see below). The introduction to ''Exit Into Eternity'' explains that Eddy was unable to complete the work due to illness, and died in 1967; also that [[August Derleth]] was intending to finish this work, and perhaps expand it into a full-length novel, but it remained unfinished due to Derleth's death in 1971.<ref>C.M. Eddy Jr. ''Exit into Eternity: Tales of the Bizarre and Supernatural'' Providence RI: Oxford Press, Inc, 1973. p. (iv).</ref> "Black Noon"'s protagonist is a pipe-smoking businessman called Biff Briggs (standing in for Eddy himself  – 'Biff' instead of 'Cliff') who reads pulp magazines in his spare time. After discovering the work of a superb horror writer named Robert Otis Mather (a thinly veiled fictitious version of H. P. Lovecraft) in the new pulp ''Uncanny Stories'' and finding he lives in the same town, Briggs befriends him and becomes a frequent visitor to Mathers' house at 31 Spring Lane, Fenham. (This fictitious town was invented by Eddy and is featured in "The Loved Dead" (1923) and "Deaf, Dumb and Blind" (1924). Mathers (known as Rom for short, due to his initials), is partly cared for by his aunt, Agatha Sessions. Mathers writes a trilogy of novels which seem to have taken him over almost by demonic possession. In the summer, Rom wants to investigate a town called Granville, which is reputed to have numerous haunted houses, and calls on Briggs to transport him. Over a period of two weeks they hold nightly vigils awaiting supernatural manifestations; while no ghosts appear, Rom's life is nearly ended several times by seemingly unnatural accidents.

There is a published letter by Eddy on his relationship with Lovecraft.<ref>''The Providence Journal'' 138, No. 283 (26 Nov 1966), 21 (as "Knew Lovecraft")</ref>

=== Later career ===
Eddy was also a theatrical booking agent for 25 years, promoting shows that featured many famous [[vaudevillians]] and performers of the early twentieth century. In later years, he was a [[proofreader]] for Oxford Press, a principal clerk at the business management office of the Rhode Island State Department of Public Health, secretary treasurer of the Rhode Island Theatrical Booking Agents' Association, and president (1954–1956) and treasurer (1962–67) of the Rhode Island Writers' Guild.<ref name=Brown/> He died on November 21, 1967, aged 71, and is interred at [[Swan Point Cemetery]].<ref name=Fenham/>
