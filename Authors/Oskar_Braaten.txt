==Biography==
Oskar Alexander Braaten was  born in [[Sagene]], a borough of the city of [[Oslo]]. Sagene was one of Norway's oldest industrial areas dating to the mid-19th century. Oskar Braaten attended school in Sagene until he was 15 years old.  In 1899, he was hired by [[antiquarian]] bookstore Bertrand Jensen, where he remained until 1910.

Though born and raised in Oslo, Braaten joined the mostly rural [[nynorsk|landsmål]]-movement.
Braaten is best known for his popular plays and novels depicting the life of factory workers  alongside [[Akerselva]] in Oslo.  He published seven novels between 1917 and 1925. Braaten convey a new image of the Oslo not seen before in literature. Braaten was able to provide  vivid and richly nuanced images of working-class life on the east side of Oslo during a historical period of industrialization. Criticism of injustice and inequality arises, but there is relatively little political tendency in his literary works.<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/kontekst/7105.html ''Oskar Braaten'' (Dagbladet)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129223254/http://www.dagbladet.no/kontekst/7105.html |date=2001-11-29 }}</ref>
