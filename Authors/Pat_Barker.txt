==Personal life==
Barker was born to a working-class family in [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], England, on 8 May 1943.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/pat-barker | title=Pat Barker | publisher=[[British Council]] | work=British Council Literature | access-date=2016-01-26}}</ref> Her mother Moyra died in 2000;<ref name="GuardianAug03" /> her father's identity is unknown. According to ''[[The Times]]'', Moyra became pregnant "after a drunken night out while in [[Women's Royal Naval Service|the Wrens]]." In a social climate where [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimacy]] was regarded with shame, she told people that the resulting child was her sister, rather than her daughter. They lived with Barker's grandmother Alice and step-grandfather William, until her mother married and moved out when Barker was seven.<ref name="Times07">{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1995669.ece | title=Pat Barker's last battle?

Barker, who says she has always been an avid reader, studied international history at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1962-65.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/alumniRelations/newsAndPublications/celebratedAlumni.htm#generated-subheading17 "Celebrated Alumni: UK", ''www.lse.ac.uk'' (2007)] Retrieved 17 January 2008.</ref> After graduating in 1965, she returned home to nurse her grandmother, who died in 1971.

In 1969, she was introduced, in a pub, to [[David Barker (zoologist)|David Barker]], a zoology professor and neurologist 20 years her senior, who left his marriage to live with her. They had two children together, and were married in 1978, after his divorce. Their daughter Anna Barker Ralph is a novelist. Barker was widowed when her husband died in January 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/lifestyle-news/my-place/2010/01/30/pat-barker-61634-25713978/ | title=Novelist Pat Barker | publisher=The Journal | date=30 January 2010 | last=Davies | first=Hannah}}</ref>

==Early work==
In her mid-twenties, Barker began to write fiction. Her first three novels were never published and, she told ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2003, "didn't deserve to be: I was being a sensitive lady novelist, which is not what I am. There's an earthiness and bawdiness in my voice.”<ref name="GuardianAug03" />

Her first published novel was ''[[Union Street (novel)|Union Street]]'' (1982), which consisted of seven interlinked stories about [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|English working class]] women whose lives are circumscribed by poverty and violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4129/Barker-Pat-ricia.html|title=Pat Barker Biography|website=biography.jrank.org}}</ref> For ten years, the manuscript was rejected by publishers as too "bleak and depressing."<ref name="CLinterview">{{cite journal | title=An Interview With Pat Barker | journal=Contemporary Literature | last=Nixon | first=Rob | number=1 | year=2004 | volume=45| pages=vi-21 | doi=10.1353/cli.2004.0010 | doi-access=free }}</ref>  Barker met novelist [[Angela Carter]] at an [[Arvon Foundation]] writers' workshop. Carter liked the book, telling Barker "if they can't sympathise with the women you're creating, then sod their fucking luck," and suggested she send the manuscript to [[Women's writing in English|feminist publisher]] [[Virago Press|Virago]], which accepted it.<ref name="GuardianAug03" /> The ''[[New Statesman]]'' hailed the novel as a "long overdue working class masterpiece,"<ref name="GuardianAug03" /> and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' commented Barker "gives the sense of a writer who has enormous power that she has scarcely had to tap to write a first-rate first novel."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gold |first=Ivan |title=North Country Women|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/09/nnp/barker-union.html |work=The New York Times |date=2 October 1983}}</ref>  ''Union Street'' was later adapted as the Hollywood film ''[[Stanley & Iris]]'' (1990), starring [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Barker has said the film bears little resemblance to her book.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} As of 2003, the novel remained one of Virago's top sellers.<ref name="GuardianAug03" />

Barker's first three novels – ''Union Street'' (1982), ''[[Blow Your House Down]]'' (1984) and ''[[Liza's England]]'' (1986; originally published as ''The Century's Daughter'') – depicted the lives of working-class women in [[Yorkshire]]. ''BookForum'' magazine described them as "full of feeling, violent and sordid, but never exploitative or sensationalistic and rarely sentimental."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/014_05/2049 | title=Chums of War: Pat Barker revisits the trauma of World War I | work=Book Forum | date=February–March 2008 | last=Locke | first=Richard}}</ref> ''Blow Your House Down'' portrays prostitutes living in a [[North of England]] city, who are being stalked by a [[serial killer]].<ref>[https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312240899 Macmillan overview]. Retrieved 25 May 2010.</ref> ''Liza's England'', described by the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' as a "modern-day masterpiece," tracks the life of a working-class woman born at the dawn of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/nov/20/theotherpatbarkertrilogy | title=The other Pat Barker trilogy | work=The Guardian| date=20 November 2007 | last=Webb | first=Belinda}}</ref>

==Regeneration Trilogy==
Following publication of ''Liza's England'', Barker felt she “had got myself into a box where I was strongly typecast as a northern, regional, working class, feminist—label, label, label—novelist. It's not a matter so much of objecting to the labels, but you do get to a point where people are reading the labels instead of the book. And I felt I'd got to that point,” she said in 1992.<ref name="CLinterview" /> She said she was tired of reviewers asking “'but uh, can she do men?' – as though that were some kind of Everest."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www6.nytimes.com/books/99/05/16/specials/barker-ghost.html | title=Shell Shock | work=New York Times Book Review | date=31 December 1995 | last=Pierpont | first=Claudia Roth | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410075919/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/16/specials/barker-ghost.html | archive-date=10 April 2009 | df=dmy-all | url-status=dead}}</ref>

Therefore, she turned her attention to the [[First World War]], which she had always wanted to write about due to her step-grandfather's wartime experiences. Wounded by a [[bayonet]] and left with a scar, he would not speak about the war.<ref name="CLinterview" /> She was inspired to write what is now known as the [[Regeneration Trilogy]]—''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (1991), ''[[The Eye in the Door]]'' (1993), and ''[[The Ghost Road]]'' (1995)—a set of novels that explore the history of the First World War by focusing on the aftermath of trauma. The books are an unusual blend of history and fiction, and Barker draws extensively on the writings of [[First World War poetry#World War I|First World War poets]] and [[William Rivers|W.H.R. Rivers]], an army doctor who worked with [[shell shock|traumatised soldiers]]. The main characters are based on historical figures, such as [[Robert Graves]], Alice and Hettie Roper (pseudonyms for [[Alice Wheeldon]] and her daughter Hettie) with the exception of Billy Prior, whom Barker invented to parallel and contrast with British soldier-poets [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. As the central fictional character, Billy Prior is in all three books.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Dinnage|first=Rosemary|date=1996|title=Death's gray land. (Pat Barker, literature and WW1)|journal=The New York Review of Books|volume=15 February 1996}}</ref>

“I think the whole British psyche is suffering from the contradiction you see in Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, where the war is both terrible and never to be repeated and at the same time experiences derived from it are given enormous value," Barker told ''The Guardian.'' "No one watches war films in quite the way the British do."<ref>{{cite news |last=Ezard|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1993/sep/11/fiction | title=Warring fictions| work=The Guardian | date=11 September 1993}}</ref>

Barker told freelance journalist Wera Reusch that "I think there is a lot to be said for writing about history, because you can sometimes deal with contemporary dilemmas in a way people are more open to because it is presented in this unfamiliar guise, they don't automatically know what they think about it, whereas if you are writing about a contemporary issue on the nose, sometimes all you do is activate people's prejudices. I think the historical novel can be a backdoor into the present which is very valuable."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lolapress.org/elec1/artenglish/reus_e.htm | title=A Backdoor into the Present: An interview with Pat Barker, one of Britain's most successful novelists | last=Reusch | first=Wera | access-date=9 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717232814/http://www.lolapress.org/elec1/artenglish/reus_e.htm | archive-date=17 July 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

''The Regeneration Trilogy'' was extremely well received by critics, with Peter Kemp of the ''Sunday Times'' describing it as "brilliant, intense and subtle",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=Pat |title=Regeneration |date=2008 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-0-14-190643-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiJOGCzq87QC |quote='Brilliant, intense and subtle' Peter Kemp, ''Sunday Times''}}</ref> and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' saying it was "a triumph of an imagination at once poetic and practical."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Ghost Road: 9 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-94191-0 |work=Publishers Weekly |date=4 December 1995}}</ref> The trilogy is described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a fierce meditation on the horrors of war and its psychological aftermath."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/books/29book.html | title=Exploring Small Stories of the Great War | work=The New York Times | date=29 February 2008 | last=Kakutani | first=Michiko}}</ref> Novelist [[Jonathan Coe]] describes it as "one of the few real masterpieces of late 20th century [[British literature|British fiction]]."<ref name="GuardianAug03" /> British author and critic, [[Rosemary Dinnage]] reviewing in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' declared that it has "earned her a well-deserved place in literature"<ref name=":0" /> resulting in its re-issue for the centenary of the First World War. In 1995 the final book in the trilogy, ''The Ghost Road'', won the [[Booker Prize|Booker–McConnell Prize]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lyall |first1=Sarah |title=A Novel by Pat Barker Wins the Booker Prize |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/08/books/a-novel-by-pat-barker-wins-the-booker-prize.html |work=The New York Times |date=8 November 1995}}</ref>

==Awards and recognition==
In 1983, Barker won the [[Fawcett Society]] prize for fiction for ''Union Street''. In 1993 she won the [[Guardian Fiction Prize]] for the ''Eye in the Door'', and in 1995 she won the [[Booker Prize|Booker–McConnell Prize]] for ''The Ghost Road''. In May 1997, Barker was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Open University]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Honoray graduate cumulative list |url=http://www.open.ac.uk/students/ceremonies/sites/www.open.ac.uk.students.ceremonies/files/Honorary%20graduate%20cumulative%20list(1).pdf |website=open.ac.uk}}</ref> In 2000, she was named a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).<ref name="GuardianAug03" />

In the review of her novel ''Toby's Room'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated about her writing, "You don't go to her for fine language, you go to her for plain truths, a driving story line and a clear eye, steadily facing the history of our world".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/10/toby-room-pat-barker-review|title=Toby's Room by Pat Barker – review|last=Lee|first=Hermione|date=2012-08-10|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}</ref>

''[[The Independent]]'' wrote of her, "she is not only a fine chronicler of war but of human nature".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/tobys-room-by-pat-barker-8142192.html|title=Toby's Room, By Pat Barker|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 2019, Barker was shortlisted for the [[Women's Prize for Fiction]] for ''[[The Silence of the Girls]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/29/feminist-retellings-of-history-dominate-2019-womens-prize-shortlist|title=Feminist retellings of history dominate 2019 Women's prize shortlist|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2019-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In their review of the novel, ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Chilling, powerful, audacious . . . A searing twist on ''The Iliad''. Amid the recent slew of rewritings of the great Greek myths and classics, Barker's stands out for its forcefulness of purpose and earthy compassion".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-the-silence-of-the-girls-by-pat-barker-sex-slave-of-the-trojan-war-l80kts52l|title=Review: The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker — sex slave of the Trojan war|last=Murphy|first=Siobhan|date=2018-08-18|work=The Times|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated, "This is an important, powerful, memorable book that invites us to look differently not only at ''The Iliad'' but at our own ways of telling stories about the past and the present, and at how anger and hatred play out in our societies."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/22/silence-of-the-girls-pat-barker-book-review-iliad|title=The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker review – a feminist Iliad|last=Wilson|first=Emily|date=2018-08-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
