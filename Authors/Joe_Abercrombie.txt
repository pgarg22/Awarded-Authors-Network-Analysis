'''Joseph Edward Abercrombie''' is a British [[fantasy]] writer and film editor. He is the author of ''[[The First Law]]'' trilogy, as well as other fantasy books in the same setting and a trilogy of [[young adult novels]]. His novel ''[[Shattered Sea|Half a King]]'' won the 2015 [[Locus Award]] for best young adult book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/06/2015-locus-awards-winners/|title=2015 Locus Awards Winners|work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus Magazine]]|date=27 June 2015|access-date=25 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=locus-2020/>

==Career==
Abercrombie had a job making tea at a television production company before taking up a career as a [[freelance]] [[film editor]]. As a freelance film editor, Abercrombie found himself with more free time than he previously had. With this time, he decided to reconsider a story plot he conceived while attending University.<ref name=locus-2020>{{Cite web |url=https://locusmag.com/2020/01/joe-abercrombie-age-of-madness/ |title=Joe Abercrombie: Age of Madness |work=Locus Magazine |date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://joeabercrombie.com/author/|title=About Joe|website=Joe Abercrombie|type=official website|language=en-US|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref>

Abercrombie began writing ''The Blade Itself'' in 2002, completing it in 2004. It took a year of rejection by publishing agencies before Gillian Redfearn of Gollancz accepted the book for a five-figure deal in 2005 ("a seven-figure deal if you count the pence columns").<ref name=":0"/><ref name=bookseller-2018>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/gollancz-snaps-abercrombies-trilogy-significant-deal-899606 |title=Gollancz scoops Abercrombie's trilogy in 'significant' deal |date=November 28, 2018 |last=Wood |first=Heloise |work=[[The Bookseller]]}}</ref> It was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]] in 2006 and was followed in the succeeding two years by two other books in the trilogy, by the titles of ''Before They Are Hanged'' and ''Last Argument of Kings'', respectively.<ref name=guardian-2019/> In 2008, Joe Abercrombie was a finalist for the John W. Campbell award for Best New Writer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfadb.com/John_W_Campbell_Award_for_Best_New_Writer_2008 |title=John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer 2008 |date=May 23, 2014 |work=Science Fiction Awards Database |publisher=Locus Science Fiction Foundation}}</ref> That same year Abercrombie was one of the contributors to the BBC ''Worlds of Fantasy'' series, alongside other contributors such as [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[China Miéville]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p040pw15|title=BBC Four - Sleuths, Spies & Sorcerers: Andrew Marr's Paperback Heroes, Fantasy|work=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref> In 2009, Abercrombie released the novel ''Best Served Cold''.  It is set in the same world as The First Law Trilogy but is a stand-alone novel.  He followed with ''The Heroes ''(2011) and ''Red Country'' (2012), both again set in the world of the First Law Trilogy. The three standalone novels were later collected into an omnibus edition under the name ''The Great Leveller''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joeabercrombie.com/books/the-great-leveller/ |title=The Great Leveller |work=Joe Abercrombie |type=official website |access-date=August 15, 2021}}</ref>

In 2011, Abercrombie signed a deal with Gollancz for four more books set in the First Law world. In 2013, [[HarperCollins]]' fantasy and children's imprints acquired the rights to three books by Abercrombie, aimed at younger readers. The three standalone but interconnected novels were released as the ''[[Shattered Sea]]'' trilogy.<ref name=bookseller-2018/>

==Personal life==
Abercrombie was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire]], [[England]]. He was educated at [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]] and [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]], where he studied [[psychology]].<ref name=":0" /> He has a wife, Lou.<ref name=guardian-2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/17/joe-abercrombie-you-can-get-women-into-any-story-if-you-think-about-it-for-10-seconds|title=Joe Abercrombie: 'I think the combination of violence and humour wasn't an immediate easy sell'|work=The Guardian|first=Alison |last=Flood |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' magazine, Abercrombie stated that video games have been a big influence on his writing, including early interest in [[interactive fiction|text-based adventure games]] and historically based realtime strategy games such as ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' and ''[[Age of Empires]]''.
