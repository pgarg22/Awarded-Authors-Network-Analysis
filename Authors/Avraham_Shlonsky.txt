'''Avraham Shlonsky''' (March 6, 1900 – May 18, 1973; {{lang-he|אברהם שלונסקי}}; {{lang-ru|Авраам Шлёнский}}) was a significant and dynamic [[Israel]]i poet and [[editing|editor]] born in the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Authorial Fictions: Literary and Public Personas in Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Literature|author1=Brenner, N.R.|author2=University of California, Berkeley|date=2008|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|isbn=9780549836926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUhSqwiKY2QC&pg=PA97|page=97|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>

He was influential in the development of modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and its literature in Israel through his many acclaimed [[translations]] of literary classics, particularly from Russian, as well as his own original Hebrew children's classics. Known for his humor, Shlonsky earned the nickname "'''Lashonsky'''" from the wisecrackers of his generation (''lashon'' means "tongue", i.e., "language") for his unusually clever and astute innovations in the newly evolving Hebrew language.

== Biography==
Avraham Shlonsky was born to a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] family in Kryukovo ([[Poltava]] ''[[guberniya]]'', now a part of [[Kremenchuk]], Ukraine). His father, Tuvia, was a [[Chabad]] Hasid, and his mother, Tzippora, was a Russian revolutionary. When she was pregnant with her sixth child, she hid illegal posters on her body. Five-year-old Avraham informed on his mother, leading to her arrest. Four of his siblings were prodigies.<ref name="Biography/The founding father">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/books/biography-the-founding-father-1.361063|publisher=haaretz.com|title=Biography / The founding father - Haaretz - Israel News &#124; Haaretz.com |accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref> His younger sister was composer and pianist [[Verdina Shlonsky]]. In 1913, when Shlonsky was 13, he was sent to [[Palestine (region)#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]] to study at the prestigious [[Herzliya Hebrew High School]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. When the First World War broke out, he returned to Ukraine.<ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=The Modern Hebrew Poem Itself|author=Burnshaw, S.|date=2003|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=9780814324851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDG6K8lPphIC&pg=PA82|page=82|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>

In 1921, the whole family moved to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Tuvia Shlonsky worked as a warehouse manager and bookkeeper in the Shemen factory in [[Haifa]].<ref name="Biography/The founding father"/> Avraham was a manual laborer, paving roads and working in construction along with other members of the [[Third Aliyah]]. He joined [[Gdud Ha'avoda]] and helped to establish [[Kibbutz]] [[Ein Harod]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]]. He married Lucia but conducted a secret affair with Mira Horowitz, the wife of a friend and colleague. She had a child with him in 1936.<ref name="Biography/The founding father"/>

Avraham Shlonsky died in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1973.<ref name="google3">{{cite book|title=Judaism in a secular age: an anthology of secular humanistic Jewish thought|author1=Kogel, R.|author2=Katz, Z.|author3=International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism|date=1995|publisher=KTAV Pub.

==Literary career==
[[Image:Avraham Shlonsky 1936.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Avraham Shlonsky, 1936]]
Shlonsky published his first poem in 1919 in the newspaper ''[[Ha-Shiloaḥ|Ha-Shiloah]]''. He contributed to Jewish cultural life with songs for satirical stage productions, as well as the [[Purim]] holiday costume balls that were a tradition in early Tel Aviv. Even at this early stage in his career as a poet, he showed a tendency for witty writing, incorporating linguistic innovations in the revived and developing Hebrew language. During this period, he edited the literary columns of several newspapers.

Gradually, he became the representative of the "rebel" group that rebelled against the poetry of [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik|Bialik]] and his generation, expressing a particular aversion to what was seen as their characteristic clichés. The new group tried to create a vibrant, youthful, lively poetry, and not perpetuate what they saw as being something [[second-hand]] from the literary establishment. For years, perhaps as a result of this stance, Shlonsky's poetry was not taught in schools alongside the classic poems of Bialik, [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]], [[David Shimoni]], and others.<ref name="google4">{{cite book|title=A New Sound in Hebrew Poetry: Poetics, Politics, Accent|author=Segal, M.|date=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253003584|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkLK7khFnYkC&pg=PA100|page=100|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>

In 1933 Shlonsky founded the literary weekly ''Turim'', which was identified with the "Yachdav" society in which major poets [[Natan Alterman]] and [[Leah Goldberg]] were also members. As an editor, Shlonsky gave aspiring poets an opportunity to publish their poems. [[Dahlia Ravikovitch]] merited one such opportunity when her first poem was published in the literary quarterly ''Orlogin'' edited by Shlonsky.<ref name="google5">{{cite book|title=Israel: The First Decade of Independence|author1=Troen, S.I.|author2=Lucas, N.|date=1995|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780791422595|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z73ADzNJAMC&pg=PA325|page=325|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>

Shlonsky was noted for his sensitive activism on behalf of [[Boris Gaponov]]. Gaponov, as editor of the [[Communist]] Party daily in an auto plant in Soviet Georgia, translated the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n epic ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' by [[Shota Rustaveli]] into Hebrew. Shlonsky orchestrated the publication of this translation in Israel, and was among those who worked to enable Gaponov to immigrate to Israel. When Gaponov, who had learned Hebrew by listening to Israel Radio broadcasts, finally immigrated to Israel he was already very ill and close to death. Israeli television viewers of the time remember the image of Shlonsky stroking Gaponov's head in a loving, fatherly manner, as the latter lay on his sickbed.

Despite his reputation for comic wit, Shlonsky did not shrink from the tragic situation around him, but rather expressed it in his works. In the poem "Distress" he laments the fate of the victims of the [[First World War]] and of the Jews who suffered from [[pogrom]]s in Ukraine during the Bolshevik revolution.<ref name="google6">{{cite book|title=Authorial Fictions: Literary and Public Personas in Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Literature|author1=Brenner, N.R.|author2=University of California, Berkeley|date=2008|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|isbn=9780549836926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUhSqwiKY2QC&pg=PA238|page=238|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>

During [[the Holocaust]], he published a collection of verse titled ''ממחשכים'' (''From Concealing Shadows'') in which he expressed his feelings from that darkest period in human history. He particularly lamented the fate of the Jews in a diseased Europe.[[File:שלונסקי קבר.jpg|thumb|Shlonsky's headstone in the Writers' Section at Kiryat Shaul cemetery, beside that of Nathan Alterman]]

== Awards ==
* In 1946, Shlonsky received the [[Tchernichovsky Prize]] for exemplary translation, for his translations of the novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' by [[Alexander Pushkin]] and the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].
* In 1959, he was awarded the [[Bialik Prize]] for [[Hebrew literature|literature]] (jointly with [[Eliezer Steinman]]).<ref name=bialik>{{Cite web|title=List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933–2004 (in Hebrew), Tel Aviv Municipality website |url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143811/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-17 }}</ref>
* In 1967, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for literature.<ref name=prize>{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site – Recipients in 1967 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashkag/Tashlab_Tashkag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashkaz}}</ref>

== Works ==
His collection of verse ''Rough Stones'' exemplifies his work as a mature poet. ''Poems from the Long Corridor'' is a collection of reflections on the nature of life and death.

Shlonsky is also considered among the finest Hebrew children's poets, for books such as ''Mickey Who?'' and ''Me and Tali in Lhama Country''.

The play ''Utzli-Gutzli'', about the dwarf [[Rumpelstiltskin]] of German legend, became a classic among Hebrew children's plays. In Shlonsky's translation for the stage, all of the monologues and dialogues are spoken in rhyme. They incorporate sophisticated wordplay using the Hebrew language at a high level. The following example from ''Utzli-Gutzli'' is presented with a transliteration, placing accents on stressed syllables. An unauthorized translation follows.

{|

| dir="rtl" | ולא חסים על הכיסים!
|}

: Every city, province, town, learn the first rule: pay the crown!
: Tax and tariff, fee and fare, not a pocket shall you spare!

In the translation of foreign-language works, Shlonsky's uniqueness is evident. The characteristic Shlonskian style is recognizable from the very first lines of each work and continues to be greatly admired by writers and readers of Hebrew literature. Shlonsky translated many of the world's best known classics: [[William Shakespeare]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Romain Rolland]], and others.

In his distinguished translation of ''[[Hamlet]]'', which a score of Hebrew translators had already tackled, Shlonsky's distinctive language is again evident. He translated Shakespeare from Russian, as he was not a master of English. Yet translating at second hand did not mar the quality of his result. When Hamlet tells his mother Gertrude not to sleep with his uncle Claudius, who murdered his father, Shlonsky uses the consonance ''min`i dodayikh midodi'': "withhold your love from my uncle", where the unusual word ''dodayikh'' (your love) evokes the [[Song of Solomon]]. The conventional translation is ''al ta`ali al yetzu`ei dodi'' (do not go upon my uncle's couch).

===Individual poems===
*"[[Toil (Shlonsky)|Toil]]" (1928)

== Selected puns attributed ==
* When some firm-breasted young women passed by, he let slip, "Here's the latest, leading with the top story" (in literal translation, here's the news / new women, chief part foremost).
* On the ''Matate'' Theater: "the bit of tea (''me`at ha-te'') left over from the kettle" (''kumkum'', the name of the previous theater).
* To a lass who wanted to present him with a flower (''perach''): "I'll gladly accept your soft mouth (''pe rakh'')!" When she tried to explain that she meant ''-rach'' with a ''chet'' (the letter of the Hebrew alphabet), he replied "I'll take the sin (the word ''chet'') upon myself!" (an allusion to Romeo and Juliet, Act I, Scene 5).

== Selected coinages attributed ==
*derekh-agav (intentional misspelling of the original phrase, meaning 'by the way'; in Shlonsky's version, it means 'the way of longing'): ''flirt''.
* someone who goes around with a transistor radio glued to one ear: ''radiot''.
* being cheated on by a woman for the first time: ''keren hayesod''. The phrase, literally "The Foundation Fund", is the Hebrew name of the [[Keren Hayesod|United Israel Appeal]]. But the word ''keren'' (fund) can also mean "horn" as in [[cuckold]]ry—or as in the [[Moses#Michelangelo's statue|horned Moses]] of art history.
* being cheated on by a woman habitually: ''keren kayemet'' (the [[Jewish National Fund]], where ''kayemet'' means "enduring").
* the Ararat (אררט) café in early Tel Aviv, where penniless writers gathered: It's an acronym for "''Ani Rotze Rak Te'' (אני רוצה רק תה, I only want tea)." (Misspelled)
* the eagerness of literary folk for prizes: prize-titution (''prastitutzia'').
