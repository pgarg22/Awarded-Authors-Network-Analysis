'The Realistic Joneses' progresses in a series of short scenes that have the shape and rhythms of sketches on ''Saturday Night Live'' rather than those of a traditional play. (Most are followed by quick blackouts.) And while the Joneses—all four of them—have all the aspects of normal folks, as their names would suggest, they also possess an uncanny otherness expressed through their stylized, disordered way of communicating. ... But for all Mr. Eno’s quirks, his words cut to the heart of how we muddle through the worst life can bring."<ref>Isherwood, Charles.

==Literary background==
On 5 April 2014, ''The Economist'' magazine commented on the comparison of Eno to [[Samuel Beckett]] stating: "(Eno) is also quick to acknowledge Beckett's influence, less for the writer's formal inventiveness than for his 'simple human stuff'. For example, he cites the line in 'Endgame' when Hamm declares, 'Get out of here and love one another.'"<ref>''The Economist'', 5 April 2014, pp75-76.</ref> In response to a query by the critic Jonathan Kalb, he wrote in 2006 that "It would be good for the theatre and for the world at large if there were more signs of [Beckett's] influence--his humaneness, invention, and humility."<ref>Kalb, Jonathan, "American Playwrights on Beckett," PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art, Vol. 29, No. 1 (January 2007).</ref>

==Awards and honors==
He is a Helen Merrill Playwriting Fellow, a recipient of the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and an [[Edward F. Albee Foundation, Inc.|Edward F. Albee Foundation Fellow]]. In 2004, he was awarded the first [[Marian Seldes]]/Garson Kanin Fellowship by the Theater Hall of Fame.<ref name=biostep>[http://www.steppenwolf.org/Plays-Events/productions/bio.aspx?id=507&crewId=2058 "Artist Bio"] steppenwolf.org, accessed January 8, 2014</ref>
