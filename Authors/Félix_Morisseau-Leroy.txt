'''Félix Morisseau-Leroy''' (13 March 1912 &ndash; 5 September 1998), was a [[Haiti]]an writer who used [[Haitian Creole]] to write poetry and plays, the first significant writer to do so. By 1961 he succeeded in having Creole recognized as an official language of Haiti, after expanding its teaching in schools and use in creative literature. Morisseau also published works on [[French language|French]], [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Haitian French]] literature.  He worked internationally, encouraging the development of national literature in post-colonial [[Ghana]] and [[Senegal]].  In 1981 he settled in [[Miami, Florida]], where he was influential in uniting the Haitian community around Creole and encouraged its study in academia.

==Early life and education ==
Born in [[Grand Gosier]], Haiti, in 1912 to an educated, well-to-do [[mulatto]] family, Morisseau-Leroy studied in nearby [[Jacmel]], where he was educated in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].  There he met his future wife Renée, who admired his skills as a horseman.<ref name="caistor">Nick Caistor, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-felix-morisseau-leroy-1197284.html "Obituary: Felix Morisseau-Leroy"], ''The Independent'', London, 11 September 1998, accessed 28 March 2019.</ref>

==Marriage and family==
Morisseau-Leroy married Renée in Jacmel, and always said she inspired his poetry.  They had two sons and a daughter.<ref name="caistor"/>

==Career==
After returning from the US to Haiti, he taught in the capital [[Port-au-Prince]].<ref name="caistor"/>  He began to pay more attention to the Creole of the streets and to think of its power as a written language to unite the country.  At that time, French was used by the educated classes, and Creole was the language of the common people.<ref name="caistor"/> 

Morisseau-Leroy taught literature and theater, and also worked as a writer and journalist.  He was appointed to political offices in government, including director in the Haitian [[Ministry of Public Instruction]] and General Director of National Education.

Known informally as "Moriso", he was a father of the [[Creole Renaissance]].  He promoted the movement to stimulate use of Haitian Creole (or Kreyòl) language and establish its legitimacy for creative use in literature and culture.  As this was the only language of the majority of the people, who were mostly rural, Morisseau believed strongly in using Creole as a means of uniting the country.  Morisseau translated the classical Greek tragedy ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' into Creole as ''Wa Kreyon'', at the same time adapting the characters and context for Haitian culture, for instance, featuring a Vodoun priest.<ref name="lehman">[http://ile-en-ile.org/morisolewa/ "Biography of Felix Morisseau-Leroy"], in French, with bibliography, Lehman Library, City University of New York, accessed 28 March 2019.</ref>

The rise of [[Papa Doc Duvalier]]'s autocratic regime shut down many of the most promising writers, as he was threatened by free expression.  According to one story, Duvalier sent armed forces to escort Morisseau to the airport and force him into exile because he was offended by his work.  Only the fact that they were former classmates and friends probably saved Morisseau's life.<ref name="geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com">[http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/2006/03/happy-birthday-flix-morisseau-leroy.html "Happy Birthday, Felix Morrisseau-Leroy"], 13 March 2006, Geoffrey Philp blog spot, accessed 14 August 2008.</ref>

Morisseau-Leroy was invited to France to produce ''Wa Kreyon'' in Paris.<ref name="caistor"/>  While there he met major figures in the [[Négritude]] movement, such as [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Leopold Senghor]].  They encouraged his work and also influenced his future teaching in nations of [[Africa]] and in the United States.<ref name="geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com"/>

He next moved to [[Ghana]], where he taught and headed the national theatre as colonialism was ending.  He taught in Ghana for seven years, then moved to [[Senegal]], where he taught until 1979.  Other Haitian writers exiled by Duvalier to Senegal included [[Jean Brierre]], [[Gérard Chenet]] and [[Roger Dorsinville]].<ref name="lehman" />

Morisseau-Leroy last moved in 1981 to [[Miami, Florida]], where there was a large Haitian community.  He settled with his family there for the rest of his life. In teaching Haitian Creole and literature, he helped unite immigrants and their descendants around their heritage.  He wrote a weekly column carried in the periodical ''[[Haïti en Marche]]''.  In later years, his mop of a white-haired [[Afro]] became a trademark, as was his sense of humor.

In 1991, his work was included in a collection of English translations (by Jeffrey Knapp, Marie Marcelle Buteau Racine, Marie Helene Laraque, and Suze Baron), ''Haitiad and Oddities'', published in Miami.  It contains "Natif Natal," originally written in French, and 12 poems, including "Boat People," "Thank You Dessalines," and "Water," originally written in Haitian Creole. In 1995 he published his last work, an epic novel of Haiti of which he was proud, entitled ''Les Djons d'Haiti Tom'' (''People of Haiti with Courage'').<ref name="caistor"/>

He died in Miami in 1998.
