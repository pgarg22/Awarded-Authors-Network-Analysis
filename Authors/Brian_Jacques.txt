'''James Brian Jacques''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|k|s}}, as in "Jakes";<ref name="Official Bio" /> 15 June 1939 – 5 February 2011<!-- This is not a typo. He died on the 5th, as shown in the obituary which ran on the 7th. -->) was an English novelist known for his ''[[Redwall]]'' series of novels and ''[[Castaways of the Flying Dutchman]]'' series. He also completed two collections of short stories entitled ''[[The Ribbajack|The Ribbajack & Other Curious Yarns]]'' and ''[[Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales]]''.

==Early years==
Brian Jacques was born in [[Liverpool]] on 15 June 1939.<ref name="Scholastic Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/contributor.jsp?id=3222|title=Brian Jacques Biography|publisher=Scholastic|access-date=2008-12-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016163401/http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/contributor.jsp?id=3222|archive-date=16 October 2007}}</ref> His parents were James Alfred Jacques, a haulage contractor, and Ellen Ryan.<ref name="Official Bio">[http://www.redwall.org/about.html Brian Jacques' Biography], ''Redwall Abbey''. Retrieved 2008-06-20</ref><ref name="Ancestry">[http://ancestry.co.uk Ancestry].</ref>

Jacques grew up in [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]] near to the [[Liverpool Docks]]. He was known by his middle name, Brian, because his father and a brother were also named James. His father loved literature and read his boys adventure stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], but also ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' with its cast of animals.  Jacques showed early writing talent. At age ten, assigned to write an animal story, he wrote about a [[Egyptian plover|bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth]]. His teacher could not believe that a ten-year-old wrote it, and caned the boy for refusing to admit copying the story.<ref name="Official Bio" /> He had always loved to write, but only then did he realize the extent of his abilities.  He attended St John's School until age fifteen, when he left school (as was usual at the time) and set out to find adventure as a merchant sailor. His book ''[[Redwall (novel)|Redwall]]'' was written for his "special friends",<ref name="Official Bio"/> the children of the [[Royal School for the Blind (Liverpool)|Royal Wavertree School for the Blind]], whom he first met while working as a milkman. He began to spend time with the children, reading books to them. However, he became dissatisfied with the state of children's literature, with too much adolescent angst and not enough magic,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and eventually began to write stories for them. He is known for the very descriptive style of his novels, which emphasize sound, smell, taste, gravity, balance, temperature, touch, and kinesthetics, not just visual sensations.

== Career ==
His work gained acclaim when [[Alan Durband]], his former English teacher (who also taught [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]]), showed it to his (Durband's) own publisher without telling Jacques.<ref name="Official Bio" /> Durband told his publishers: "This is the finest children's tale I've ever read, and you'd be foolish not to publish it". Soon after, Jacques was summoned to London to meet with the publishers, who gave him a contract to write the next five books in the series.

''Redwall'' was an 800-page handwritten manuscript.<ref name="latimes">[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/13/local/la-me-brian-jacques-20110213 Brian Jacques dies at 71; author of 'Redwall' children's fantasy novels] ''latimes.com''. Retrieved February 2013.</ref> It is now common for children's books to have 350 pages, and the ''Harry Potter'' books far exceed that, but in those days 200 was regarded as the maximum that would hold a child's attention.<ref name="latimes" /> It set the tone for the whole series, centered on the triumph of good over evil, with peaceful mice, badgers, voles, hares, moles and squirrels defeating rats, weasels, ferrets, snakes and stoats. He did not shy away from the reality of battle, and many of the "good" creatures die.  
''Redwall'' alludes to the surrounding human civilization, for example with a scene featuring a horse-drawn cart. The subsequent books ignore humans completely, portraying an Iron Age society from the misty past building castles, bridges and ships to the scale of forest creatures, writing their own literature and drawing their own maps. Jacques was highly involved in the audio books of his work, even enlisting his sons and others to voice Redwall inhabitants. Jacques said that the characters in his stories are based on people he has encountered. He based Gonff, the self-proclaimed "Prince of Mousethieves", on himself when he was a young boy hanging around the docks of Liverpool.<ref name="Official FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.redwall.org/faq.php|title=Q&A with Brian Jacques|access-date=2008-12-20}}</ref> Mariel is based on his granddaughter. Constance the Badgermum is based on his maternal grandmother. Other characters are a combination of many of the people he has met in his travels.<ref name="Official FAQ"/>

Jacques remembered well the rationing during and after the war, when he fantasized about the dishes in his aunt's illustrated Victorian cookbook. Groaning boards spread with sumptuous feasts are common scenes in his stories, described in mouth-watering detail. The war also informed his depictions of gruesome battles.  Jacques was known to prefer old-fashioned ways; he always preferred an old typewriter as being more reliable than a computer, and he was known to be not fond of videogames and other modern technology, though he allowed an animated television series to be produced which he introduced himself each episode on PBS and answered children's questions after the cartoon ended. The Teletoon airings omitted that. He never felt that he fit the image of a "writer sitting in his garden."<ref name="nytimes" /> Nonetheless, he was deeply touched by his success at reaching children. He was also pleased to be recognized by the people of Liverpool.  His novels have sold more than twenty million copies worldwide<ref name="latimes" /> and have been published in twenty-eight languages.

== Other interests ==
Jacques also had musical interests. In the 1960s he formed a folk music band, the Liverpool Fishermen, with two of his brothers. He hosted a radio show called ''[[Jakestown]]'' on [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] from 1986 to 2006, featuring selections from his favourite operas.<ref name="Scholastic Bio" />

== Recognition ==
In June 2005, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref name="Official Bio"/> A prize was created at [[Bristol Grammar School]], known as the 'Brian Jacques Award for Most Improved Creative Writing', and is awarded to a student in Year 8, as book tokens.<ref name="Bristol Review of Books">[http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/Downloads/Senior-School/BGS-150-not-out.aspx BGS: 150 and not out] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604062919/http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/Downloads/Senior-School/BGS-150-not-out.aspx# |date=4 June 2016 }} - accessed May 2016</ref>

== Family ==
He lived with his wife, Maureen, in Liverpool. Jacques and his wife had two sons, now adults, David and Marc, and grandchildren Hannah and Anthony. Marc is a [[joiner]] and bricklayer, while David is a muralist and professor of art.<ref name="Official Bio"  /><ref name="nytimes">[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/arts/09jacques.html?_r=1& Brian Jacques, Writer of Redwall Series, Dies at 71] ''nytimes.com''.

== Death ==
