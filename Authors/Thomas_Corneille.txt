'''Thomas Corneille''' (20 August 1625 – 8 December 1709) was a French [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] and [[dramatist]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Rouen]] some nineteen years after his brother [[Pierre Corneille|Pierre]], the "great Corneille", Thomas's skill as a poet seems to have shown itself early. At the age of fifteen he composed a play in [[Latin]] which was performed by his fellow-pupils at the [[Jesuit]] school in Rouen, the Collège de Bourbon (now the [[Lycée Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lycée Pierre Corneille]]). His first play in the [[French language]], ''Les Engagements du hasard'', was probably first performed at the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]] in 1647, although not published until 1656.<ref>Clarke 2007, pp. 8–11.</ref> ''Le Feint Astrologue'', imitated from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], and itself imitated in [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] ''[[An Evening's Love]]'', came the following year.

After his brother's death, Thomas succeeded his vacant chair in the [[Académie française]]. He then turned his attention to [[philology]], producing a new edition of the ''Remarques'' of [[CF Vaugelas]] in 1687. His ''Le Dictionnaire des Arts et des Sciences'' first appeared in 1694 as a supplement to the first edition of  ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|Le dictionnaire de l'Academie françoise]]''—also published that year—and as a competitor to [[Antoine Furetière|Furetière]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire universel|Dictionaire universel]]'' of 1690.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corneille |first1=Thomas |title=Le Dictionnaire des Arts et des Sciences |date=1694 |publisher=la veuve de Jean-Baptiste Coignard; and Jean Baptiste Coignard fils |location=Paris |edition=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=l'Académie françoise |title=Le dictionnaire de l'Académie françoise |date=1694 |publisher=Jean Baptiste Coignard fils |location=Paris |edition=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Collison |first1=Robert |title=Encyclopaedias: Their History throughout the Ages |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediasth0000coll |url-access=registration |date=1964 |publisher=Hafner Publishing |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediasth0000coll/page/95 95]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Considine |first1=John |title=Academy Dictionaries 1600-1800 |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=58–59}}</ref> Corneille's ''Dictionnaire'' is regarded by Kafker as one of the nine ''Notable encyclopaedias of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'' that preceded [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kafker |first1=Frank A. |title=Notable encyclopaedias of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Nine predecessors of the Encyclopédie |date=1981 |publisher=Voltaire Foundation |location=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Diderot |first1=Denis |last2=d'Alembert |first2=Jean le Rond |title=Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers |date=1751–1772 |publisher=Antoine-Claude Briasson; Michel-Antoine David l'aîné; André-François Le Breton; and Laurent Durand |location=Paris |edition=1}}</ref>

A complete translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' (he had published six books with the ''Heroic Epistles'' some years previously) followed in 1697.

In 1704 he lost his sight and was constituted a "veteran," a dignity which gave him the privileges of an academician, while exempting him from the duties. He did not allow his blindness to put a stop to his work, however, and in 1708 produced a large ''Dictionnaire universel géographique et historique'' in three volumes folio. This was his last major work. He died at [[Les Andelys]] at the age of eighty-four.

== Place in French Literature ==
Thomas Corneille has often been regarded as one who, but for his surname, would merit no notice. Others feel he was unlucky in having a brother ([[Pierre Corneille]]) who outshone him, as he would have outshone almost anyone else. 
In 1761 [[Voltaire]] wrote of Thomas Corneille: ‘si vous exceptez [[Jean Racine|Racine]], auquel il ne faut comparer personne, il était le seul de son temps qui fût digne d’être le premier au-dessous de son frère' <ref>Voltaire, "Commentaires sur Corneille", in ''Oeuvres complètes de Voltaire'', LIII-LV, ed. David Williams (Banbury, Voltaire Foundation, 1973–1975), LV, p. 979.</ref> (if you except Racine, to whom nobody can be compared, he was the first of his time who was worthy to be behind his brother).

The brothers were close, and practically lived together. Of his forty-two plays (the highest number assigned to him), the last edition of his complete works contains only thirty-two dramas, but he wrote several in collaboration with other authors. Two are usually reprinted as his masterpieces at the end of his brother's selected works. These are ''Ariane'' (1672) and the ''Le Comte d'Essex (The Earl of Essex (1678))'', in the former of which [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]] attained success. (An oil painting depicting a scene from Le Comte d'Essex is in the [[Hermitage Museum]].) But of ''Laodice'', ''Camma'', ''Stilico'' and some other pieces, Pierre Corneille himself said that "he wished he had written them," and he was not wont to speak lightly. ''[[Camma]]'' (1661, on the same story as [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''Cup'') deserves special notice.

Thomas Corneille is remarkable in the literary gossip-history of his time. His ''Timocrate'' boasted of the longest run (80 nights) recorded of any play during the century. For ''La Devineresse'', he and his cowriter [[Jean Donneau de Visé]], founder of the ''[[Mercure galant]]'' (to which Thomas contributed), received over 6,000 [[French livre|livres]], the largest sum known to have been paid during that period. Lastly, one of his pieces (''Le Baron des Fondrières'') claims the honor of being the first which was booed off the stage. Thomas Corneille is also remarkable for having excelled in almost all dramatic genres of his time, including the new and innovative genres that were the ''[[pièce à machines]]'' and [[French opera|opera]] at the time. His machine play ''Circé'' was among the most successful of the century. His three opera librettoes, ''[[Psyché (opera)|Psyché]]'' (1678), ''[[Bellérophon]]'' (1679) and ''[[Médée (Charpentier)|Médée]]'' (1693) make him, next to [[Philippe Quinault]] and [[Jean Galbert de Campistron]], one of the most important French librettists of the seventeenth century.

In a letter to her father, shortly before her execution, [[Charlotte Corday]] quotes Thomas Corneille: "Le Crime fait la honte, et non pas l’échafaud!" (The crime causes the shame, and not the scaffold!).
