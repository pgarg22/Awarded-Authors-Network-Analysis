==Early life and education==
Tobolowsky was born in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], into a [[Jewish]] family from Russia and Poland.<ref>[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/235392/unorthodox-episode-92-stephen-tobolowsky-jewish-in-hollywood-stephen-marche Tablet Magazine: "The Stephen Show Episode 92: Actor Stephen Tobolowsky tells us what it’s really like being Jewish in Hollywood and Esquire writer Stephen Marche breaks down modern gender dynamics" by Stephen Marche] retrieved June 2, 2017</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}

He grew up creating imaginative games with his brother, and his story ''The Dangerous Animals Club'' paints a picture of how unsupervised children in the 20th century could amuse themselves.  He showed talent at baseball, but a serious childhood illness stopped his career as an athlete before it got started.  He graduated from [[Justin F. Kimball High School]] and [[Southern Methodist University]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Currey|first=Mason|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2012/10/stephen_tobolowsky_what_i_learned_in_the_seventh_grade_.single.html|title=Stephen Tobolowsky: What I learned in the seventh grade|date=October 3, 2012|publisher=Slate.com |access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Susan|url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/character-actor-stephen-tobolowsky-writes-his-first-book/Content?oid=4226473|title=Character actor Stephen Tobolowsky writes his first book|work=Charleston City Paper|date=November 7, 2012|access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref> He received a master's degree from the [[University of Illinois]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uofi150.news-gazette.com/people/stephen-tobolowsky|title=Stephen Tobolowsky|access-date=November 23, 2018}}</ref>

Another cousin (and Ira's brother) is the sculptor George Tobolowsky.<ref name="dmag"/>

Stephen Tobolowsky also played in a band called A Cast of Thousands, which had two songs, "Red, White and Blue" and "I Heard a Voice Last Night", on a compilation of local Dallas bands called ''A New Hi''. Both of these songs featured Steve Vaughan on guitar, who would be later known as [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/Various-A-New-Hi-Dallas-1971-Part-1/release/5828010 ''A New Hi (Dallas 1971)'']</ref>

==Career==
Tobolowsky has appeared in over 200 films, plus many television projects.

He directed one movie, ''[[Two Idiots in Hollywood]]'', based on his play of the same name.
