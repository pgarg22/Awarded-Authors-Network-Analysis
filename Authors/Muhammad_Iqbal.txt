Born and raised in [[Sialkot]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an ethnic [[Kashmiri Muslims|Kashmiri Muslim]] family, Iqbal completed his B.A. and M.A. at the [[Government College Lahore]].  He taught [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at the [[Oriental College]], Lahore from 1899 until 1903. During this time, he wrote prolifically.  Among the Urdu poems from this time that remain popular are [[Parinde ki faryad]] (A bird's prayer), an early meditation on animal rights, and [[Tarana-e-Hindi]] (The Song of India) a patriotic poem—both poems composed for children. In 1905, he left for further studies in Europe, first to England, where he completed a second B.A. at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and was subsequently [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]], and then to Germany, where he received a Ph.D. in philosophy at the [[University of Munich]].  After returning to Lahore in 1908, he established a law practice but concentrated on writing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and religion. He is best known for his poetic works, including ''[[Asrar-e-Khudi]]'' – after whose publication he was awarded a [[British honours system|knighthood]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32782 |date=29 December 1922 |pages=2  |supp=y}}</ref> ''[[Rumuz-e-Bekhudi]]'', and the ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]''. In [[Iran]], where he is known as ''Iqbāl-e Lāhorī'' (''Iqbal of [[Lahore]]''), he is highly regarded for his Persian works.

Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation across the world, but in particular in South Asia; a series of lectures he delivered to this effect were published as ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]''. Iqbal was elected to the [[Punjab Legislative Council]] in 1927 and held a number of positions in the [[All India Muslim League]]. In his [[Allahabad Address|1930 presidential address]] at the League's annual meeting in [[Allahabad]], he formulated a political framework for Muslims in British-ruled India.<ref name="Sevea2012-2"/> Iqbal died in 1938.  After the creation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, he was named the [[national poet]] there. He is also known as the ''"Hakeem-ul-Ummat"'' (“The Sage of the [[Ummah]]”) and the ''"Mufakkir-e-Pakistan"'' (“The Thinker of Pakistan”). The anniversary of his birth (''Yom-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl''), 9 November, used to be a [[List of holidays in Pakistan|public holiday in Pakistan]] until 2018.<ref name=iqbal-world-holidays>{{citation|chapter=Birthday of Iqbal|title= Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary, Fourth Edition|year= 2010|publisher=Omnigraphics, Inc.|access-date=8 February 2021|chapter-url= https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Birthday+of+Iqbal}}</ref>

=== Higher education in Europe ===
Iqbal was influenced by the teachings of [[Thomas Walker Arnold|Sir Thomas Arnold]], his philosophy teacher at Government College Lahore, to pursue higher education in the West. In 1905, he travelled to England for that purpose. While already acquainted with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Henri Bergson]], Iqbal would discover [[Rumi]] slightly before his departure to England, and he would teach the ''[[Masnavi]]'' to his friend [[Swami Rama Tirtha]], who in return would teach him Sanskrit.<ref>Syed Abdul Vahid, ''Glimpses of Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Pakistan, 1974, p. 77</ref> Iqbal qualified for a scholarship from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, University of Cambridge]], and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1906. This  B.A. degree in London, made him eligible, to practice as an advocate, as it was being practiced those days. In the same year he was [[called to the bar]] as a [[barrister]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]]. In 1907, Iqbal moved to Germany to pursue his doctoral studies, and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in 1908.

Iqbal began his career as a reader of Arabic after completing his Master of Arts degree in 1899, at [[Oriental College, Lahore|Oriental College]] and shortly afterward was selected as a junior professor of philosophy at Government College Lahore, where he had also been a student in the past. He worked there until he left for England in 1905. In 1907 he went to Germany for PhD In 1908, he returned from Germany and joined the same college again as a professor of philosophy and English literature.<ref name="Brill">{{cite book|title=Gabriel's Wing: a study of the religious ideas of Sir Muhammad Iqbal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goE3AAAAIAAJ|first=Annemarie|last=Schimmel|publisher=Brill Archive|page=39|year=1963}}</ref> In the same period Iqbal began practising law at the Chief Court of Lahore, but he soon quit law practice and devoted himself to literary works, becoming an active member of ''[[Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-Islam]]''.<ref name="allamaiqbal a person" /> In 1919, he became the general secretary of the same organisation. Iqbal's thoughts in his work primarily focus on the spiritual direction and development of human society, centered around experiences from his travels and stays in Western Europe and the Middle East. He was profoundly influenced by Western philosophers such as Nietzsche, Bergson, and Goethe.

The poetry and philosophy of Rumi strongly influenced Iqbal. Deeply grounded in religion since childhood, Iqbal began concentrating intensely on the study of Islam, the culture and history of Islamic civilisation and its political future, while embracing Rumi as "his guide".<ref name="books.google.co.uk" /> Iqbal's works focus on reminding his readers of the past glories of Islamic civilisation and delivering the message of a pure, spiritual focus on Islam as a source for socio-political liberation and greatness. Iqbal denounced political divisions within and amongst Muslim nations, and frequently alluded to and spoke in terms of the global Muslim community or the [[Ummah]].<ref name="allamaiqbal.com">{{cite web |last=1 in author list|first=Iqbal Academy |date=26 May 2006|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/biography/biotxtread.html |title=Allama Iqbal – Biography |format=PHP |access-date=7 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="books.google.co.uk" />

[[File:Iqbalpolitics.jpg|thumb|250px|Iqbal with Muslim politicians.<br />
(L to R): M. Iqbal (third), [[Syed Zafarul Hasan]] (sixth) at [[Aligarh Muslim University]]]]

Iqbal first became interested in national affairs in his youth. He received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his return from England in 1908, and he was closely associated with [[Mian Muhammad Shafi]]. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was expanded to the provincial level, and Shafi received a significant role in the structural organisation of the [[Punjab Muslim League]], Iqbal was made one of the first three joint secretaries along with Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Maulvi Mahbub Alam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the All-India Muslim League (1906–1947)|last=Afzal|first=Rafique M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-906735-0|location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages=15}}</ref> While dividing his time between law practice and poetry, Iqbal remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in [[World War I]] and stayed in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian National Congress]], which he regarded as dominated by [[Hindus]], and was disappointed with the League when, during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah.<ref name="brightpk.com" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} He was active in the [[Khilafat Movement]], and was among the founding fathers of [[Jamia Millia Islamia]] which was established at [[Aligarh]] in October 1920. He was also given the offer of being the first vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], which he refused.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jmi.ac.in/aboutjamia/profile/history/historical_note-13|title = Profile of Jamia Millia Islamia - History - Historical Note}}</ref>

In November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]] from the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> He supported the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah|constitutional proposals]] presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress and worked with [[Aga Khan]] and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League.<ref name="brightpk.com" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} While in Lahore he was a friend of [[Abdul Sattar Ranjoor]].<ref name="n">''New Age Weekly''.

=== Iqbal, Jinnah and the concept of Pakistan ===
Ideologically separated from Congress Muslim leaders, Iqbal had also been disillusioned with the politicians of the Muslim League, owing to the factional conflict that plagued the League in the 1920s.{{cn|date=September 2021}} Discontent with factional leaders like Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was influential in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:

{{quote|I know you are a busy man, but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has the right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name="iqbalandpakmovement" />
}}

While Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.<ref name="jalal14">Ayesha Jalal, ''The Sole Spokesman'', pp. 14</ref> Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan. Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on 21 June 1937:

{{quote|A separate federation of Muslim Provinces, reformed on the lines I have suggested above, is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of Non-Muslims. Why should not the Muslims of North-West India and [[Bengal]] be considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other nations in India and outside India are.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />}}

Iqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with Punjabi leader [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)|Sikandar Hyat Khan]], whom Iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:
{{quote|There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism. This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defense of our national existence. The united front can be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah. Now, none but Jinnah is capable of leading the Muslims.<ref name="iqbalandpakmovement">{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/movement/move_main.htm |title=Iqbal and Pakistan Movement |publisher=Allamaiqbal.com |access-date=9 November 2010}}</ref>

== Revival of Islamic policy ==
[[File:Iqbal-RahmatAli.jpg|thumb|left|Iqbal with [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] and other Muslim leaders]]
Iqbal's six English lectures were published in Lahore in 1930, and then by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1934 in the book ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]''. The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Iqbal expressed fears that not only would [[secularism]] weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture, and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name="books.google.co.uk" /> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim regions in India. Under a single Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects, especially concerning their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his [[Allahabad Address|presidential address]] on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in north-western India:<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /><ref name="Dec 1930"/>

{{quote|I would like to see the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[Sind province (1936–1955)|Sind]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the [[British Empire]], or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of Northwest India.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /><ref name="Dec 1930">{{cite book |last=Sirriyeh |first=Elizabeth |date=21 October 1998 |title=Sufis and Anti-Sufis: The Defense, Rethinking and Rejection of Sufism in the modern world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Bp0K-HpBPsC&q=I+would+like+to+see+the+Punjab,+North-West+Frontier+Province,+Sind+and+Baluchistan+amalgamated+into+a+single+state&pg=PA136 |location=University of Leeds, United Kingdom |publisher=Routledge |page=136 |isbn=9780700710607}}</ref>}}

In his speech, Iqbal emphasised that, unlike Christianity, Islam came with "legal concepts" with "civic significance", with its "religious ideals" considered as inseparable from social order: "Therefore, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, the construction of a policy on national lines, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim."<ref name="Naipaul">{{cite book |last=Naipaul |first=V. S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250–52}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

He thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''—that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Even as he rejected secularism and nationalism he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would be a [[theocracy]], and criticised the "intellectual attitudes" of Islamic scholars ([[ulema]]) as having "reduced the Law of Islam practically to the state of immobility".<ref name=iqbal-2004-1934-131>{{cite book |title=The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam |edition=reprint |orig-year=1934| date=2004 |location=Lahore |publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications |page=131 }}</ref>

The latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League. He reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the third [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

He would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians opposed to the League. Many accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two-nation theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Patron of ''Tolu-e-Islam'' ===
[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first issue of ''Tolu-e-Islam'']]
Iqbal was the first patron of ''[[Tolu-e-Islam (magazine)|Tolu-e-Islam]]'', a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India. For a long time, Iqbal wanted a journal to propagate his ideas and the aims and objectives of the [[All India Muslim League]]. In 1935, according to his instructions, [[Syed Nazeer Niazi]] initiated and edited the journal,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tolueislam.com/Urdu/mag/1935/1935_Oct.djvu| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804120220/http://webcode.ca/docs/1935_Oct.pdf| archive-date=4 August 2017| title=Tolu-e-Islam – Under editorship of Syed Nazeer Niazi}}</ref> named after Iqbal's poem  "[[Tulu'i Islam]]".

== Literary work ==
{{Main|Works of Muhammad Iqbal}}

=== Persian ===
Iqbal's poetic works are written primarily in [[Persian language|Persian]] rather than [[Urdu]]. Among his 12,000 verses of poetry, about 7,000 verses are in Persian.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the ''[[Asrar-i-Khudi]]'' {{nastaliq|اسرارِ خودی}} (''Secrets of the Self'') in Persian. The poems emphasize the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|access-date=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-i-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of "Khudi", or "Self".<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /><ref name="books.google.co.uk" /> Iqbal's use of the term "Khudi" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|"Rooh"]] used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in [[Adam]], for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the "Self" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the "Self" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

In his ''[[Rumuz-i-Bekhudi]]'' {{nastaliq|رموزِ بیخودی}} (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his characteristics intact, he asserts, but once this is achieved, he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the "Self" outside of society. Published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he supports Islam, Iqbal also recognizes the positive aspects of other religions. ''Rumuz-i-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-i-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

Iqbal's 1924 publication, the ''[[Payam-e-Mashriq]]'' {{nastaliq|پیامِ مشرق}} (''The Message of the East''), is closely connected to the ''West-östlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion, and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardor, and dynamism. He asserts that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented ''Payam-e Mashreq'' to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]. In it, he admired the uprising of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name="A Spiritual Bridge between East and West"/>

The ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' {{nastaliq|زبورِ عجم}} (''Persian Psalms''), published in 1927, includes the poems "''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''" ("Garden of New Secrets") and "''Bandagi Nama''" ("Book of Slavery"). In "''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''", Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight. "''Bandagi Nama''" denounces slavery and attempts to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here, as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasizing love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

Iqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' {{nastaliq|جاوید نامہ}} (''Book of Javed''), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' ("A stream full of life") guided by Rumi, "the master", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javed, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the "new generation".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mufti|first=Ifrah|date=9 November 2018|title=Allama Iqbal: Pakistan's national poet & the man who gave India 'Saare jahan se achha'|url=https://theprint.in/features/allama-iqbal-pakistans-national-poet-the-man-who-gave-india-saare-jahan-se-achha/147155/|access-date=18 November 2020|website=[[ThePrint]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Chih Bayed Kard Ay Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' {{nastaliq|پس چہ باید کرد اے اقوامِ شرق}} includes the poem "''Musafir''" {{nastaliq|مسافر}} ("The Traveller"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. "''Musafir''" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counselled to learn the "secret of Islam" and to "build up the self" within themselves.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

His love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:<ref>'' Kuliyat Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>

{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|گرچہ ہندی در عذوبت شکر است}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/persian/asrar/text/01.htm|title=1}}</ref>

''garchi Hindi dar uzūbat <u>sh</u>akkar ast''

Translation: ''Even though in sweetness [[Hindustani language|Hindi]]* [archaic name for Urdu, lit. "language of India"] is sugar'' – ''(but) speech method in [[Dari language|Dari]] [the variety of Persian in Afghanistan ] is sweeter *''

Throughout his life, Iqbal would prefer writing in Persian as he believed it allowed him to fully express philosophical concepts, and it gave him a wider audience.<ref name="goethezeitportal">{{cite web

Muhammad Iqbal's ''[[The Call of the Marching Bell]]'' ({{nastaliq|بانگِ درا}}, ''bang-e-dara''), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" /> The poems he wrote up to 1905—the year he left for England—reflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the Urdu language patriotic "[[Sare Jahan se Accha|Saare Jahan se Accha]]",<ref name="A Spiritual Bridge between East and West"/> and "''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]''" ("The Song of the Community"). The second set of poems date from 1905 to 1908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=7 Jun|first1=Mir Ayoob Ali Khan / TNN /|last2=2015|last3=Ist|first3=04:12|title=Remembering Iqbal and his sare jahan se achcha {{!}} Hyderabad News – Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Remembering-Iqbal-and-his-sare-jahan-se-achcha/articleshow/47570903.cms|access-date=18 November 2020|website=[[The Times of India]]|language=en}}</ref>

Iqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' {{nastaliq|بالِ جبریل}} (''Wings of [[Gabriel#Islam|Gabriel]]'') is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]] and [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.{{Sfn|Anjum|2014|p=134}}

''[[Zarb-i-Kalim]]''  {{nastaliq|ضربِ کلیم}} (or ''The Rod of Moses'') is another philosophical poetry book of Allama Iqbal in [[Urdu]], it was published in 1936, two years before his death. In which he described as his political manifesto. It was published with the subtitle "A Declaration of War Against the Present Times. Muhammad Iqbal argues that modern problems are due to the godlessness, materialism, and injustice of modern civilisation, which feeds on the subjugation and exploitation of weak nations, especially the Indian Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction "Zarb i Kalim"|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/poet/poetry/urdu/poet_introzarb.html|publisher=Iqbal Academy Pakistan|access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref>

Iqbal's final work was ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' {{nastaliq|ارمغانِ حجاز}} (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. The profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.{{Sfn|Anjum|2014|p=286-289}}

Iqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days. Some verses of that ghazal are:<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

{{blockquote|At last, the silent tongue of Hijaz has<br />
announced to the ardent ear the tiding<br />
That the covenant which had been given to the<br />
desert-[dwellers] is going to be renewed<br />
vigorously:<br />
The lion who had emerged from the desert and<br />
had toppled the Roman Empire is<br />
As I am told by the angels, about to get up<br />
again (from his slumbers.)<br />
You the [dwellers] of the West, should know that<br />
the world of God is not a shop (of yours).<br />
Your imagined pure gold is about to lose its <br />
standard value (as fixed by you).<br />
Your civilization will commit suicide with its
own daggers.<br />

=== English ===
Iqbal wrote two books, ''[[The Development of Metaphysics in Persia]]'' (1908) and ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]'' (1930), and many letters in the English language. He also wrote a book on Economics that is now rare. In these, he revealed his thoughts regarding Persian ideology and Islamic Sufism – in particular, his beliefs that Islamic Sufism activates the searching soul to a superior perception of life. He also discussed philosophy, God and the meaning of prayer, human spirit and Muslim culture, as well as other political, social and religious problems.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

Iqbal was invited to Cambridge to participate in a conference in 1931, where he expressed his views, including those on the [[separation of church and state]], to students and other participants:<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />

{{quote|I would like to offer a few pieces of advice to the young men who are at present studying at Cambridge. ... I advise you to guard against atheism and materialism. The biggest blunder made by Europe was the separation of Church and State. This deprived their culture of moral soul and diverted it to atheistic materialism. I had twenty-five years ago seen through the drawbacks of this civilization and, therefore, had made some prophecies. They had been delivered by my tongue, although I did not quite understand them. This happened in 1907. ... After six or seven years, my prophecies came true, word by word. The European war of 1914 was an outcome of the mistakes mentioned above made by the European nations in the separation of the Church and the State.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com" />}}

=== Punjabi ===
Iqbal also wrote some poems in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], such as "''Piyaara Jedi''" and "''Baba Bakri Wala''", which he penned in 1929 on the occasion of his son Javed's birthday. A collection of his Punjabi poetry was put on display at the [[Iqbal Manzil]] in Sialkot.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/05-Oct-2016/iqbal-s-punjabi-poetry-put-on-display|title=Iqbal's Punjabi poetry put on display|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]|date=5 October 2016|access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref>

The Vice-Chancellor of [[Quaid-e-Azam University]], Dr. Masoom Yasinzai, stated in a seminar addressing a distinguished gathering of educators and intellectuals that Iqbal is not only a poet of the East but is a universal poet. Moreover, Iqbal is not restricted to any specific segment of the world community, but he is for all humanity.<ref name="Preston">{{cite web|url=http://www.preston.edu.pk/allama_iqbal.php|title=Seminar on Allama Iqbal held at Preston University|publisher=Preston.Edu.PK|access-date=19 May 2019 }}</ref>

{{quote|Yet it should also be born in mind that while dedicating his Eastern Divan to Goethe, the cultural icon par excellence, Iqbal's Payam-i-Mashriq constituted both a reply as well as a corrective to the Western Divan of Goethe.

Iqbal's revolutionary works through his poetry affected the Muslims of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]].

The Urdu world is very familiar with Iqbal as the "Poet of the East".<ref name="urdu" /> Iqbal is also called ''Muffakir-e-Pakistan'' ("The Thinker of Pakistan") and ''Hakeem-ul-Ummat'' ("The Sage of the [[Ummah]]"). The Pakistan government officially named him Pakistan's "[[List of national poets|national poet]]".<ref name="Iqbal Academy Pakistan"/>

=== Iran ===
In Iran, Iqbal is known as ''Iqbāl-e Lāhorī'' ({{lang-fa|اقبال لاهوری}}) (Iqbal of Lahore). Iqbal's ''Asrare-i-Khudi'' and ''Bal-i-Jibreel'' are particularly popular in Iran. At the same time, many scholars in Iran have recognised the importance of Iqbal's poetry in inspiring and sustaining the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.<ref name="Iqbal-Iran1">{{cite web|title=The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/19455/137th-birthday-what-allama-iqbals-poetry-has-taught-me-so-far/|work=Osama Sajid|date=25 March 2011|access-date=25 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="the Friday" /> During the early phases of the revolutionary movement, it was common to see people gathering in a park or corner to listen to someone reciting Iqbal's Persian poetry, which is why people of all ages in Iran today are familiar with at least some of his poetry, notably ''Zabur-i-Ajam''.<ref name="Iqbal-Iran2">{{cite web|title=Iqbal and the Iranians Iqbal|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/656464/heritage-eghbal-i-lahuri-and-the-iranians|work=Nasir Riaz|date=25 March 2011|access-date=25 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="the Friday" />

[[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]] has stated, "We have a large number of non-Persian-speaking poets in the history of our literature, but I cannot point out any of them whose poetry possesses the qualities of Iqbal's Persian poetry. Iqbal was not acquainted with Persian idiom, as he spoke Urdu at home and talked to his friends in Urdu or English. He did not know the rules of Persian prose writing. [...] In spite of not having tasted the Persian way of life, never living in the cradle of Persian culture, and never having any direct association with it, he cast with great mastery the most delicate, the most subtle and radically new philosophical themes into the mould of Persian poetry, some of which are unsurpassable yet."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khamenei.de/books/iqbal.htm |title=Iqbal |publisher=Khamenei.de |access-date=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618081641/http://www.khamenei.de/books/iqbal.htm |archive-date=18 June 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

By the early 1950s, Iqbal became known among the intelligentsia of Iran. Iranian poet laureate [[Muhammad Taqi Bahar]] universalised Iqbal in Iran. He highly praised the work of Iqbal in Persian.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In 1952, Iranian Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mossadeq]], a national hero because of his oil nationalisation policy, broadcast a special radio message on Iqbal Day and praised his role in the struggle of the Indian Muslims against British imperialism. At the end of the 1950s, Iranians published the complete Persian works. In the 1960s, Iqbal's thesis on Persian philosophy was translated from English to Persian. Ali Shariati, a Sorbonne-educated sociologist, supported Iqbal as his role model as Iqbal had Rumi. An example of the admiration and appreciation of Iran for Iqbal is that he received the place of honour in the pantheon of the Persian elegy writers.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Iqbal became even more popular in Iran in the 1970s. His verses appeared on banners, and his poetry was recited at meetings of intellectuals. Iqbal inspired many intellectuals, including [[Ali Shariati]], [[Mehdi Bazargan]] and [[Abdulkarim Soroush]]. His book ''The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam'' was translated by Mohammad Masud Noruzi.<ref name="the Friday">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/love-letter-to-persia/|title=Love letter to Persia|newspaper=The Friday Times|date=25 April 2014|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

Key Iranian thinkers and leaders who were influenced by Iqbal's poetry during the rise of the Iranian revolution include Khamenei, Shariati and Soroush, although much of the revolutionary guard was familiar with Iqbal's poetry.<ref name="Iqbal-Iran3">{{cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8hAwAAQBAJ&q=Iqbal+lahori+iranian+revolution&pg=PA201|work=Iqbal Singh Sevea|date=25 March 2011|access-date=25 October 2014|isbn = 9781139536394|last1 = Sevea|first1 = Iqbal Singh}}</ref> At the inauguration of the First Iqbal Summit in Tehran (1986), Khamenei stated that in its "conviction that the Quran and Islam are to be made the basis of all revolutions and movements", Iran was "exactly following the path that was shown to us by Iqbal".<ref name="Iqbal-Iran3" /> Shariati, who has been described as a core ideologue for the Iranian Revolution, described Iqbal as a figure who brought a message of "rejuvenation", "awakening" and "power" to the Muslim world.<ref name="Iqbal-Iran5">{{cite book|title=Iqbal: Manifestation of the Islamic Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivogAAAACAAJ|work=Iqbal Singh Sevea|date=25 March 2011|access-date=25 October 2014|isbn = 9781871031201|last1 = Khamenei|first1 = Ali|last2 = Shariati|first2 = Ali|last3 = Sharīʻatī|first3 = ʻalī}}</ref>

Iqbal's views on the Western world have been applauded by Westerners, including [[United States Supreme Court]] Associate Justice [[William O. Douglas]], who said that Iqbal's beliefs had "universal appeal".<ref name="allamaiqbal review 1985" /> Soviet biographer N. P. Anikoy wrote:

{{quote|[Iqbal is] great for his passionate condemnation of weak will and passiveness, his angry protest against inequality, discrimination and oppression in all forms, i.e., economic, social, political, national, racial, religious, etc., his preaching of optimism, an active attitude towards life and man's high purpose in the world, in a word, he is great for his assertion of the noble ideals and principles of humanism, democracy, peace and friendship among peoples.<ref name="allamaiqbal review 1985" />}}

Others, including [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], stated that with Iqbal's anti-capitalist holdings, he was "anti-intellect", because "capitalism fosters intellect".<ref name="allamaiqbal review 1985" /> [[Freeland Abbott]] objected to Iqbal's views of the West, saying that they were based on the role of imperialism and that Iqbal was not immersed enough in Western culture to learn about the various benefits of the modern democracies, economic practices and science.<ref name="allamaiqbal review 1985">{{cite web|last=Review|first=Iqbal|year=1985|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/oct85/index.htm |title=American, West European and Soviet Attitudes to Iqbal |format=PHP|access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref> Critics of Abbot's viewpoint note that Iqbal was raised and educated in the European way of life, and spent enough time there to grasp the general concepts of Western civilisation.<ref name="allamaiqbal review 1985" />

Iqbal is widely commemorated in Pakistan, where he is regarded as the ideological founder of the state.
