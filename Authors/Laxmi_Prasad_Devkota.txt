'''Laxmi Prasad Devkota''' ({{lang-ne|लक्ष्मीप्रसाद देवकोटा}}) was a [[Nepalis|Nepali]] poet, playwright, and novelist. Honored with the title of '''Mahakavi''' in [[Nepali literature]], he was known as a poet with a golden heart. He is considered to be the greatest and most famous literary figure in Nepal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historyradio.org/2017/11/21/my-father-laxmi-devkota/|title=Mahakavi Laxmi Prasad Devkota, the most famous writer in Nepal|access-date=11 November 2019|archive-date=11 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111195435/https://historyradio.org/2017/11/21/my-father-laxmi-devkota/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://echoesfromnepal.blogspot.com/2013/11/laxmi-prasad-devkota.html|title=Our Echoes: Laxmi Prasad Devkota|access-date=11 November 2019|archive-date=11 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111195432/http://echoesfromnepal.blogspot.com/2013/11/laxmi-prasad-devkota.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of his popular works include the best selling ''[[Muna Madan]]'', along with ''Sulochana'', ''Kunjini'', ''Bhikhari'', and ''[[Shakuntala (epic)|Shakuntala]]''.<ref name="record">{{cite web|author=MICHAEL HUTT|language=en|title=A voice from the past speaking to the present|url=https://www.recordnepal.com/wire/a-voice-from-the-past-speaking-to-the-present|publisher=The Record Nepal|location=Kathmandu|date=7 March 2018|access-date=24 February 2019|archive-date=24 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224175242/https://www.recordnepal.com/wire/a-voice-from-the-past-speaking-to-the-present/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="boss">{{cite web|language=en |title=The great poet (Laxmi Prasad Devkota)

==Early life==
Devkota was born on the night of [[Lakshmi Pujan|Lakshmi Puja]] on 13 November 1909 ([[Vikram Samvat|B.S.]]1966 Kartik 27) to father Teel Madhav Devkota and mother Amar Rajya Lakshmi Devi in Dhobidhara, [[Kathmandu]].<ref>[http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/mag/muna.detail.php?article_id=223&cat_id=17 Muna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206120800/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/mag/muna.detail.php?article_id=223&cat_id=17 |date=6 December 2013 }} Being born on the auspicious day of Laxmi pooja(the goddess of wealth), he was regarded as the gift of goddess Laxmi, but in contradiction to it, he became a gift of Saraswati(goddess of knowledge and education).</ref> His father was a Sanskrit scholar, so he attained his basic education under the custodianship of his father. He started his formal education at [[Durbar High School]], where he studied both [[Sanskrit grammar]] and English. After finishing his [[matriculation]] exams from [[Patna]] at the age of 17, he pursued [[Bachelor of Arts]] along with [[Bachelor of Laws]] at [[Tri-Chandra College]] and graduated from [[Patna University]] as a private examinee. His desire of completing his master's degree was left incomplete due to his family's financial conditions.<ref>http://www.weallnepali.com/sahitya-sumana/laxmi-prasad-devkota-laksmi-prasada-devakota {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425051108/http://www.weallnepali.com/sahitya-sumana/laxmi-prasad-devkota-laksmi-prasada-devakota |date=25 April 2018 }} [http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/mag/muna.detail.php?article_id=223&cat_id=17 Muna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206120800/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/mag/muna.detail.php?article_id=223&cat_id=17 |date=6 December 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=20008&cat_id=10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206120225/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=20008&cat_id=10|url-status=dead|title=Gorkhapatra|archivedate=6 December 2013}}</ref>

Only after a decade from his graduation as a lawyer, he started working in ''Nepal Bhasaanuwad Parishad'' (Publication Censor Board), where he met famous playwright [[Balkrishna Sama]]. At the same time, he also worked as a lecturer at Tri-Chandra College and [[Padma Kanya Multiple Campus|Padma Kanya College]].<ref name="boss"/>

==Learning and style==
Devkota contributed to Nepali literature by starting a modern Nepali language romantic movement in the country. He was the first writer born in Nepal to begin writing epic poems in Nepali literature. Nepali poetry soared to new heights with Devkota's innovative use of the language.

Departing from the Sanskrit tradition that dominated the Nepali literary scene at the time, and being inspired from the [[Newar language]] ballad song [[Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni]], he wrote ''[[Muna Madan]]'' ({{Lang-ne|मुनामदन}}) (1930), a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] in a popular ''Jhyaure bhaka'' ({{Lang-ne|झ्याउरे भाका}}) folk tune. ''Muna Madan'' is undoubtedly the best-selling book in the history of Nepali literature. The 2003 film [[Muna Madan (2003 film)|Muna Madan]], which was Nepal's official entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[76th Academy Awards]], was based on this poem. The work received immediate recognition from the [[Rana dynasty|Ranas]]'''—'''the country's rulers at the time. ''Muna Madan'' tells the story of Madan, a travelling merchant, who departs to [[Tibet]] in a bid to earn some money leaving behind his wife, Muna. The poem describes the thematic hardships of the journey: the grief of separation, the itching longing, and the torment of death.

The ballad Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni is a tragic song based on a [[Newar people|Newa merchant]], his mother, and his wife. The merchant is about to leave Kathmandu for Tibet on work. The song starts with the wife pleading with her mother-in-law to stop him, saying that it's not even been a month since she came to their home and he wants to go away. Being raised in [[Kathmandu]], Devkota had heard this song from locals singing it at a local ''Pati'' ({{Lang-ne|पाटी or फ़ल्चा}}). He was highly fascinated by the song and decided to re-write it in [[Nepali language]]. Since the Rana rulers had put a ban on the Newa trade, language and literature, he changed the main character from a Newa merchant as in the original song to a [[Kshatriya]] (warrior class) character. Although Kshatriya people did not practice trade for their living during those days, he had to depict it as such in order to lure the Rana rulers.<ref name="record" /><ref name="boss" />

The following couplet, which is among the most famous and frequently quoted lines from the epic, celebrates the triumph of humanity and compassion over the hierarchies created by caste in Nepalese culture.

{{col-end}}

Considered his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], [[Muna Madan]] has remained widely popular among the lay readers of Nepali literature.

{{anchor|pagal-poem}}<!-- this anchor is for a redirect to the poem -->Devkota, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum in 1939, wrote a free-verse poem ''Pagal'' ({{Lang-ne|पागल|lit=The Lunatic}}). The poem deals with his usual mental ability and is considered one of the best Nepali language poems.
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
"जरुर साथी म पागल !
यस्तै छ मेरो हाल ।
म शब्दलाई देख्दछु !

बासनालाई संबाद लिन्छु ।
आकाशभन्दा पातालका कुरालाई छुन्छु ।
ती कुरा,
जसको अस्तित्व लोक मान्दैंन
जसको आकार संसार जान्दैन !"

Surely, my friend, I am mad,
That’s exactly what I am!
I see a word,
Hear sights,

I touch things thinner than air,
Those things,
Whose existence the world denies,
Whose shapes the world does not know.
</poem>
{{col-end}}

Devkota had the ability to compose long epics and poems with literary complexity and philosophical density in very short periods of time. He wrote ''[[Shakuntala (epic)|Shakuntala]]'', his first [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] and also the first ''Mahakavya'' ({{Lang-ne|महाकाव्य}}) written in the Nepali language, in a mere three months. Published in 1945, ''Shakuntala'' is a voluminous work in 24 cantos based on [[Kālidāsa|Kālidāsa's]] famous Sanskrit play [[Shakuntala (play)|''Abhijñānaśākuntalam'']]. ''Shakuntala'' demonstrates Devkota's mastery of [[Sanskrit]] meter and diction which he incorporated heavily while working primarily in Nepali. According to the late scholar and translator of Devkota, [[David Rubin (author)|David Rubin]], ''Shakuntala'' is among his greatest accomplishments. "It is, without doubt, a remarkable work, a masterpiece of a particular kind, harmonizing various elements of a classical tradition with a modern point of view, a pastoral with a cosmic allegory, Kālidāsa's romantic comedy of earthly love with a symbolic structure that points to redemption through the coinciding of sensual and sacred love."<ref>Rubin, David (translator). ''Nepali Visions, Nepali Dreams: The Poetry of Laxmi Prasad Devkota''. Columbia University Press, 1980, p. 40.</ref>

Devkota also published several collections of short lyric poems set in various traditional and non-traditional forms and meters. Most of his poetry shows the influence of English Romantic poets like [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]. The title poem in the collection ''Bhikhari'' ({{Lang-ne|भिखारी|lit=Beggar}}) is reminiscent of Wordsworth's "The Old Cumberland Beggar". In this poem, Devkota describes the beggar going about his ways in dire poverty and desolation, deprived of human love and material comforts. On the other hand, the beggar is also seen as the source of compassion placed in the core of suffering and destitution. Devkota connects the beggar with the divine as the ultimate fount of kindness and empathy:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
"कालो बादलबाट खसेको 
 अन्धकारमा भित्र पसेको,
 ईश्वर हो कि भिखारी ?
 बोल्दछ ईश्वर हृदय घुसेका 
 घर, घर आँगन चारी
 बोल्दछ, आर्तध्वनिमा बोल्दछ
 करूणामृत दिल भारी ।"
</poem>
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
Fallen from the blackest clouds
To enter into darker shrouds,
Is he deity or beggar?
Buddha speaks – his words pierce the heart,
Wandering from house to house, yard to yard,
Now speaking with a voice of pain:
His heart in sorrow cowed.
</poem>
{{col-end}}

Many of his poems focus on mundane elements of the human and the natural world. The titles of his poems like ''Ban'' ({{Lang-ne|वन|lit=The Woods}}), ''Kisaan'' ({{Lang-ne|किसान|lit=The Peasant}}), ''Baadal'' ({{Lang-ne|बादल|lit=Clouds}}) shows that he sought his poetic inspiration in the commonplace and proximal aspects of the world. What resonates throughout most of his poetry is his profound faith in humanity. For instance, in the poem ''Ban'', the speaker goes through a series of interrogations, rejecting all forms of comfort and solace that could be offered solely to him as an individual. Instead, he embraces his responsibility and concern for his fellow beings. The poem ends with the following quatrain that highlights the speaker's humanistic inclinations:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
"दोस्त कहाँ छन्? साथ छ को को? घर हो तिम्रो कुन देश?
जान्छौ कुन पुर भवन मुसाफिर, ल्यायौ कुन सन्देश?
दोस्त मेरो शुभ उद्योगी, साथ छ साहस बेश ।
विश्व सबै घर, हृदय-पुरीतिर ल्याउछु सेवा सन्देश ।।"
</poem>
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
<poem>
Where are your friends? Who goes with you? Which land is your home?
What place do you seek, Traveller? With what news do you roam?
My friend is decent diligence. Courage comes with me.
The whole world is my home. To heartland I roam, with hues of humanity.
</poem>
{{col-end}}

Besides poetry, Devkota also made significant contributions to the essay genre. He is considered the father of the modern Nepali essay. He defied the conventional form of essays and broke the traditional rules of essay writing and embraced a more fluid and colloquial style which had more clarity in meaning, expressive in feelings and eloquent in terms of language. His essays are generally satirical in tone and are characterized by their trenchant humour and ruthless criticism of the modernizing influences from the West on Nepali society. An essay titled ''Bhaladmi''  ({{Lang-ne|भलादमी|lit=Gentleman}}) or criticizes a decadent trend in Nepali society to respect people based on their outward appearances and outfit rather than their actual inner worth and personality. In another essay titled ''Ke Nepal Sano Cha?'' ({{Lang-ne|के नेपाल सानो छ?|lit=Is Nepal is small}}), he expresses deeply nationalistic sentiments inveighing against the colonial forces from British India which, he felt, were encroaching all aspects of Nepali culture. His essays are published in an essays book entitled ''Laxmi Nibhandha Sanghraha'' ({{Lang-ne|लक्ष्मी निबन्धसङ्‌ग्रह}}).<ref name="record" />

Devkota also translated [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'' into Nepali.

==Politics==
Laxmi Prasad Devkota was not active within any well-established political party but his poetry consistently embodied an attitude of rebellion against the oppressive [[Rana dynasty]]. During his self-exile in [[Varanasi]], he started working as an editor of ''Yugvani'' newspaper of the [[Nepali Congress]], leading to confiscation of all his property in Nepal by the Rana Government. After the introduction of democracy through [[1951 Nepalese revolution|Revolution of 1951]], Devkota was appointed member of the ''Nepal Salahkar Samiti'' ({{Lang-ne|नेपाल सलाहकार समिति|lit=Nepal Advisory Committee}}) in 1952 by [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]]. Later in 1957, he was appointed as Minister of Education and Autonomous Governance under the premiership of [[Kunwar Inderjit Singh]].

== Personal life ==

===Family===
Devkota's son, Padma Devkota, is also a poet and writer and served for many years as a professor at the English Department, [[Tribhuvan University]], Kathmandu.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Health===
In the late 1930s, Devkota suffered from [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]], probably due to the death of his mother, father, and his two-month old daughter. Eventually, in 1939, he was admitted to the [[Central Institute of Psychiatry|Mental Asylum of Ranchi]], [[India]], for five months. With financial debts later in his life and being unable to finance the weddings and dowries of his daughters, he is once reported to have said to his wife, "Tonight let's abandon the children to the care of society and youth and renounce this world at bedtime and take potassium cyanide or morphine or something like that [[Sic|''[sic]'']]."<ref>Pande, N. ''Mahakavi Devkota'', p. 30.</ref>

===Later years and death===
Laxmi Prasad Devkota was a chain smoker throughout his life. After a long battle with cancer, Devkota died on 14 September 1959, at Aryaghat, along the banks of [[Bagmati River|Bagmati river]] in [[Pashupatinath Temple]], Kathmandu.<ref name="boss"/>
