'''Robert Patrick''' (born September 27, 1937) is an American [[playwright]], [[poet]], [[lyricist]], short story writer, and [[novelist]]. He was born '''Robert Patrick O'Connor''' in [[Kilgore, Texas]].<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0665914|name=Robert Patrick}}</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:RobertPatrickReadToByMother.jpg|thumb|Patrick's mother always encouraged him to read.]]
O'Connor was born to [[migrant worker]]s in [[Texas]]. Because his parents constantly moved around the [[southwestern United States]] looking for work, he never went to one school for a full year until his senior year of high school, in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. Books, [[film]], and [[radio]] were the only constants in his early life. His mother made sure he learned to read, and arranged for him to start school a year early. He lacked friendships due to the constant moving, and didn't do well in school. He dropped out of college after two years. He did not experience live theater, beyond a few school productions, until he was working one summer as a dishwasher at the Kennebunkport Playhouse in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]] and fell in love with the theater.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eger|first1=Henrik|title=Robert Patrick reflects on 50 years of Off-Off-Broadway and gay theater|url=http://www.broadstreetreview.com/theater/robert-patrick-reflects-on-50-years-of-off-off-broadway-and-gay-theater|accessdate=July 27, 2017|publisher=Broadstreet Review|date=August 10, 2014}}</ref>

He stopped in [[New York City]] on his way back to Roswell from Maine and happened upon the [[Caffe Cino]], the first [[Off-Off-Broadway|Off-Off Broadway]] theatre, on September 14, 1961. He stayed in New York, working for free at the Caffe Cino, La Mama ETC, and other early Off-Off Broadway theaters in any capacity, and supported himself with temporary typing jobs while observing and participating in dozens of productions, including [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''So Long at the Fair''. He had already been writing poetry, and in 1964 wrote his first play, ''The Haunted Host''. The play was soon produced at Caffe Cino, and playwriting became his main focus.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Musto|first1=Michael|title=Historic Gay Playwright Robert Patrick On Surviving, Writing, and Being Grabbed by Shirley MaClaine|url=http://www.papermag.com/gay-playwright-robert-patrick-2465836182.html|accessdate=July 27, 2017|publisher=Paper Mag|date=July 26, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
Patrick has written and published over sixty plays.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shewey|first1=Don|title=Robert Patrick: The Prolific Father of 'Kennedy's Children'|url=http://www.donshewey.com/theater_articles/robert_patrick.htm|website=DonShewey.com|publisher=The Phoenix|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref>

===1960s===

His first play, ''The Haunted Host'', premiered at Caffe Cino in 1964. Patrick denied Neil Flanagan, the Caffe Cino's star performer, the title role (because Flanagan had recently played [[Lanford Wilson]]'s gay character, Lady Bright), and after other prominent Off-Off actors refused the role because they feared playing a gay character might damage their careers, Patrick appeared in the play himself alongside fellow playwright [[William M. Hoffman]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Patrick|url=http://primarystagesoffcenter.org/interviews/p-t/robert-patrick|website=Primary Stages Off Center|publisher=Primary Stages Theater|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref>

He also worked at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, another of the first Off-Off-Broadway theatres.

[http://catalog.lamama.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/250 "Special Event: ''BbAaNnGg!'' (1965)". Accessed May 29, 2018.]</ref>

In 1969, he won the [[Show Business (magazine)|Show Business magazine]] Best Play Award for ''Joyce Dynel'', ''Salvation Army'', and ''Fog''. Also in 1969, his play ''Camera Obscura'' was produced on [[PBS]], starring [[Marge Champion]], and was chosen to be in the well-known playwright revue "Collision Course".

Patrick was a prolific pioneer in [[Off-Off-Broadway]] and [[gay]] theatre, with over 300 productions of his plays during the 1960s in New York City alone. In 1972, the publisher and licensing company [[Samuel French]] called Patrick "New York's Most-Produced Playwright".

In 1973, Patrick's ''[[Kennedy's Children]]'' had an obscure opening in the back of a London pub theatre called the [[King's Head Theatre|King's Head]], in [[Islington]]. The production was instantly successful and was signed for the [[West End theatre|West End]] and other international productions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berkvist|first1=Robert|title=The Odyssey Of 'Kennedy's Children'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/09/archives/the-odyssey-of-kennedys-children.html|accessdate=July 31, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 9, 1975}}</ref> 1974 was the first season of gay theatre in the [[United Kingdom]], to which Patrick contributed three plays.

[http://catalog.lamama.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/3307 "Production: ''Cleaning House'' (1974)". Accessed May 29, 2018.]</ref>

A 1974 Boston production of ''The Haunted Host'' was the first time [[Harvey Fierstein]] appeared on the professional stage as a man. Years later, Fierstein included a recording of Patrick's monologue "Pouf Positive" on his [[compact disc]] ''This Is Not Going to Be Pretty''. "Pouf Positive" was also filmed by Dov Hechtman in 1989.[[File:WikiTennessee.jpg|thumb|left|Patrick with [[Tennessee Williams]] and, standing, Don Parker, Shirley Knight, and Michael Sacks, Sardi's, opening night of "Kennedy's Children," Nov. 3, 1975.]]

The 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Kennedy's Children]]'' earned [[Shirley Knight]] a 1976 [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play|Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play]].

Patrick traveled widely, from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] to [[Cape Town]], to see productions of ''Kennedy's Children.'' For ten years, he visited high schools and high school theatre conventions nationwide on behalf of the [[International Thespian Society]].

In 1976, [[Marlo Thomas]] commissioned Patrick to write ''My Cup Ranneth Over'' for her and [[Lily Tomlin]]. Although they never performed in the play, it would become Patrick's most produced work.

Patrick co-wrote ''Da Nutrcracker in Da Bronx'' with Jeannine O'Reilly and [[Paul Foster (playwright)|Paul Foster]]; the production was directed by Powell Shepard at La MaMa in 1977.<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.
