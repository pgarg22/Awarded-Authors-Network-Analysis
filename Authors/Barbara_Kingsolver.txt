After graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended [[DePauw University]] in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], on a music scholarship, studying classical piano. Eventually, however, she changed her major to biology when she realized that "classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them] get to play <nowiki>'</nowiki>[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> in a hotel lobby".<ref name="At Lunch"/> She was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the [[Vietnam war]].<ref name="Novel as Indictment"/> She graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Barbara Kingsolver: A Literary Companion|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476611174|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAsyBgAAQBAJ&q=Barbara+Kingsolver+phi+beta+kappa&pg=PA13|language=en}}</ref> with a Bachelor of Science in 1977, and moved to France for a year before settling in Tucson, Arizona, where she lived for much of the next two decades.

In a 2010 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Kingsolver says, "I never wanted to be famous, and still don't, [...] the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most".

Kingsolver lives in the [[Appalachia]] area of the United States.

==Literary style and themes==
Kingsolver has written novels in both the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and [[third-person narrative|third person]] narrative styles, and she frequently employs overlapping narratives.<ref name="Men, Women and Coyotes"/>

Kingsolver's literary subjects are varied, but she often writes about places and situations with which she is familiar; many of her stories are based in places she has lived in, such as central Africa and Arizona. She has stated emphatically that her novels are not autobiographical, although there are often commonalities between her life and her work.<ref name="Novel as Indictment"/> Her work is often strongly idealistic<ref name="At Lunch"/> and her writing has been called a form of activism.<ref name="Women on war">{{cite book |title= Women on War: an International Anthology of Women's Writings from Antiquity to the Present|last=Gioseffi|first=Daniela|year= 2003|publisher=Feminist Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-55861-408-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/womenonwarintern00gios/page/86 86]–88|url=https://archive.org/details/womenonwarintern00gios|url-access= registration|access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

Her characters are frequently written around struggles for social equality, such as the hardships faced by undocumented immigrants, the working poor, and single mothers.<ref name="At Lunch"/> Other common themes in her work include the balancing of individuality with the desire to live in a community, and the interaction and conflict between humans and the ecosystems in which they live.<ref name="Listen Here"/>  Kingsolver has been said to use prose and engaging narratives to make historical events, such as the Congo's struggles for independence, more interesting and engaging for the average reader.<ref name="Novel as Indictment"/>

==Bellwether Prize==
In 2000, Kingsolver established the [[Bellwether Prize|Bellwether Prize for Fiction]]. Named for the [[bellwether]], the literary prize is intended to support writers whose unpublished works support positive social change.<ref name="Novel as Indictment"/> The Bellwether Prize is awarded in even-numbered years, and includes guaranteed major publication and a cash prize of $25,000 USD, fully funded by Kingsolver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellwetherprize.org/info.html|title=Bellwether Prize Information|work=Bellwether Prize Official Site|access-date=May 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505052223/http://www.bellwetherprize.org/info.html|archive-date=May 5, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She has stated that she wanted to create a literary prize to "encourage writers, publishers, and readers to consider how fiction engages visions of social change and human justice".<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsolver.com/faq/about-writing.html#11|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=Official site|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

==Criticism==

Kingsolver was criticized for a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' opinion piece following the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]].  She wrote, "I feel like I'm standing on a playground where the little boys are all screaming at each other, 'He started it!' and throwing rocks that keep taking out another eye, another tooth.  I keep looking around for somebody's mother to come on the scene saying, 'Boys! Boys! Who started it cannot possibly be the issue here.
