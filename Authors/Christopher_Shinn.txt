==Career==
In an article about Shinn, Rob Weinert-Kendt observed: "If playwright Christopher Shinn has a signature character, it is the manipulative victim — the half-sympathetic, half-deplorable sort of person whose suffering is real but who uses it as rationale for bad behavior." As an example, in ''Dying City'', "Shinn conjured twin terrors: a pair of brothers, one a straight soldier shipping off to Iraq, the other a successful gay actor."<ref name=latimes>Weinert-Kendt, Rob.
