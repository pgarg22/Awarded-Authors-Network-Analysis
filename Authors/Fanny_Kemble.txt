'''Frances Anne "Fanny" Kemble''' (27 November 1809{{spaced ndash}}15 January 1893) was a British actress from a [[Kemble family|theatre family]] in the early and mid-19th century. She was a well-known and popular writer and abolitionist, whose published works included plays, poetry, eleven volumes of memoirs, [[travel writing]] and works about the theatre.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Frances Anne Kemble - adapted from Project Gutenberg eText 16478.jpg|left|alt=Formal facial portrait photo of attractive young woman with ringlets, smiling softly and looking into the camera.|thumb|Fanny Kemble as a young girl]]

A member of the famous Kemble theatrical family, Fanny was the eldest daughter of the actor [[Charles Kemble]] and his [[Vienna|Viennese]]-born wife, the former [[Marie Therese De Camp]]. She was a niece of the noted tragedienne [[Sarah Siddons]] and of the famous actor [[John Philip Kemble]]. Her younger sister was the opera singer [[Adelaide Kemble]].<ref name=":0" /> Fanny was born in London and educated chiefly in France. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1821, Fanny Kemble departed to boarding school in Paris to study art and music as befitted the child of the most celebrated artistic family in England at that time. In addition to literature and society, it was at Mrs Lamb's Academy in the Rue d'Angoulême, Champs Elysées, that Fanny received her first real personal exposure to the stage performing staged readings for students' parents during her time at school. As an adolescent, Kemble spent time studying literature and poetry, in particular the work of Lord Byron.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=Margaret |title=Fanny Kemble: A Passionate Victorian |url=https://archive.org/details/fannykemblepassi00arms |url-access=registration |date=1938 |publisher=Macmillan Company |location=New York}}</ref>

One of her teachers was Frances Arabella Rowden (1774 – c. 1840),<ref>{{Cite ODNB |title=Rowden [married name de St Quentin], Frances Arabella (1774–1840?), schoolmistress and poet {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |language=en |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/59581 |year=2004}}</ref> who had been associated with the [[Reading Abbey Girls' School]] since she was 16. Rowden was an engaging teacher, with a particular enthusiasm for the theatre. She was not only a poet, but according to [[Mary Russell Mitford]], "she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=eds |first1=Lilla Maria Crisafulli & Cecilia Pietropoli |title=The languages of performance in British romanticism |date=2008 |publisher=P. Lang |location=New York |isbn=978-3039110971 |page=301 |edition=Oxford; Bern; Berlin; Frankfurt am Main; Wien$nLang|chapter=appendix}}</ref>

In 1827, Kemble wrote her first five-act play, ''Francis the First''. It was met with critical acclaim from multiple quarters. Nineteenth-century critics wrote that the script "displays so much spirit and originality, so much of the true qualities which are required in dramatic composition, that it may fairly stand upon its own intrinsic worth, and that the author may fearlessly challenge a comparison with any other modern dramatist."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Scullion |first1=Adrienne |title=Female Playwrights of the Nineteenth Century |date=1996 |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London}}</ref>

==Acting career==
On 26 October 1829, at the age of 20, Kemble first appeared on the stage as Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at [[Covent Garden Theatre]], after only three weeks of rehearsals. Her attractive personality at once made her a great favourite, and her popularity enabled her father to recoup his losses as a [[Actor-manager|manager]]. She played all the principal women's roles of the time, notably Shakespeare's [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] and Beatrice (''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]''), and [[Lady Teazle]] in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Clinton |first1=Catherine |title=Fanny Kemble's civil wars |date=2000 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-684-84414-1|url=https://archive.org/details/fannykemblescivi00clin_0}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Deirdre|title=Fanny Kemble : a performed life |date=2007 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-4023-8}}</ref> Kemble disliked the artificiality of stardom in general, but appreciated the salary which she accepted to help her family in their frequent financial troubles.

In 1832, Kemble accompanied her father on a theatrical tour of the United States. While in Boston in 1833, she journeyed to [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] to witness the revolutionary technology of the first commercial railroad in the United States. She had previously accompanied George Stephenson on a test of the Liverpool and Manchester, prior to its opening in England, and described this in a letter written in early 1830. The [[Granite Railway]] was among many sights which she recorded in her journal.

Kemble retired from her acting career upon her marriage in 1834, but after her separation, she returned to acting as a solo platform performer, beginning her first American tour in 1849. During her readings she rose to focus on presenting edited works of Shakespeare, though unlike others she insisted on representing his entire canon, ultimately building her repertoire to 25 of his plays. She performed in Britain and in the United States, concluding her career as a platform performer in 1868.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cast of One: One-Person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage |last=Gentile |first=John |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-252-01584-3 |location=Urbana, IL |pages=[https://archive.org/details/castofoneonepers00gent/page/30 30–34 ]|url=https://archive.org/details/castofoneonepers00gent/page/30}}</ref>

==Marriage==

On June 7, 1834, Kemble retired from the stage to marry a wealthy Philadelphian, [[Pierce Mease Butler]], grandson of U.S. Senator [[Pierce Butler]], whom she had met on an American acting tour with her father in 1832.<ref name=":0" />  Although they met and lived in Philadelphia, Pierce's mother was a daughter of [[Pierce Butler]], a [[Founding Father]] who represented South Carolina at the Constitutional Convention. By agreeing to change his last name from Mease to Butler - as his grandfather's will had demanded, Butler became heir to the cotton, tobacco and rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] of his grandfather on Butler Island, just south of [[Darien, Georgia]], and to the hundreds of [[slaves]] who worked them.  By the time the couple's daughters, Sarah and Frances, were born, Butler had inherited three of his [[Butler Island Plantation|grandfather's plantations]] on [[Butler Island (Georgia)|Butler Island]], just south of Darien, Georgia, and the hundreds of people who were enslaved on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineages.com/slaves-and-their-owners/largest-slave-auction-in-american-history/|title=Largest Slave Auction in American History|date=21 July 2013}}</ref>

He made trips to the plantations during the early years of their marriage, but never took Kemble or their children with him. At Kemble's insistence, they finally spent the winter of 1838–1839 at the plantations at Butler and [[St. Simons Island, Georgia|St. Simons]] islands, in conditions primitive compared to their house in Philadelphia, and Kemble kept a diary of her observations, flavored strongly by [[abolitionist]] sentiment. Kemble was shocked by the living and working conditions of the slaves and [[Treatment of slaves in the United States|their treatment]] by the overseers and managers. She tried to improve matters,{{Clarify|date=March 2015}} complaining to her husband about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and about the [[mixed-race]] slave children attributed to the overseer, Roswell King, Jr.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Butler disapproved of Kemble's outspokenness, forbidding her to publish.

Marital tensions had emerged when the family returned to Philadelphia in the spring of 1839.  Apart from their disagreements over slave treatment on Butler's plantations, Kemble was "embittered and embarrassed" by Butler's marital infidelities.<ref>Malcolm Bell, ''Major Butler's Legacy: Five Generations of a Slaveholding Family'', Athens and London: University of Georgia, 1987, pp. 288–310<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Butler threatened to deny Kemble access to their daughters if she published any of her observations about the plantations.<ref name="David 2007 p. 154">David (2007), ''A Performed Life'', p. 154.</ref> 

By 1845–1847, the marriage had failed irretrievably and Kemble returned to England.<ref name=":0" />  

===Separation and divorce===

Butler filed for a divorce in 1847, after they had been separated for some time, citing abandonment and misdeed by Kemble.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Wister |first1=Fanny Kemble |title=Fanny, The American Kemble: Her Journals and Unpublished Letters |date=1972 |publisher=South Pass Press |location=Tallahassee}}</ref>  The couple endured a bitter and protracted divorce in 1849, with Butler retaining custody of their two daughters. At that time, with divorce rare, the father was customarily awarded custody in the patriarchal society. Other than brief visits, Kemble was not reunited with her daughters until each came of age at 21.<ref name="Fanny Kemble's civil wars">{{Cite book |last1=Clinton |first1=Catherine |title=Fanny Kemble's civil wars |date=2000 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-684-84414-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/fannykemblescivi00clin_0}}</ref>

Her ex-husband squandered a fortune estimated at $700,000, but was saved from bankruptcy by a sale on 2–3 March 1859 of 436 people he held in slavery. [[The Great Slave Auction]], at Ten Broeck racetrack outside [[Savannah, Georgia]], was the largest single slave auction in United States history. As such, it was covered by national reporters.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/murray:@field(DOCID+@lit(lcrbmrpt2305div1)) "Great Auction of Slaves at Savannah, Georgia"], ''New York Tribune'', 9 March 1859, at ''American Memory'', Library of Congress.</ref>

After the [[American Civil War]], Butler tried to run his plantations with free labour, but failed to make a profit. He died of [[malaria]] in Georgia in 1867. Neither Butler nor Kemble remarried.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=David |first1=Deirdre |title=Fanny Kemble: a performed life |date=2007 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-4023-8}}</ref>

==Later stage career==

In England, she began to act on the stage again - at first in plays, and then as a "reader" of Shakespeare's plays at lecture rooms and concert halls.  She returned to the theatre and toured major US cities, giving successful readings of Shakespeare plays.   Following her father's example, she appeared with success as a Shakespearean reader, rather than acting in plays. She toured the United States. 

Kemble's success as a Shakespearean reader enabled her to buy a home in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/09/fanny-kemble-html Harvard Magazine: Fanny Kemble, Brief life of a literary actress: 1809-1893 by Catherine Clinton] Retrieved 2017-05-05.</ref> 

In 1877, she returned to London to join her younger daughter Frances, who had moved there with her British husband and child. She lived in London and was active in society, befriending the writer [[Henry James]]. Using her maiden name, Kemble lived there until her death.  During this period she was a prominent and popular figure in London society, and became a great friend of the American writer [[Henry James]] during her later years. His novel, ''[[Washington Square (novel)|Washington Square]]'' (1880), was based on a story Kemble told him about one of her relatives.<ref>[Singer, Irving.  ''Cinematic Mythmaking'', MIT Press, 2008. pp.88–89.]</ref>

==Literary career==
Kemble wrote two plays, ''Francis the First'' (1832) and ''The Star of Seville'' (1837). She also published a volume of poems (1844). She published the first volume of her memoirs, ''Journal'', in 1835, shortly after her marriage. 

She waited until 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], to publish her anti-slavery ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite ODNB |title=Kemble [married name Butler], Frances Anne [Fanny] (1809–1893), actress and author {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |language=en |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15318|year=2004}}</ref>  It has become her best-known work in the United States: she published several other volumes of journals. It included her observations of slavery and life on her husband's Southern plantation in the winter of 1838–1839. It contains the earliest-known written use of the word "[[vegetarian]]": "The sight and smell of raw meat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably, indeed, return entirely to my green and salad days."<ref>Fanny Kemble, ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839'', Harper and Brothers, New York, 1863, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WaFiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA197 197–198].</ref>{{pb}}After separating from Butler in the 1840s, Kemble travelled in Italy and wrote a two-volume book on this time, ''A Year of Consolation'' (1847).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brown, Clements, and Grundy, eds. |title=Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles: From the Beginnings to Present.|url=http://orlando.cambridge.org|website=orlando.cambridge.org|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2006–2018 }}</ref>

In 1863 Kemble also published a volume of plays, including translations from [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. These were followed by additional memoirs: ''Records of a Girlhood'' (1878); ''Records of Later Life'' (1882); ''Far Away and Long Ago'' (1889); and ''Further Records'' (1891). Her various reminiscences contain much valuable material about the social and theatrical history of the period. She also published ''[[Notes on Some of Shakespeare's Plays]]'' (1882), based on long experience in acting and reading his works.

In 2000, [[Harvard University Press]] published an edited compilation from her journals.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} These included ''Record of a Girlhood'' (1878) and ''Records of Later Life (1882).<ref>''XIX Century Fiction'', Part I, A–K. Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019.</ref>

==Descendants==
Kemble's older daughter, Sarah Butler, married Owen Jones Wister, an American doctor. Their one child, [[Owen Wister]], grew up to become a popular American novelist, writing in 1902 a popular western, ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]''.

Fanny's other daughter Frances met James Leigh in Georgia. He was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] born in England. The couple married in 1871, and their one child, Alice Leigh, was born in 1874. An attempt was made to run Frances's father's plantations there with free labour, but no profit could be made. Leaving Georgia in 1877, they moved permanently to England. Frances Butler Leigh defended her father in the continuing post-war dispute over slavery as an institution. Based on her experience, Leigh published ''Ten Years on a Georgian Plantation since the War'' (1883), a rebuttal to her mother's account.<ref name="Fanny Kemble's civil wars"/>

==Death==
Her granddaughter Alice Leigh was present when Fanny Kemble died in London in 1893.

==Controversy==
While Kemble's account of the plantations has been criticised, it is seen as notable for voicing the enslaved black people, especially enslaved black women, and has been drawn on by many historians.<ref name="gaenc">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-792&pid=s-54 "Fanny Kemble"], ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''<!-- publishing info, year(s), ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> As noted earlier, her daughter published a rebuttal account. Margaret Davis Cate published a strong critique in the ''[[Georgia Historical Quarterly]]'' in 1960. In the early 21st century, historians [[Catherine Clinton]]{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{quotation needed|date=June 2016}} and Deirdre David studied Kemble's ''Journal'' and raised questions{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{quotation needed|date=June 2016}}<!--David just mentions that in an article, King expressed a 'calmly reasoned view', 'believed in the power of rewards' and 'advocated teaching the slaves industry, perseverance, and cleanliness'. I don't see any questioning of Kemble in this connection.--> about her portrayal of Roswell King, father and son, who successively managed Pierce Butler's plantations, and about Kemble's own racial sentiments.

On Kemble's racial views, David notes how she would call black slaves stupid, lazy, filthy and ugly, but such views were then common and compatible with opposing slavery and outrage at its cruelties.<ref>Deirdre David, ''Kemble: A Performed Life'', Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2007, p. 162.</ref>

Clinton noted that in 1930, Julia King, granddaughter of Roswell King, Jr., stated that Kemble had falsified her account of him after he spurned her affections.<ref>Fanny Kemble, ''Fanny Kemble's Journals/ Edited and with an Introduction by Catherine Clinton.'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 15–16.</ref> There is little evidence in Kemble's ''Journal'' that she encountered Roswell King, Jr., on more than a few occasions, and none that she knew his wife, the former Julia Rebecca Maxwell. But she criticized Maxwell as "a female fiend" because a slave named Sophy told her that Mrs. King had ordered the flogging of Judy and Scylla, "of whose children Mr. K[ing] was the father."<ref>Kemble, p. 269.</ref> Roswell King, Jr., was no longer in the employ of her husband when Pierce Butler and Kemble began their short residency in Georgia. King had resigned due to "growing uneasiness... born of a dispute between the Kings and the Butlers over fees the elder King thought were owed him as co-administrator of Major Butler's estate."<ref>Bell, pp. 254 and 271.</ref>

Before arriving in Georgia, Kemble had written, "It is notorious that almost every Southern planter has a family more or less numerous of illegitimate coloured children."<ref>Kemble, p. 10.</ref> Her statements about Roswell King, Sr., and Roswell King, Jr., and their alleged status as white fathers of enslaved mulatto children, are based on what she was told by other slaves. In some cases, individuals relied on hearsay accounts of their paternity, although European ancestry was visible. The mulatto Renty, for example, was "ashamed" to ask his mother about the identity of his father. He believed he was the son of Roswell King, Jr. because "Mr. C[ouper]'s children told me so, and I 'spect they know it."<ref>Kemble, p. 249.</ref> John Couper, the Scottish-born owner of a rival plantation adjacent to Pierce Butler's Hampton Point on St. Simon's Island, had had marked disagreements with the Roswell Kings in the past. Clinton suggests that Kemble favored Couper's accounts.<ref>Kemble, pp. 265–267 and 391–392.</ref>{{quotation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Biographies==
Numerous books have appeared on Fanny Kemble and her family, including Deirdre David's ''A Performed Life''<ref name=":1" /> (2007) and Vanessa Dickerson's passage on Kemble in ''Dark Victorians'' (2008).

Some recent biographies that focus on Kemble's role as an [[abolitionist]] include [[Catherine Clinton]]'s ''Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars: The Story of America's Most Unlikely Abolitionist'' (2000). Others have studied the theatrical careers of Kemble and her family. One of these, Henry Gibbs' ''[[Affectionately Yours, Fanny: Fanny Kemble and the Theatre]]'', appeared in eight editions between 1945 and 1947.
