'''Sumitranandan Pant''' (20 May 1900 – 28 December 1977)<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=स्पर्श भाग 2|publisher=[[NCERT]]|isbn=81-7450-647-0|pages=25|language=hi|chapter=पर्वत प्रदेश में पावास|chapter-url=http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_10.Hindi.Sparsh/K-5.pdf}}</ref> was an Indian poet. He was one of the most celebrated 20th century poets of the [[Hindi language]] and was known for romanticism in his poems which were inspired by nature, people and beauty within.<ref name=b1>Rubin, David (1993).

==Early life==
His father served as the manager of a local tea garden, and was also a landholder, so Pant was never in want financially growing up. He grew up in the same village and always cherished a love for the beauty and flavor of rural India, which is evident in all his major works.

Pant enrolled in Queens College in Banaras in 1918. There he began reading the works of [[Sarojini Naidu]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], as well as English Romantic poets. These figures would all have a powerful influence on his writing.<ref name=b1/> In 1919 he moved to [[Allahabad]] to study at Muir College. As an anti-British gesture he only attended for two years. He then focused more on poetry, publishing ''Pallav'' in 1926. This collection established him as a literary giant of the Hindi renaissance that had begun with [[Jaishankar Prasad]]. In the introduction to the book, Pant expressed dissatisfaction that Hindi speakers "think in one language and express themselves in another."<ref name=b1/> He felt that [[Braj Bhasha|Braj]] was out of date and sought to help usher in a new national language.

Pant moved to [[Kalakankar]] in 1931. For nine years he lived an secluded life close to nature. Simultaneously he grew enamored with the works and thinking of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], dedicating several verses to them in the poetry he produced during this time.<ref name=":0" /> Pant returned to Almora in 1941 where he attended drama classes at the Uday Shankar Cultural Centre. He also read Aurobindo's ''The Life Divine'', which heavily influenced him. Three years later he moved to [[Chennai|Madras]] and then to [[Pondicherry]], attending Aurobindo's ashram. In 1946 he returned to Allahabad to resume his role among the country's other leading writers.

==Literary career==
He is considered one of the major poets of the ''[[Chhayavaad]]i'' school of Hindi literature.<ref name=":0" /> Pant mostly wrote in [[Sanskrit]]ized Hindi. Pant authored twenty-eight published works including poetry, verse plays and essays.

Apart from ''Chhayavaadi'' poems, Pant also wrote progressive, socialist, humanist poems and<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTWrBxcysOU|title=Chhayavaadi Poet Sumitranandan Pant|work=Youtube}}</ref>
philosophical (influenced by [[Sri Aurobindo]]) poems. Pant eventually moved beyond this style. As the late scholar and translator of Pant, [[David Rubin (author)|David Rubin]], writes, "In the early forties the new psychological and experimental "schools" were emerging. It was typical of both [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala'|Nirala]] and Pant that they themselves anticipated these trends and, by the time the new approaches were in vogue, they had already moved on to newer areas of experimentation."<ref name=b1/>

Mahapran Nirala once remarked: 

{{Quote|text=The most powerful thing in Pant Ji is that, like Shelley, he makes his composition mellifluous and tender by enriching it with numerous similes and metaphors.|author=Mahapran Nirala|title=|source=<ref name=":0" />}}

==Awards==
In 1960, Pant received the [[Sahitya Academy]] award, given by India's Academy of Letters, for ''Kala Aur Budhdha Chand''.<ref name=":0" />

In 1969, Pant became the first Hindi poet to receive the [[Jnanpith Award]], considered to be India's highest accolade for literature. This was awarded to him for a collection of his most famous poems titled ''Chidambara''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html|title=Jnanpith Laureates Official listings|publisher=[[Jnanpith]] Website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122739/http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html|archive-date=13 October 2007}}</ref>
