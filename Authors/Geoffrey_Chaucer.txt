'''Geoffrey Chaucer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɔː|s|ər}}; {{circa|1340s}} – 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely considered the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Geoffrey Chaucer in Context |url=https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/literature/anglo-saxon-and-medieval-literature/geoffrey-chaucer-context?format=HB |date=2019|access-date=20 April 2020 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ref=Cambridge.org}}</ref> He has been called the "father of English literature", or, alternatively, the "father of English poetry".<ref>{{cite news |title=Chaucer |url=https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/literature/anglo-saxon-and-medieval-literature/chaucer?format=PB&isbn=9781108034647 |date=2011|access-date=20 April 2020 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ref=Cambridge.org}}</ref> He was the first writer to be buried in what has since come to be called [[Poets' Corner]], in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Robert DeMaria, Jr., Heesok Chang, Samantha Zacher, eds, ''A Companion to British Literature, Volume 2: Early Modern Literature, 1450–1660'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 41.</ref> Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and [[astronomer]], composing the scientific ''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a [[bureaucrat]], [[courtier]], diplomat, and member of parliament.

Among Chaucer's many other works are ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''. He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of [[Middle English]] when the dominant literary languages in England were still [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]]. His contemporary [[Thomas Hoccleve]] hailed Chaucer as "the firste fyndere of our fair langage". Almost [[English words first attested in Chaucer|two thousand English words are first attested to Chaucerian manuscripts]].

Chaucer was born in London most likely in the early 1340s (by some accounts, including his monument, he was born in 1343), though the precise date and location remain unknown. The Chaucer family offers an extraordinary example of upward mobility. His great-grandfather was a tavern keeper, his grandfather worked as a purveyor of wines, and his father John Chaucer rose to become an important wine merchant with a royal appointment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Echard|first1=Sian|last2=Rouse|first2=Robert|title=The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain, 4 Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXoqDwAAQBAJ&q=chaucer+wine+purveyor&pg=PA425|page=425|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118396988|year=2017|access-date=11 September 2021}}</ref> Several previous generations of Geoffrey Chaucer's family had been [[Winemaker|vintners]]<ref name="Brewer1992">{{cite book|author=Derek Brewer|title=Chaucer and His World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_l3StHI3nBUC&pg=PA18|year=1992|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85991-366-9|pages=18–19}}</ref><ref name="Turner2019">{{cite book|author=Marion Turner|title=Chaucer: A European Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fA2GDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|date=9 April 2019|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-16009-2|page=26}}</ref> and merchants in [[Ipswich]].

In 1324, his father John Chaucer was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the 12-year-old to her daughter in an attempt to keep property in Ipswich. The aunt was imprisoned and fined £250, now equivalent to about £{{Inflation|UK|250|1324|r=-5|fmt=c}}, which suggests that the family was financially secure.<ref>Skeat, W. W., ed. ''The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899; Vol. I, pp. xi–xii.</ref>

John Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3 April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as "moneyer", said to be a [[moneyer]] at the [[Tower of London]]. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as ''me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie'', which translates as: "Geoffrey Chaucer, son of the vintner John Chaucer, London".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer: Romaunt of the rose.

===Career===

[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chaucer as a pilgrim, in the early 15th-century illuminated [[Ellesmere manuscript]] of the ''Canterbury Tales'']]
While records concerning the lives of his contemporaries [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]] are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career. The first of the "Chaucer Life Records" appears in 1357, in the household accounts of [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster|Elizabeth de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster|Countess of Ulster]], when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections,<ref>Skeat (1899); Vol. I, p. xvii.</ref> a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], the second surviving son of the king, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work |last1=Rossignol |first1=Rosalyn |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=551, 613 |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-8160-6193-8}}</ref>

In 1359, the early stages of the [[Hundred Years' War]], Edward III invaded France and Chaucer travelled with [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], Elizabeth's husband, as part of the [[History of the British Army|English army]]. In 1360, he was captured during the [[Reims Campaign|siege of Rheims]]. Edward paid £16 for his ransom,<ref>''Chaucer Life Records'', p. 24.</ref> a considerable sum {{Inflation|UK|value=16|start_year=1360|fmt=eq|cursign=£}},{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and Chaucer was released.

After this, Chaucer's life is uncertain, but he seems to have travelled in France, Spain, and [[Flanders]], possibly as a messenger and perhaps even going on a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]]. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, [[Thomas Chaucer]], had an illustrious career, as [[Chief Butler of England|chief butler]] to four kings, envoy to France, and [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Thomas's daughter, [[Alice de la Pole|Alice]], married the [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]]. Thomas's great-grandson (Geoffrey's great-great-grandson), [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln]], was the heir to the throne designated by [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] before he was deposed. Geoffrey's other children probably included Elizabeth Chaucy, a nun at [[Barking Abbey]],<ref>{{Cite book |title=Medieval English Nunneries, c. 1275 to 1535 |last=Power |first=Eileen |year=1988 |publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ll6BuF4-kgC&pg=PA19 |access-date=19 December 2007 |isbn=978-0-8196-0140-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Chaucer and His England |last=Coulton |first=G.

According to tradition, Chaucer studied law in the [[Inner Temple]] (an [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]]) at this time. He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[valet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' in honour of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Holt Literature and Language Arts |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=2003 |isbn=978-0030573743 |pages=113}}</ref>

Chaucer travelled to [[Picardy]] the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]]. Numerous scholars such as Skeat, Boitani, and Rowland<ref>Companion to Chaucer Studies, Rev. ed., Oxford UP, 1979</ref> suggested that, on this Italian trip, [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio]]. They introduced him to [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Italian poetry]], the forms and stories of which he would use later.<ref>Hopper, p. viii: ''He may actually have met Petrarch, and his reading of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio provided him with subject matter as well as inspiration for later writings.''</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Legend of Thebes and Literary Patricide in Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Statius |last1=Schwebel |first=Leah |journal=Studies in the Age of Chaucer |volume=36 |pages=139–68 |year=2014 |doi=10.1353/sac.2014.0028|s2cid=194954865 }}</ref> The purposes of a voyage in 1377 are mysterious, as details within the historical record conflict. Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.

In 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.

[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer.jpeg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]
A possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer "a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.

Chaucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.<ref>Morley, Henry (1890) ''English Writers: an attempt towards a history of English literature''. London: Cassell & Co.; Vol. V. p. 106.</ref> He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years, a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period. He was mentioned in law papers of 4 May 1380, involved in the [[raptus]] (rape or seizure) of Cecilia Chaumpaigne.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://chaumpaigne.org/the-legal-documents/ |title=The Legal Documents |last=Waymack |first=Anna |year=2016 |website=De raptu meo }}</ref> What was meant is unclear, but the incident seems to have been resolved quickly with an exchange of money in June 1380 and did not leave a stain on Chaucer's reputation. It is not known if Chaucer was in the City of London at the time of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], but if he was, he would have seen its leaders pass almost directly under his apartment window at [[Aldgate]].<ref>Saunders, Corrine J. (2006) ''A Concise Companion to Chaucer''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 19.</ref>

While still working as comptroller, Chaucer appears to have moved to [[Kent]], being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent, at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the '[[Wonderful Parliament]]' that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat, for which he was paid £24 9s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=F. R. |year=1943 |title=Chaucer and the Parliament of 1386 |journal=Speculum |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=80–86 |oclc=25967434 |doi=10.2307/2853640 |jstor=2853640|s2cid=159965790 }}</ref> On 15 October that year, he gave a deposition in the case of ''[[Scrope v.

He survived the political upheavals caused by the [[Lords Appellant]]s, despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well.

On 12 July 1389, Chaucer was appointed the [[Clerk of the Works|clerk of the king's works]], a sort of [[Construction foreman|foreman]] organising most of the king's building projects.<ref>Morley (1890), Vol. 5, p. 245.</ref> No major works were begun during his tenure, but he did conduct repairs on [[Westminster Palace]], [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor]], continued building the wharf at the [[Tower of London]], and built the stands for a tournament held in 1390. It may have been a difficult job, but it paid well: two [[shilling]]s a day, more than three times his salary as a comptroller. Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the King's park in [[Feckenham Forest]] in [[Worcestershire]], which was a largely honorary appointment.<ref>Forest of Feckenham, John Humphreys FSA, in Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeology Society's Transactions and proceedings, Volumes 44–45, p. 117.</ref>

===Later life===
[[File:Stained glass window on the north wall at Southwark Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1257997.jpg|thumb|upright|Interred in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]], Chaucer is also commemorated by this stained glass window at [[Southwark Cathedral]]]]
In September 1390, records say that Chaucer was robbed and possibly injured while conducting the business, and he stopped working in this capacity on 17 June 1391. He began as Deputy Forester in the royal forest of [[Petherton Park]] in [[North Petherton]], Somerset on 22 June.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weiskott |first=Eric |date=1 January 2013 |title=Chaucer the Forester: The Friar's Tale, Forest History, and Officialdom |jstor=10.5325/chaucerrev.47.3.0323 |journal=The Chaucer Review |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=323–336 |doi=10.5325/chaucerrev.47.3.0323}}</ref> This was no sinecure, with maintenance an important part of the job, although there were many opportunities to derive profit.

Richard II granted him an annual pension of 20 pounds in 1394 ({{Inflation|index=UK|value=20|start_year=1394|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}),<ref>Ward, p. 109.</ref> and Chaucer's name fades from the historical record not long after Richard's overthrow in 1399. The last few records of his life show his pension renewed by the new king, and his taking a lease on a residence within the [[Close of the Collegiate Church of St Peter|close of Westminster Abbey]] on 24 December 1399.<ref>Morley (1890); Vol. V, pp. 247–248.</ref> [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] renewed the grants assigned by Richard, but ''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse'' hints that the grants might not have been paid. The last mention of Chaucer is on 5 June 1400 when some debts owed to him were repaid.

Chaucer died of unknown causes on 25 October 1400, although the only evidence for this date comes from the engraving on his tomb which was erected more than 100 years after his death. There is some speculation<ref>{{cite book |author1=Jones, Terry |author2= Yeager, Robert F. |author3= Doran, Terry |author4= Fletcher, Alan |author5= D'or, Juliett |year=2003 |title=Who Murdered Chaucer?: A Medieval Mystery |isbn=0-413-75910-5 }}</ref> that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey's close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making him the first writer interred in the area now known as [[Poets' Corner]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Poets' Corner History|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/about-the-abbey/history/poets-corner |access-date=12 May 2020 |agency=WestminsterAbbey.org}}</ref>

==Relationship to John of Gaunt==
Chaucer was a close friend of [[John of Gaunt]], the wealthy [[Duke of Lancaster]] and father of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], and he served under Lancaster's patronage. Near the end of their lives, Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law when Lancaster married [[Katherine Swynford]] (de Roet) in 1396; she was the sister of [[Philippa (de) Roet|Philippa (Pan) de Roet]], whom Chaucer had married in 1366.

Chaucer's ''[[The Book of the Duchess|Book of the Duchess]]'' (also known as the ''Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse'')<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Chaucer |first1=Geoffrey |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of "A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil" (1318–1319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, "And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght" (948–949). The phrase "long castel" is a reference to Lancaster (also called "Loncastel" and "Longcastell"), "walles white" is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, "Seynt Johan" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and "ryche hil" is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. "White" is the English translation of the French word "blanche", implying that the white lady was [[Blanche of Lancaster]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Wilcockson |first1=Colin |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

===Poem ''Fortune''===

Chaucer's short poem ''Fortune'', believed to have been written in the 1390s, is also thought to refer to Lancaster.<ref name="Gross, Zaila 1987 635">{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Gross |first1=Zaila |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

''Fortune'', in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, "And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, "My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends.

''Fortune'' turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and "Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne" (78–79). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76 ("as three of you or tweyne") is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.<ref name="Gross, Zaila 1987 635" />

Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's "beste frend". ''Fortune'' states three times in her response to the plaintiff, "And also, you still have your best friend alive" (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his "beste frend" in the envoy when appealing to his "noblesse" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at ''Fortune'' that she shall not take his friend from him.

==Religious beliefs==
Chaucer's attitudes toward the Church should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity. He seems to have respected and admired Christians and to have been one himself, though he also recognised that many people in the church were venal and corrupt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/was-chaucer-favor-church-opposed-326550 |title=Was Chaucer in favor of the church or opposed to it? – eNotes |website=eNotes}}</ref> He wrote in ''Canterbury Tales'', "now I beg all those that listen to this little treatise, or read it, that if there be anything in it that pleases them, they thank our Lord Jesus Christ for it, from whom proceeds all understanding and goodness."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/poets/geoffrey-chaucer.html |title=Geoffrey Chaucer}}</ref>

==Literary works==

Chaucer's first major work was ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', an elegy for [[Blanche of Lancaster]] who died in 1368. Two other early works were ''[[Anelida and Arcite]]'' and ''[[The House of Fame]]''. He wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he held the job of customs comptroller for London (1374 to 1386). His ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' all date from this time. It is believed that he started ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 1380s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |edition =3 |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor1-last=Benson |author-link=Larry Benson |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford UP |year=1988 |chapter=Introduction: The Canon and Chronology of Chaucer's Works|pages=xxii-xxv |first1=Larry D. |last1=Benson}}</ref>

Chaucer also translated [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' and ''[[Roman de la Rose|The Romance of the Rose]]'' by [[Guillaume de Lorris]] (extended by Jean de Meun). [[Eustache Deschamps]] called himself a "nettle in Chaucer's garden of poetry".

Chaucer's ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' describes the form and use of the [[astrolabe]] in detail and is sometimes cited as the first example of technical writing in the English language, and it indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents.<ref>'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p9: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966</ref> ''[[The equatorie of the planetis]]'' is a scientific work similar to the ''Treatise'' and sometimes ascribed to Chaucer because of its language and handwriting, an identification which scholars no longer deem tenable.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reviewed Work(s): The Authorship of ''The Equatorie of the Planetis'' by Kari Anne Rand Schmidt |first=Jeremy J. |last=Smith |journal=[[The Modern Language Review]] |volume=90 |issue=2 |year=1995 |pages=405–406 |jstor=3734556 |doi=10.2307/3734556 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Reviewed Work(s): The Authorship of ''The Equatorie of the Planetis'' by Kari Anne Rand Schmidt |first=N.

[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|left|Portrait of Chaucer from a 1412 manuscript by [[Thomas Hoccleve]], who may have met Chaucer]]
Chaucer wrote in continental [[Accentual-syllabic verse|accentual-syllabic metre]], a style which had developed in English literature since around the 12th century as an alternative to the [[Alliterative verse|alliterative]] Anglo-Saxon [[Metre (poetry)|metre]].<ref>C. B. McCully and J. J. Anderson, ''English Historical Metrics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 97.</ref> Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter|iambic pentametre]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.<ref>[[Marchette Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E. P. Dutton, 1946, p. 89.</ref> The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''.

The poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.<ref>Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p. 147.</ref> This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy – of which Chaucer was a part – remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]].

[[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death. This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience.

The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]].

Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. ''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of almost two thousand [[English words first attested in Chaucer]].<ref>Cannon, Christopher (1998).

===Literary===
[[File:William Blake - Geoffrey Chaucer - Manchester City Gallery - Tempera on canvas c 1800.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Chaucer by Romantic era poet and painter [[William Blake]], c. 1800]]
Widespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. [[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later "additions" from original Chaucer.

Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.<ref>"From The Preface to ''Fables Ancient and Modern''". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Stephen Greenblatt. 8th ed. Vol. C. New York, London: Norton, 2006. 2132–33. p. 2132.</ref> It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of [[Walter William Skeat]]'s work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England.<ref>{{cite news |title=William Caxton's illustrated second edition of The Canterbury Tales |url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/william-caxton-and-canterbury-tales |access-date=22 July 2021 |agency=British Library}}</ref>

===English===
Chaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England.

Although Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:

===Valentine's Day and romance===
The first recorded association of [[Valentine's Day]] with romantic love is believed to be in Chaucer's ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'' (1382), a [[dream vision]] portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates.<ref name="oruch">Oruch, Jack B., "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2847741 St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February]", ''Speculum'', '''56''' (1981): 534–65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be "the original mythmaker in this instance."

==Critical reception==
===Early criticism===
The poet [[Thomas Hoccleve]], who may have met Chaucer and considered him his role model, hailed Chaucer as "the firste fyndere of our fair langage".<ref>Thomas Hoccleve, ''The Regiment of Princes'', ''TEAMS'' website, [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/hoccfrm.htm University of Rochester, Robbins Library]</ref> [[John Lydgate]] referred to Chaucer within his own text ''The Fall of Princes'' as the "lodesterre … off our language".<ref>As noted by Carolyn Collette in "Fifteenth Century Chaucer", an essay published in the book ''A Companion to Chaucer'' {{ISBN|0-631-23590-6}}</ref> Around two centuries later, Sir [[Philip Sidney]] greatly praised ''Troilus and Criseyde'' in his own ''Defence of Poesie''.<ref>"Chawcer undoubtedly did excellently in his Troilus and Creseid: of whome trulie I knowe not whether to mervaile more, either that hee in that mistie time could see so clearly, or that wee in this cleare age, goe so stumblingly after him." The text can be found at [http://www.uoregon.edu/~rbear/defence.html uoregon.edu]</ref> During the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Chaucer came to be viewed as a symbol of the nation's poetic heritage.<ref>Richard Utz, "Chaucer among the Victorians," ''Oxford Handbook of Victorian Medievalism'', ed. Joanna Parker and Corinna Wagner (Oxford: OUP, 2020): pp. 189-201.</ref>

===Manuscripts and audience===
The large number of surviving manuscripts of Chaucer's works is testimony to the enduring interest in his poetry prior to the arrival of the printing press. There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].<ref>Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p. 1118.</ref> Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost.

Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes.  This included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own.

Lollards were particularly attracted to Chaucer's satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham ([[Amersham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]), was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a "boke of the Tales of Caunterburie" among other suspect volumes.<ref>Potter, Russell A., "Chaucer and the Authority of Language: The Politics and Poetics of the Vernacular in Late Medieval England", ''Assays'' VI (Carnegie-Mellon Press, 1991), p. 91.</ref>

===Printed editions===
[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|upright|thumb|Title page of Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'', c. 1400]]
[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two [[folio]] editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |title=A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales | location=Westminster, England 
| publisher=William Caxton | year=1473 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031075730/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |archive-date=31 October 2005}}</ref> Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority.
 
[[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.)

There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer's works, and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is not doubt this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer's work.  ''The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,'' published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer's collected works. Thynne's editions of ''Chaucer's Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention.<ref name=Stow1561 /> As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor's intentions.

[[File:Chaucer knight.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Opening page of [[The Knight's Tale]]—the first tale from Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''—from the [[Ellesmere Manuscript]], early 15th century ]]
In the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wikt:canon|canon]] began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.

Probably the most significant aspect of the growing [[apocrypha]] is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] [[Lollard]], primarily the ''Testament of Love'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''. As "Chaucerian" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic—or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic—to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.

The famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition. The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''.)

Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a "right Wiclevian" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. ([[Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his "Life of Chaucer".) No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist—there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.

[[John Stow]] (1525–1605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' in 1561<ref name=Stow1561>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |title=UWM.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111220719/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |archive-date=11 November 2005}}</ref> brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] pared the canon down in his 1775 edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg079.htm |title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer: To Which are Added an Essay on his Language and Versification, and an Introductory Discourse, Together with Notes and a Glossary by the late Thomas Tyrwhitt.

What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.

[[File:Chaucer 1602.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition. The two top shields display: ''Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged'' (Chaucer), that at bottom left: ''Gules, three [[Breaking wheel|Catherine Wheels]] or'' (Roet, [[canting arms]], French ''rouet'' = "spinning wheel"), and that at bottom right displays Roet quartering ''Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or'' (Chaucer) with crest of Chaucer above: ''A unicorn head'']]

In his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional "Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer". Speght's "Life" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king's views on religion. Speght states, "In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people." Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:

::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.

Later, in "The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]" to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:
::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.

Speght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]. Ironically – and perhaps consciously so – an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, "low", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position.

Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''.

The myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.

Alongside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments...]]''. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha. ''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''.

Speght's "Life of Chaucer" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe "thought it not out of season … to couple … some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer" with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]].

Probably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he <blockquote>"marvel[s] to consider … how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right [[John Wycliffe|Wicklevian]], or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love … Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read."<ref name="Foxe">{{cite book |title=The Acts and Monuments of John Foxe: With a Life of the Martyrologist, and Vindication of the Work, Volume 4 |date=1846 |publisher=Seeley, Burnside, and Seeley |pages=249, 252, 253}}</ref></blockquote>

It is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of "The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther" when "Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned."<ref name="Foxe"/>

Foxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.

[[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, <blockquote>"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer."<ref>{{Cite ODNB |first=E.

===Modern scholarship===

Although Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chaucer: The Critical Heritage.

Scholars such as [[Frederick James Furnivall]], who founded the Chaucer Society in 1868, pioneered the establishment of diplomatic editions of Chaucer's major texts, along with careful accounts of Chaucer's language and prosody. [[Walter William Skeat]], who like Furnivall was closely associated with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.

With the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The ''Chaucer Review'' was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies. In 1994, literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] placed Chaucer among the [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|greatest Western writers of all time]], and in 1997 expounded on [[William Shakespeare]]'s debt to the author.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Bloom |year=1994 |title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages |page=[https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloorich/page/226 226] |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace |isbn=0-15-195747-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloorich/page/226 }}</ref>

==List of works==
The following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.

===Major works===
*Translation of ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', possibly extant as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]''
*''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''
*''[[The House of Fame]]''
*''[[Anelida and Arcite]]''
*''[[Parlement of Foules]]''
*Translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' as ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''
*''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''
*''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''
*''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''
*''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''

===Short poems===
[[File:Balade to Rosemounde.jpg|upright|thumb|''Balade to Rosemounde'', 1477 print]]
*''An ABC''
*''Chaucers Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn'' (disputed)<ref>Weiskott, Eric. "''Adam Scriveyn'' and Chaucer's Metrical Practice." ''Medium Ævum'' 86 (2017): 147–51.</ref>
*''The Complaint unto Pity''
*''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse''
*''[[The Complaint of Mars]]''
*''The Complaint of Venus''
*''A Complaint to His Lady''
*''The Former Age''
*''Fortune''
*''Gentilesse''
*''Lak of Stedfastnesse''
*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Scogan''
*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Bukton''
*''Proverbs''
*''Balade to Rosemounde''
*''Truth''
*''Womanly Noblesse''

===Poems of doubtful authorship===
*''Against Women Unconstant''
*''A Balade of Complaint''
*''Complaynt D'Amours''
*''Merciles Beaute''
*''The Equatorie of the Planets''&nbsp;– A rough translation of a Latin work derived from an Arab work of the same title. It is a description of the construction and use of a [[Equatorium|planetary equatorium]], which was used in calculating planetary orbits and positions (at the time it was believed the sun orbited the Earth). The similar ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', not usually doubted as Chaucer's work, in addition to Chaucer's name as a gloss to the manuscript are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer. However, the evidence Chaucer wrote such a work is questionable, and as such is not included in ''The Riverside Chaucer''. If Chaucer did not compose this work, it was probably written by a contemporary.

===Works presumed lost===
*''Of the Wreched Engendrynge of Mankynde'', possible translation of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]'s ''De miseria conditionis humanae''
*''Origenes upon the Maudeleyne''
*''The Book of the Leoun''&nbsp;– "The Book of the Lion" is mentioned in Chaucer's retraction. It has been speculated that it may have been a redaction of [[Guillaume de Machaut]]'s 'Dit dou lyon,' a story about courtly love (a subject about which Chaucer frequently wrote).

===Spurious works===
*''[[The Pilgrim's Tale]]''&nbsp;– written in the 16th century with many Chaucerian allusions
*''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'' or ''The Complaint of the Ploughman''&nbsp;– a [[Lollard]] satire later appropriated as a Protestant text
*''[[Pierce the Ploughman's Crede]]''&nbsp;– a Lollard satire later appropriated by Protestants
*''The Ploughman's Tale''&nbsp;– its body is largely a version of [[Thomas Hoccleve]]'s "Item de Beata Virgine"<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/bowers-canterbury-tales-fifteenth-century-ploughmans-tale-introduction |chapter=The Ploughman's Tale: Introduction |editor1-first=John M. |editor1-last=Bowers |title=The Canterbury Tales: Fifteenth-Century Continuations and Additions |year=1992|location= Kalamazoo |publisher=Medieval Institute Publications}}</ref>
*"La Belle Dame Sans Merci"&nbsp;– frequently attributed to Chaucer, but actually a translation by Richard Roos of [[Alain Chartier]]'s poem<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/sym4int.htm |title=Chaucerian Dream Visions and Complaints |year=2004 |chapter=La Belle Dame sans Mercy: Introduction |editor1-first= Dana M. |editor1-last=Symons |location= Kalamazoo |publisher=Medieval Institute Publications}}</ref>
*''The Testament of Love''&nbsp;– actually by [[Thomas Usk]]
*''[[Jack Upland]]''&nbsp;– a Lollard satire
*''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]''&nbsp;– a 15th-century allegory

===Derived works===
*''[[God Spede the Plough]]''&nbsp;– Borrows twelve stanzas of Chaucer's ''Monk's Tale''
