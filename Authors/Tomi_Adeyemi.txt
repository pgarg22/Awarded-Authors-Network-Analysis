==Early life==
Tomi Adeyemi was born on August 1, 1993<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/tomi_adeyemi/status/1024699215690260480|title=thank you all for making this the best birthday yet...|last=Adeyemi|first=Tomi|date=August 1, 2018|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}</ref><ref name="SydneyHerald" /> in the United States to parents who emigrated from [[Nigeria]]. Her father was a physician in Nigeria but found employment as a taxi driver while he waited to transfer his qualifications. Adeyemi's mother worked as a cleaning woman. Adeyemi grew up in [[Chicago]] and was not exposed to her Nigerian heritage; her parents decided not to teach her or her siblings their native tongue. She would later embrace her heritage as an adult, explaining, "I didn't think too much of it and I think that is the kind of an experience of the first generation. You're just trying to fit in. You don't realize how cool your culture is until you get out of that phase of trying to fit in." She would later describe one of her novels as a love letter to her culture.<ref name=SydneyHerald>Kembrey, Melanie (March 9, 2018).

Adeyemi wrote her first story when she was five years old, and continued to write throughout her teenage years. She graduated from [[Hinsdale Central High School]] in [[Hinsdale, Illinois]] in 2011.<ref name=DevilsAdvocate>Wols, Lauren; Eck, Everett; Anderson, Hannah (March 21, 2018).

==Career==
[[File:10.8.17FantasyPanelByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|left|Adeyemi, top left, with other fantasy authors at a panel discussion at the 2017 [[New York Comic Con]]]]
After Tomi Adeyemi moved to California, she worked at a Los Angeles film production company. When she decided to reduce her hours there to write a book, her parents, who had uprooted their lives in Nigeria to give her a better life, were not entirely accepting of this idea. Adeyemi says, "I'm first-generation Nigerian so I came out of my mother's womb and I was supposed to be a doctor, a lawyer or engineer, and I was like 'oh hey, I'm quitting my very well-paying job at a very stable company that has many future job opportunities for me' ... I'm so lucky that my parents were like, 'obviously we're not crazy about this but we love you'."<ref name=SydneyHerald/>

While working on her first novel Adeyemi was a creative writing coach.<ref name=DevilsAdvocate/>

Adeyemi's first written novel did not yield positive feedback. She instead set herself a year to write another book that became ''Children of Blood and Bone'', and she entered it into Pitch Wars, a competition program in which emerging writers are matched with editors and authors to revise their work before they submit it to a literary agent.<ref name=SydneyHerald/>

Adeyemi's debut novel, ''[[Children of Blood and Bone]],'' was released in March 2018, and debuted at number 1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' Young Adult Hardcover Bestseller List.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2018/03/25/young-adult-hardcover/|title=Young Adult Hardcover Books - Best Sellers|date= March 25, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 6, 2018|language=en}}</ref> It is a young-adult (YA) fantasy novel,<ref name=":0"/> featuring protagonist Zélie Adebola, who fights a monarchy to return magic to her people. Adeyemi has said she wanted to write a fantasy novel set in West Africa so that "a little Black girl [could] pick up my book one day and see herself as the star...I want her to know that she’s beautiful and she matters and she can have a crazy, magical adventure even if an ignorant part of the world tells her she can never be [[Hermione Granger]]."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/tomi-adeyemis-unpublished-novel-fantasy-movies/|title=Tomi Adeyemi's unpublished novel and fantasy movies|date= April 1, 2017|work=BusinessDay|access-date= June 20, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> ''[[Children of Blood and Bone]]'' was awarded the 2018 [[Andre Norton Award]] for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy and is a finalist for the 2019 [[Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book]].

Adeyemi made a guest appearance in the final episode of [[Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Sunshine Moxie|title=Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis - Episode 207 - "AIW"|date=2018-11-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovc_j55cMGg|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>

For reasons unclear, her second novel, ''Children of Virtue and Vengeance'' was pushed back from its initial release date of March 2019 to June 2019. Adeyemi later stated on her Instagram that her publisher offered her two choices: June 2019 and December 2019, but she chose the former so fans would not have to wait. Unfortunately, the workload was too much and the author, editor, and publisher agreed to give the second book more time. ''Children of Virtue and Vengeance'' became a #1 [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Bestseller]] in December 2019.

In addition to her success as a novelist, Adeyemi teaches creative writing through her online course, [https://www.thewritersroadmap.net/ The Writer's Roadmap].

==Controversy==
In November 2018, Tomi Adeyemi accused [[Nora Roberts]] of plagiarizing the title of her novel, ''[[Of Blood and Bone]]'' from her ''[[Children of Blood and Bone]]'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tomi_adeyemi/status/1067496955108978688|title=Twitter Profile|last=Adeyemi|first=Tomi|date=November 29, 2018|website=Twitter|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181129224146/https://twitter.com/tomi_adeyemi/status/1067496955108978688|archive-date=November 29, 2018|url-status=}}</ref> Adeyemi later retracted the accusation saying "after talking to her, I believe our titles were created in isolation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tomi_adeyemi/status/1067680544232693760|title=Twitter Profile|last=Adeyemi|first=Tomi|date=November 29, 2018|website=Twitter|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181129224035/https://twitter.com/tomi_adeyemi/status/1067680544232693760|archive-date=November 29, 2018|url-status=}}</ref> Roberts later clarified that her book had been titled and submitted to her publisher one year before Adeyemi's.
