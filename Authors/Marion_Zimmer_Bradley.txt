'''Marion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley''' (June 3, 1930 – September 25, 1999) was an American author of [[fantasy]], [[historical fantasy]], [[science fiction]], and [[science fantasy]] [[novel]]s, and is best known for the [[Arthurian fiction]] novel ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', and the [[Darkover series]]. While noted for the [[feminist]] perspective in her writing, her reputation has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations of [[child sexual abuse]] and [[rape]] by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, and for assisting her second husband, convicted pedophile [[Walter H. Breen]], to rape and abuse multiple unrelated children.

After her divorce, Bradley married [[numismatist]]  [[Walter H. Breen]] on June 3, 1964. They had a daughter, Moira Greyland, who is a professional [[harpist]] and singer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moiragreyland.net/|title=Moira Greyland|website=Moira Greyland|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> and a son, Mark Greyland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://starfire-studio.com/markgreyland.html|title=Secret Keeper No More: An Interview With Mark Greyland|date=2014-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221115834/http://starfire-studio.com/markgreyland.html|archive-date=21 December 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> Moira's son, RJ Stern, is a college football player who was featured on season 5 of [[Last Chance U]] on [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/sportsraid/last-chance-u-underdog-rj-stern-on-what-his-future-holds-c6bd28c9581|title=Netflix's Last Chance U Underdog RJ Stern Discusses Football and What His Future Holds|last1=Martin|first1=Andrew|publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|date=September 7, 2020|access-date=November 21, 2020}}</ref>

In 1965, Bradley graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Hardin-Simmons University]] in [[Abilene, Texas]]. Afterward, she moved to [[Berkeley, California]], to pursue graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, with her brother [[Paul Edwin Zimmer]], she helped found and name the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to [[Staten Island]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Paxson|first=Diana L.|date=Winter 1999|title=The Priestess of Avalon: A Memoir of Marion Zimmer Bradley (1930-1999)|url=https://avalonbooks.net/about-authors/the-priestess-of-avalon/|journal=Sagewoman}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Paxon|first=Diana L.|author-link=Diana L.

Bradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married, and continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on [[child molestation]] charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years.<ref>{{cite news| author=Serrano, Richard A. |date= October 3, 1991| url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61504546.html?dids=61504546:61504546&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+03%2C+1991&author=RICHARD+A.+SERRANO&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Rare+Coins+Expert+Charged+With+Child+Molestation&pqatl=google | title=Rare Coins Expert Charged With Child Molestation| work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=  December 5, 2008}}</ref> She had edited Breen's book ''Greek Love'' (published pseudonymously), which was dedicated to her (named simply as "his wife"), and in 1965 had contributed an article, "Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature", to Breen's journal ''The International Journal of Greek Love''.<ref name="(John)Phd20142">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7nKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA321|title=Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context|last=Mader|first=Donald|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-76628-5|editor-last=Bullough|editor-first=Vern L.|pages=312–321|chapter=Walter H.

===Religion===
While she was attending the College for Teachers (now [[University at Albany, SUNY]]) in Albany, Bradley became involved in [[Western esoteric tradition]]. She later completed the [[Rosicrucian]] correspondence course.<ref name=":3" />

In the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and [[Walter H. Breen]] founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of [[Dion Fortune]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDdcVt9-jnMC|title=The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca|date=2010-05-12|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438126845|editor-last=Guiley|editor-first=Rosemary|pages=36–37|language=en|chapter=Bradley, Marion Zimmer (1930 - 1999)}}</ref> By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S.

Bradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespiralpath.org/clergy/handbook/aboutspiral.html|title=The Fellowship of the Spiral Path Clergy Training Program: Handbook|date=2014-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227175500/http://www.thespiralpath.org/clergy/handbook/aboutspiral.html|archive-date=27 December 2014|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> In 1981 Bradley, [[Diana L. Paxson]], and Elisabeth Waters incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.<ref name=":3" />

In the 1990s Bradley said she would return to [[Christianity]], telling an interviewer: "I just go regularly to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian church]] ... That pagan thing ... I feel that I've gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/30/news/mn-16625|title=Marion Bradley; Writer of Fantasy Novels|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=1999-09-30|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

===Death===
After suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at [[Alta Bates Medical Center]] in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref name=":1" /> Her ashes were later scattered at [[Glastonbury Tor]] in [[Somerset]], England.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|28–29}}

==Child sex abuse allegations==
In 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of 3 to 12. In an email to ''[[The Guardian]],'' Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because:<ref name="Flood">{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=June 27, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/27/sff-community-marion-zimmer-bradley-daughter-accuses-abuse|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 27, 2014|title=SFF community reeling after Marion Zimmer Bradley's daughter accuses her of abuse}}</ref>

Greyland also reported that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, [[Walter H. Breen]], for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions.<ref name="Flood"/><ref name="Rosenberg">{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=June 27, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/06/27/re-reading-feminist-author-marion-zimmer-bradley-in-the-wake-of-sexual-assault-allegations/|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=June 27, 2014|title=Re-reading feminist author Marion Zimmer Bradley in the wake of sexual assault allegations}}</ref><ref name="Seidl">{{cite news|last=Seidl|first=Christian|date=June 29, 2014|url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/leute/schriftstellerin/missbrauchsvorwuerfe-an-avalon-autorin-36588372.bild.html|newspaper=[[Bild]]|access-date=June 29, 2014|title=Hat die Avalon-Autorin ihre Tochter missbraucht?}}</ref> By her own admission, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him.<ref name="sff.net">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911223846/http://www.stephengoldin.com/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradle---Timeline.html |archive-date=September 11, 2016 |url=http://www.stephengoldin.com/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradle---Timeline.html |work=Marion Zimmer Bradley: In Her Own Words |title=Timeline of Events |publisher=Stephen Goldin |last=Goldin |first=Stephen |author-link=Stephen Goldin |date=1999 |access-date=2015-07-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Additionally, she assisted Breen (her husband at the time) to access and abuse multiple unrelated young boys, knowing he was a pedophile who was engaging in sexual contact with children as young as eight. She and her live-in female partner both admitted to knowledge of the abuse and purposefully avoided investigating, questioning, or notifying any authorities. She even attempted to adopt a child whom Breen was interested in sexually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marionzimmerbradley.com/index.html|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley and Child Abuse|website=marionzimmerbradley.com|access-date=25 July 2020}}</ref>

In response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, began donating all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity [[Save the Children]].<ref name="SFgateway">{{cite web|date=July 2, 2014|url=http://blog.sfgateway.com/index.php/marion-zimmer-bradley/|publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|access-date=July 2, 2014|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714164724/http://blog.sfgateway.com/index.php/marion-zimmer-bradley/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Janni Lee Simner]] donated advances and royalties from her two Darkover short stories and, at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization [[Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network]].<ref name="Simner">{{cite web|date=June 13, 2014|url=http://simner.com/blog/?p=5775|publisher=[[Janni Lee Simner]]|access-date=July 10, 2014|title=On doing a thing I needed to do}}</ref>

==Literary career==
Bradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[C.L. Moore]], and [[Leigh Brackett]],<ref>[[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]], "Bradley, Marion Zimmer", ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', ed. [[David Pringle]], St. James Press, 1996, {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}}, p. 68-71.</ref> especially when they wrote about "the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be". Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel ''[[The Forest House]]'', her retelling of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''; she finished it before her death.<ref name=":2" />

Bradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1949 with the short story "Outpost". "Outpost" was published in ''Amazing Stories'' Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine ''Spacewarp'' Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948.  Her first professional publication was a short story "Women Only", which appeared in the second (and final) issue of ''Vortex Science Fiction'' in 1953.<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?VRTXSCNCFC21953 Publication Listing – Title: Vortex Science Fiction Vol. 1, No. 2], Internet Speculative Fiction Database</ref> Her first published novel-length work was ''[[Falcons of Narabedla]]'', first published in the May 1957 issue of ''[[Other Worlds (magazine)|Other Worlds]]''.
[[File:Cover of I Am A Lesbian by Lee Chapman - Monarch MB529 1962.jpg|thumb|256x256px|Cover of "I Am A Lesbian" published by Marion Zimmer Bradley under the pseudonym Lee Chapman. &nbsp;[[Monarch Books|Monarch Book]],&nbsp;1962.]]
Early in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the [[speculative fiction]] genre, including [[gay]] and [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novels; ''I Am a Lesbian'' was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, her novels were considered [[Pornography|pornographic]] when published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/068/000044933/|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref>

Her 1958 novel ''[[The Planet Savers]]'' introduced the planet of [[Darkover]], which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a [[science fantasy]] fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human [[colony]] where [[Parapsychology|psi powers]] developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.
Bradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy [[fandom]], promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned ''Amazing Stories'' and ''[[Wonder Stories|Thrilling Wonder Stories]]''. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including ''Astra's Tower'', ''Day*Star'', and ''Anything Box''. She also co-edited fanzines, including ''Ugly Bird'' with [[Redd Boggs]], ''MEZRAB'' with her first husband Robert Bradley, and ''Allerlei'' with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including ''The Gorgon'' and ''The Nekromantikon''. In the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fictional world of [[Middle-earth]], she wrote two short [[fanfic]] stories about [[Arwen]] and published them in [[chapbook]] format. One story, "The Jewel of Arwen" (originally published in a different form in the fanzine ''I Palantir'' #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology ''The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley'' (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.bu.edu/collections/collection?id=121684|title=Collection - Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center|website=archives.bu.edu|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>

In 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] and is credited with coining the name of that group.<ref>[http://www.smithway.org/history/chap6b.html "... Marion Zimmer Bradley, came up with 'Society for Creative Anachronism' which quickly caught on."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727145215/http://www.smithway.org/history/chap6b.html |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref>

For many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover [[fan fiction]]. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to one of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.<ref>[http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/236/191 "The Contraband Incident: The Strange Case of Marion Zimmer Bradley."] Coker, Catherine. 2011. – ''Transformative Works and Cultures'', no. 6. doi:10.3983/twc.2011.0236. Texas A & M University, College Station, TX</ref>

Bradley was the editor of the long-running ''[[Sword and Sorceress series|Sword and Sorceress]]'' [[anthology]] series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies.  [[Mercedes Lackey]] was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in [[Berkeley, California]]. Bradley was editing the final ''Sword and Sorceress'' manuscript until the week of her death.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Her most famous single novel may be ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'',<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-marion-zimmer-bradley-1123162.html|title=Obituary: Marion Zimmer Bradley|last=Adrian|first=Jack|date=30 September 1999|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> a retelling of the [[Camelot]] legend from the point of view of [[Morgan Le Fay|Morgaine]] and [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]]. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mzbworks.com/|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref>
