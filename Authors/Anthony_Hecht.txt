'''Anthony Evan Hecht''' (January 16, 1923 – October 20, 2004) was an American [[poet]]. His work combined a deep interest in form with a passionate desire to confront the horrors of 20th century history, with the [[World War II|Second World War]], in which he fought, and the [[Holocaust]] being recurrent themes in his work.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news |title=Anthony Hecht, a Formalist Poet, Dies at 81 |last=Shapiro |first=Harvey |date=October 22, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/22/books/22Hecht.html |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years===
Hecht was born in [[New York City]] to [[Germany|German]]-[[Jew]]ish parents. He was educated at various schools in the city – he was a classmate of [[Jack Kerouac]] at [[Horace Mann School]] – but showed no great academic ability, something he would later refer to as "conspicuous". However, as a freshman English student at [[Bard College]] in New York he discovered the works of [[Wallace Stevens]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref name="Matt Schudel">{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53133-2004Oct21.html| title=Poet, Essayist Anthony Hecht Dies at 81| author= Matt Schudel| work=Washington Post | date= October 22, 2004 }}</ref> It was at this point that he decided he would become a poet. Hecht's parents were not happy at his plans and tried to discourage them, even getting family friend [[Dr. Seuss|Ted Geisel]], better known as Dr. Seuss, to attempt to dissuade him.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}



In 1944, upon completing his final year at Bard, Hecht was drafted into the [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Infantry Division]] and was sent to the battlefields in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].<ref>Jonathan Post, ''The Selected Letters of Anthony Hecht,'' The Johns Hopkins University Press; Nov 27, 2012. {{ISBN|978-1421407302}}</ref> He saw combat in [[Germany]] in the "[[Ruhr Pocket]]"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9736.2008.00410.x | volume=96 | year=2008 | journal=The Yale Review | pages=1–26 | last1 = Lindsay | first1 = Geoffrey| title=Anthony Hecht, Private First Class | issue=3 }}</ref> and in [[Cheb]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. However, his most significant experience occurred on April 23, 1945, when Hecht's division helped liberate [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]]. Hecht was ordered to interview French prisoners in the hope of gathering evidence on the camp's commanders. Years later, Hecht said of this experience, <blockquote>The place, the suffering, the prisoners' accounts were beyond comprehension. For years after I would wake shrieking.<ref name="Matt Schudel"/></blockquote>

===Career===
After the war ended, Hecht was sent to [[Occupied Japan]], where he became a staff writer with ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sewanee_review/v119/119.4.lindsay.pdf Geoffrey Lindsay, "Anthony Hecht in Occupied Japan." ''Sewanee Review,'' 2011, 119 (4). pp 641–655.]</ref> He returned to the US in March 1946 and immediately took advantage of the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. bill]] to study under the poet-critic [[John Crowe Ransom]] at [[Kenyon College]], [[Ohio]].  Here he came into contact with fellow poets such as [[Randall Jarrell]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], and [[Allen Tate]]. He later received his [[master's degree]] from [[Columbia University]].  In 1947 Hecht attended the [[University of Iowa]] and taught in the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], together with writer [[Robie Macauley]], with whom Hecht had served during World War II,<ref>[http://www.webdelsol.com/AGNI/ag-08tk.htm Kennedy, Thomas E., "A Last Conversation with Robie Macauley," ''Agnii,'' Vol. 45, 1997.]</ref> but, suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after his war service, gave it up swiftly to enter psychoanalysis.<ref>[http://www.breakoutofthebox.com/AnthonyHecht.htm Anthony Hecht, obituary ]</ref><ref>

In spring, 1947, he taught at Kenyon. His first poems, "Once Removed" and "To a Soldier Killed in Germany", were published in [[The Kenyon Review]]. Later that year, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned to his parent's home in New York City and entered psychoanalysis. 
In 1948, his poems begin to appear in [[The Hudson Review]], [[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]], and Furioso. He later won the Furioso Poetry Award and enrolled at [[Columbia University]] as a candidate for a master's degree in English literature.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7_VvDwAAQBAJ& Anthony Hecht, ''Selected Poems.'' Borzoi poetry, J. D. McClatchy, ed. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011.] {{isbn|0375711988}}</ref>

Hecht released his first collection, ''A Summoning of Stones'', in 1954. Even at this stage Hecht's poetry was often compared with that of [[W. H. Auden]], with whom Hecht had become friends in 1951 during a holiday on the Italian island of [[Ischia]], where Auden spent each summer. In 1993 Hecht published ''The Hidden Law'', a critical reading of Auden's body of work. In his second book, ''The Hard Hours'', Hecht first addressed his own experiences of World War II – memories that had caused him to have a [[nervous breakdown]] in 1959.<ref>[http://waywiser-press.com/imprints/hecht.html Philip Hoy, ''Anthony Hecht in Conversation with Philip Hoy''. London: Between the Lines, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025011017/http://waywiser-press.com/imprints/hecht.html |date=2011-10-25 }}</ref> Hecht spent three months in hospital following his breakdown, although he was spared [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock therapy]], unlike [[Sylvia Plath]], whom he had encountered while teaching at [[Smith College]].

Hecht's main source of income was as a teacher of poetry, most notably at the [[University of Rochester]], where he taught from 1967 to 1985. He also spent varying lengths of time teaching at other notable institutions such as Smith, Bard, [[Harvard]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], and [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1474996/Anthony-Hecht.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Anthony Hecht | date=October 25, 2004}}</ref> Between 1982 and 1984, he held the esteemed position of [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]]. Hecht won a number of literary awards including: the 1968 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] (for ''The Hard Hours''), the 1983 [[Bollingen Prize]], the 1988 [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]], the 1989 [[Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry]], the 1997 [[Wallace Stevens Award]],  the 1999/2000 [[Frost Medal]], and the Tanning Prize.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63nvmt4HqTEC&q=Anthony+Hecht+iowa&pg=PA533| title=Who's who of Pulitzer Prize winners|editor=Elizabeth A. Brennan |editor2=Elizabeth C. Clarage| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year= 1999| isbn= 978-1-57356-111-2 }}</ref>

Hecht died on October 20, 2004, at his home in Washington, D. C.;<ref name="NYTobit" /> he is buried at the cemetery at Bard College. One month later, on November 17, Hecht was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]], accepted on his behalf by his wife, Helen Hecht.<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/news/news04/medals/Hecht.html National Endowment for the Arts – 2004 National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529132258/http://www.nea.gov/news/news04/medals/Hecht.html |date=2010-05-29 }}</ref>

==Literary style, inspirations, and themes==
Hecht is known for his masterful use of traditional forms and linguistic control. Extraordinarily erudite, his verse often features allusions to French literature, Greek myth, and tragedy, and English poets and poetry stretching from Wallace Stevens to John Donne.
He is often described as a "traditionalist". 
In The Hard Hours (1967), Hecht begins to use his experiences as a soldier in Europe during World War II.
