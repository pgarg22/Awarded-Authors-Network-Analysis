'''Anne Bannerman''' (31 October 1765 – 29 September 1829) was a Scottish poet. She was part of the Edinburgh literary circle which included [[John Leyden]], Jessie Stewart, and [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], and [[Robert Anderson (author)|Dr Robert Anderson]]. Her work "remains significant for her Gothic ballads, as well as for her innovative sonnet series and her bold original odes."<ref>Adriana Craciun, "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1312 Bannerman, Anne (1765–1829)]," ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford: OUP, 2004).</ref>

==Early life==
Bannerman was born in [[Edinburgh]] to Isobel (''née'' Dick) and William Bannerman, a "running stationer" licensed to sell ballads in the streets.

==Career==
Bannerman's early work was published, often pseudonymously, in periodicals, notably the ''Monthly Magazine'', the ''Poetical Register'', and the ''[[Edinburgh Magazine and Review|Edinburgh Magazine]]'', the latter of which was edited by her friend and supporter, [[Robert Anderson (author)|Dr Robert Anderson]]. She was read and admired by [[Thomas Park (antiquarian)|Thomas Park]], [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]], [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Thomas Percy]], [[Anne Grant]], and antiquary [[Joseph Cooper Walker]]. Her first volume, ''Poems'' (1800), was well regarded but did not sell well. It contains a series of [[ode]]s, original [[sonnets]], a [[Sonnet sequence|sonnet series]] translated from [[Petrarch]], and another based on ''[[The Sorrows of Werther]]''. In these two latter Bannerman developed [[Joanna Baillie]]'s theory of dramatic composition — her stated intent to focus on the progress of one master passion — and applied it to poetry. Her second collection, ''Tales of Superstition and Chivalry'' (1802) was published anonymously. It consisted of ten Gothic ballads and four engravings and did not fare so well with reviewers, in part because of her penchant for the strain of obscurity and ambiguity within the Gothic tradition.<ref>Adriana Craciun, ''Fatal Women of Romanticism'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003), 156.</ref> Her ballads were, however, praised by [[Walter Scott]].<ref>Walter Scott, "Essay on imitations of the ancient ballad," ''Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border'' (1830). Rev. and ed. [[T.F. Henderson]]. Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1932. Vol. 4.16–17.</ref>

After the deaths of her mother and brother, she struggled financially and was a governess for a period despite precarious health. Although various of her friends supported her and attempted to procure her a pension, such attempts were largely unsuccessful and she died in debt on 29 September 1829.

Contemporary scholars are rediscovering her work and she is the subject of several recent studies.
