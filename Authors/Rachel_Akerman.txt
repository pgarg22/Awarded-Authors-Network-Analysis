'''Rachel Akerman''' (1522 â€“ 1544) was an [[Austria]]n-[[Judaism|Jewish]] poet.

The earliest Jewish woman to write [[German language|German]] [[poetry]]; born probably at [[Vienna]], 1522; died at [[Iglau]], [[Moravia]], 1544. She appears to have received an excellent education, having studied both [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. She soon exhibited poetical powers, and began to exercise them at an early age.

On account of her poem, "Geheimniss des Hofes" ("The Mystery of the Courts"), in which she described the intrigues of courtiers, Rachel and her father were expelled from Vienna, where they had lived. She died in [[Iglau]], [[Moravia]], heartbroken.
