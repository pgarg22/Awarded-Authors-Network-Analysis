'''Suryakant Tripathi''' "'''Nirala'''" (21 February 1896 &ndash; 15 October 1961) was an Indian poet, novelist, essayist and story-writer who wrote in [[Hindi]]. He also drew many sketches.

== Biography == 
His family is roots in unnaoo  [[Unnao]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref name="unnao">[http://unnao.nic.in/person.htm Famous Personalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016084339/http://unnao.nic.in/person.htm |date=16 October 2013 }} [[Unnao district]] Official website.</ref> He participated in literary circles such as the [[Kavi sammelan|Kavi Sammelan]].{{Citation needed|date= July 2018}} Though a student of [[Bengali language|Bengali]], Nirala took a keen interest in [[Sanskrit]] from the very beginning.{{Citation needed|date= July 2018}}

Nirala's life, barring short periods, was one long sequence of misfortunes and tragedies. His father, Pandit Ramsahaya Tripathi, was a government servant and was a tyrannical person. His mother died when he was very young. Nirala was educated in the Bengali medium at Mahishadal Raj High School at [[Mahishadal]], Purba Medinipur.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.collegeadmission.in/MahishadalRajCollege/Mahishadal_Raj_College.shtml  |title = Mahishadal Raj College  | publisher= College Admission | accessdate = 9 April 2019}}</ref> However, after passing the matriculation exam, he continued his education at home by reading Sanskrit and [[English literature]]. Subsequently, he shifted to [[Lucknow]] and thence to village Gadhakola of [[Unnao district]], to which his father originally belonged. Growing up, he gained inspiration from personalities like [[Ramakrishna Paramhansa]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], and [[Rabindranath Tagore]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

After his marriage at a young age (his age is 20), Nirala learned Hindi at the insistence of his wife, Manohara Devi. Soon, he started writing poems in Hindi, instead of Bengali. After a bad childhood, Nirala had a few good years with his wife. But this phase was short-lived as his wife died when he was 20, and later his daughter (who was a widow) also expired. Nirala lost half of his family, including his wife and daughter, in [[1918 flu pandemic in India|1918 Spanish flu influenza outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-literature-has-helped-us-make-sense-of-pandemics/articleshow/74841225.cms|title=How literature has helped us make sense of pandemics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/references-to-death-and-disease-in-hindi-literature-6357805/|title=References to death and disease in Hindi literature|date=12 April 2020}}</ref> He also went through financial troubles during this time. During that phase, he worked for many publishers, worked as a proof-reader and also edited publications including ''[[Matvala]]''<ref>Ruth Vanita, "The New Homophobia: Ugra's ''Chocolate''", in ''Same-Sex Love in India: Readings in Indian Literature'', ed. by Ruth Vanita, Saleem Kidwai (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 246-52 (p. 246).</ref> and ''Samanvaya''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Most of his life was somewhat in the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] tradition. He wrote strongly against social injustice and exploitation in society. Since he was more or less a rebel, both in form and content, acceptance did not come easily. What he got in plenty was ridicule and derision. All this may have played a role in making him a victim of [[schizophrenia]] in his later life and he was admitted to [[Central Institute of Psychiatry]], Ranchi.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/hindi/india-39967752 निराला, नज़रुल, मजाज़ भी रहे हैं रांची पागलखाने में – BBC News हिंदी]. Bbc.com. Retrieved on 13 December 2018.</ref> (Incidentally Bengali poet [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] (who was later declared national poet of Bangladesh) had also been admitted to the same institute for schizophrenia).{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Nirala died in [[Allahabad]] on 15 October 1961. The world of Hindi literature is remarkable for ideological and aesthetic divisions.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} But today, the same reviled Nirala is one of the very few people in Hindi literature who are admired and respected by almost all, across all divisions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}
