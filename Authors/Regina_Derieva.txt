'''Regina Derieva''' ({{lang-rus|Реги́на Ио́сифовна Дери́ева|p=rʲɪˈɡʲinə ɪˈosʲɪfəvnə dʲɪˈrʲijɪvə|a=Ryegina Iosifovna Dyeriyeva.ru.vorb.oga}}; February 7, 1949 – December 11, 2013) was a [[Russia]]n [[poet]] and [[writer]] who published around thirty books of [[poetry]], [[essay]]s, and [[prose]]. From July 1999 until her death she lived in [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/kultursvepet-16-december_8828244.svd?sidan=3 |title=Poeten Regina Derieva har gått bort|newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet|date=16 December 2013}}</ref>

[[Joseph Brodsky]] called Derieva "a great poet", stressing that her poems are hers "only by name, only by her craft". "The real authorship belongs here to poetry itself, to freedom itself. I have not met anything similar for a long time, neither among my fellow countrymen nor among English-speaking poets".  [[Tomas Venclova]] has stated that " Regina Derieva was, first and foremost, a Christian poet, a worthy heir of a long line of metaphysical poets, be they English, French or Russian. Far from any inflated rhetoric or didactics, her poems reached the very core of the Christian experience, which meant serious and fearless attitude to life, suffering and death. The imagery and syntax of the Gospels and the Books of Prophets was, for her, a natural element just as apocalyptic presentiments and mystical hope formed the axis of her world-outlook".  [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] has a blurb on the back cover of Derieva's ''Alien Matter'' :  ”Science teaches that eighty percent of the universe consists of dark matter, so called. Regina Derieva learned this same fact in a very hard school. She does not consent to it, though. She knows that the hurt truth in us points to a dimension where, for example, victory is cleansed of battle. Her strict, economical poems never waver from that orientation”.

Derieva's work has been translated into several languages, including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and other languages. A [[compact disc]] with her readings in Russian of selected poems was issued in 1999. Derieva's work has appeared in the ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, ''[[Evergreen Review]],'' ''[[Modern Poetry in Translation]],'' ''Poetry East,'' ''[[The Liberal]],'' ''[[Ars Interpres]],'' ''Salt Magazine,'' ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]],'' ''[[Notre Dame Review]],'' ''Dublin Poetry Review,'' ''[[Quarterly Literary Review Singapore]],'' ''[[Words Without Borders]],'' ''[[St. Petersburg Review]],'' ''[[Poetry International (magazine)|Poetry International]],'' ''[[Artful Dodge]],'' ''[[Atlanta Review]],'' ''POEM Magazine,'' ''[[The Hopkins Review]],'' ''[[The American Poetry Review]]'' as well as in many Russian and Swedish magazines.

She translated poetry by [[Thomas Merton]] and contemporary [[United States|American]], [[Australian]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Poland|Polish]], and [[Sweden|Swedish]] poets. [[Singapore Writers Festival|Regina Derieva participated in a number of Swedish and international poetry festivals]].

Derieva's poetry is strongly affected by her Catholic faith. In 1996, a significant Italian  composer and organist, Fra [[Armando Pierucci]],  composed a cantata for the series  of Regina Derieva's poems.  This cantata is titled ''[[Via Crucis]].''<ref>[http://www.divine-art.com/CD/27002info.htm pilgrims star 27002 Via Crucis. <!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233219/http://www.divine-art.com/CD/27002info.htm |date=2008-04-02 }}</ref> [http://www.merton.org/itms/fellows%20research.htm In 2003, she received the Shannon Fellowship of the International Thomas Merton Society]. In 2009, the Catholic Church of Sweden awarded her the ORA ET LABORA medal for her literary work to benefit the Church.
