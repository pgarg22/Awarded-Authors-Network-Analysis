Regan]] Professor, Emeritus, Department of English at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/People/CharlesBernstein|title=Department of English|work=upenn.edu|access-date=July 19, 2015}}</ref> He is one of the most prominent members of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E<ref>Kenneth Goldsmith, ''Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of [[UbuWeb]]'', Columbia University Press, New York, pp. 130–135</ref> or [[Language poets]]. In 2006 he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/news/alpha2006.aspx|title=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|work=amacad.org|access-date=July 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917091214/http://amacad.org/news/alpha2006.aspx|archive-date=September 17, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in 2019 he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] from Yale University, the premiere American prize for lifetime achievement, given on the occasion of the publication of ''Near/Miss''. Bernstein was David Gray Professor of Poetry and Poetics at SUNY-Buffalo from 1990–2003, where he co-founded the Poetics Program. A volume of Bernstein's selected poetry from the past thirty years, ''All the Whiskey in Heaven'', was published in 2010 by [[Farrar, Straus, and Giroux]]. ''The Salt Companion to Charles Bernstein'' was published in 2012 by [[Salt Publishing]].

==Early life and work==
Bernstein was born in [[New York City]] to a [[Jewish]] family and attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]], graduating in 1968. His mother was [https://jacket2.org/commentary/sherry-bernstein-funeral Sherry Bernstein] (born Shirley Jacqueline Kegel, February 2, 1921 to October 27, 2018) and his father was Herman Bernstein (1901–1977). Charles then matriculated at [[Harvard College]], where he majored in philosophy and studied the work of [[J.L. Austin]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.literaturfestival.com/autoren-en/autoren-2012-en/charles-bernstein?set_language=en|title=Charles Bernstein — internationales literaturfestival berlin|website=www.literaturfestival.com}}</ref> under [[Stanley Cavell]], a seminal figure in [[ordinary language philosophy]], as well as [[Rogers Albritton]].<ref>http://writing.upenn.edu/library/Bernstein-Charles-and-Loss-Pequeno-Glazier_Autobiographical-Interview_1996.pdf</ref> Cavell would oversee Bernstein's thesis, a study that pursued the aesthetic and poetic possibilities of the amalgamation of analytical philosophy and avant-garde literature, focussing on Gertrude Stein and Wittgenstein. After graduating from Harvard in 1972, his first book, ''Asylums,'' was published in 1975. Together with [[Bruce Andrews]] he edited the magazine ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'', which ran to 13 issues (3 volumes) between 1978 and 1981 (plus 3 supplements and a fourth volume in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eclipsearchive.org/projects/LANGUAGE/language.html|title=L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E|website=eclipsearchive.org}}</ref> This is routinely considered to be the starting point of Language Poetry and was the most significant outlet for both the progressive poetry and progressive poetic theory taking place in New York City and Berkeley. He has said about the creation of ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', "We tried to trace a history of radical poetics, taking up the model presented in [[Jerome Rothenberg]]'s ''Revolution of the Word'', and later by Rothenberg and Pierre Joris in ''Poems for the Millennium'' and [[Marjorie Perloff]] in ''The Futurist Moment''. When you go back 30 years, you see that poetics that now are widely accepted as foundational for contemporary poetry were harshly rejected then."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/charles-bernstein/|title=Charles Bernstein by Jay Sanders – BOMB Magazine|website=bombmagazine.org}}</ref> Bernstein and Andrews published selected pieces from these 13 issues in ''The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book''. In 2019 and 2020, the University of New Mexico Press, under editors Matthew Hofer and Michael Golston, published three related books: ''The Language Letters: Selected 1970s Correspondence of Bruce Andrews, Ron Silliman, and Charles Bernstein;'' a new edition of ''Legend by'' Andrews,  Bernstein, Ray DiPalma, Steve McCaffery, and Ron Silliman; and ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E: Facsimile Edition.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Recencies Series: Research and Recovery in Twentieth-Century American Poetics|url=https://unmpress.com/Recencies_Series_Research_and_Recovery_in_Twentieth-Century_American_Poetics|access-date=2021-04-07|website=University of New Mexico Press|language=en}}</ref>

During this period, Bernstein also published three more books of his own poetry, ''Parsing'' (1976), ''Shade'' (1978) and ''Poetic Justice'' (1979), earning a living working for the [[CETA Artists Project (NYC Cultural Council Foundation 1978-80)|Cultural Council Foundation's CETA Artist Project]] and as a freelance medical writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeninteger.com/green_integer_review/issue_1/Charles-Bernstein-interview.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727202516/http://www.greeninteger.com///green_integer_review/issue_1/Charles-Bernstein-interview.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2010 }}</ref> He also co-founded the [https://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Ear-Inn.php Ear Inn reading series] with Ted Greenwald in 1978.

==Later life and work==

From 1989 to 2003, Bernstein was David Gray Professor of Poetry and Letters at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]], where he was a SUNY Distinguished Professor and co-founder and Director of the Poetics Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/prog.html|title=UB Poetics Program|work=upenn.edu|access-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref>  He is also, with [[Loss Pequeño Glazier]], co-founder of The [[Electronic Poetry Center]] at Buffalo.  From 2003–2019, he was Donald T. Regan Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he co-founded the poetry audio archive [[PennSound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/news/press-release-launch.php|title=PennSound: Press Release|work=upenn.edu|access-date=July 19, 2015}}</ref>  He has been the recipient of fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and of the Roy Harvey Pearce/Archive for New Poetry Prize of the University of California, San Diego. With his translators, Bernstein won the 2015 Münster Prize for International Poetry for two German translations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/?q=commentary/munster-prize-two-books-charles-bernstein-german-translation|title=Muenster Prize for two books by Charles Bernstein in German translation &#124; Jacket2|website=jacket2.org}}</ref> In the same year, he won the  Janus Pannonius Grand Prize for Poetry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/janus-pannonius-grand-prize-poetry-charles-bernstein-and-giuseppe-conte|title=Janus Pannonius Grand Prize for Poetry to Charles Bernstein and Giuseppe Conte &#124; Jacket2|website=jacket2.org}}</ref> In 2019, Bernstein was the recipient of the Bollingen Prize for American poetry, for lifetime achievement and for ''Near/Miss.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/books/bollingen-prize-american-poetry-nominees-national-book-critics-circle-edgar-allan-poe-awards-announced.html|title=Bollingen Prize in American Poetry and Nominees for the National Book Critics Circle and Edgar Allan Poe Awards Are Announced|first=Gregory|last=Cowles|date=January 22, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Bernstein was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2006.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>

Since 1980, he has published a further eighteen books of poetry, as well as editing a number of anthologies of prose and verse, including ''The Politics of Poetic Form,'' ''Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word,'' ''S/N: NewWorldPoetics'', with Eduard Espina, and ''Best American Experimental Writing'', with [[Tracie Morris]]. Working with the composers [[Ben Yarmolinsky]], [[Dean Drummond]], and [[Brian Ferneyhough]], he has written the libretti for five operas and has collaborated with a number of visual artists, including his wife, [[Susan Bee]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Amy Sillman]], and [[Mimi Gross]]. In 1984, he organized"New York Talk" and in 1985–86, "St Marks Talks," the first lecture series at the Poetry Project in New York. In 2001, he co-curated "Poetry Plastique" with Jay Sanders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/features/poetryplastique/|title=Poetry Plastique|website=writing.upenn.edu}}</ref> Bernstein's work has appeared frequently in [[The Best American Poetry series]], ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Poetry Magazine]]'', ''[[boundary 2]],'' and ''[[Critical Inquiry]].'' While Bernstein has supported small presses throughout his career, he has also published on such mainstream academic presses as [[Oxford University Press]], [[Harvard University Press]], [[Northwestern University Press]], and, most recently, [[The University of Chicago Press]], which has published his last major works.  The publication of ''[[All the Whiskey in Heaven]]'' by [[Farrar, Straus, and Giroux]] in 2010 was his most commercial endeavor to date. He has said about his work, "It's true that, on the one hand, I mock and destabilize the foundation of a commitment to lyric poetry as an address toward truth or toward sincerity. But, on the other hand, if you're interested in theory as a stable expository mode of knowledge production or critique moving toward truth, again, I should be banned from your republic. (I've already been banned from mine.) My vacillating poetics of poems and essays is a serial practice, a play of voices."<ref name=Sanders>Sanders, Jay http://bombsite.com/issues/111/articles/3454 "Charles Bernstein" ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Spring 2010, retrieved August 1, 2011</ref>

There have been three collections of essays focussed on Bernstein's work: a 1985 issue of [http://eclipsearchive.org/projects/DIFFICULTIES/difficulties.html ''The Difficulties''], ed. Tom Beckett, ''[https://www.saltpublishing.com/products/the-salt-companion-to-charles-bernstein-9781844714858 The Salt Companion to Charles Bernstein],'' ed.
