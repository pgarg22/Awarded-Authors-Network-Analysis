'''Hugh Cook''' (9 August 1956 – 8 November 2008) was a [[Cult following|cult]] author whose works blend [[fantasy]] and science fiction. He is best known for his series ''The [[Chronicles of an Age of Darkness]]''.

==Biography==
Hugh Walter Gilbert Cook was born in [[Essex]], England in 1956. After spending his early childhood in England he moved to [[Banaba Island|Ocean Island]] (now [[Banaba Island]] in Kiribati). His experiences of English castles and of life on an equatorial island later influenced his writing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zenvirus.com/diary/wizard-war-chronicles-age-darkness.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223105623/http://zenvirus.com/diary/wizard-war-chronicles-age-darkness.html |archivedate=23 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

He moved to, and was educated in New Zealand. His first novel, ''Plague Summer'' was published when he was 24 in 1980.

Between 1986 and 1992 he wrote the ten-novel series ''The [[Chronicles of an Age of Darkness]]''. Disappointing sales prevented the publication of further volumes (up to 60 were planned).

In 1997 he moved to Japan, and lived in [[Yokohama]] with his wife and daughter and taught English.

He subsequently published mainly online, through his site, Zen Virus. His online works include poetry, short stories, "flash fiction", and several novels.

In 2005 he underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer in the form of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He wrote a medical memoir, Cancer Patient, telling of this experience.

Following a relapse, Hugh Cook died on 8 November 2008, in the hospice in Auckland.

The series broadly tells the story of the events leading to the end of a dark age.  The idea for the series began with an ambitious outline for a series of twenty novels. This would have been followed by two equally long series, ''The Chronicles of an Age of Wrath'', and ''The Chronicles of an Age of Heroes''. This sixty-volume scheme ended with the publication of the tenth volume because of disappointing sales. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152446/http://zenvirus.com/]
