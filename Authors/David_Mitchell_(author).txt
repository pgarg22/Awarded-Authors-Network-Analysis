==Personal life==
After another stint in Japan, Mitchell and his wife, Keiko Yoshida, live in [[Ardfield]], County Cork, Ireland, {{as of|2018|lc=yes}}. They have two children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Olson |first1=Danel |title=David Mitchell |journal=Weird Fiction Review |date=Winter 2018 |issue=9 |pages=384–404 }}</ref> In an essay for [[Random House]], Mitchell wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/1100/mitchell/essay.html|title=Bold Type: Essay by David Mitchell|publisher=Randomhouse.com|access-date=28 August 2013}}</ref> "I knew I wanted to be a writer since I was a kid, but until I came to Japan to live in 1994 I was too easily distracted to do much about it. I would probably have become a writer wherever I lived, but would I have become the same writer if I'd spent the last six years in London, or [[Cape Town]], or [[Moose Jaw]], on an oil rig or in the circus? This is my answer to myself."
