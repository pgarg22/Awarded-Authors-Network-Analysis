'''George Henry Boker''' (October 6, 1823 &ndash; January 2, 1890) was an American poet, playwright, and diplomat.

==Early years and education==
Boker was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. His father was Charles S. Boker, a wealthy banker, whose financial expertise weathered the [[Girard National Bank]] through the panic years of 1838-40, and whose honour, impugned after his 1857 death, was defended many years later by his son in "The Book of the Dead." Charles Boker was also a director of the [[Mechanics National Bank]].

Boker was brought up in an atmosphere of ease and refinement, receiving his preparatory education in private schools, and entering [[Princeton University]] in 1840. While there he helped found, and was first editor of, the college literary magazine, the ''Nassau Monthly'' (now the ''[[Nassau Lit]]'').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Everett |first1=Ashley |title=George Henry Boker |url=https://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/bios/Boker__George_Henry |website=www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu |access-date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

He was left in easy circumstances, and was able to devote his time to literature, as well as boxing and dancing.

[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], a relative, recounted:

{{quote|text=As a mere schoolboy, Boker's knowledge of poetry was remarkable. I can remember that he even at nine years of age manifested that wonderful gift that caused him many years after to be characterized by some great actor—I think it was [[Edwin Forrest|Forrest]]—as the best reader in America ... While at college ... [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] were his favourites. He used to quiz me sometimes for my predilections for [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]. We both loved [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] passionately.}}{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Boker graduated from Princeton in 1842.<ref>{{cite web |title=George H.

==Literary recognition==
In 1848 his first volume of verse, ''The Lessons of Life, and other Poems'', was published.

Also, he met [[Bayard Taylor]] and [[Richard Henry Stoddard]], who would be long-lasting friends. This group of young men supported and encouraged each other in the face of official journalistic criticism.

Launched in the literary life, Boker began to write assiduously. His first play, ''Calaynos'', went into two editions during 1848, and the following year was played by [[Samuel Phelps]] at [[Sadler's Wells]] Theatre, London, May 10. This tragedy is notable for its depiction of the racial issues between the Spanish and the Moors.

This was soon followed by other plays. The next to be staged was a comedy, ''The Betrothal'' (1850). Two other tragedies from this time are ''Anne Boleyn'' (1850) and ''Leonor de Guzman'' (1853).

During this time, in correspondence with his friends, Boker was determining to himself the distinction between ''poetic'' and ''dramatic'' style. But Boker was not wholly wed to theatrical demands; he still approached the stage in the spirit of the poet who was torn between loyalty to poetic indirectness, and necessity for direct dialogue.

''[[Francesca da Rimini]]'', (1853) is the play he is most well-remembered for. It is a verse tragedy based on the story of Paolo and Francesca from the fifth canto of [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]]. Boker published the original version, called the reading version, but used an acting version for the stage which had more directness and dramatic flow. This allowed for a compromise between the poet of the reading version and the demands of the theatre.  "''Francesca da Rimini'' is one of our finest verse dramas, certainly the best American romantic tragedy written before the twentieth century."<ref>Myron Matlaw (1967), "Preface to ''Francesca da Rimini''", in Myron Matlaw, ed., ''"The Black Crook" and Other Nineteenth-Century Plays'', New York:  Dutton, p. 97.</ref>

The [[American Civil War]] not only turned Boker's pen to the Union Cause, but changed him politically from a Democrat to a staunch Republican. In fact, his name is closely interwoven with the rehabilitation of the Republican party in Philadelphia. His volume "Poems of the War," was issued in 1864.

In 1862, the [[Union League of Philadelphia|Union League Club]] was founded, with Boker as the leading spirit; through his efforts the war earnestness of the city was concentrated here; from 1863-71 he served as its secretary; from 1879-84 as its President.<ref>{{cite web |title=George Henry Boker |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/george-henry-boker |website=www.poetryfoundation.org |access-date=2 September 2020}}</ref> But Boker's thoughts were also concerned with poetry. In 1869, Boker issued ''Königsmark, The Legend of the Hounds and other Poems'', and this ended his dramatic career until his return from abroad.

==Diplomatic activities==
President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] sent Boker to [[Constantinople]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] (his appointment dated November 3, 1871)—an honor undoubtedly bestowed in recognition of his national service. Here he remained four years, "and during that time secured the redress for wrongs done American subjects by the Syrians, and successfully negotiated two treaties, one having reference to the extradition of criminals, and the other to the naturalization of subjects of little power in the dominions of the other."

Boker's initial enthusiasm for Turkish scenery and culture was unbounded, but after a time, his ignorance of the tongue, and distrust of interpreters, contributed to his frustration. By the time his Government was ready to transfer him to another post he was glad to leave Turkey. Despite this, he had developed his diplomatic skills and shown a talent for cultivating personal contacts.

In 1875, he was transferred to Russia, which was considered a more prestigious position.

The new political administration resulting from the [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|1876 American election]] viewed Boker unfavorably. Despite support from Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]], Boker was recalled in 1878.

==Later years==

On January 15, 1878, Boker withdrew from diplomatic life, returning to the United States. At this time he was depressed, feeling that both his literary and diplomatic careers had been failures.

In 1882 [[Lawrence Barrett]] mounted a revival of ''Francesca da Rimini''. This brought more public interest in Boker and his other work, which necessitated the reprinting of several of his books. In 1884, he was elected as a member to the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?year=1884;smode=advanced;f1-date=1884;startDoc=1|access-date=2021-05-21|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

His home in Philadelphia—one of the literary centres of the time,—bore traces of his Turkish stay—carpets brought from Constantinople, Arabic designs on the draperies, and rich Eastern colours in the tapestried chairs.

Boker was also a director of the [[Mechanics National Bank]] of Philadelphia for several years later in his life.

Boker died on January 2, 1890 in Philadelphia and was interred at [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]].<ref>[https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/stuniversity/373544512.html ''Philadelphia Inquirer'']</ref>

In addition to the works already mentioned, Boker also wrote hundreds of [[sonnet]]s. A collection of these, ''Sequence on Profane Love'', was discovered in manuscript after his death, and published in 1927. He has been compared to [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] as one of the premier American sonnet writers.
