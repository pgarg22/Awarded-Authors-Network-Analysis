'''Michael de Larrabeiti''' (18 August 1934 – 18 April 2008) was an English [[novelist]] and [[travel writer]]. He is best known for writing ''[[The Borrible Trilogy]]'',<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/16/book-corner-the-borribles Guardian]</ref> which has been cited as an influence by writers in the ''[[New Weird]]'' movement.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1935822/Michael-de-Larrabeiti.html Telegraph]</ref>

==Early life==
One of five children, de Larrabeiti was born in [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and was mostly brought up in [[Battersea]], South London. His mother was of working-class Irish descent and lived most of her life in the [[Lavender Hill]] area of London; his father was a [[Basque people|Basque]] from [[Bilbao]] and was often absent.

In 1939 he was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[Arundel]] in [[West Sussex]], before returning to London in 1940, only to be evacuated again to [[Askern]], a mining village near [[Doncaster]] in [[Yorkshire]], in the winter. At the end of the [[Second World War]] he returned to London and, after failing the [[eleven-plus exam|11-plus]], was educated at [[Clapham Central Secondary School]]. The teachers he had here, often men who had returned from fighting in the war determined to make a better world, were a great influence on de Larrabeiti, something he would later fictionalise in ''[[Journal of a Sad Hermaphrodite]]''.

==Youth==
After leaving school at sixteen, de Larrabeiti initially worked as a [[librarian]] at a public library on Magdalen Road in [[Earlsfield]], south London.  In 1952 he began attending [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] with a view towards taking [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]s and attending university.  This ambition took nine years to fulfill, mainly because of economic reasons.  During this period de Larrabeiti, guided by his elder brothers, worked at many things, initially as a cinema projectionist in a [[3D cinema]] in [[Festival Gardens]], [[Battersea Park]] during the [[Festival of Britain]].  His experiences in the Gardens are recorded in ''[[A Rose Beyond the Thames]]''.  He later worked as a [[cameraman]] in documentary films and as a travel guide in France and [[Morocco]].

In 1959 he fell in with a group of [[Provence|Provençal]] shepherds and went with them on the [[transhumance]], herding three thousand sheep from their winter pasture to summer pasture in the French Alps.  He then taught English in [[Casablanca]], and in 1961 was the photographer on the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Marco Polo Expedition]], travelling four months overland on a pair of BSA motorcycles and sidecar with [[Stanley Johnson (writer)|Stanley Johnson]] and [[Tim Severin]] to [[Afghanistan]] and India.  The adventure led to the publication of Severin's 1964 book ''Tracking Marco Polo'' with photographs by de Larrabeiti.

Between 1961 and 1965 he read French and English at [[Trinity College Dublin]], from where he won a scholarship to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]], where he studied in 1965–66; he later began a [[DPhil]] at [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] which he later abandoned to take up full-time writing.

==Writing career==
De Larrabeiti continued to work as a guide and tour manager in the travel business for Clarksons and, later, as a freelance contributor to the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' travel section, for which he wrote acclaimed travel essays. His books have also been critically well-received, with recent work being long-listed for the [[Booker Prize]]. 2006 saw the publication of his most recent novel, ''[[Princess Diana's Revenge]]''; a collection of memoirs entitled ''[[Spots of Time]]'' was published in early 2007. His 1992 novel ''[[Journal of a Sad Hermaphrodite]]'' is also set to be republished, after having been out of print for over ten years.

In his early years he espoused [[Marxism]] and remained a left-winger throughout his life. He lived in the [[Oxfordshire]] village of [[Great Milton]] with his wife Celia, and had three daughters.  The last years of his life were blighted by [[cancer]].
