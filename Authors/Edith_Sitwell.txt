'''Dame Edith Louisa Sitwell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE}} (7 September 1887 – 9 December 1964) was a British poet and critic and the eldest of [[The Sitwells|the three literary Sitwells]]. She reacted badly to her eccentric, unloving parents and lived much of her life with her governess. She never married but became passionately attached to Russian painter [[Pavel Tchelitchew]], and her home was always open to London's poetic circle, to whom she was generous and helpful.

Sitwell published poetry continuously from 1913, some of it abstract and set to music. With her dramatic style and exotic costumes, she was sometimes labelled a poseur, but her work was praised for its solid technique and painstaking craftsmanship. She was a recipient of the [[Benson Medal]].

==Early life==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}
Edith Louisa Sitwell was born in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], the oldest child and only daughter of Sir [[George Sitwell|George Sitwell, 4th Baronet]], of [[Renishaw Hall]]; he was an expert on genealogy and landscaping.<ref name=age>Tim Harris, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/12/1041990178094.html Eccentric patriarch with slender grip on reality], ''The Age'', January 2003; accessed March 2010.</ref> Her mother was Lady Ida Emily Augusta (née Denison), a daughter of [[William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough]] and a granddaughter of [[Henry Somerset, 7th Duke of Beaufort]] through whom she was descended from the [[Plantagenets]] in the female line.<ref name="face">{{cite web |title=Dame Edith Sitwell |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04qh1gk |publisher=BBC |website=Face to Face |access-date=30 January 2021 |date=6 May 1959}}</ref>

Sitwell had two younger brothers, [[Osbert Sitwell|Osbert]] (1892–1969) and [[Sacheverell Sitwell|Sacheverell]] (1897–1988), both distinguished authors, well-known literary figures in their own right, and long-term collaborators. She described her childhood as "extremely unhappy" and said her mother had "terrible rages" while she rarely saw her father.<ref name="face"/> Her relationship with her parents was stormy at best, not least because her father made her undertake a "cure" for her supposed spinal deformation, involving locking her into an iron frame. She wrote in her autobiography that her parents had always been strangers to her.

==Adult life==
[[File:Portrait of Edith Sitwell.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Portrait of Edith Sitwell'', by [[Roger Fry]], 1918]]
In 1914, 26-year-old Sitwell moved to a small, shabby flat in [[Pembridge Mansions]], [[Bayswater]], which she shared with Helen Rootham (1875–1938), her [[governess]] since 1903.

Sitwell never married, but seems to have fallen in love with a number of unavailable men over the course of her life. Around 1914, she developed a passion for the Chilean artist and boxer Álvaro de Guevara, whom her biographer [[Richard Greene (writer)|Richard Greene]] describes as 'thuggish.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greene |first1=Richard |title=Edith Sitwell : avant-garde poet, English genius |date=2011 |publisher=Virago |location=London |isbn=978-1-86049-967-8 |page=118 |edition=1st}}</ref> Violent, unstable and addicted to opium, Guevara eventually became involved with the poet and socialite [[Nancy Cunard]], whom Sitwell subsequently 'never lost an opportunity to speak ill of.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Richard |title=Edith Sitwell : avant-garde poet, English genius |date=2011 |publisher=Virago |location=London |isbn=978-1-86049-967-8 |page=119 |edition=1st}}</ref>

After meeting the poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]] in 1918, the two became close friends. Sassoon, who was homosexual, cared deeply for Sitwell, but Greene asserts that she fell in love with him, becoming jealous of his lover [[Stephen Tennant]] in the late 1920s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Richard |title=Edith Sitwell : avant-garde poet, English genius |date=2011 |publisher=Virago |location=London |isbn=978-1-86049-967-8 |page=206 |edition=1st}}</ref> Sassoon and Sitwell were often seen out in each other's company, leading Sassoon's friend and mentor, the critic [[Edmund Gosse]], to suggest that they marry. According to Sassoon's biographer, [[Max Egremont]], Sassoon quickly replied, "I don't think poets should marry one another."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Egremont |first1=Max |title=Siegfried Sassoon: A Biography |date=2005 |publisher=Picador |location=London |page=300 |edition=1st}}</ref> Throughout the 1920s and 30s, Sitwell relied on Sassoon for criticism of her work, both privately and publicly. In 1922 he wrote a glowing review of ''[[Façade (poem)|Façade]]'' in the ''Daily Herald'' entitled 'Too Fantastic for Fat-Heads,' in which he compared Sitwell to the artist [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and declared, 'Aubrey Beardsley has triumphed over all the fat-heads of his day. Miss Sitwell will do the same.'<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sassoon |first1=Siegfried |title='Too Fantastic for Fat-Heads' |journal=Daily Herald |date=24 May 1922}}</ref> Writing to him in 1933, Sitwell told him, 'you are the only person who has ever done anything at all for my poetry.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greene |first1=Richard |title=Edith Sitwell : avant-garde poet, English genius |date=2011 |publisher=Virago |location=London |isbn=978-1-86049-967-8 |page=235 |edition=1st}}</ref>

In 1927, Sitwell fell in love with the gay Russian painter [[Pavel Tchelitchew]]. They developed a close friendship, with Sitwell regularly helping him financially and publicising his work. However, she was often hurt by his unpredictable temper and seeming lack of appreciation for her efforts on his behalf, and Greene suggests that Tchelitchew "toyed with her expectations" of romance when he wanted something from her, growing more distant again when he got what he wanted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Richard |title=Edith Sitwell : avant-garde poet, English genius |date=2011 |publisher=Virago |location=London |isbn=978-1-86049-967-8 |page=191 |edition=1st}}</ref> Nevertheless, the relationship lasted until his death 30 years later. In 1928, Helen Rootham had surgery for cancer; she eventually became an invalid. In 1932, Rootham and Sitwell moved to Paris where they lived with Rootham's younger sister, Evelyn Wiel.

In 1930, Sitwell published a study of the poet [[Alexander Pope]], in which she argued for Pope's greatness and identified him as a precursor of [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]. [[George Orwell]], reviewing the book in the ''[[New Adelphi]]'', noted Sitwell's fixation on the "texture" of Pope's work, which he argued distracted her from his sometimes hackneyed sentiments, but praised "her warm-hearted defence of the poet against all his detractors."<ref>{{cite book|first=E. A.|last=Blair|author-link=George Orwell|chapter=Review|orig-year=1930|pages=44–47|title=The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, Volume 1: An Age Like This 1920–1940|editor1-first=Sonia|editor1-last=Orwell|editor1-link=Sonia Orwell|editor2-first=Ian|editor2-last=Angus|editor2-link=Ian Angus (librarian)|publisher=Penguin|year=1968}}</ref>

Sitwell's mother died in 1937. Sitwell did not attend the funeral because of her displeasure with her parents during her childhood. Helen Rootham died of [[spinal cancer]] in 1938. During the [[Second World War]], Sitwell returned from France and retired to Renishaw with her brother Osbert and his lover, David Horner. She wrote under the light of oil lamps as the house had no electricity. She knitted clothes for their friends who served in the army. One of the beneficiaries was [[Alec Guinness]], who received a pair of [[seaboot]] stockings.

The poems she wrote during the war brought her back before the public. They include ''Street Songs'' (1942), ''The Song of the Cold'' (1945), and ''The Shadow of Cain'' (1947), all of which were much praised.  "Still Falls the Rain" about the [[London Blitz]], remains perhaps her best-known poem; it was set to music by [[Benjamin Britten]] as [[Canticle III: Still falls the rain|Canticle&nbsp;III: Still Falls the Rain]]. Her poem ''The Bee-Keeper'' was set to music by [[Priaulx Rainier]], as ''The Bee Oracles'' (1970), a setting for tenor, flute, oboe, violin, cello, and harpsichord. It was premiered by [[Peter Pears]] in 1970. Poems from ''The Canticle of the Rose'' were set by composer [[Joseph Phibbs]] in a song-cycle for high soprano with string quartet premiered in 2005.<ref>Premiere: [[Lisa Milne]], soprano, with [[Belcea Quartet]], [[Wigmore Hall]], London, 14 March 2005. Review: Robert Maycock, 'Belcea Quartet, Wigmore Hall, London', ''The Independent'', 14 December 2005. Published by Ricordi.</ref>

In 1943, her father died in Switzerland, his wealth depleted. In 1948, a reunion with Tchelitchew, whom she had not seen since before the war, went badly. In 1948 Sitwell toured the United States with her brothers, reciting her poetry and, notoriously, giving a reading of [[Lady Macbeth]]'s [[sleepwalking scene]]. Her poetry recitals always were occasions; she made recordings of her poems, including two recordings of ''[[Façade (poem)|Façade]]'', the first with [[Constant Lambert]] as co-narrator, and the second with Peter Pears.

Tchelitchew died in July 1957. Her brother Osbert died in 1969, of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in 1950. Sitwell became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire ([[Order of the British Empire|DBE]]) in 1954. In August 1955, she converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and asked author [[Evelyn Waugh]] to serve as her godfather.

Sitwell wrote two books about Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]: ''Fanfare for Elizabeth'' (1946) and ''The Queens and the Hive'' (1962). She always claimed that she wrote prose simply for money and both these books were extremely successful, as were her ''English Eccentrics'' (1933) and {{sic|''Victoria of England''}} (1936).

Sitwell was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in November 1962 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] on the stage of the BBC Television Theatre in London.

Sitwell lived from 1961 until her death in a flat in [[Hampstead]] in London, which is now marked with an [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Edith Sitwell {{!}} Poet {{!}} Blue Plaques |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/edith-sitwell/ |publisher=English Heritage |access-date=30 January 2021}}</ref>

==Last years and death==
About 1957 Sitwell began using a [[wheelchair]], after battling with [[Marfan syndrome]] throughout her life.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} Her last poetry reading was in 1962. In the following year she was awarded the title of [[Companion of Literature]] by the [[Royal Society of Literature]] (the first woman to be so honoured).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rsliterature.org/award/companions-of-literature/|title=Companions of Literature|publisher=Royal Society of Literature}}</ref> She died <!-- of [[cerebral haemorrhage]] -->at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], [[Lambeth]], London, on 9 December 1964 at the age of 77.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-36113|title=Sitwell, Dame Edith Louisa (1887–1964), poet and biographer|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/36113|isbn=978-0-19-861412-8}}</ref> She is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of Saints Mary and Peter in [[Weedon Lois]], Northamptonshire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/sitwell.html|title=Edith Sitwell Weedon Lois England poet grave|website=www.poetsgraves.co.uk}}</ref>

Sitwell's papers are held at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at [[The University of Texas at Austin]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

==Poetry==
Sitwell published her first poem ''The Drowned Suns'' in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in 1913 and between 1916 and 1921 she edited ''Wheels'', an annual poetic anthology compiled with her brothers—a literary collaboration generally called "[[the Sitwells]]".

In 1929 she published ''Gold Coast Customs'', a poem about the artificiality of human behaviour and the barbarism that lies beneath the surface. The poem was written in the rhythms of the [[tom-tom drum|tom-tom]] and of [[jazz]], and shows considerable technical skill. Her early work reflects the strong influence of the French [[symbolists]].

She became a proponent and supporter of innovative trends in English poetry and opposed what she considered the conventionality of many contemporary backward-looking poets. Her flat became a meeting place for young writers whom she wished to befriend and help: these later included [[Dylan Thomas]] and [[Denton Welch]]. She also helped to publish the poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]] after his death. Her only novel, ''[[I Live Under a Black Sun]]'', based on the life of [[Jonathan Swift]], was published in 1937.

==Publicity and controversy==
Sitwell had angular features resembling Queen Elizabeth I and she stood six feet tall. She often dressed in an unusual manner with gowns of brocade or velvet, with gold turbans and many rings; her jewellery is now in the jewellery galleries of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. Her unusual appearance provoked critics almost as much as her verse, and she was the subject of virulent personal attacks from [[Geoffrey Grigson]], [[F. R. Leavis]], and others. She gave as good as she got, describing Leavis as "a tiresome, whining, pettyfogging little pipsqueak".<ref>Wendy Pollard ''Pamela Hansford Johnson: Her Life, Work and Times'' (Shepeard-Walwyn, UK, 2014) {{ISBN|978-0-85683-298-7}}. page 280.</ref>

Sitwell treated her enemies with scorn. [[Noël Coward]] wrote a skit on her and her two brothers as "the Swiss Family Whittlebot" for his 1923 revue ''[[London Calling!]]'', and although she wrote accepting an apology from him in 1926,<ref>''Edith Sitwell. Selected Letters.'' Edited by John Lehman and Derek Parker. Macmillan, London, 1970</ref> she refused to speak to him until they were reconciled after her 70th birthday party at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]]. Sitwell participated in the ''UGH....'' correspondence featured in the [[Times Literary Supplement]] in 1963, an ongoing debate on the value of the work of [[William S. Burroughs]] and the nature of literary criticism, initiated by critic John Willard. Sitwell stated that she was delighted by Willard's wholly negative review of Burroughs' work, despite claiming not to know who Burroughs was. In the same letter, she described ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' as an "insignificant, dirty little book", and rounded out her letter with the statement that she preferred [[Chanel Number 5]] to having her nose "nailed to other people's lavatories".<ref>''William S. Burroughs At The Front: Critical Reception, 1959-1989'' (eds. Jennie Skerl and Robin Lydenberg).<!-- publishing info needed --></ref>

Sitwell explored the distinction between poetry and music in ''[[Façade (poem)|Façade]]'' (1922), a series of abstract poems set to music by [[William Walton]]. ''Façade'' was performed behind a curtain with a hole in the mouth of a face painted by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]]; the words were recited through the hole with the aid of a megaphone. The public received the first performance with bemusement. Critic [[Julian Symons]] attacked Sitwell in ''[[The London Magazine]]'' of November 1964, accusing her of "wearing other people's bleeding hearts on her own safe sleeve."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1964|title=The London Magazine|journal=The London Magazine|volume=4|issue=8|asin=B0034RS9EK}}</ref>
