==Life==
Margaret was born at [[Wallyford]], near [[Musselburgh]], East Lothian, as the only daughter and youngest surviving child of Margaret Oliphant (c. 1789 – 17 September 1854) and Francis W. Wilson (c. 1788–1858), a clerk.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jay |first=Elisabeth |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-20712 |title=Oliphant, Margaret Oliphant Wilson (1828–1897), novelist and biographer |date=2004-09-23 |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=1 |language=en |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/20712}}</ref><ref name="Times1854Sep19">{{Cite newspaper The Times |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS17206067&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0 |articlename=Deaths |date=19 September 1854 |page_number=1 |issue=21850 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> She spent her childhood at [[Lasswade]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Liverpool]]. A street, Oliphant Gardens in Wallyford, is named after her. As a girl, she continually experimented with writing. She had her first novel published, ''Passages in the Life of Mrs. Margaret Maitland'', in 1849. This dealt with the relatively successful [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Scottish Free Church]] movement, with which her parents sympathised. Next came ''Caleb Field'' in 1851, the year she met the publisher [[William Blackwood]] in Edinburgh and was invited to contribute to ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' – a tie that continued for her lifetime and covered over 100 articles, including a critique of the character of [[Arthur Dimmesdale]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''.

In May 1852, Margaret married her cousin, Frank Wilson Oliphant, at [[Birkenhead]] and settled at [[Harrington Square]], now in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], London. Her husband was an artist working mainly in [[stained glass]]. Three of their six children died in infancy.<ref>According to Elizabeth Jay, in the introduction of Margaret Oliphant's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S3i4B7wq2xwC&pg=PA203 Autobiography]'' (published in 2002), p. 9, one of these children died aged one day, another, Stephen Thomas, at nine weeks, and Marjorie, the other daughter, at about eight months. The surviving children were Maggie (died in 1864), Cyril Francis, "Tiddy" (died in 1890) and Francis Romano, "Cecco" (died in 1894). However, ''The Victorian Web'' mentions seven children. See also Elisabeth Jay: Oliphant, Margaret Oliphant... In: ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford: OUP, 2004). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20712 Retrieved 14 November 2010. Subscription required.] for the countless dependents she supported through much of her life.</ref> Her husband developed tuberculosis and for his health they moved in January 1859 to [[Florence]] and then to [[Rome]], where he died. This left Oliphant almost bereft of resources. She returned to England and took up the task of supporting her three remaining children with literature.

[[File:Memorial to Mrs Oliphant in St Giles Cathedral Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|180px|Memorial to Mrs Oliphant in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, unveiled by [[J. M. Barrie]].<ref name="ODNB">[[ODNB]]</ref>]]
She had now become a popular writer and worked with notable industry to sustain her position. Unfortunately, her home life was full of sorrow and disappointment. In January 1864 her only remaining daughter Maggie died in Rome and was buried in her father's grave. Her brother, who had emigrated to Canada, was shortly afterwards involved in financial ruin. Oliphant offered a home to him and his children, adding their support to already heavy responsibilities.

In 1866 she settled at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] to be near her sons, who were attending [[Eton College|Eton]]. That year, her second cousin, [[Annie Louisa Walker]], came to live with her as a companion-housekeeper.<ref name="AutoElephant">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3i4B7wq2xwC&q=Annie+Louisa+Coghill|title=The autobiography of Margaret Oliphant |editor=Elizabeth Jay |year=2002 |isbn=1-55111-276-0 |publisher=Broadview Press Ltd |place= ississauga, Canada}}</ref> Windsor was her home for the rest of her life. Over more than 30 years she pursued a varied literary career, but personal troubles continued. Her ambitions for her sons remained unfulfilled. Cyril Francis, the elder, died in 1890, leaving a ''Life of [[Alfred de Musset]]'', incorporated in his mother's ''Foreign Classics for English Readers''.<ref name="pubhist">[http://www.publishinghistory.com/foreign-classics-for-english-readers-blackwood.html Foreign Classics for English Readers (William Blackwood & Sons) - Book Series List], publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 20 May 2017.</ref> The younger, Francis (whom she called "Cecco"), collaborated with her in the ''Victorian Age of English Literature'' and won a position at the [[British Museum]], but was rejected by [[Sir Andrew Clark, 1st Baronet|Sir Andrew Clark]], a famous physician. He died in 1894. With the last of her children lost to her, she had little further interest in life. Her health steadily declined and she died at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] on 20 June 1897.<ref name="Times1897Nov06"/><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/06/27/117906335.pdf ''"Death of Mrs. Oliphant: Cancer Ends the Career of the Famous English Novelist and Historian,"''] The New York Times, 27 June 1897.</ref> She was buried in [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] beside her sons.<ref name="ODNB"/> She left a personal estate worth a gross £4,932 and a net value £804.<ref name="Times1897Nov06"/>

In the 1880s Oliphant acted as literary mentor of the Irish novelist [[Emily Lawless]]. During this time Oliphant wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including a long [[ghost story]] ''A Beleaguered City'' (1880) and several short tales, including "The Open Door" and "Old Lady Mary".<ref>[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], ''Who's Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction''. Elm Tree Books, 1977. {{ISBN|0-241-89528-6}}, p. 142.</ref> Oliphant also wrote historical fiction. ''Magdalen Hepburn'' (1854) is set during the [[Scottish Reformation]], and features [[Cultural depictions of Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[John Knox]] as characters.<ref>William Russell Aitken, ''Scottish literature in English and Scots: a guide to information sources''.

She also wrote lives of [[Francis of Assisi]] (1871), the French historian [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Count de Montalembert]] (1872),<ref>{{cite book|title=Memoir of Count de Montalembert ''by Mrs. Oliphant''|year=1872|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100325691}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Simcox, G.

At the time of her death, Oliphant was still working on ''Annals of a Publishing House'', a record of the progress and achievement of the firm of Blackwood, with which she had been so long connected. Her ''Autobiography and Letters'', which present a touching picture of her domestic anxieties, appeared in 1899. Only parts were written with a wider audience in mind: she had originally intended the ''Autobiography'' for her son, but he died before she had finished it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/genre/autobiography/3.html|title=The Problematic Relationship of Autobiographer to Audience|author=George P.

===Critical reception===
Opinions on Oliphant's work are split, with some critics seeing her as a "domestic novelist", while others recognize her work as influential and important to the Victorian literature canon. Critical reception from Oliphant's contemporaries is divided as well. Among those who were not in favour of Oliphant was [[John Skelton (author)|John Skelton]], who took the view that Oliphant wrote too much and too fast.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The new nineteenth century : feminist readings of underread Victorian fiction|date=1996|publisher=Garland Pub|others=Harman, Barbara Leah., Meyer, Susan, 1960-|isbn=081531292X|location=New York|oclc=33948483}}</ref> Writing a ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's]]'' article called "A Little Chat About Mrs. Oliphant", he asked, "Had Mrs. Oliphant concentrated her powers, what might she not have done?

[[M. R.

More modern critics of Oliphant's work include Virginia Woolf, who asked in ''Three Guineas'' whether Oliphant's autobiography does not lead the reader "to deplore the fact that Mrs. Oliphant sold her brain, her very admirable brain, prostituted her culture and enslaved her intellectual liberty in order that she might earn her living and educate her children."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Guineas|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovinch|year=1966|location=San Diego}}</ref> However, even modern critics are divided on Oliphant's work. Authors [[Sandra Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar|Gubar]] did not include Oliphant in their "Great tradition" of women's writing because she did not question or challenge the patriarchy at the time of her life and writing.<ref name=":0" />

===Revival of interest===
Interest in Mrs Oliphant's work declined in the 20th century. In the mid-1980s, a small-scale revival was led by the publishers Alan Sutton<ref>''The Curate in Charge'' (1875), reissued in 1985. {{ISBN|0-86299-327-X}}.</ref> and [[Virago Press]], centred on the Carlingford series and some similarities of subject-matter with the work of [[Anthony Trollope]].<ref>See, for example, the blurb and introduction (p. xiv) to the 1987 Virago paperback edition of ''The Perpetual Curate''. {{ISBN|0-86068-786-4}}.</ref>

[[Penguin Books]] in 1999 published an edition of ''Miss Marjoribanks'' (1866).<ref>{{ISBN|0-14-043630-8}}.</ref> ''Hester'' (1873) was reissued in 2003 by [[Oxford World's Classics]].<ref>{{ISBN|0-19-280411-1}}.</ref> In 2007–2009, the [[Gloucester]] publisher Dodo Press reprinted half a dozen of Oliphant's works. In 2010, both the British Library and [[Persephone Books]] reissued ''The Mystery of Mrs. Blencarrow'' (1890), in the latter case with the novella ''Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamund'' (1886),<ref>Persephone site: [http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/pages/titles/index.asp?id=143 Retrieved 30 October 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029104541/http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/pages/titles/index.asp?id=143 |date=29 October 2010 }}</ref> and the [[Association for Scottish Literary Studies]] produced a new edition of the novel ''Kirsteen'' (1890).<ref>ASLS site: [http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/Kirsteen.html Retrieved 21 June 2012.]</ref>

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast four-hour dramatisations of ''Miss Marjoribanks'' in August/September 1992 and ''Phoebe Junior'' in May 1995. A 70-minute adaptation of ''Hester'' was broadcast on Radio 4 in January 2014.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nh88x|title=BBC Radio 4 Extra - Hester - Omnibus|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref>
