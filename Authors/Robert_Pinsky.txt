=== Career ===
Early on, Pinsky was inspired by the flow and tension of jazz and the excitement that it made him feel. As a former saxophonist, he has said that being a musician was a profoundly influential experience that he has tried to reproduce in his poetry. The musicality of poetry was and is extremely important to his work.<ref>{{cite web|website=Cary Academy|url=http://project1.caryacademy.org/echoes/poet_Robert_Pinsky/defaultrobert%20pinsky.htm|title=Robert Pinsky, New Page 1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927022101/http://project1.caryacademy.org/echoes/poet_Robert_Pinsky/defaultrobert%20pinsky.htm|archive-date=2007-09-27}}</ref> Additionally, Pinsky revealed in a 1999 interview with ''[[Bomb Magazine]]'' that he enjoys jazz for its "physical immediacy, improvisation and also the sense that a lifetime of suffering and study and thought and emotion is behind some single phrase."<ref name="Sleigh">{{cite news|author=Sleigh, Tom|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/68/articles/2249 |title=Robert Pinsky|work=[[BOMB Magazine]] | date= Summer 1998|access-date= June 19, 2012}}</ref>

Pinsky has acknowledged that his poetry would change somewhat depending on the particular subjectivity of each reader. Embracing the idea that people's individuality would fill out the poem, he has said, "The poetry I love is vocal, composed with the poet's voice and I believe its proper culmination is to be read with a reader's imagined or actual voice. The human voice in that sense is not electronically reproduced or amplified; it's the actual living breath inside a body—not necessarily an expert's body or the artist's body. Whoever reads the poem aloud becomes the proper medium for the poem."<ref name="Sleigh" /> Pinsky observes 'the kind of poetry I write emphasizes the physical qualities of the words'<ref>{{cite news |type= Interview |author= Cavalieri, Grace|title=The Poet and the Poem|work= WPFW-FM (1996-96 season)}}</ref> for poetry to Pinsky, is a vocal art, not necessarily performative,but reading to one self or recalling some lines by memory.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Art of Poetry|title= Interview |date=1996|authors= Downing & Kunitz}}</ref> Pinsky comments 'all language is necessarily abstract ' .<ref>Hartman, Charles ''Free Verse – an essay on Prosody'' Princeton University Press, Princeton 1980 {{ISBN|9780810113169}}</ref> No aspect of a poem, he observes, is more singular, more unique, than its rhythm, for there are no rules.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pinsky, Robert|title=The Sounds of Poetry -A Brief Guide|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|date=1998|isbn=0-374-26695-6|url=https://archive.org/details/soundsofpoetry00robe}}</ref>
