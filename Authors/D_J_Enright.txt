== Life ==
Enright was born in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], and educated at Leamington College and [[Downing College, Cambridge]]. After graduating he held a number of academic posts outside the United Kingdom: in [[Egypt]], Japan, [[Thailand]] and notably in [[Singapore]] (from 1960). He at times attributed his lack of success in finding a post closer to home to writing for ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'' and his short association with [[F. R. Leavis]]; whose influence he mainly and early, but not entirely, rejected.

As a poet he was identified with [[Movement (literature)|the Movement]]. His 1955 [[anthology]], ''Poets of the 1950s'', served to delineate the group of British poets in question – albeit somewhat remotely and retrospectively, since he was abroad and it was not as prominent as the [[Robert Conquest]] collection ''[[New Lines]]'' of the following year.
Returning to London in 1970, he edited ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine, with [[Melvin J. Lasky]], for two years. He subsequently worked in publishing. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== The "Enright Affair" ==
Enright gained some notoriety in Singapore after his inaugural lecture at the [[University of Singapore]] on 17 November 1960, titled "Robert Graves and the Decline of Modernism". His introductory remarks on the state of culture in Singapore were the subject of a ''[[Straits Times]]'' article. "'Hands Off' Challenge to 'Culture Vultures'", the next day. Among other things, he stated that it was important for [[Singapore]] and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] to remain "culturally open", that culture was something to be left for the people to build up, and that for the government to institute "a [[sarong]] culture, complete with [[pantun]] competitions and so forth" was futile. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Some quotes include:
<blockquote>Art does not begin in a test-tube, it does not take its origin in good sentiments and clean-shaven, upstanding young thoughts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Leave the people free to make their own mistakes, to suffer and to discover. Authority must leave us to fight even that deadly battle over whether or not to enter a place of entertainment wherein lurks a juke-box, and whether or not to slip a coin into the machine.</blockquote>

The following day, Enright was summoned by the Ministry for Labour and Law regarding his foreigner work permit, and was handed a letter by the Minister for Culture, [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam|S. Rajaratnam]], which had also been released to the press. The letter admonished Enright for "involv[ing] [himself] in political affairs which are the concern of local people", not "visitors, including mendicant professors", and said that the government "[has] no time for asinine sneers by passing aliens about the futility of 'sarong culture complete with pantun competitions' particularly when it comes from beatnik professors". There was also some criticism that Enright had been insensitive towards Malays and their so-called "sarong culture".

With some mediation from the Academic Staff Association of the university, it was agreed that to put the matter to rest, Enright would write a letter of apology and clarification, the government would reply, and both were to be printed in the newspapers. Although the affair was "essentially dead" after that, according to Enright, it would still be brought up periodically in discussions of local culture and academic freedom. Enright gave his account of the incident in ''Memoirs of a Mendicant Professor'' (pp.&nbsp;124–151).<!-- ISBN, page numbers needed -->
