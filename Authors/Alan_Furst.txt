'''Alan Furst''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɜr|s|t}}; born 1941) is an American author of historical [[spy novel]]s. Furst has been called "an heir to the tradition of [[Eric Ambler]] and [[Graham Greene]]," whom he cites along with [[Joseph Roth]] and [[Arthur Koestler]] as important influences. Most of his novels since 1988 have been set just prior to or during the [[Second World War]] and he is noted for his successful evocations of [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples and places during the period from 1933 to 1944.

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], and raised on the [[Upper West Side, Manhattan|Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] where he attended the [[Horace Mann School]], Furst received a B.A. from [[Oberlin College]] in 1962 and an M.A. from [[Penn State]] in 1967.

While attending general studies courses at [[Columbia University]], he became acquainted with [[Margaret Mead]], for whom he later worked. Before becoming a full-time novelist, Furst worked in advertising and wrote magazine articles, most notably for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and as a columnist for the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.

==Early writings==
Furst's papers were obtained by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at The University of Texas at Austin. They include a 1963 letter from his grandfather, Max Stockman, which urged Furst to become a teacher and 'write as a sideline' in his spare time. The collection also includes early articles on a wide variety of topics, published in many magazines for which no common denominator can be found, including ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', ''[[ELLE|Elle]]'', ''Esquire'', ''[[50 Plus]]'', ''International Herald Tribune'', ''Islands'', ''New Choices'', ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Pursuits'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', and ''[[Seattle Weekly]]''.

The Ransom collection remarks: "Of note is the April 1984 ''Esquire'' article, 'The Danube Blues,' which sparked Furst's interest in writing espionage novels. Numerous slides of his 1983 Danube trip are also available. Unproduced [[screenplay]]s include 'Heroes of the Last War' (1984), and 'Warsaw' (1992)."

His early novels (1976–1983) achieved limited success. One item, held in the Ransom collection, includes the manuscript for "One Smart Cookie" (with [[Debbi Fields]], 1987), a commissioned biography of the owner of the [[Mrs. Fields|Mrs. Fields Cookies]] company.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/14/books/14furs.html?pagewanted=1%22Alan%20Furst&sq&st=cse%22&scp=5|title= Shadowy World of Spies, Created in a Secluded Studio|author= Charles McGrath|date= 14 June 2008
|newspaper= The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>

The year 1988 saw publication of ''Night Soldiers'' — inspired by his 1984 trip to [[Eastern Europe]] on assignment for ''Esquire'' — which invigorated his career and led to a succession of related titles. His output since 1988 includes a dozen works. He is especially noted for his successful evocations of [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples and places during the period from 1933 to 1944. While all his historical espionage novels are loosely connected (protagonists in one book might appear as minor characters in another), only ''The World at Night'' and ''Red Gold'' share a common plot.

Writing in ''The New York Times'', the novelist Justin Cartwright says that Furst, who lives in [[Sag Harbor]], [[Long Island]], "has adopted a European sensibility."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/books/review/Cartwright-t.html|title= Cloak and Swagger|author= Justin Cartwright|date= 26 April 2010

He later lived for many years in [[Paris]], a city that he calls "the heart of civilisation" which figures significantly in all his novels.

In 2011, the [[Tulsa City-County Library|Tulsa Library Trust]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]] selected Furst to receive its [[Helmerich Award]], a [[literary prize]] given annually to honor a distinguished author's body of work.<ref name="Furst">David Harper, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=20110306_11_A11_ULNSbh276607 "Spy novelist Alan Furst chosen for 2011 Helmerich Award"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 6, 2011.</ref>

In 2012, he appeared in a documentary about the life and work of author [[W. Somerset Maugham]], ''Revealing Mr. Maugham''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guillen |first1=Michael |title=The Evening Class: FRAMELINE36: REVEALING MR.
