''Quill & Quire'',</ref> In 1977, Acorn introduced the Jackpine sonnet, a form designed to be as irregular and spikey (and Canadian) as a [[jack pine]] tree, but with internal structure and integrity. Without a fixed number of lines and with varied line lengths, the Jackpine sonnet depends on interweaving [[internal rhyme]]s, [[assonance]] and occasional end-[[rhyme]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last= Acorn|first= Milton|date= 1977|title= Jackpine Sonnets|url= https://archive.org/details/jackpinesonnets0000acor/page/|url-access= registration|location= Toronto|publisher= Steel Rail Educational Publishing|page= [https://archive.org/details/jackpinesonnets0000acor/page/ Introduction]|isbn= 9780887910074|author-link= Milton Acorn}}</ref>

In July 1986, he suffered a heart attack and was admitted to the hospital.
