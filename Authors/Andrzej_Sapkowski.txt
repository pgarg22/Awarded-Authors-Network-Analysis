==Biography==
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|Sapkowski [[novel]]s on display occupying two shelves at an [[Empik]] bookstore in [[Katowice]], Poland]]
Sapkowski studied economics at the [[University of Łódź]], and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first [[short story]], ''[[The Witcher]]'' ("Wiedźmin", also translated "The Hexer" or "Spellmaker") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine ''[[Fantastyka]]''. In an interview, he said that being a businessman at the time and thus familiar with marketing, he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won third prize.<ref>[http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm НО МЫ ЖЕ СЛАВЯНЕ! РАЗГОВОР С АНДЖЕЕМ САПКОВСКИМ], An interview with Sapkowski for Russian monthly magazine "World of Fatnastics"</ref> The story was published in ''Fantastyka'' in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a [[Novel sequence|cycle of tales]] based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and six novels. This cycle and his other works have made him one of the best-known [[fantasy author]]s in Poland in the 1990s.<ref name=mo/>

The main character of "The Witcher" is [[Geralt of Rivia]], a monster hunter trained for this since childhood. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].<ref name=mo>{{in lang|pl}} Marek Oramus ''[http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html Jedynie słuszny wizerunek wiedźmina]'', Polityka – nr 36 (2261) from 2000-09-02; pp. 52–54</ref> The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by [[Slavic mythology]].<ref>''[http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Andrzej-Sapkowski/The-Last-Wish.html The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski ]'', fantasybookreview</ref>

==Personal life==
