==Life==

===Early life===
Praed was born in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. The family name of Praed was derived from the marriage of the poet's great-grandfather to a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] heiress. Winthrop's father, William Mackworth Praed, was a [[serjeant-at-law]] (1756–1835) and [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom#Registration process from 1832|revising barrister]] for Bath.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roebuck (ed.)|first1=John A.|title=Pamphlets for the People, vols 1 & 2, (1835)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKhXAAAAcAAJ&q=Praed|website=books.google.co.uk|year=1835|access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref> His mother belonged to the English branch of the [[New England]] family of Winthrop.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=240–241}}

In 1814 Praed was sent to [[Eton College]], where he founded a manuscript periodical called ''Apis matina''. This was succeeded in October 1820 by the ''Etonian'', a paper projected and edited by Praed and [[Walter Blount (officer of arms)|Walter Blount]], which appeared every month until July 1821, when the chief editor, who signed his contributions "Peregrine Courtenay," left Eton, and the paper died. [[Henry Nelson Coleridge]], [[William Sidney Walker]], and [[John Moultrie (poet)|John Moultrie]] were the three best known of his collaborators on this periodical, which was published by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], and of which details are given in Knight's ''Autobiography'' and in [[Henry Maxwell Lyte]]'s ''Eton College''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}

Before Praed left school he had established, over a shop at Eton, a "boys' library," the books of which were later amalgamated in the School Library. His career at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] was a brilliant one. He gained the [[Browne medal]] for [[Greek language|Greek]] verse four times, and the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] for English verse twice in 1823 and 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Complete Collection of the English Poems which Have Obtained the Chancellor's Gold Medal in the University of Cambridge|publisher=W. Metcalfe|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/acompletecollec00cambgoog|author=University of Cambridge|year=1859|access-date=2008-10-01}}</ref> He was bracketed third in the classical tripos in 1825, won a fellowship at his college in 1827, and three years later carried off the Seatonian prize.<ref>{{acad|id=PRT821WM|name=Praed, Winthrop Mackworth}}</ref> At the [[Cambridge Union Society|Union]] his speeches were rivalled only by those of [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] and of [[Charles Austin (lawyer)|Charles Austin]], who subsequently made a great reputation at the parliamentary bar. The character of Praed during his university life is described by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]] in the first volume of his ''Life''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}

===Political career===
Praed began to study law, and in 1829 was called to the bar at the [[Middle Temple]]. On the [[Norfolk]] circuit, his prospects of advancement were bright, but his inclination was towards politics, and after a year or two he took up political life. Whilst at Cambridge he tended to [[Whiggism]], and up to the end of 1829 he continued to have these sympathies, but during the agitation for parliamentary reform his opinions changed, and when he was returned to parliament for [[St Germans (UK Parliament constituency)|St Germans]] (17 December 1830),<ref>R Chambers "Book of Days" states he was elected for Truro in 1830 rather than St Germans</ref> his election was due to the [[British Tory Party|Tory]] party. He sat for that borough until December 1832, and on its extinction contested the borough of [[St Ives (UK Parliament constituency)|St Ives]], within the limits of which the Cornish estates of the Praeds were situated.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}

The pieces he wrote on this occasion were collected in a volume printed at [[Penzance]] in 1833 and entitled ''Trash'', dedicated without respect to [[James Halse]], M.P., his successful opponent. Praed sat for [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]] from 1835 to 1837, and was [[Secretary to the Board of Control]] during Sir [[Robert Peel]]'s short administration. He sat for [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] from 1837 until his death. During the progress of the [[Reform Act 1832]] he advocated the creation of three-cornered constituencies, in which each voter should have the power of giving two votes only, and maintained that [[freehold (real property)|freehold]]s within [[borough]]s should confer votes for the boroughs and not for the county. Neither of these suggestions was then adopted, but the former ultimately formed part of the [[Reform Act 1867]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}

===Personal life===
In 1835, he married Helen Bogle. He died of [[tuberculosis]] at Chester Square, London, two weeks before his 37th birthday.  

==Works==
W. Mackworth Praed was famed for his [[Charades#History|verse charades]].<ref name=eb9>{{citation|contribution=[[s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Charades|Charades]]|editor-last=Baynes|editor-first=Thomas Spencer|title=[[s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]|edition=9th|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|date=1878|volume=[[s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Volume V|V]]|ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}}|page=398}}.</ref> [[Henry Austin Dobson|H. Austin Dobson]] praised Praed's "sparkling wit, the clearness and finish of his style, and the flexibility and unflagging vivacity of his rhythm" ([[Humphry Ward]]'s ''English Poets''). His verse abounded in allusions to the characters and follies of the day. His humour was much imitated.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}

His poems were first edited by [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] (New York, 1844); another American edition, by W. A. Whitmore, appeared in 1859; an authorized edition with a memoir by Derwent Coleridge appeared in 1864: ''The Political and Occasional Poems of W. M. Praed'' (1888),<ref>Praed's poems, ''The Poetical Works of Winthrop Mackworth Praed'', can be found here: [https://archive.org/details/poeticalworkswi00whitgoog],</ref> edited with notes by his nephew, [[George Young (writer)|Sir George Young]], included many pieces collected from various newspapers and periodicals. Sir George Young separated from his work some poems, the work of his friend [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]], generally confused with his. Praed's essays, contributed to various magazines, were published in Morley's ''Universal Library'' in 1887.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}

==Legacy==
Praed was not only successful at Eton during his lifetime, but a society still exists that bears his name. The "Praed" society is the poetry society currently existing at Eton. It meets at a master's house and membership is by invitation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}
