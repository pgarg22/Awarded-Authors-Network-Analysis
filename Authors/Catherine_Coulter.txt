'''Jean Catherine Coulter''' (born December 26, 1942) is an American author of romantic suspense thrillers and [[historical romance]]s who currently resides in northern California.<ref name="Coulter1">{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.ca/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000007990,00.html|title=Coulter profile|publisher=Penguin Group|accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early years===
Coulter grew up on a horse ranch in [[Cameron County, Texas]].<ref name="Coulter2">{{cite web|url=http://www.authorsontheweb.com/features/authormonth/0207coulter/coulter-catherine.asp|title=Authors on the Web - Catherine R. Coulter|publisher=Authors on the Web.com|accessdate=2006-11-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020231725/http://www.authorsontheweb.com/features/authormonth/0207coulter/coulter-catherine.asp|archivedate=2006-10-20}}</ref> Her grandmother, who died at the young age of 37, was also a writer. Her father was a painter and singer, and her mother is a retired concert pianist. Coulter wrote her first two novels, fifteen pages each, when she was fourteen. While a freshman at the [[University of Texas]], Coulter wrote poetry. After earning her undergraduate degree from the University of Texas, Coulter attended [[Boston College]] and earned a master's degree in early 19th-century European history.<ref name="Coulter2"/>

She took a job as a speechwriter for a [[Wall Street]] executive. As her own husband was then a medical student, she spent many of her evenings alone, reading romance novels. One night when they were home together, she found herself in the middle of a particularly bad book and threw it across room, asserting that even she could do better. Her husband challenged her to prove herself, and the two spent the weekend plotting out a storyline for a gothic romance. She wrote the novel in the evenings. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Writing career===
When Coulter finished writing her novel she sent it to an editor at Signet. Three days later Signet offered her a three-book contract. That first novel, ''The Autumn Countess'', was published by [[Penguin Group|Penguin Books]] in 1978. By 1982, she was earning enough to quit her job and become a full-time writer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherwin|first=Elisabeth|title=Coulter dispenses advice like an inspirational speaker|date=1996-08-04|url=http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/gizmo/coulter.html|accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> Since then she has written over fifty books and has had forty-two consecutive New York Times Bestsellers since 1988. Her thriller ''The Maze'' was her first book to place on the ''New York Times'' Hardcover Bestseller list, while ''The Cove'' spent nine weeks on the ''New York Times'' Paperback Bestseller list and sold over one million copies.<ref name="Coulter2"/> Coulter generally publishes one historical romance and one suspense novel each year, and has been busily rewriting many of her earlier Regency romances to turn them into longer historical romances.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Laurie|title=Some Time with Catherine Coulter|publisher=The Romance Reader|year=1996|url=http://www.likesbooks.com/int7.html|accessdate=2007-02-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218154827/http://www.likesbooks.com/int7.html|archivedate=2007-02-18}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Coulter sits down at her computer every morning at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. to review her email before beginning writing at 7:30&nbsp;a.m.  She normally finishes writing by 11 a.m. to 11:30&nbsp;a.m. Coulter lives in [[Sausalito, California]] with her husband.<ref name="Coulter2"/><ref>[http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/5828/catherine-coulter Catherine Coulter | Penguin Random House] Retrieved 2016-12-15.</ref>
