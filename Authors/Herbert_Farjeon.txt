==Career==

His first play to be performed, ''Friends'', was put on at the [[Abbey Theatre]], Dublin in 1917. Subsequently, he had several plays performed in London. He was better known for his [[revue]]s than for his "straight" plays, however. These included: ''Spread It Abroad'', ''The Two Bouquets'', ''Nine Sharp'', ''Little Revue'', ''Diversion'' and ''Light and Shade''. He is credited with discovering [[Joyce Grenfell]], whose first stage appearance was in ''Light and Shade''. In 1938, he joined the management of the [[Little Theatre in the Adelphi|Little Theatre]] in London, and his revues were performed there.<ref name="Bristol"/> His songs included "[[I've danced with a man, who's danced with a girl, who's danced with the Prince of Wales]]".
 
He wrote reviews of plays and articles about the theatre for a number of British newspapers and magazines, including the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' and the ''[[Radio Times]]''. He was interested in the history of the theatre, and wrote about the Elizabethan theatre, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and his plays, and edited a seven volume publication of the text of the [[First Folio]]. In the 1940s he helped to save the [[Theatre Royal, Bristol]] when it was put up for sale and might have ceased to be a theatre.<ref name="Bristol"/>

He collaborated with his sister on a number of books, including ''Kings and Queens'' (1932), ''The Two Bouquets'' (1938, also staged with music by [[Ernest Irving]]), ''An Elephant in Arcady'' (1939), and ''The Glass Slipper'' (1944).
