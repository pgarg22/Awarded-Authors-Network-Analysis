'''Jane Arden''' (29 October 1927 – 20 December 1982, born '''Norah Patricia Morris''') was a British [[film director]], actress, singer/songwriter and poet, who gained note in the 1950s. Born in [[Pontypool]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], she studied at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]. She started acting in the late 1940s and writing for stage and television in the 1950s. In the 1960s, she joined movements for [[feminism]] and [[anti-psychiatry]]. She wrote a screenplay for the film ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'' (1967). In the late 1960s and 1970s, she wrote for [[experimental theatre]], adapting one work as a self-directed film, ''[[The Other Side of the Underneath]]'' (1972). In 1978 she published a poetry book. 
Arden committed suicide in 1982. In 2009, her feature films ''Separation'' (1967), ''The Other Side of the Underneath'' (1972) and ''[[Anti-Clock]]'' (1979) were restored by the [[British Film Institute]] and released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. Her literary works are out of print.

==Early life and career==
Arden was born '''Norah Patricia Morris''' at 47 Twmpath Road, [[Pontypool]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], then still considered by some to be part of England.<ref>[http://babylonwales.blogspot.com/2010/05/jane-arden.html Jane Arden at babylonwales.blogspot.com].</ref> She studied acting at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London and began a career in the late 1940s on television and in film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rada.ac.uk/profiles/jane-arden/ |title=Jane Arden — RADA |last=Fabrique |website=Rada.ac.uk}}</ref>

Arden appeared in a television production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in the late 1940s and starred in two British crime films: ''[[Black Memory]]'' (1947) directed by [[Oswald Mitchell]] – which provided South African-born actor [[Sid James]] with his first screen credit (billed as Sydney James) – and Richard M. Grey's ''A Gunman Has Escaped'' (1948). In 2017 [[Renown Pictures]] released both films on DVD in a set of three discs, ''Crime Collection Volume One''.

==Writing and theatre==
In the 1950s Arden married the director [[Philip Saville]]. After a short spell in New York, where she began writing, the couple settled in [[Hampstead]] and had two sons. Arden then wrote several plays and television scripts, some of which her husband directed.<ref name=screenonline>{{Cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1364950/index.html |title=Arden, Jane (1927-82) |website=Screen Online}}</ref>

Arden worked in the late 1950s with some leading figures in British theatre and cinema. Her stage play ''Conscience and Desire, and Dear Liz'' (1954) gained interest. Her comic television drama ''Curtains For Harry'' (1955) starring [[Bobby Howes]] and [[Sydney Tafler]] was shown on 20 October 1955 by the new [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7fc12b7b|title=Curtains for Harry (1955) |website=BFI}}</ref> featuring also the ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' actress [[Joan Sims]]. Arden's co-writer on this was the American [[Richard Lester]], who was working as a television director at the time.

In 1958, her play ''[[The Party (1958 play)|The Party]]'', a family drama set in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], was directed at London's [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] by [[Charles Laughton]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-13503928 |title=Obituary: Albert Finney |date=8 February 2019 |publisher= |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> It turned out to be Laughton's last appearance on the London stage, while providing [[Albert Finney]] with his first.<ref name=screenonline/> Her television drama ''The Thug'' (1959) gave [[Alan Bates]] a powerful early role.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7ccded9d |title=The Thug (1959) |website=BFI}}</ref> In 1964, Arden appeared with [[Harold Pinter]] in ''In Camera'', a television production of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[No Exit|Huis Clos]]'' directed by Saville.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b72c53297|title=In Camera (1964) |website=BFI}}</ref>

==Feminism, film and radical theatre==
Arden's work became increasingly radical through her growing involvement in [[feminism]] and the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement of the 1960s. This is particularly clear from 1965 onwards, starting with the television drama ''The Logic Game'', which she wrote and starred in.<ref name=screenonline/> ''The Logic Game'', directed by Saville, also starred the British actor [[David de Keyser]], who worked with her again in the film ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'' (1967).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6baa4ce2 |title=Separation (1968) |website=BFI}}</ref> Arden wrote the screenplay; the film was directed by [[Jack Bond (director)|Jack Bond]] (born 1937). ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'', shot in black and white by Aubrey Dewar, featured music by the group [[Procol Harum]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.procolharum.com/separation_ihrev.htm |title=Ian Hockley reviews 'Separation' in London on Bastille Day 2009 |website=Procolharum.com}}</ref>

Arden and Bond had hitherto worked on the [[documentary film]] ''Dalí in New York'' (1966), which has the [[surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]] and Arden walking the streets of [[New York City]] and discussing Dalí's work.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8d103e25 |title=Dali in New York (1966) |website=BFI}}</ref> This was resurrected and shown at the 2007 [[Tate Gallery]] Dalí exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.closeupfilmcentre.com/vertigo_magazine/issue-14-december-2007/arden-and-dali-loiter-in-the-streets/ |title=VERTIGO – Arden and Dali Loiter in the Streets |website=Closeupfilmcentre.com}}</ref>

Arden's television work in the mid-1960s included appearances in Saville's ''Exit 19'', Jack Russell's ''The Interior Decorator'', and the satirical programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' hosted by [[David Frost]].<ref name=bfi>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f19de0e |title=Jane Arden |website=BFI}}</ref> Her work in [[experimental theatre]] in the late 1960s and the 1970s coincided with a return to cinema as an actor, writer and director or co-director.<ref name=screenonline/>

The play ''Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven'' (1969), starring [[Victor Spinetti]], and [[Sheila Allen (English actress)|Sheila Allen]], was sold out for six weeks at London's [[Arts Lab]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theatrevoice.com/audio/vagina-rex-and-the-gas-oven/ |title=Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven (1/2) |publisher=}}</ref> It was described by [[Arthur Marwick]] as "perhaps the most important single production" at the venue during that period.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marwick |first=Arthur |title=The Sixties |url=https://archive.org/details/sixtiesculturalr00marw |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1998 |location=Oxford |page=[https://archive.org/details/sixtiesculturalr00marw/page/352 352] |isbn=0-19-288100-0}}</ref> Also around that time Arden wrote the drama ''The Illusionist''.

In 1970, Arden formed the [[radical feminist]] theatre group Holocaust and wrote the play ''A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches'', which would later be adapted for the screen as ''[[The Other Side of the Underneath]]'' (1972).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b2594d5 |title=The Other Side of the Underneath (1973) |website=BFI}}</ref> She directed the film and appeared in it uncredited; screenings at film festivals, including the 1972 [[London Film Festival]], caused a major stir. It depicts a woman's mental breakdown and rebirth in scenes at times violent and shocking; the writer and critic [[George Melly]] called it "a most illuminating season in Hell",<ref>[http://vertigomagazine.co.uk/showarticle.php?sel=bac&siz=1&id=836 Vertigo Magazine:] Unknown pleasures: By [[Sean Kaye-Smith]]. Retrieved August 2007.</ref> while the [[BBC Radio]] journalist David Will called it "a major breakthrough for the British cinema".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.closeupfilmcentre.com/vertigo_magazine/issue-11-august-2007/unknown-pleasures/ |title=VERTIGO – Unknown Pleasures |website=Closeupfilmcentre.com}}</ref>

Throughout her life, Arden's interest in other cultures and belief systems increasingly took the form of a personal spiritual quest.

After ''The Other Side of the Underneath'' came two further collaborations with Jack Bond in the 1970s: ''Vibration'' (1974), described by Geoff Brown and Robert Murphy in their book ''Film Directors in Britain and Ireland'' ([[British Film Institute]] 2006) as "an exercise in meditation utilising experimental film and video techniques",<ref>[http://library.aftrs.edu.au/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=E26163B25718F.33284&profile=nfts&uri=link=3100006~!259374~!3100001~!3100002&aspect=subtab13&menu=search&ri=1&source=~!horizon&term=Anti-clock&index= Horizon Information Portal:] Summary.</ref> and the futuristic ''[[Anti-Clock]]'' (1979), which featured Arden's songs and starred her son Sebastian Saville. The latter opened the 1979 [[London Film Festival]].

In 1978, Arden published the book ''You Don't Know What You Want, Do You?'' and supported its publication with public readings and discussions, for instance at the [[King's Head Theatre]] in London on 1 October 1978. Although loosely defined as poetry, it is also a radical socio-psychological manifesto comparable to [[R. D. Laing]]'s ''Knots''. By this time, Arden had moved on from [[feminism]] to a view that all people needed freeing from the tyranny of rationality.

==Personal life==
Jane Arden had two sons with Philip Saville: Sebastian and Dominic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/philip-saville-obituary |title=Philip Saville obituary |first=Toby |last=Hadoke |date=1 January 2017 |publisher= |website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

Arden committed suicide at Hindlethwaite Hall in [[Coverdale (dale)|Coverdale]], [[Yorkshire]], on 20 December 1982.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ppzbwz/jack-bond-144-v16n9.|title=Jack Bond - VICE<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Vice.com|accessdate=19 July 2020}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In July 2008, Arden was among the topics discussed at the Conference of 1970s British Culture and Society held at the [[University of Portsmouth]].

In 2009, the [[British Film Institute]] restored the three major feature films Arden made with her creative associate Jack Bond: ''[[Separation (1967 film)|Separation]]'' (1967), ''[[The Other Side of the Underneath]]'' (1972) and ''[[Anti-Clock]]'' (1979).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/blu-rays-dvds/separation |title=Separation |website=British Film Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/blu-rays-dvds/other-side-underneath |title=The Other Side of the Underneath |website=British Film Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/blu-rays-dvds/anti-clock-0 |title=Anti-Clock |website=British Film Institute}}</ref> These became available on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in July 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mondo-digital.com/janearden.html |title=The Films of Jane Arden & Jack Bond |website=Mondo-digital.com}}</ref> Bond was involved in the restoration and reissue processes; the releases were accompanied by an exhibition of the restored features at the [[National Film Theatre]] and The Cube Microplex in [[Bristol]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cubecinema.com/programme/event/id/3559/ |title=Cube: Bfi Jane Arden And Jack Bond Season: Separation |website=Cubecinema.com}}</ref> Her books – poetry and plays – remain out of print.

As a tribute to Arden, the [[experimental music|experimental-music]] group [[Hwyl Nofio]], fronted by [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] from Pontypool, included the song "Anti-Clock" on their album ''[[Dark (album)|Dark]]'' (2012).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hwyl-Nofio-Dark/release/5209524 |title=Hwyl Nofio – Dark |website=Discogs.com}}</ref>
