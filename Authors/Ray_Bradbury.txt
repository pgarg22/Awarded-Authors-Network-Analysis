'''Ray<!-- Please do not change to Raymond - it is unreferenced and incorrect - confirmed at OTRS 2016100910006885--> Douglas Bradbury''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|æ|d|ˌ|b|ɛ|r|i}}; August 22, 1920{{spaced ndash}}June 5, 2012) was an American [[author]] and [[screenwriter]]. One of the most celebrated 20th-century American writers, he worked in a variety of modes, including [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], [[mystery fiction|mystery]], and [[Literary fiction|realistic fiction]].<ref>[http://victorianweb.org/genre/index.html "Mode" is replacing "genre" in critical terminology in order to broaden the range of critical discussion of specific types of literary expression.

Retrieved 28 February 2021.]</ref>

Bradbury was mainly known for his novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953) and his short-story collections ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (1951).<ref name="NYT-20120606" /> Most of his best known work is [[speculative fiction]], but he also worked in other genres, such as the [[coming of age]] novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'' (1957) and the fictionalized memoir ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'' (1992). He also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including ''[[Moby Dick (1956)|Moby Dick]]'' and ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''. Many of his works were adapted into television and film productions as well as comic books.

''The New York Times'' called Bradbury "the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream."<ref name="NYT-20120606">{{cite news|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|title=Ray Bradbury, Master of Science Fiction, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/books/ray-bradbury-popularizer-of-science-fiction-dies-at-91.html|date=June 6, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|left|Bradbury as a senior in high school, 1938]]
Bradbury was born on August 22, 1920, in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], to Esther ([[née]] Moberg) Bradbury (1888–1966), a [[Swedish American|Swedish immigrant]], and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury (1890–1957), a power and telephone [[lineman (technician)|lineman]] of English ancestry.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Greasley |editor-first=Philip A. |author=Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature |title=Dictionary of Midwestern Literature |volume=1, The Authors |year=2001 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253336095 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnuYKJSoHCMC&pg=PA77| access-date=March 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>p.141 Bloom, Harold ''Ray Bradbury'' 2010 Infobase Publishing</ref><ref>Touponce, William F.

Bradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in [[Waukegan]]. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child.<ref>Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury". Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition" 2001:1–5. EBSCO. November 8, 2010.</ref> This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury's works of fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes "Green Town", [[Illinois]].

The Bradbury family lived in [[Tucson, Arizona]], during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to [[Waukegan]]. While living in Tucson, Bradbury attended Amphi Junior High School and Roskruge Junior High School. They eventually settled in [[Los Angeles]] in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old. The family arrived with only US$40 ({{Inflation|US|40|1934|fmt=eq}}), which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week ({{Inflation|US|14|1934|fmt=eq}}). This meant that they could stay, and Bradbury, who was in love with Hollywood, was ecstatic.<!--TONE!-->{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury attended [[Los Angeles High School]] and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer [[Ray Harryhausen]] and radio star [[George Burns]]. Bradbury's first pay as a writer, at age 14, was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the '' [[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show.<ref>[http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/18/ray-bradbury-has-the-most-amazing-dreams-i-write-screenplays-he-says-with-a-wink-in-the-middle-of-the-night-when-he-wa/ Ray Bradbury's close encounters with W.C.

==Influences==

===Literature===
Throughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer and knew at a young age that he was "going into one of the arts."<ref>Litz, A. Walton. American Writers Supplement IV. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996. Print.</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury| title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203| last=Weller| first=Sam| date=2010-01-01| newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref> Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 12 (1931) —sometimes writing on butcher paper.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Barnaby|editor-first=Barnaby|editor-last2=Schulz|editor-first2=Monte|title=Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|date=15 December 2002|location=Cincinnati, OH|pages=161–164|language=English|isbn=1582971943}}</ref>

In his youth, he spent much time in the [[List of Carnegie libraries in Illinois|Carnegie Library]] in [[Waukegan]], reading such authors as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. At 12, Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|last=Weller|first=Sam|date=2010-01-01|newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref> In addition to comics, he loved the work of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], creator of ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'', especially Burroughs' [[John Carter of Mars]] series. ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]'' impressed him so much that at the age of 12, he wrote his own sequel.<ref>Contemporary Authors Online. ''Ray Bradbury''. Detroit: Gale, 2009. Web.</ref><ref>Heller, Terry. Magill's Survey of American Literature. Revised Edition. Pasadena: Salem Press, 2006. Print.</ref> The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about [[Tarzan]] and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', and every night when the show went off the air, he would sit and write the entire script from memory.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orbiting Ray Bradbury's Mars : biographical, anthropological, literary, scientific and other perspectives|others=McMillan, Gloria (Professor)|isbn=9780786475766|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|oclc=857141273|last1 = McMillan|first1 = Gloria|last2=Palumbo|first2=Donald E.|last3=Sullivan Iii|first3=C. W.|date=2013-09-17}}</ref>

As a teen in [[Beverly Hills]], he often visited his mentor and friend science-fiction writer [[Bob Olsen]], sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in [[Hollywood]], Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]].<ref>The article linked appears in the source, but this name conflicts with the group's web site.</ref> Excited to find that others shared his interest, Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday-night conclave at age 16.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Big Read| url=http://www.neabigread.org/books/fahrenheit451/fahrenheit451_04.php| publisher=Neabigread.org| access-date=July 6, 2012}}</ref>

Bradbury cited [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Jules Verne]] as his primary science-fiction influences. Bradbury identified with Verne, saying, "He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally".
<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury interview – The art of Fiction No. 203] ''The Paris Review''; Spring, 2009</ref> Bradbury admitted that he stopped reading science-fiction books in his 20s and embraced a broad field of literature that included poets [[Alexander Pope]] and [[John Donne]].<ref name="playboy"/> Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein, then 31 years old. Bradbury recalled, "He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical."<ref name="playboy"/>

In young adulthood Bradbury read stories published in ''Astounding Science Fiction'', and read everything by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the early writings of [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]].

===Hollywood===
The family lived about four blocks from the [[Fox Uptown Theatre]] on [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] in [[Los Angeles]], the flagship theater for [[MGM]] and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, "hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious." Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were [[Norma Shearer]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and [[Ronald Colman]]. Sometimes, he spent all day in front of [[Paramount Pictures]] or [[Columbia Pictures]] and then skated to the [[Brown Derby]] to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing [[Cary Grant]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], and [[Mae West]], who, he learned, made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.<ref name="playboy">{{cite journal|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_playboy.html |title=About Ray Bradbury Interview|journal=Playboy|year= 1996|author=Ken Kelley}}</ref>

Bradbury relates the following meeting (as an adult) with [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], director of Soviet epic film series ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', at a [[Hollywood]] award ceremony in Bondarchuk's honor:

{{quote|They formed a long queue and as Bondarchuk was walking along it he recognized several people: "Oh Mr. Ford, I like your film." He recognized the director, Greta Garbo, and someone else. I was standing at the very end of the queue and silently watched this. Bondarchuk shouted to me; "Ray Bradbury, is that you?" He rushed up to me, embraced me, dragged me inside, grabbed a bottle of [[Stolichnaya]], sat down at his table where his closest friends were sitting. All the famous Hollywood directors in the queue were bewildered. They stared at me and asked each other "Who is this Bradbury?" And, swearing, they left, leaving me alone with Bondarchuk&nbsp;...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/06/06/ray_bradbury_russians_have_an_unparalleled_capacity_for_love_15822.html|title=Ray Bradbury: "Russians have an unparalleled capacity for love"|publisher=Russia Beyond The Headlines |website=www.rbth.ru|access-date=September 15, 2012|date=2012-06-07}}</ref>}}

==Career==
[[File:Amazing stories 194412.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bradbury's "Undersea Guardians" was the cover story for the December 1944 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Bradbury's first published story was "[[Hollerbochen's Dilemma]]", which appeared in the January 1938 number of [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest J. Ackerman's]] [[fanzine]] ''Imagination!''.<ref name=isfdb/> In July 1939, Ackerman and his girlfriend [[Morojo]] gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the [[1st World Science Fiction Convention|First World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[New York City]], and funded Bradbury's fanzine, titled ''[[Futuria Fantasia]]''.<ref>[http://www.raybradbury.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000825.html Marguerite bradbury – Ray Bradbury Discussion] Ray Bradbury Official website</ref> Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each limited to under 100 copies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to [[Rob Wagner]]'s film magazine, ''Script''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|journal=The Paris Review|volume=Spring 2010|issue=192|date=Spring 2010|author=Sam Weller }}</ref>

Bradbury was free to start a career in writing when, owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected for induction into the military during [[World War II]]. Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Buck Rogers]], Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. Bradbury was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to attend the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]], which at the time met at [[Clifton's Cafeteria]] in downtown Los Angeles. There he met the writers [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Emil Petaja]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Leigh Brackett]] and [[Jack Williamson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1939, Bradbury joined [[Laraine Day]]'s Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, "so incredibly bad" that he gave up playwriting for two decades.<ref name="bradbury1972">{{cite book|title=The Veldt|publisher=Dramatic Publishing|author=Bradbury, Ray|author-link=Ray Bradbury| year=1972| location=Woodstock, Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YP_awFRqToC&pg=PA4| page=4| isbn=978-1-58342-028-7}}</ref> Bradbury's first paid piece, "Pendulum", written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine ''Super Science Stories'' in November 1941, for which he earned $15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s9.com/Biography/Bradbury-Raymond-Douglas| title=Biographies: Bradbury, Raymond Douglas|publisher=s9.com|access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>

Bradbury sold his first solo story, "The Lake", for $13.75 at 22 and became a full-time writer by 24.<ref name="playboy"/> His first collection of short stories, ''[[Dark Carnival (short story collection)|Dark Carnival]]'', was published in 1947 by [[Arkham House]], a small press in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]], owned by writer [[August Derleth]]. Reviewing ''Dark Carnival'' for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Will Cuppy]] proclaimed Bradbury "suitable for general consumption" and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]].<ref>Cuppy, Will, "Review of Dark Carnival," ''New York Herald Tribune Books'', May 25, 1947.</ref>

After a rejection notice from the pulp ''[[Weird Tales]]'', Bradbury submitted "Homecoming" to ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named [[Truman Capote]]. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a [[slush pile]], which led to its publication. ''Homecoming'' won a place in the [[O. Henry Award]] Stories of 1947.<ref>[http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/ray-bradbury-from-truman-capote-to-a-t-m-s/ Ray Bradbury, From Truman Capote to A.T.M.'s], by Dean Robinson – 6th floor; ''The New York Times'', June 6, 2012</ref>

In [[UCLA]]'s [[Powell Library]], in a study room with typewriters for rent, Bradbury wrote his classic story of a [[book burning]] future, ''The Fireman'', which was about 25,000 words long. It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name ''Fahrenheit 451'', for a total cost of $9.80, due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.<ref>{{cite web|author=A Bruin Birthday Tribute To Ray Bradbury Tweet|url=http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|title=First Spark: Ray Bradbury Turns 90; The Universe and UCLA Academy Celebrate|publisher=Spotlight.ucla.edu|date=August 22, 2010|access-date=September 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005161805/http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|archive-date=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer [[Christopher Isherwood]] gave Bradbury the opportunity to put ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' into the hands of a respected critic.

==Writing==
Bradbury attributed his lifelong habit of writing every day to two incidents. The first of these, occurring when he was three years old, was his mother's taking him to see [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] in the 1923 silent film ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.<ref>Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury." Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition (2001): UFO. November 10, 2010.</ref> The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, "Live forever!"<ref name="IHW">{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/inhiswords02.html|title=In His Words| publisher=RayBradbury.com| access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref> Bradbury remarked, "I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico&nbsp;... [he] gave me a future&nbsp;... I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago."<ref name="IHW"/> At that age, Bradbury first started to do [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], which was his first great love. If he had not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.<ref>Terry Sanders' film Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer (1963)</ref>

Bradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers [[Robert Frost]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. From Steinbeck, he said he learned "how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment". He studied [[Eudora Welty]] for her "remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line". Bradbury's favorite writers growing up included [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Edith Wharton]], and [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]].<ref name="Paris Review">[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury The Art of Fiction No. 203: Ray Bradbury], Interviewed by Sam Weller; ''The Paris Review'', Spring 2010</ref>

Bradbury was once described as a "[[Midwest]] [[surrealism|surrealist]]" and is often labeled a science-fiction writer, which he described as "the art of the possible." Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:<ref>[http://www.cosmolearning.com/videos/a-conversation-with-ray-bradbury-2001-1131/ A Conversation with Ray Bradbury] Point Loma Nazarene University, Writer's Symposium By The Sea; "The only science fiction I have written is ''Fahrenheit 451''.

Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at a lake edge and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he [[The Lake (short story)|wrote about it]], tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zen in the Art of Writing|first=Ray|last=Bradbury|date=1990}}</ref>

When later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, Bradbury replied, "From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who've said things well." He is quoted, "If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life."<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/06/personal_lessons_from_futurist.html Personal lessons from futurist Ray Bradbury on crying, escaping, laughing], by Mick Mortlock; Oregon Live, June 6, 2012</ref>

In high school, Bradbury was active in both the poetry club and the drama club, continuing plans to become an actor, but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson.<ref>[http://www.spaceagecity.com/bradbury/bio.htm Ray Bradbury Biography] Ray Bradbury Online</ref> The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing,<ref>Litz, A.

Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:
{{quote| Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and we had no money.

He told ''[[The Paris Review]]'', "You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they don't."<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury Interview] ''The Paris Review''</ref>

Bradbury described his inspiration as, "My stories run up and bite me in the leg—I respond by writing them down—everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off".<ref>Garg, Anu, A  Word a Day, 2017.08.22, wordsmith.org</ref>

==="Green Town"===
A reinvention of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics ''Dandelion Wine'', ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', and ''Farewell Summer'', as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Summer Morning, Summer Night by Ray Bradbury|url=https://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|website=Subterranean Press|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822143044/http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|archive-date=August 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.<ref>Sites from these works which still exist in Waukegan include his boyhood home, his grandparents' home next door (and their connecting lawns where  his grandfather and he gathered dandelions to make wine) and, less than a block away, the famous ravine which Bradbury used as a [[metaphor]] throughout his career.</ref>

==Cultural contributions==
Bradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that ''Fahrenheit 451'' touches on the alienation of people by media:
{{quote|In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'' I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, [[sleep walking]], helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.<ref>Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960).</ref>}}

Bradbury stated that the novel worked as a critique of the later development of [[political correctness]]:
{{quote|How does the story of ''Fahrenheit 451'' stand up in 1994?<br />
R.B.: It works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can't say certain things. The homosexual groups don't want you to criticize them. It's thought control and freedom of speech control.<ref name="Conversations with Ray Bradbury">{{cite web |last1=Gasior |first1=Ann |title=Bradbury Talk Likely to Feature the Unexpected |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:168044/datastream/PDF/view |website=Florida State University Libraries |publisher=Dayton Daily News |access-date=2 June 2018 |pages=104–105 |language=en |date=1 October 1994}}</ref>}}

In a 1982 essay, he wrote, "People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it". This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/10/19/prevent-the-future/ |title=I Do Not Want to Predict the Future.

On May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on television in Hollywood on the popular quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' hosted by [[Groucho Marx]].  During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", his short story published six years earlier in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' under the title "The World the Children Made".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBTrUx46b8I| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/NBTrUx46b8I| archive-date=2021-10-29|title=You Bet Your Life #55-35 Science fiction author Ray Bradbury (Secret word 'House', May 24, 1956)|date=November 16, 2013|work=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Bradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said "libraries raised me", and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|access-date=June 7, 2012|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote, "I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid.'

Several comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury's stories. Particularly noted among these were [[EC Comics]]' line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury's stories included ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''Weird Science'', ''Weird Fantasy'', ''Crime Suspenstories'', and ''Haunt of Fear''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-22|title=Ray Bradbury: Comic Book Hero|url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/08/ray-bradbury-comic-book-hero/|access-date=2021-06-17|website=The Saturday Evening Post|language=en-US}}</ref>

Bradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy, as well as literary. Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-ray-bradbury-theater-20120606,0,3881510.story Ray Bradbury, 91, leaves a rich theatrical legacy too] by David Ng; Los Angeles Times, June 6, 2012</ref>

Bradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s–1960s era: [[Jason V Brock]]'s ''Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man'',<ref>French, Lawrence [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/03/richard-matheson-remembers-his-good-friend-charles-beaumont/ "Richard Matheson remembers his good friend Charles Beaumont"], March 24, 2010.

Bradbury's legacy was celebrated by the bookstore [[Fahrenheit 451 Books]] in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. Joseph Nicoletti did some Music-Film Consulting for Ray Bradbury for a while, Nicoletti Lived in Laguna Beach and also did work for Wally Heider and Paramount Pictures' The Godfather III. The grand opening of an annex to the store was attended by Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, [[Joseph Mugnaini]], in the mid-1980s. The shop closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop with the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.<ref>Ray Riegert, ''Hidden Coast of California: The Adventurer's Guide'' (Berkeley, Cal.: Ulysses Press, 1988), p. 133.</ref>

His wife of 56 years, Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman Bradbury ever dated.<ref name="playboy"/>

He was raised [[Baptist]] by his parents, who were themselves infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury considered himself a "delicatessen religionist" who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was "a God-given thing, and I'm so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is 'At play in the fields of the Lord.'"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/08/02/Bradbury/index.html| title=Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels'| publisher=CNN| date=August 2, 2010| access-date=October 14, 2015| first=John| last=Blake}}</ref>

Bradbury was a close friend of [[Charles Addams]], and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury's stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams' own [[Addams Family]] placed in rural [[Illinois]]. Bradbury's first story about them was "Homecoming", published in the 1946 Halloween issue of ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', with Addams' illustrations. Addams and he planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family's complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways.<ref>[http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray Interview with Ray Bradbury] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203203807/http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray |date=February 3, 2009 }} in ''IndieBound'', fall 2001.</ref> In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, ''[[From the Dust Returned]]'', featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original "Homecoming" illustration.<ref>Bradbury, Ray, ''From The Dust Returned: A Novel''.

Late in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the "devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends." Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], who was an intimate friend for many years. They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for ''Star Trek'', which Bradbury never did, objecting that he "never had the ability to adapt other people's ideas into any sensible form."<ref name="playboy"/>

==Bibliography==
{{Main|Ray Bradbury bibliography|Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography}}
Bradbury authored "more than 27 novels and story collections", which included many of his 600 short stories.<ref name="latimes obit"/> More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.<ref name="NYT-20120606"/>
[[File:PlanetStoriesNov1953.png|thumb|upright|Bradbury's "The Golden Apples of the Sun" was published in the November 1953 issue of ''[[Planet Stories]]''.]]
===First novel===
In 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers, but no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, "You could call it ''The Martian Chronicles''." Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became ''The Martian Chronicles.''<ref name="Paris Review"/>

===Intended first novel===
What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007.<ref>[http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/dandelion-wine-50th-anniversary-ed-signed-2-vol-sc-by-ray-bradbury--stephen-king-out-of-print-1022-p.asp Summer Morning, Summer Night], by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007</ref>

==Adaptations to other media==

[[File:Ray Bradbury 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bradbury in 1959, when some of his short stories were adapted for television shows like ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'']]
From 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by [[Al Feldstein]] for [[EC Comics]] (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including "[[The Illustrated Man|Kaleidoscope]]" and "Rocket Man" being combined as "Home To Stay"—for which Bradbury was retroactively paid—and EC's first version of "The Handler" under the title "A Strange Undertaking") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, ''[[The Autumn People]]'' (1965) and ''[[Tomorrow Midnight]]'' (1966), both published by [[Ballantine Books]] with cover illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]].
Also in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', ''Out There'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[CBS Television Workshop]]'', ''[[Fireside Theater|Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Star Tonight]]'', ''Windows'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. "The Merry-Go-Round", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's "The Black Ferris", praised by ''Variety'', was shown on ''Starlight Summer Theater'' in 1954 and NBC's ''Sneak Preview'' in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and its successor ''[[X Minus One]]''.

[[File:Rhedosaurus & the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from the 1953 film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', based on Bradbury's 1951 short story "[[The Fog Horn]]"]]

Producer [[William Alland]] first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', a [[Harry Essex]] screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment "Atomic Monster". Three weeks later came the release of Eugène Lourié's ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's "[[The Fog Horn]]", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, "Tyrannosaurus Rex", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.
Bradbury was hired in 1953 by director [[John Huston]] to work on the screenplay for his film version of [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), which stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Ahab, [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, and [[Orson Welles]] as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], were filmed.

Bradbury's short story ''I Sing the Body Electric'' (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the [[I Sing the Body Electric (The Twilight Zone)|100th episode of ''The Twilight Zone'']]. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.

Bradbury and director Charles Rome Smith co-founded the Pandemonium Theatre Company in 1964.  Its first production was ''The World of Ray Bradbury'', consisting of one-act adaptations of "[[The Pedestrian]]", "The Veldt", and "To the Chicago Abyss".  It ran for four months at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles (October 1964 – February 1965); an off-Broadway production was presented in October 1965.  Another Pandemonium Theatre Company production was mounted at the Coronet Theatre in 1965, again presenting adaptations of three Bradbury short stories: "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit," "The Day It Rained Forever," and "Device Out of Time." (The last was adapted from his 1957 novel ''Dandelion Wine''). The original cast for this production featured [[Booth Coleman]], [[Joby Baker]], Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, [[Keith Taylor (actor)|Keith Taylor]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, [[F. Murray Abraham]], Anne Loos, and [[Len Lesser]].  The director, again, was Charles Rome Smith.

[[Oskar Werner]] and [[Julie Christie]] starred in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by [[François Truffaut]].

In 1966, Bradbury helped [[Lynn Garrison]] create ''AVIAN'', a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, "Planes That Land on Grass".

In 1969, ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' was brought to the big screen, starring [[Rod Steiger]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Robert Drivas]]. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the [[The Illustrated Man (film)|film version]], to compose a [[cantata]] ''[[Christus Apollo]]'' based on Bradbury's text.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |last=Goldsmith |first=Jerry |date=2002 |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Christus Apollo |type=CD |publisher=[[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]]}}</ref> The work premiered in late 1969, with the [[California Chamber Symphony]] performing with narrator [[Charlton Heston]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

''[[The Martian Chronicles (TV miniseries)|The Martian Chronicles]]'' became a three-part TV [[miniseries]] starring [[Rock Hudson]], which was first broadcast by [[NBC]] in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries "just boring".<ref>{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bradburychronicl00well/page/301 301–302]|isbn=978-0-06-054581-9|url=https://archive.org/details/bradburychronicl00well/page/301}}</ref>

The 1982 television movie ''[[The Electric Grandmother]]'' was based on Bradbury's short story "I Sing the Body Electric".

The 1983 horror film ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', starring [[Jason Robards]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]], is based on the Bradbury novel of the [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|same name]].

In 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced "[[Bradbury 13]]", a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of "The Ravine", "Night Call, Collect", "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", "There Was an Old Woman", "Kaleidoscope", "[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]", "The Screaming Woman", "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", "The Man", "The Wind", "The Fox and the Forest", "[[Here There Be Tygers]]", and "The Happiness Machine". Voiceover actor [[Paul Frees]] provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a [[Peabody Award]] and two Gold Cindy awards and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on June 12, 2011.

From 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] anthology television series, ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.

Deeply respected in the [[USSR]], Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science-fiction TV series ''This Fantastic World'' which adapted the stories film version of "I Sing The Body Electric", ''Fahrenheit 451'', "A Piece of Wood", "To the Chicago Abyss", and "Forever and the Earth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtrf.ru/|title=State fund of Television and Radio Programs|language=ru}}</ref> In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of [[There Will Come Soft Rains (short story)|There Will Come Soft Rains]] («Будет ласковый дождь») came out by [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] director Nazim Tyuhladziev.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|script-title=ru:Будет ласковый дождь|language=ru|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909130617/http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|archive-date=September 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He made a film adaptation of [[The Veldt (film)|''The Veldt'' in 1987]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raybradbury.ru/video-stage/video/the_veldt/|script-title=ru:"Вельд", Киностудия "Узбекфильм", 1987|language=ru}}</ref> In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of "[[Here There Be Tygers]]" («Здесь могут водиться тигры») by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:Мультипликационные фильмы|url=http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1&letter=%c7|website=Творческое объединение «Экран»|access-date=14 August 2015|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201212324/http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1|archive-date=February 1, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Bradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of ''[[The Halloween Tree (1993 TV film)|The Halloween Tree]]'', based on [[The Halloween Tree|his 1972 novel]].

The 1998 film ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'', released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story "The Magic White Suit" originally published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.

In 2002, Bradbury's own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of ''Fahrenheit 451'' at Burbank's Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the Pixel Pups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827043730/http://sromagazine.biz/mag/one_hot_stage/index.html|title=fahrenheit 451 and ray bradbury and flames and fire and falcon theatre and pixel pups and fahrenheit 451|date=August 27, 2005|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  In 1984, Telarium released a game for [[Commodore 64]] based on ''Fahrenheit 451''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemon64.com/|title=Lemon64.com - all about Commodore 64|website=Lemon64}}</ref>

In 2005, the film ''[[A Sound of Thunder (film)|A Sound of Thunder]]'' was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'' revolves around the same theory as ''A Sound of Thunder'' and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of ''A Piece of Wood'' and ''[[The Small Assassin]]'' were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] for using the title ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', which is an allusion to Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', for his documentary about the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore's use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated,  though Bradbury was [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative-leaning]] politically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/301992/ray-bradbury-great-conservative-john-fund|title=Ray Bradbury, a Great Conservative|publisher=Nationalreview.com|date=June 6, 2012|author=Fund, John|access-date=June 6, 2012}}</ref> Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film's release to apologize, saying that the film's marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bradburychronicl00well/page/330 330–331]|isbn=978-0-06-054581-9|url=https://archive.org/details/bradburychronicl00well/page/330}}</ref>

In 2008, the film ''[[Ray Bradbury's Chrysalis]]'' was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.

In 2010, ''The Martian Chronicles'' was adapted for radio by ''Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air''.

Bradbury's works and approach to writing are documented in [[Terry Sanders]]' film ''Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer'' (1963).

Bradbury's poem "Groon" was voiced as a tribute in 2012.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=http://vimeo.com/49873749|title="Groon" (a poem) by Ray Bradbury|work=Vimeo}}</ref>
