'''Richard Purdy Wilbur''' (March 1, 1921 – October 14, 2017) was an American poet and literary translator. One of the foremost poets of his generation, Wilbur's work, composed primarily in traditional forms, was marked by its wit, charm, and gentlemanly elegance. He was appointed the second [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] in 1987 and received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] twice, in 1957 and 1989.<ref>{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1981–1990 | url= https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1981-1990.html | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | year = 2008 | access-date = January 1, 2009}}</ref>

==Early years==
Wilbur was born in [[New York City]] on March 1, 1921, and grew up in [[North Caldwell, New Jersey]].<ref name=nytobit/> In 1938 he graduated from [[Montclair High School (New Jersey)|Montclair High School]], where he worked on the school newspaper.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/richard-purdy-wilbur-dlb/ Richard (Purdy) Wilbur], from the ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]''. Accessed January 1, 2012. "Wilbur showed an early interest in writing, which he has attributed to his mother's family because her father was an editor of the Baltimore Sun and her grandfather was an editor and a publisher of small papers aligned with the Democratic party. At Montclair High School, from which he graduated in 1938, Wilbur wrote editorials for the school newspaper."</ref> He graduated from [[Amherst College]] in 1942 and served in the [[United States Army]] from 1943 to 1945 during [[World War II]]. He attended graduate school at [[Harvard University]]. Wilbur taught at [[Wellesley College]], then [[Wesleyan University]] for two decades and at [[Smith College]] for another decade. At Wesleyan he was instrumental in founding the award-winning poetry series of the [[Wesleyan University Press|University Press]].<ref>{{citation | publisher =[[University of Illinois]] | url = http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/wilbur/bio.htm | title = Wilbur biography}}</ref><ref name="NYT">{{citation |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | access-date = July 18, 2011 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E2D6143FF935A25753C1A9639C8B63&sel=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=The University of Verse | first = Jane | last = Gordon | date = October 16, 2005}}</ref> He received two Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry and taught at [[Amherst College]] as late as 2009.<ref>{{citation | chapter-url = https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/rpwilbur42 | publisher =[[Amherst College]] | chapter = Wilbur | title = Faculty staff}}.</ref> He was also on the editorial board of the literary magazine ''[[The Common (magazine)|The Common]]'', based at [[Amherst College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommononline.org/about|title=About The Common - The Common|website=www.thecommononline.org|date=July 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name="NYT"/><ref name="nytobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/obituaries/richard-wilbur-poet-laureate-and-pulitzer-winner-dies-at-96.html |title=Richard Wilbur, Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Winner, Dies at 96 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 16, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Mark | last = Ferney | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2017/10/15/wilbur/n2ZJZF17OJGN1nHQOjUBWP/story.html |title=Richard Wilbur, Pulitzer-winning poet, dies at 96 |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=October 15, 2017 |access-date= October 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/richard-wilbur-in-the-new-yorker |title=Richard Wilbur in the New Yorker |date=October 16, 2017 |first1=Hannah |last1=Aizenman |journal=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-richard-wilbur-20171016-story.html |title=Richard Wilbur, Who Twice Won Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, Dies at 96|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 16, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2019|quote=The U.S. poet laureate in 1987-88, Wilbur was often cited as an heir to Robert Frost and other New England writers and was the rare versifier to enjoy a following beyond the poetry community. He was regarded — not always favorably — as a leading “formalist,” a master of old-fashioned meter and language who resisted contemporary trends. Wilbur was also known for his translations, especially of Moliere, Racine and other French playwrights.}}</ref>

==Literary career==
When only 8 years old, Wilbur published his first poem in ''John Martin's Magazine''.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3509/the-art-of-poetry-no-22-richard-wilbur |title=Richard Wilbur, The Art of Poetry No. 22 |journal=[[The Paris Review]] |series=Interviews |date=Winter 1977 |volume=Winter 1977 |issue=72 |access-date=December 24, 2014}}.</ref> His first book, ''The Beautiful Changes and Other Poems'', appeared in 1947. Thereafter he published several volumes of poetry, including ''New and Collected Poems'' (Faber, 1989). Wilbur was also a translator, specializing in the 17th century French comedies of [[Molière]] and dramas of [[Jean Racine]]. His translation of ''[[Tartuffe]]'' has become the play's standard English version and has been presented on television twice (a 1978 production is available on DVD). Wilbur also published several children's books, including ''Opposites'', ''More Opposites'', and ''The Disappearing Alphabet.'' In 1959 he became the general editor of The Laurel Poetry Series ([[Dell Publishing]]).

Continuing the tradition of [[Robert Frost]] and [[W. H. Auden]], Wilbur's poetry finds illumination in everyday experiences. Less well-known is Wilbur's foray into [[lyrics|lyric]] writing. He provided lyrics to several songs in [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s 1956 [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Candide (musical)|Candide]]'', including the famous "[[Glitter and Be Gay]]" and "Make Our Garden Grow." He also produced several unpublished works, including "The Wing" and "To Beatrice".

His honors included the 1983 [[Drama Desk Special Award]] and the [[PEN Translation Prize]] for his translation of ''[[The Misanthrope]]'', the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] and the [[National Book Award]] for ''Things of This World'' (1956),<ref name=nba1957>

In 1988 he won the [[Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry]] and in 1989 he won a second Pulitzer, for his ''New and Collected Poems.'' On October 14, 1994, he received the [[National Medal of Arts]] from President [[Bill Clinton]]. He also received the [[PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation]] in 1994. In 2003 Wilbur was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/82135-2004-Inductees-of-Theatre-Hall-of-Fame-Announced|title=2004 Inductees of Theatre Hall of Fame Announced|publisher=www.playbill.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331082301/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/82135-2004-Inductees-of-Theatre-Hall-of-Fame-Announced|archive-date=March 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2006 he won the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]].
