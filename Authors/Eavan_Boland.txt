==Life and career==

{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2020}}
Boland's father, [[Frederick Boland]], was a career diplomat and her mother, [[Frances Kelly]], was a noted painter. She was born in Dublin in 1944.

When she was six, Boland's father was appointed [[Irish Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]; the family followed him to London, where Boland had her first experiences of [[anti-Irish sentiment]]. Her dealing with this hostility strengthened Boland's identification with her Irish heritage. She spoke of this time in her poem, "An Irish Childhood in England: 1951".

At 14, she returned to Dublin to attend [[Holy Child Killiney|Holy Child School]] in Killiney.<ref name="irishtimes-obit">{{cite news |title=Eavan Boland obituary: Outstanding Irish poet and academic |access-date=15 May 2020 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/eavan-boland-obituary-outstanding-irish-poet-and-academic-1.4242681 |date=2 May 2020 |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515213036/https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/eavan-boland-obituary-outstanding-irish-poet-and-academic-1.4242681 |archive-date=15 May 2020}}</ref> She published a pamphlet of poetry (23 Poems) in her first year at Trinity, in 1962. Boland earned a BA with First Class Honors in English Literature and Language from [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1966.

Since then she held numerous teaching positions and published poetry, prose criticism and essays. Boland married the novelist Kevin Casey in 1969 and had two daughters. Her experiences as a wife and mother influenced her to write about the centrality of the ordinary, as well as providing a frame for more political and historical themes.

She taught at Trinity College Dublin, [[University College, Dublin]], and [[Bowdoin College]], and was a member of the [[International Writing Program]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. She was also writer in residence at Trinity College Dublin, and at the National Maternity Hospital.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, she taught at the School of Irish Studies in Dublin. From 1996 she was a tenured Professor of English at Stanford University where she was the Bella Mabury and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor in the Humanities and Melvin and Bill Lane Professor for Director of the Creative Writing program. She divided her time between [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], and her home in Dublin.

Boland died in Dublin on 27 April 2020, aged 75, from a stroke.<ref>{{cite news |last= Crowley |first= Sinéad |date= 27 April 2020 |title= Poet Eavan Boland dies aged 75  |url= https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2020/0427/1135169-eavan-boland/ |work= Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) |access-date= 29 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/poet-eavan-boland-passes-away-aged-75-996378.html |title=Poet Eavan Boland passes away aged 75 |date= 27 April 2020 |website=BreakingNews.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Doyle |first= Martin |date= 27 April 2020 |title= Eavan Boland, leading Irish poet and champion of the female voice, dies aged 75 |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/eavan-boland-leading-irish-poet-and-champion-of-the-female-voice-dies-aged-75-1.4239274 |work= The Irish Times |access-date= 29 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Eavan Boland, 'Disruptive' Irish Poet, Is Dead at 75|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/books/eavan-boland-dead.html|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|work=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2020|access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref>
