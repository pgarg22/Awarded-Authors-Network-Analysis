==Early life and education==

Parks was born in [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]]. She grew up with two siblings in a military family. Parks enjoyed writing poems and songs and created a newspaper with her brother, called the "Daily Daily."<ref name="HM">{{cite web|title= Suzan-Lori Parks Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org |publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]] |url=https://achievement.org/achiever/suzan-lori-parks/#interview}}</ref> Parks attended high school in [[West Germany]], where her father, a career officer in the [[United States Army]], was stationed.<ref name=HM /> The experience showed her "what it feels like to be neither white nor black, but simply foreign".<ref name="HM"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115040630/http://spinner.cofc.edu/temples/parks.html?referrer=webcluster& Suzan-Lori Parks (Archived from January 2010)]</ref> After returning to the U.S., Parks's family relocated frequently and she attended school in Kentucky, Texas, California, North Carolina, Maryland, and [[Vermont]].<ref name=HM /> She graduated high school from [[The John Carroll School]] in 1981 while her father was stationed in [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]].<ref name="connections">{{cite news| title=Connections| pages=4| publisher=John Carroll School| date=Spring 2007| url=http://johncarroll.org/data/files/gallery/ParentFiles/April_2007_Connections.pdf| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808153956/http://johncarroll.org/data/files/gallery/ParentFiles/April_2007_Connections.pdf| archive-date=2007-08-08}}</ref><ref name="Academy of Achievement" />

In high school, Parks was discouraged from studying literature by at least one teacher, but upon reading [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'', Parks found herself veering away from her interest in chemistry, gravitating towards writing.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = Interview with Suzan-Lori Parks|jstor = 3299177|journal = [[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]]|date = 1996-01-01|pages = 309–317|volume = 19|issue = 2|first1 = Shelby|last1 = Jiggetts|first2 = Suzan-Lori|last2 = Parks|doi = 10.1353/cal.1996.0053|s2cid = 161387051}}</ref> Parks attended [[Mount Holyoke College]] and became a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She graduated in 1985 with a B.A. in English and German literature. She studied under [[James Baldwin]], who encouraged her to become a playwright; Parks was initially resistant to writing for theater, believing that it was "where a lot of people with too much attitude wore funny clothes and funny little costumes, and they talked with funny little voices even though they were from, like, New York or New Jersey. And I didn't respect that."<ref name=":1"/> Parks began to take classes with Baldwin and, at his behest, began to write plays.<ref name="achievement">{{cite web| title =Suzan-Lori Parks Interview| publisher =Academy of Achievement| date =June 22, 2007| url =http://www.achievement.com/autodoc/page/par1int-5| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090108080211/http://www.achievement.com/autodoc/page/par1int-5| archive-date =January 8, 2009}}</ref> Baldwin later described Parks as, "an utterly astounding and beautiful creature who may become one of the most valuable artists of our time."<ref name="Academy of Achievement">{{cite web|url = http://www.idvl.org/thehistorymakers/Bio321.html|title = Biography Page for Suzan-Lori Parks|date = November 21, 2006|access-date = August 5, 2015|website = The History Makers|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032832/http://www.idvl.org/thehistorymakers/Bio321.html|archive-date = September 24, 2015}}</ref> Parks then studied acting for a year at [[Drama Studio London]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Als |first=Hilton |author-link=Hilton Als|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/the-show-woman |title=The Show-Woman |work=The New Yorker |date=October 30, 2006 |access-date=January 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Bio>{{cite web|title=Suzan-Lori Parks Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/suzan-lori-parks-37703|website=biography.com|access-date=14 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="TookHerCue">{{cite web| title=Suzan-Lori Parks '85 Took Her Cue from Five College Professor James Baldwin| publisher=Mount Holyoke College| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/reasons.shtml?num=5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713222641/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/reasons.shtml?num=5 |archive-date=July 13, 2010 |access-date=August 13, 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Parks has written three screenplays and numerous stage-plays. Her first screenplay was for [[Spike Lee]]'s 1996 film ''[[Girl 6]]''. She later worked with [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions]] on screenplays for ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005 television)|Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Great Debaters]]'' (2007).<ref>[http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/847213.html 'Debaters' makes its case] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413173159/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/847213.html |date=2009-04-13 }}</ref><ref>Harris, Dana and Brodesser, Claude (2004).

=== ''Betting on the Dust Commander'' ===
Although ''Betting on the Dust Commander'' was not the first play Parks wrote, it was the first of her plays to be produced. Her first play ''The Sinner's Place'', which she wrote for her senior project at Mount Holyoke, was rejected for production by her college's drama department as they considered it too experimental since she wanted to have dirt on the stage during the performance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americantheatre.org/2000/10/01/the-possession-of-suzan-lori-parks/|title=The Possession of Suzan-Lori Parks|last=Garrett|first=Shawn Marie|date=2000-10-01|work=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}</ref> When her second play, ''Betting on the Dust Commander,'' first premiered, it ran for three nights in a bar in Manhattan's Lower East Side called ''Gas Station.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/the-show-woman|title=The Show-Woman|last=Als|first=Hilton|date=2006-10-30|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref> It is a short, one-act play set in Kentucky, centering around the lives of a couple, Mare and Lucius, who have been married for 110 years. Parks's unique voice is displayed throughout the text via her use of specific dialect and incorporation of the sounds of sniffling and sneezing as part of the dialogue. The play's title comes from the horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1970, [[Dust Commander]]. As the play goes on, we discover that Dust Commander's Derby is responsible for bringing Mare and Lucius together, and through the couple's discussion of him they think back over their many years of memories together. The motif of dust along with many of the play's lines are intentionally repeated throughout the text. In addition to this Parks does not give the audience any information on how these two characters have managed to live for so long. In this way she destabilizes any linear sense of memory and time. Parks complicates the audience's view of history, relationships, and the past; some argue that Parks's incorporation of these elements and the repetitive style of the text is reminiscent of African rituals and the way that their retelling of stories often incorporate the past in a literal manner.<ref>Kolin, Philip C.

===''Topdog/Underdog''===
One of her best-known works is ''[[Topdog/Underdog]]''. This play marked a departure from the heightened language she usually wrote. Parks is an admirer of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and believed he left a legacy for descendants of slaves. ''Topdog/Underdog'' explains what that legacy is. It tells the story of two African-American brothers: Lincoln and Booth. Lincoln works at a boardwalk arcade, dressing up like Abraham Lincoln and letting the tourists shoot him with plastic guns. He got this job because he could be paid less than the white man who had the job before. Parks does not judge Lincoln in this play, but rather enjoys bringing him into the other characters' lives and seeing how they are affected. She said, "Lincoln is the closest thing we have to a mythic figure. In days of Greek drama, they had [[Apollo]] and [[Medea]] and [[Oedipus]] – these larger than life figures that walked the earth and spoke – and they turned them into plays. Shakespeare had kings and queens that he fashioned into his stories. Lincoln, to me, is one of those." Parks also believes that Lincoln "created an opening with that hole in his head." She makes the case that everything we do has to pass through everything else, like the eye of a needle. She says we have all passed through the hole in Lincoln's head on our journey to whatever lies ahead. Like many of her other plays, ''Topdog/Underdog'' takes her characters on a quest to find out who they are and to examine the stories and experiences that have shaped their lives. More than anything, she believes that we have an important relationship with the past.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/theater/theater-beyond-a-black-and-white-lincoln.html|title=Theater; Beyond a Black-and-White Lincoln|last=Shenk|first=Joshua Wolf|date=2002-04-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>

===365 Plays/365 Days===
Parks decided that she wanted to give herself the task of writing 365 plays in 365 days, hence her play ''365 Plays/365 Days''. This decision was made shortly after one of her books, ''[[Getting Mother's Body]]'', was published. She kept herself on schedule and succeeded. She wrote anywhere she had to: on the road, hotel rooms, and modes of transportation. The end result has been produced by more than 700 theaters around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/par1bio-1|title=Suzan-Lori Parks Biography -- Academy of Achievement|website=www.achievement.org|access-date=2016-04-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106050746/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/par1bio-1|archive-date=2014-01-06}}</ref>

The plays were presented by 725 performing arts groups, taking turns until the entire cycle was performed. The performances started in 2006, and included venues such as the Denver Center Theatre Company, colleges in England and Australia and the Steel City Theatre Company in [[Pueblo, Colorado]].<ref>Moore, John.
