== Biography ==
[[File:Astrid Lindgren 1924.jpg|thumb|right| Lindgren in 1924]]
Astrid Lindgren grew up in Näs, near [[Vimmerby]], [[Småland]], Sweden, and many of her books are based on her family and childhood memories.

Lindgren was the daughter of Samuel August Ericsson (1875–1969) and Hanna Jonsson (1879–1961). She had two sisters, {{interlanguage link|Stina Hergin|lt=Stina|sv}} and {{interlanguage link|Ingegerd Lindström|lt=Ingegerd|sv}}, and a brother, {{interlanguage link|Gunnar Ericsson (Centre Party)|lt=Gunnar Ericsson|sv|Gunnar Ericsson (centerpolitiker)}}, who eventually became a member of the [[Swedish parliament]].

Upon finishing school, Lindgren took a job with a local newspaper in Vimmerby. She had a relationship with the chief editor, who was married but eventually proposed marriage in 1926 after she became pregnant. She declined and moved to the capital city of Stockholm, learning to become a typist and [[stenographer]] (she would later write most of her drafts in stenography). In due time, she gave birth to her son, Lars, in [[Copenhagen]] and left him in the care of a foster family.

Although poorly paid, she saved whatever she could and traveled as often as possible to Copenhagen to be with Lars, often just over a weekend, spending most of her time on the train back and forth. Eventually, she managed to bring Lars home, leaving him in the care of her parents until she could afford to raise him in Stockholm.

Since 1928 Lindgren worked as secretary at the [[Royal Automobile Club (Sweden)|Royal Automobile Club]] (Kungliga Automobil Klubben) and by 1931 she married her boss, Sture Lindgren (1898–1952), who left his wife for her. Three years later, in 1934, Lindgren gave birth to her second child, Karin, who would become a translator. The character Pippi Longstocking was invented to amuse her daughter while she was ill in bed. Lindgren later related that Karin had suddenly said to her, "Tell me a story about Pippi Longstocking," and the tale was created in response to that request.

The family moved in 1941 to an apartment on [[:sv:Dalagatan|Dalagatan]], with a view over [[Vasaparken, Stockholm|Vasaparken]], where Lindgren remained until her death on 28 January 2002 at the age of 94, having become blind.<ref>Source – Steinar Mæland.{{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}</ref>  Astrid Lindgren died in her home in [[central Stockholm]]. Her funeral took place in the [[Storkyrkan]] in [[Gamla stan]]. Among those attending were King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] with [[Queen Silvia of Sweden|Queen Silvia]] and others of the royal family, and Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]]. The ceremony was described as "the closest you can get to a [[state funeral]]."<ref>Hagerfors, Anna-Maria (2002).</ref>

== Career ==
Lindgren worked as a journalist and secretary before becoming a full-time author.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Swedish secretary and journalist who sold 144 million books worldwide|url=https://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/281173/|website=Cineuropa – the best of european cinema|language=en|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> She served as a secretary for the [[1933 Swedish Summer Grand Prix]].
In the early 1940s, she worked as a secretary for criminalist [[Harry Söderman]]; this experience has been cited as an inspiration for her fictional detective [[Bill Bergson]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Harry Söderman |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Jørn-Kr. |last=Jørgensen |editor=Helle, Knut |editor-link=Knut Helle |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Harry_Söderman/utdypning |language=no |access-date=3 January 2013}}</ref>

In 1944 Lindgren won second prize in a competition held by [[Rabén & Sjögren]], with the novel ''Britt-Marie lättar sitt hjärta'' (''Britt-Marie Unburdens Her Heart'').<ref>{{Cite web|title=Astrid Lindgren|url=https://themisathena.wordpress.com/literature/astrid-lindgren/|date=6 June 2016|website=Lioness at Large|language=en|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> A year later she won first prize in the same competition with the [[chapter book]] ''Pippi Långstrump'' (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]''),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Astrid Lindgren|url=https://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/laureates/astrid-lindgren/|website=The Right Livelihood Award|language=en-US|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> which had been rejected by [[Bonniers]]. (Rabén & Sjögren published it with illustrations by [[Ingrid Vang Nyman]], the latter's debut in Sweden.) Since then it has become one of the most beloved children's books in the world<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/29/books/astrid-lindgren-author-of-children-s-books-dies-at-94.html|title=Astrid Lindgren, Author of Children's Books, Dies at 94|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=29 January 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 January 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and has been translated into 60 languages. While Lindgren almost immediately became a much appreciated writer, the irreverent attitude towards adult authority that is a distinguishing characteristic of many of her characters has occasionally drawn the ire of some conservatives.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Meri |first1=Tiina |title=PIPPI LONGSTOCKING – REBEL ROLE MODEL |url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/pippi-longstocking-rebel-role-model/ |website=sweden.se/ |date=4 June 2013 |publisher=Sweden |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref>

The [[women's magazine]] ''[[Damernas Värld]]'' sent Lindgren to the United States in 1948 to write short essays. Upon arrival she is said to have been upset by the [[discrimination against black Americans]]. A few years later she published the book ''[[Kati (book series)#Kati in America|Kati in America]]'', a collection of short essays inspired by the trip.

In 1956, the inaugural year of the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]], the German-language edition of ''Mio, min Mio'' (''[[Mio, My Son]]'') won the Children's book award.<ref name=djlp /><ref name="djlp–1956" /> (Sixteen books written by Astrid Lindgren made the Children's Book and Picture Book longlist, 1956–1975, but only ''Mio, My Son'' won a prize in its category.)<ref name=djlp-lindgren />

In 1958 Lindgren received the second [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] for ''[[Rasmus and the Vagabond|Rasmus på luffen]]'' (''Rasmus and the Vagabond''), a 1956 novel developed from her screenplay and filmed in 1955. The biennial [[International Board on Books for Young People]], now considered the highest lifetime recognition available to creators of children's books, soon came to be called the Little Nobel Prize. Prior to 1962 the Board cited a single book published during the preceding two years.<ref name=andersen /><ref name=ibby-lindgren />{{clarify|date=October 2015}}

On her 90th birthday, she was pronounced [[International Swede of the Year]] 1997 by Swedes in the World (SVIV{{snd}}{{interlanguage link|Svenskar i Världen|sv}}), an association for [[Swedes living abroad]].

In its entry on Scandinavian fantasy, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' named Lindgren the foremost Swedish contributor to modern children's fantasy.<ref>{{Citation |last=John-Henri |first=Holmberg |author-link=John-Henri Holmberg |contribution=Scandinavia |year=1997 |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |editor-last=Clute |editor-first=John |editor2-last=Grant |editor2-first=John  |page=841 |place=New York |publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] }}</ref> Its entry on Lindgren was: "Her niche in children's fantasy remains both secure and exalted. Her stories and images can never be forgotten."<ref>{{Citation |last=John-Henri |first=Holmberg |author-link=John-Henri Holmberg |contribution=Lindgren, Astrid (Anna Emilia) |year=1997 |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |editor-last=Clute |editor-first=John, and John Grant |page=582 |place=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |title-link=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy}}</ref>

== Translations ==
By 2012 Astrid Lindgren's books had been translated into 95 different languages and language variants. Further, the first chapter of ''Ronja the Robber's Daughter'' has been translated into [[Latin language|Latin]]. Up until 1997 a total of 3,000 editions of her books had been issued internationally,<ref>Anette Øster Steffensen (2003): "Two Versions of the Same Narrative{{nbsp}}– Astrid Lindgren's Mio, min Mio in Swedish and Danish".</ref> and globally her books had sold a total of 165 million copies. Many of her books have been translated into English by the translator Joan Tate.

In 1976 a scandal arose in Sweden when it was publicised that Lindgren's [[marginal tax rate]] had risen to 102 percent. This was to be known as the "[[Pomperipossa in Monismania|Pomperipossa effect]]", from a story she published in ''[[Expressen]]'' on 3 March 1976,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astrid-lindgren.com/astridlindgren/Ldates/1974-1976.htm |title=Astrid Lindgren timeline, 1974–76 |publisher=Astrid-lindgren.com |access-date=22 February 2014 |archive-date=19 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119141022/http://www.astrid-lindgren.com/astridlindgren/Ldates/1974-1976.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> entitled ''[[Pomperipossa in Monismania]]'', attacking the government and its taxation policies.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |title=Scandinavian Crime Fiction |last=Stougaard-Nielsen |first=Jakob |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-4725-2275-7 |location=London |pages=77}}</ref> It was a satirical allegory in response to the marginal tax rate Lindgren had incurred in 1976,<ref name=":1">{{cite book |title=The Swedish God |last=Biro |first=Jan |publisher=Homulus Foundation |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9842103-0-5 |location=Los Angeles |pages=55}}</ref> which required self-employed individuals to pay both regular [[income tax]] and employers' deductions.<ref name=":1" /> In a stormy tax debate, she attracted criticism from Social Democrats and even from her own colleagues, and responded by raising the issue of the lack of women involved in the Social Democrats' campaign.<ref>{{cite book |title=Astrid Lindgren: The Woman Behind Pippi Longstocking |last=Andersen |first=Jens |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-300-22610-2 |location=New Haven }}</ref> In [[1976 Swedish general election|that year's general election]], the [[Social Democrats (Sweden)|Social Democratic]] government was voted out for the first time in 44 years, and the Lindgren tax debate was one of several controversies that may have contributed to the result. Another controversy involved [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s farewell letter to Sweden, after charges had been made against him of tax evasion.<ref name=":0" /> Lindgren nevertheless remained a Social Democrat for the rest of her life.<ref>{{cite web |author=Clas Barkman |url=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/brev-fran-astrid-lindgren-visar-hennes-stod-for-s |title=Brev från Astrid Lindgren visar hennes stöd för S |work=Dagens Nyheter |date=16 May 2010 |access-date=22 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018092713/http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/brev-fran-astrid-lindgren-visar-hennes-stod-for-s |archive-date=18 October 2012 }}</ref>

In 1978, when she received the ''[[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]]'', Lindgren made a speech, ''[[Never Violence!]]''. She spoke against corporal punishment of children. After that she teamed up with scientists, journalists and politicians to achieve non-violent upbringing. In 1979, a law was introduced in Sweden prohibiting violence against children.<ref name=SUED>{{cite web |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/gewaltfreie-erziehung-astrid-lindgrens-grosse-provokation-1.4179081 |title=Außenansicht: Gewaltlosigkeit fängt bei den Kindern an|author=Christian Pfeiffer}}</ref> Until then there was no such law anywhere in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinder.wdr.de/radio/kiraka/nachrichten/klicker/gewalfreie-erziehung-100.html|title=Nachrichten für Kinder: Astrid Lindgrens Vision – niemals Gewalt!|date=22 October 2018|website=kinder.wdr.de}}</ref>

From 1985 to 1989 Lindgren wrote articles concerning animal protection and mass production in the Swedish magazines ''[[Expressen]]'' and ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' along with the veterinarian Kristina Forslund. They wanted to launch an awareness campaign to promote better animal treatment in factory farming. Eventually their activities led to a new law which was called ''[[Lex Lindgren]]'' and was presented to Astrid Lindgren during her 80th birthday. During that time it was the strictest law concerning animal welfare in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.planet-wissen.de/kultur/literatur/astrid_lindgren/pwiewissensfrage336.html|title=Lex Lindgren|date=30 July 2021}}</ref> However, Lindgren and Forslund weren't satisfied with it. Not enough had been done and only minor changes occurred. The articles Forslund and Lindgren wrote were later published in the book ''[[Min ko vill ha roligt]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.braunschweiger-zeitung.de/kultur/article214763869/Was-das-Schwein-Augusta-gegen-die-Herren-der-Gewinnerzielung-sagt.html|title=Was das Schwein Augusta gegen die Herren der Gewinnerzielung sagt|date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

Lindgren was well known both for her support for [[children's rights|children's]] and [[animal rights]] and for her opposition to [[corporal punishment]] and the EU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/astrid-lindgren-spoke-people-listened/|title=Astrid Lindgren spoke, people listened|date=4 June 2013|website=sweden.se}}</ref> In 1994 she received the [[Right Livelihood Award]], "For her commitment to justice, non-violence and understanding of minorities as well as her love and caring for nature."

== Honors and memorials ==
[[File:Astrid Lindgren 2011.jpg|thumb| Lindgren represented in the Villa Villekulla exhibit at Kneippbyn in [[Visby]]]]

In 1967 the publisher [[Rabén & Sjögren]] established an annual [[literary prize]], the [[Astrid Lindgren Prize]], to mark her 60th birthday.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Congratulations Katarina von Bredow!|url=https://astridlindgrenmemorialaward.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/congratulations-katarina-von-bredow/|date=14 November 2013|website=Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award|language=en|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> The prize—40,000 [[Swedish kronor]]—is awarded to a Swedish-language children's writer every year on Lindgren's birthday in November.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ALMA – ALMA|url=http://www.alma.se/en/|last=Lindgren|first=Astrid|date=14 April 2009|website=www.alma.se|language=en|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>

Following Lindgren's death, the [[government of Sweden]] instituted the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] in her memory. The award is the world's largest monetary award for children's and youth literature, in the amount of five million Swedish kronor.

The collection of Astrid Lindgren's original manuscripts in [[Kungliga Biblioteket]] in Stockholm (the Royal Library) was placed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Registered Heritage: Astrid Lindgren Archives |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page–1/astrid-lindgren-archives/ |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref>

On 6 April 2011 Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] announced that Lindgren's portrait will feature on the 20&nbsp;[[Swedish krona|kronor]] banknote, beginning in 2014–15.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=46685 |title=Sveriges Riksbank |publisher=The Riksbank |date=30 September 2011 |access-date=22 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172146/http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=46685 |archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> In the run-up to the announcement of the persons who would feature on the new banknotes, Lindgren's name had been the one most often put forward in the public debate.

=== Asteroid Lindgren ===
Asteroid [[3204 Lindgren]], discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer [[Nikolai Chernykh]], was named after her.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?q=3204+Lindgren+1978+RH |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names – p.256 |access-date=22 February 2014}}</ref> The name of the Swedish [[miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] [[Astrid (satellites)|Astrid 1]], launched on 24&nbsp;January 1995, was originally selected only as a common [[Swedish name days|Swedish female name]], but within a short time it was decided to name the instruments after characters in Astrid Lindgren's books: PIPPI (Prelude in Planetary Particle Imaging), EMIL (Electron Measurements&nbsp;– In-situ and Lightweight), and MIO (Miniature Imaging Optics).

=== Astrid's Wellspring ===
[[File:Sagornas död.jpg|thumb|''Källa Astrid'' (Astrid's Wellspring) by Berit Lindfeldt]]
In memory of Astrid Lindgren, a memorial sculpture was created next to her childhood home, named ''Källa Astrid'' ("Astrid's Wellspring" in English). It is situated at the spot where Astrid Lindgren first heard [[fairy tales]]. The sculpture consists of an artistic representation of a young person's head (1.37&nbsp;m high),<ref>[http://www.kindaposten.se/article/articleview/23590/1/13/ "Källa Astrid" på Astrids källa "Astrid's Wellspring [source of inspiration&#93; in Astrid's Wellspring"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828140019/http://www.kindaposten.se/article/articleview/23590/1/13/ |date=28 August 2010 }}.

The sculpture was initially slightly different in design and intended to be part of a fountain set in the city center, but the people of Vimmerby vehemently opposed the idea. Furthermore, Astrid Lindgren had stated that she never wanted to be represented as a statue. (However, there is a statue of Lindgren in the city center.) The memorial was sponsored by the culture council of Vimmerby.

The author is buried in Vimmerby where the [[Astrid Lindgren's World]] theme park is also located. The children's museum [[Junibacken]], in Stockholm, was opened in June 1996 with the main theme of the permanent exhibition being devoted to Astrid Lindgren; at the heart of the museum is a theme train ride through the world of Astrid Lindgren's novels.

{{Main|Astrid Lindgren's plays}}
In addition to her novels, short stories and picture books, Astrid Lindgren wrote some plays. Many of the plays were created in the 1940s and 1950s in collaboration with her friend Elsa Olenius, a pioneer in the Swedish children's theater. Many of the stories were written exclusively for the theater. They have been translated into several languages, including Danish, Finnish and Romanian. Most of Astrid Lindgren's plays have not been translated into English.
