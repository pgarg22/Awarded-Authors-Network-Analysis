The Reverend '''Charles Watts Whistler''' MRCS, LSA, (14 November 1856 – 10 June 1913) was an English writer of historical fiction, who set his work between 600 and 1100 CE, usually based on early [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[chronicle]]s, [[Norse saga|Norse]] or [[Denmark|Danish]] sagas and archaeological discoveries.

==Life==
Charles Watts Whistler was the oldest son of the Rev. Rose Fuller Whistler, Vicar of [[Ashburnham, East Sussex|Ashburnham]] in Sussex, a Vice President of the [[Sussex Archaeological Society]], and later Rector of [[Elton, Cambridgeshire|Elton, Huntingdonshire]], to which cure Charles Watts Whistler would succeed. The family descended from the Sussex branch of the Thames Valley family of Whistler, as did [[Rex Whistler]] and his brother the glass engraver Sir [[Laurence Whistler]].

Whistler was educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors School, London]] and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, before studying medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and becoming a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. After practising as a surgeon (like his maternal grandfather James Watts, MRCS, of Battle, Sussex), he was ordained deacon in 1884 and priest in 1885. He then served successively as curate of [[Woolton]], Liverpool (1884–1885), Chaplain of the Fishermen's Chapel, [[Hastings]] (1885–1888), Vicar of [[All Saints' Church, Theddlethorpe]], Lincolnshire (1888–1894), Rector of [[Elton, Cambridgeshire|Elton]], Huntingdonshire (1894–1895), Vicar of [[Stockland Bristol]], [[Somerset]] (1895–1909), and finally Rector of [[Cheselbourne]], [[Dorset]] (1909–1913).

Whistler was married on 3 March 1886 to Georgiana Rosalie Shapter Strange, daughter of William James Stevenson Strange, a master wool-dyer by then retired. His brother Alfred James Whistler married Georgiana's sister Mary Maud Strange. The two women's brother, W. R. P. Strange, had been Vicar of Stockland before Whistler.

Whistler's interest in the history of England before the Norman Conquest appears in his prolific work as a historical novelist. His works were popular in their day, but the archaism of language he adopted makes them less accessible to modern readers.

==Summaries==
*''Havelok'' plays around 580–600 CE in [[Denmark]] and [[England]], one or two generations after mythical [[King Arthur]] (and his people's struggle with the Saxons) and shows early relations between the Danes and Saxons (now well-established in England with their own kingdoms) and the already Christianized [[Welsh people|Welsh]] in England. It also introduces dislike between the Danes/[[Jutes]] (cousins of the Saxons) and the Norse. It is based one of the most popular pre-[[Elizabethan Age|Elizabethan]] sagas of the British Isles, which shares traits with the classic Nordic sagas.
*''Prince of Cornwall'' takes place about a hundred years or four generations later – c. 690–710 CE – and deals much with the relations between Welsh and Saxons, and some resident Danes in the country.
*''King's Comrade'' is again three generations later, c. 790 CE. It is mainly focused on inter-Saxon conflict ([[Æthelberht II of East Anglia|King Ethelbert]], [[King Offa]]), and problems with the Welsh, who still would like to get their lost estates back. Introduces Norse campaigns on the Frankish coast, founding the Norse state of Normandy.
*''Wulfric the Weapon Thane'' shows how the Danes invade the English realm and found kingdoms, turning from fun-loving plunderers to competitive conquerors.
*''[[Thegn|Thane]] of [[Wessex]]'' takes place shortly before King Alfred's rule. The hero is robbed of land and title through bitter intrigues, and banned from the realm. But as he tries to leave the kingdom, he is followed by pursuers who are after his life. Soon Whistler has one or two tasty conflicts of interest, and we have a man in a mess – how to do the right thing if you have no rights or honour in the eyes of your former peers?
*''[[King Alfred]]'s [[Viking]]'' tells more of the battles between the English (united at last) and the Danes. It tells of the first [[navy]] of England, built by Alfred with help from Norse friends.
*c. 935 CE: ''A Sea Queen's Sailing'' (1906)
*c. 1000 CE: ''King Olaf's Kinsman'' (1896) – A Story of the Last Saxon Struggle against the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] in the Days of [[Edmund Ironside|Ironside]] and [[Cnut]]
