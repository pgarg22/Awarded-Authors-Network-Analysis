'''Arthur Seymour John Tessimond''' ([[Birkenhead]], 19 July 1902 â€“ [[Chelsea, London]] 13 May 1962) was an English [[poet]].

He went to [[Birkenhead School]] until the age of 14,<ref name=Bainbridge>{{cite web|last=Bainbridge|first=James|title=A.S.J. Tessimond (1902-1962)|url=http://jrwb.wordpress.com/tessimond/|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=May 2012}}</ref> before being sent to [[Charterhouse School]], but ran away at age 16.<ref>''Collected Poems'', p. xiv.</ref> From 1922 to 1926 he attended the [[University of Liverpool]], where he read [[English literature]], French, [[Philosophy]] and Greek.<ref name=Bainbridge /> He later moved to [[London]] where he worked in bookshops, and also as a copywriter.<ref>''Collected Poems'', p. xvi.</ref>

After avoiding military service in [[World War II]], he later discovered he was unfit for service. He suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], and received [[electro-convulsive therapy]].

He first began to publish in the 1920s in literary magazines. He was to see three volumes of poetry published during his life: ''Walls of Glass'' in 1934, ''Voices in a Giant City'' in 1947 and ''Selections'' in 1958. He contributed several poems to a 1952 edition of ''Bewick's Birds''.

He died in 1962 from a [[brain haemorrhage]].

In the mid-1970s he was the subject of a radio programme entitled ''Portrait of a Romantic''. This, together with the publication of the posthumous selection  ''Not Love Perhaps'' in 1972, increased interest in his work; and his poetry subsequently appeared in school books and anthologies.

A 1985 anthology of his work ''The Collected Poems of A. S. J. Tessimond'', edited by [[Hubert Nicholson]], contains previously unpublished works.

In 2010 a new collected poems, based closely on Nicholson's edition, was published by [[Bloodaxe Books]].

In April 2010 an edition of [[Brian Patten]]'s series ''Lost Voices'' on [[BBC Radio Four]] was committed solely to Tessimond.
