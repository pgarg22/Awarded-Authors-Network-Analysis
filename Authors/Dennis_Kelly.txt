'''Dennis Kelly''' (born 16 November 1970) is a British scriptwriter for theatre, television and film.

His play ''DNA'', first performed in 2007, became a core set-text for [[GCSE]] in 2010<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160817033617/http://www.casarotto.co.uk:80/client/dennis-kelly-11505 Archived webpage from 2016 of Dennis Kelly's page on his agent's website]</ref> and has been studied by approximately 400,000 students each year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Dennis |date= |title=Dennis Kelly: Plays Two: Our Teacher's a Troll; Orphans; Taking Care of Baby; DNA; The Gods Weep |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Dennis_Kelly_Plays_Two/fTM2DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT7&printsec=frontcover |location=London |publisher=Oberon Books Ltd |pages= |isbn= |contributor-first=Aleks |contributor-last=Sierz |contribution=Introduction}}</ref> He wrote the script for ''[[Matilda the Musical]]'', which had music and lyrics from comedian [[Tim Minchin]].

While working in supermarkets, he discovered theatre when he joined a local youth group, the Barnet Drama Centre.<ref name=Monsters/>

Kelly says that he struggled with alcoholism during much of his 20s.<ref name=Drinking/> He attended [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and has been sober since 2001.<ref name=Writerly>[https://writerlyblogblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/dennis-kelly-20-hot-100-alive/ DENNIS KELLY: 20% HOT, 100% ALIVE on the Writerly blog]</ref>

At the age of 30, he graduated from [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College, University of London]] with First Class Honours in Drama and Theatre Arts.

In September 2011 Kelly married Neapolitan actress Monica Nappo. They had met five years earlier when Nappo was appearing in an Italian premiere of one of Kelly's plays.<ref name=Shakespeare/>

At one point Kelly shared his home in [[Deptford]] with Vladimir Shcherban from the [[Belarus Free Theatre]] company. Kelly offered his home to Shcherban as a place to stay when Shcherban was facing homelessness. Shcherban's situation came as a result of him having to flee (with other members of the theatre company) from [[Belarus]] to London as a means to escape political censorship and persecution in the aftermath of the [[2010 Belarusian presidential election]], where oppositional candidates had been arrested.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shcherban |first1=Vladimir |title=Too much British theatre is defined by finance and funding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/sep/20/british-theatre-finance-funding-grants |access-date=11 March 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=20 September 2014}}</ref>

==Career==

Kelly has credited [[Sharon Horgan]] for making him become a writer. They had both initially met in the early 1990s at [[Stockwell Playhouse|LOST youth theatre]] where they performed in a production of [[Anton Chekov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]''. They again met each other some years later while both drunk in a Camden pub. In the pub Kelly explained to Horgan that he had written a play.<ref>{{Cite episode| title= Sharon Horgan talks to Dennis Kelly| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b05mtcjp | access-date= 24 March 2021 | series= Chain Reaction | first= Sharon | last= Horgan | network= BBC | station= BBC Radio 4 | date= March 2015 | series-no=10}}</ref> The next day Horgan phoned Kelly up and told him that they should both put the play on. Kelly has said that "I honestly think, had I not bumped into her, I wouldn’t have become a writer, because I don’t think I’d have had the drive. Sharon always had a lot of drive and was quite fearless."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saner |first1=Emine |title=Sharon Horgan's unstoppable rise as master of honest comedy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/sharon-horgan-motherland-unstoppable-rise-as-the-master-of-honest-comedy |access-date=18 March 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The play that Kelly wrote was called ''Brendan's Visit'', which was performed at the [[Etcetera Theatre]] and [[Canal Cafe Theatre]], with Horgan playing one of the characters.<ref>[https://www.unitedagents.co.uk/cv/9059/acting Sharon Horgan's Acting CV]</ref> Kelly has disowned the play saying that "I’ve killed everyone who ever saw it, let’s never talk about that ever again. […] I don’t think I can remember what it was about but I’m definitely not going to say what it was about! It was just a sitcom with swearing which is like a lot people’s first plays."<ref name=Writerly/>

Kelly's first professionally produced play ''[[Debris (play)|Debris]]'' was written when he was 30 years old.<ref name=Identity>{{cite news |last1=Kelly |first1=Dennis |title=Identity crisis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/28/theatre.television |access-date=11 March 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=28 February 2008}}</ref> He says he wrote it imagining he'd give himself a part. Staged at [[Theatre503]] in 2003, it transferred the next year to [[Battersea Arts Centre]]. It was well received and he went on to write the controversially titled ''[[Osama the Hero]]'' which was produced by [[Hampstead Theatre]], beginning a long-running relationship with the theatre.

He wrote ''[[After the End]]'' in 2005. It was produced by [[Paines Plough]] in his first out of London production at the [[Traverse Theatre|Traverse]], though it later came to the [[Bush Theatre]] before going on a tour of the UK and internationally in 2006.

''[[Love and Money (play)|Love and Money]]'' was staged at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester]] and then at the [[Young Vic]] in 2006. That same year his sitcom ''[[Pulling (TV series)|Pulling]]'',<ref>{{citation
  |title = Pulling
  | work=BBC
  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/pulling/index.shtml  
  }}</ref> co-written and starring [[Sharon Horgan]], aired on [[BBC Three]]. It received good ratings for the channel and was well reviewed, being nominated for a [[BAFTA TV Award]] for Best Situation Comedy in 2007.

Returning to theatre and the Hampstead Theatre in 2007, his fake [[verbatim theatre|verbatim play]] ''[[Taking Care of Baby]]'' was another success for both writer and theatre.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

For the 2007 [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] Connections Festival, he wrote ''DeoxyriboNucleic Acid'' (better known by the title ''DNA'') which after the connections received a professional production alongside ''The Miracle'' by [[Lin Coghlan]] and ''Baby Girl'' by [[Roy Williams (playwright)|Roy Williams]] at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in the Cottesloe.<ref>{{citation

The play is now used widely in schools and is on several curriculums for [[GCSE]] drama.

The second series of ''[[Pulling (TV series)|Pulling]]'' ran in 2008 and won a [[British Comedy Award]]. However, the show was not renewed for a third series, although in 2009 an hour-long special closed the series. That same year he also wrote an episode for Series 8 of ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]''.

In 2009, his play ''[[Orphans (Dennis Kelly play)|Orphans]]'' was staged at the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] before transferring to the [[Traverse Theatre]] in Edinburgh as part of the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

Kelly was one of the ten writers who took part in writing monologues based on a children's account for a one-off event at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] directed by [[Danny Boyle]] in London in support of [[Dramatic Need]] in 2010. His three monologues were performed by [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Jenny Jules]] and [[Charlie Cox]].<ref>{{citation

In 2010, Kelly returned to the Hampstead Theatre once more for his response to Shakespeare's [[King Lear]], ''The Gods Weep'' starring [[Jeremy Irons]], with mixed reviews. His next theatrical venture fared much better; his musical version of [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Matilda the Musical|Matilda]]'' co-written with comedian [[Tim Minchin]] was a hit at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] in 2011. It transferred to the West End and has won several awards including Best Musical at the [[Evening Standard Awards]], [[The Critics' Circle]] and Theatre Awards.

His work has been produced in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], [[Iceland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Romania]] and [[Canada]]. Other work includes translations of Péter Kárpáti's ''Fourth Gate'' ([[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] Studio) and ''The Colony'', a radio play which won Best European Radio Drama at the Prix Europa, 2004.

He wrote an adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio (2017 play)|Pinocchio]]'' featuring the songs and score from the [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Walt Disney film]] for the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], opening in December 2017.

Kelly's play ''Girls & Boys'' had its world premiere at The [[Royal Court Theatre]] in February 2018, starring [[Carey Mulligan]].
