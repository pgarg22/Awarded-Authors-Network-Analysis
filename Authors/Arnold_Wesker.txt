'''Sir Arnold Wesker''' {{postnom|country=GBR|FRSL}} (24 May 1932 – 12 April 2016) was an English dramatist. He was the author of 50 plays, four volumes of short stories, two volumes of essays, much journalism and a book on the subject, a children's book, some poetry, and other assorted writings. His plays have been translated into 20 languages, and performed worldwide.

==Early life==
Wesker was born in [[Stepney]], [[London]], in 1932,<ref name=Birth>{{cite news|title=Birthday's today|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2013-5-24.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130524113741/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2013-5-24.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 May 2013 |newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=24 May 2014|date=24 May 2013|quote=Sir Arnold Wesker, playwright, 81 }}</ref> the son of Leah (née Cecile Leah Perlmutter), a cook, and Joseph Wesker, a tailor's machinist and active communist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/17/Arnold-Wesker.html |title=Arnold Wesker Biography (1932-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref>

Arnold Wesker was delivered by Samuel Sacks, father of neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3ADCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 | title=Star Turns and Cameo Appearances: Memoirs of a Life Among Musicians | publisher=Boydell & Brewer | author=Bernard Jacobson | year=2015 | pages=167 | isbn=978-1-58046-541-0}}</ref>

He attended a Jewish Infants School in [[Whitechapel]]. His education was then fragmented during [[World War II]]. He was briefly [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during the Second World War|evacuated]] to [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Cambridgeshire]], before returning to London where he attended Dean Street School during [[the Blitz]]. He then returned to live with his parents who had moved to a council flat in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London, where he attended Northwold Road School. He then attended Upton House Central School, Hackney, from 1943. This was a school where emphasis was placed on teaching office skills, including typing, to bright boys who however had not been selected for [[grammar school]] places. He was then evacuated again to [[Llantrisant]], [[South Wales]].<ref name="independent">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-arnold-wesker-playwright-875474.html An education in the life of Arnold Wesker at ''The Independent''] Retrieved 13 April 2016</ref>

He was accepted into the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] but could not afford to take up his place there. Later, he served for two years in the [[Royal Air Force]], and then went on to work as cook, furniture maker, and bookseller.<ref name="Casebook" />

After saving up enough money, he went to study at the London School of Film Technique, now known as the [[London Film School]]<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/13/sir-arnold-wesker-obituary |title=''Sir Arnold West Obituary |access-date=2020-06-04 |work=Guardian|date=12 April 2016 }}</ref>

==Career==
His inspiration for 1957 play ''[[The Kitchen (play)|The Kitchen]]'', which was [[The Kitchen (1961 film)|later made into a film]], came when he was working at the [[Bell Hotel, Norwich|Bell Hotel]] in Norwich.<ref name="Vidya-mitra2015">{{cite web |title=Twentieth Century English Literature - Arnold Weskers: Roots |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_153VXu4p8 |publisher=Vidya-mitra |access-date=8 February 2019 |date=13 December 2015}}</ref> It was while working here that he met his future wife Dusty.

Wesker's plays have dealt with themes including self-discovery, love, confronting death and political disillusion. ''[[Chicken Soup with Barley]]'' (1958) went out to the provinces. Rather than opening in the [[West End theatre|West End]], its premiere was seen at the provincial [[Coventry Theatre]], a locale which typified Wesker's political views as an '[[Angry young men|angry young man]]'.

Wesker's play ''[[Roots (play)|Roots]]'' (1959) was a [[kitchen sink drama]] about a girl, Beatie Bryant, who returns after three years of stay in London to her farming family home at Norfolk and struggles to voice herself.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/09/roots-arnold-wesker-review | title=Roots – Review | work=The Guardian | date=9 October 2013 | access-date=13 April 2016 | author=Lyn Gardner}}</ref> Critics commended the "emotional authenticity" brought out in the play.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u92FAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA101 | title=1956 and All That: The Making of Modern British Drama | publisher=Routledge | author=Dan Rebellato | year=2002 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-134-65783-4}}</ref> ''Roots'', ''The Kitchen'', and ''Their Very Own and Golden City'' were staged by the English Stage Company at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] under the management of [[George Devine]] and later [[William Gaskill]].

===Nuclear disarmament===
Wesker joined with enthusiasm the Royal Court group on the [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] in 1959. Another of the Royal Court contingent, [[Lindsay Anderson]], made a short documentary film (''March to Aldermaston'') about the event. He was an active member of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] and, with other prominent members, was jailed in 1961 for his part in its campaign of mass nonviolent resistance to nuclear weapons.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36031849 | title=Sir Arnold Wesker, British playwright, dies aged 83 | work=[[BBC]] | date=13 April 2016 | access-date=13 April 2016}}</ref>

===Centre 42===
After his stay in prison in 1961, Wesker made a full-time commitment to become the leader of an initiative which arose from Resolution 42 of the 1960 [[Trades Union Congress]], concerning the importance of arts in the community. Centre 42 was initially a touring festival aimed at devolving art and culture from London to the other main working class towns of Britain, moving to the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in 1964. The project to establish a permanent arts centre struggled through subsequent years, because its funding was limited; Wesker fictionalised it in his play ''Their Very Own and Golden City'' (1966). He formally dissolved the project in 1970, although The Roundhouse did eventually open as a permanent arts centre in 2006.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Clive Barker|chapter=Vision and Reality - 'Their Very Own and Golden City' and Centre 42|editor1-last=Dornan|editor1-first=Reade W.|title=Arnold Wesker: A Casebook|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135541453|pages=89–96|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXV9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|access-date=4 February 2018}}</ref>

===Writers & Readers Publishing Cooperative===
Wesker co-founded, in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paraprincipiantes.com/html/quienes.shtml |title=Libros para Principiantes: Quienes somos |publisher=Paraprincipiantes.com |access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref>,  the [[For Beginners|Writers & Readers Publishing Cooperative Ltd]], with a group of writers that included [[John Berger]], [[Lisa Appignanesi]], [[Richard Appignanesi]], [[Chris Searle]] and [[Glenn Thompson (publisher)|Glenn Thompson.]]

==Later works==
''The Journalists'' (1972) was commissioned by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and researched at ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' at a time it when was edited by [[Harold Evans]]. The RSC's literary manager Ronald Bryden thought it would be "the play of the decade" and it was scheduled to be directed by [[David Jones (director)|David Jones]].<ref name="DTSweet">{{cite news|last=Sweet|first=Matthew|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/9270517/Arnold-Wesker-Did-Trotskyists-kill-off-the-best-Seventies-play.html|title=Arnold Wesker: Did Trotskyists kill off the best Seventies play?|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=<!-- Wednesday -->16 May 2012|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref> The actors in that year's RSC company refused to perform it, Wesker claimed, because they were under the influence of the [[Workers Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers Revolutionary Party]].<ref name="Wesker2004">{{cite news|last=Wesker|first=Arnold|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/160159|title=Diary - Arnold Wesker|work=New Statesman|date=19 July 2004|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref> (The WRP was not founded until 1973, but its forerunner, the Socialist Labour League had many sympathisers in the RSC.)<ref name="DTSweet" /> Wesker wrote in 2004 that he had also "committed the politically incorrect crime of creating Tory ministers who were intelligent rather than caricatures".<ref name="Wesker2004" />

Wesker's play ''[[The Merchant (play)|The Merchant]]'' (1976), which he later renamed ''[[Shylock]]'', uses the same three stories used by Shakespeare for his play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are fast friends bound by a common love of books, culture and a disdain for the crass antisemitism of the Christian community's laws. They make the bond in defiant mockery of the Christian establishment, never anticipating that the bond might become forfeit. When it does, the play argues, Shylock must carry through on the letter of the law or jeopardize the scant legal security of the entire Jewish community. He is, therefore, quite as grateful as Antonio when Portia, as in Shakespeare's play, shows the legal way out.

The play received its American premiere on 16 November 1977 at New York's Plymouth Theatre with [[Joseph Leon]] as Shylock, [[Marian Seldes]] as Shylock's sister Rivka and [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Portia. This production had a challenging history in previews on the road, culminating (after the first night out of town in Philadelphia on 8 September 1977) with the death of the exuberant Broadway star [[Zero Mostel]], who was initially cast as Shylock.

Wesker wrote a book, ''The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel'', chronicling the entire process from initial submissions and rejections of the play through to rehearsals, Zero's death, and the disappointment of the critical reception for the Broadway opening. The book reveals much about the playwright's relationship to director [[John Dexter]] (who had been the earliest, near-familial interpreter of Wesker's works), to criticism, to casting, and to the ephemeral process of collaboration through which the text of any play must pass.<ref>[http://www.dramaparis.com/images/Arnold+WESKER+-+oeuvres.pdf Selected works]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 2005, he published his first novel, ''Honey'', which recounted the experiences of Beatie Bryant, the heroine of his earlier play ''Roots''. The novel broke from the previously established chronology. ''Roots'' was set in the early 1960s and Beatie is 22; but in ''Honey'' she has only aged three years yet the action has been transplanted into the 1980s. Other oddities are that the timeframe includes the [[Rushdie affair]] and [[John Major]]'s fall as recent events and yet the action is concerned with the [[dotcom boom]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview20 | title=Review: Honey – Back to his Roots | work=The Guardian | date=8 October 2005 | access-date=13 April 2016 | author=Alfred Hickling}}</ref>

In 2008, Wesker published his first collection of poetry, ''All Things Tire of Themselves'' (Flambard Press). The collection dates back many years and represents what he considered his best and most characteristic poems. He was a member of the editorial advisory board of ''[[Jewish Renaissance]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishrenaissance.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are.html/|title=Who We Are|publisher=[[Jewish Renaissance]]|access-date=21 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010150551/http://www.jewishrenaissance.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are.html|archive-date=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

He was a patron of the [[Shakespeare Schools Festival]], a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shakespeareschools.org/about-us/patrons |title=Shakespeare Schools Foundation Patrons |website=Shakespeare Schools Foundation |publisher=[[Shakespeare Schools Foundation]] |access-date=July 12, 2021}}</ref>

He was the castaway on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], on in 1966 and again in 2006.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tvj3Ygaj7ZAC&pg=PT24 | title=Desert Island Discs: Flotsam & Jetsam: Fascinating facts, figures and miscellany from one of BBC Radio 4's best-loved programmes | publisher=[[Random House]] |last=Symons|first=Mitchell| year=2012 | pages=24 | isbn=978-1-4481-2744-3}}</ref>

==Archive==
Wesker's papers, covering his entire career, were acquired by the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 2000. The collection contains not only the prolific output of the playwright, novelist and poet but also is framed within the larger historical context of international events. Wesker was actively involved in the organizing of his archive, and before shipping it to the Ransom Center, Wesker compiled a list of the contents, which is also available to scholars for consultation. The collection's contents include over three hundred boxes of manuscript drafts, correspondence, production ephemera, personal records, and other materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00243p1|title=Arnold Wesker: A Preliminary Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref> Wesker's family shipped the last of his papers to the Ransom Center in March, 2016 shortly before his death.

On 13 April 2016, the Leader of the Opposition, [[Jeremy Corbyn]], gave thanks for the playwright's life. They shared a socialist background in London, where Corbyn is an MP.
<blockquote>I am sure the whole House will join me in mourning the death of the dramatist Arnold Wesker, one of the great playwrights of this country, one of those wonderful angry young men of the 1950s who, like so many angry young people, changed the face of our country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hansard.digiminster.com/Commons/2016-04-13/debates/16041336000023/Engagements#contribution-16041336000127|title=Engagements - Hansard Online|access-date=24 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512234601/https://hansard.digiminster.com/Commons/2016-04-13/debates/16041336000023/Engagements#contribution-16041336000127|archive-date=12 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>
