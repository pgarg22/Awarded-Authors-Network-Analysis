'''Inge Krokann''' (19 August 1893   &ndash; 27 September 1962) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer. His most famous work is '' I Dovre Sno '' (1929), an epic story of the Loe family during the [[Middle Ages]]. Because his writing was full of local expressions and is so strongly tied to the use of the Oppdal dialect and idiosyncratic [[Nynorsk]],   his works are largely inaccessible and difficult to translate.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.allkunne.no/framside/biografiar/k/inge-krokann/94/706/|title=Inge Krokann|publisher = allkunne|access-date= April 1, 2018}}</ref>

Ingebrikt Krokann was born at [[Oppdal]]  in [[Trøndelag]], Norway. He was the son of Trond Jonsson Krokann (1858-1936) and Dørdi Olsdatter Lo (1859-1933). In 1915 he took his final  exam at Volda lærarskule.  He worked as a [[teacher]]  first at the children's school in [[Rennebu]]. During the winter of 1917-18,  he got a leave to go to [[Askov]] Folk High School in [[Denmark]], and then he took a college course in [[Volda]]. From 1920 to 1923 he taught at Skogn Folkhøgskule. He developed [[tuberculosis]] and never fully recovered. He taught at the Nordic folk college in [[Fredriksberg]] in Denmark during 1937-1938.
