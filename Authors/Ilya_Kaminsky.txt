==Critical reception==

Writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Kevin Young calls ''Deaf Republic'' "a contemporary epic. Evident throughout is a profound imagination, matched only by the poet's ability to create a republic of conscience that is ultimately ours, too"<ref name="NYDeaf">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/deaf-republic|title = "Deaf Republic"|magazine = [[The New Yorker]]|date = 11 February 2019}}</ref>
	 
In ''The New York Times'', Parul Sehgal says: "I was stunned by Ilya Kaminsky's ''Deaf Republic'', lyric poems presented as a play in two acts, set in a country in crisis, inspired both by Odessa, where Kaminsky grew up, and America, where he now lives. It's a book about censorship, political apathy, torture — "the nakedness / of the whole nation" — but also about tomato sandwiches, the birth of a daughter and the sudden, almost shocking joys of longtime married life."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/books/critics-roundtable-year-in-books.html|title=Times Critics Discuss Their Year in Books, from New Talents to Old Favorites|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 December 2019|last1=Garner|first1=Dwight|last2=Sehgal|first2=Parul|last3=Szalai|first3=Jennifer}}</ref>
	 
In ''The Guardian'', Fiona Benson says: "I fell hard for Ilya Kaminsky's ''Deaf Republic''. Part folklore, fable, war story and love poem, it imagines an occupied town falling deaf in response to the shooting of a child. Often devastating, always humane, this is a book of the century, let alone this year."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/30/best-books-of-the-year-2019-bernardine-evaristo-lee-child-hilary-mantel|title=Bernardine Evaristo, Lee Child and more pick the best books of 2019|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=30 November 2019}}</ref>
	 
''[[Washington Examiner]]'' calls ''Deaf Republic'' "a contemporary masterpiece. This book is proof that in 2019 great poetry can enjoy tremendous popularity."<ref>https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/deaf-republic-open-ears</ref>
	 	 
About Kaminsky's first book, ''Dancing in Odessa'', Robert Pinsky writes: "Passionate, daring to laugh and weep, direct yet unexpected, Ilya Kaminsky's poetry has a glorious tilt and scope."<ref name="TupeloDancing" />
