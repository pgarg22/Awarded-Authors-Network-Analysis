'''Mustapha Matura''' (17 December 1939 – 29 October 2019)<ref>[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100140869 "Mustapha Matura"], ''The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre''. Oxford Reference.</ref><ref> Giverny Masso,  [https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/playwright-mustapha-matura-dies-aged-79/ "Playwright Mustapha Matura dies aged 79"], ''[[The Stage]]'', 30 October 2019.</ref> was a [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[playwright]] living in [[London]]. Characterised by critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] as "a pioneering black playwright who opened the doors for his successors", Matura was the first British-based dramatist of colour to have a play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], with ''[[Play Mas]]'' in 1974.<ref name="Guardian obit">Michael Billington, [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/01/mustapha-matura-obituary "Mustapha Matura obituary"], ''The Guardian'', 1 November 2019.</ref> He was described by the ''[[New Statesman]]'' as "the most perceptive and humane of Black dramatists writing in Britain."<ref name=BFI>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/536770/index.html "Matura, Mustapha (1939–)", Screenonline.]</ref>

==Early years==

Born '''Noel Mathura''' in 1939, in [[Port of Spain]], Trinidad,<ref name="Guardian obit" /> he changed his name when he became a writer, and explained: "I liked the sound of it.... It was the sixties."<ref name=Bio>[http://mustaphamatura.com/bio.html Biography], Mustapha Matura website.</ref>

Leaving the Caribbean, he travelled to England by ship in 1962, and after a year working as a hospital porter he and fellow Trinidadian [[Horace Ové]] went to [[Rome]], where he worked on stage productions such as [[Langston Hughes]]' ''Shakespeare in Harlem''.<ref name=Bio /> Matura thereafter decided to write plays about the West Indian experience in [[London]].<ref name=BFI />

==Career==
Matura's play ''As Time Goes By'' was first performed in 1971 at the [[Traverse Theatre]] Club in [[Edinburgh]] and in London at the Theatre Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]], with a cast of Caribbean actors, including [[Stefan Kalipha]], [[Alfred Fagon]], [[Mona Hammond]] and [[Corinne Skinner-Carter]]. 

''Play Mas'' was first performed at the Royal Court in 1974 (with Stefan Kalipha, [[Rudolph Walker]], [[Norman Beaton]] and Mona Hammond in the cast), winning Matura the London ''[[Evening Standard]]''’s Most Promising Playwright Award that year. It would be revived in 2015 at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]], directed by [[Paulette Randall]] in what was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "beautifully observed production... a richly informative play that raises big questions about the nature of liberation, and is also hilariously precise about the shifting balance of power."<ref>[https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/play-mas/quotes-reviews "Play Mas – Quotes + Reviews"], Orange Tree Theatre.</ref> The reviewer for ''[[The Arts Desk]]'' wrote: "It is surprising that this is the first major revival of Play Mas.... It is exuberant, funny and often charming."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/theatre/play-mas-orange-tree-theatre|title= Play Mas, Orange Tree Theatre {{!}} Mustapha Matura's celebration of Trinidadian Carnival gets a welcome revival|first=Heather|last=Neill|website=The Arts Desk|date=14 March 2015}}</ref>

Among Matura's subsequent plays were ''Rum and Coca Cola'' (1976), ''Another Tuesday'' ([[Institute of Contemporary Arts, London|Institute of Contemporary Arts]], 1978), ''More, More'' (The Factory, London, 1978), ''Independence'' (1979), ''A Dying Business'' ([[Riverside Studios]], 1980); ''One Rule'' (Riverside Studios, 1981), ''Meetings'' (1981),<ref>Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/theater/stage-mustapha-matura-s-meetings.html "Stage: Mustapha Matura's 'Meetings'"], ''The New York Times'', 31 March 1981.</ref> ''[[Playboy of the West Indies]]'' ([[Oxford Playhouse]], 1984; produced for [[BBC television]], 1985), ''Trinidad Sisters'' ([[Tricycle Theatre]], 1988) and ''The Coup'' ([[Royal National Theatre]], 1991).<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/author/mustapha-matura Mustapha Matura page] at Bloomsbury Publishing.</ref><ref name=BlackPlaysArchive />

In 1978, he co-founded the Black Theatre Co-operative (now [[NitroBeat]]) together with British director [[Charlie Hanson]].<ref name=BFI /> "Frustrated by the lack  of interest from London Fringe theatres in Matura's new play ''Welcome Home Jacko'', Matura and Hanson set up their own theatre company. ''Welcome Home Jacko'' was presented at The Factory in [[Paddington]], west London, in May 1979 and marked the beginnings of the Black Theatre Co-operative. The company supported, commissioned and produced work by black writers in Britain."<ref name=BlackPlaysArchive>[http://www.blackplaysarchive.org.uk/explore/companies/black-theatre-co-operative Black Plays Archive, National Theatre.]</ref>

Matura's work for television includes the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[No Problem!]]'' (1983–85), written by him with [[Farrukh Dhondy]], and ''Black Silk'' (BBC, 1985), which he devised in collaboration with [[Rudy Narayan]].<ref>[http://mustaphamatura.com/tv.html TV], Mustapha Matura website.</ref>

Matura was also a poet, and in Bayswater, West London, in 1971 he performed his epic poem "Elae Elae Ghanga", and featured in an evening of poetry and music on Friday, 29 October, organised by the [[Caribbean Artists Movement]], along with [[James Berry (poet)|James Berry]], [[T-Bone Wilson]], [[Louis Marriott]], [[Marc Matthews]] and [[Archie Markham]].<ref>[[Anne Walmsley]], ''The Caribbean Artists Movement 1966–1972'', London: New Beacon Books, 1992, pp. 293, 298.</ref><ref>Ian Dieffenthaller, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cJ0YBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=mustapha+matura+poetry&source=bl&ots=F9NeEZv0ME&sig=yKPEzGDrIhSgcBijD4U4zpcZu_A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik76izj8fKAhXM2hoKHRqSCbUQ6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&q=mustapha%20matura%20poetry&f=false ''Snow on Sugarcane: The Evolution of West Indian Poetry in Britain''], Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009, p. 103.</ref>

==Personal life and legacy==

Matura's first marriage, to Marian Walsh, with whom he had two children (Dominic and Ann), ended in divorce.<ref name="Guardian obit" /> He was subsequently married to Ingrid Selberg, daughter of [[Norway|Norwegian]] mathematician [[Atle Selberg]],<ref>[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Selberg.html Atle Selberg biography], School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland.</ref> with whom he had two children, Cayal and Maya.<ref name="Guardian obit" />

Matura died aged 79 on 29 October 2019, in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], after having a heart attack on a flight from New York where he was visiting a grandchild.<ref name="Guardian obit" /><ref>Geneva Abdul, [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/theater/mustapha-matura-dead.html "Mustapha Matura, Caribbean Playwright in London, Dies at 79"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 19 November 2019.</ref> A celebration of his life and work was held on 8 March 2020 at the [[Young Vic]], directed and curated by [[Nicolas Kent]], [[Anton Phillips]] and [[Paulette Randall]].<ref>[https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/remembering-mustapha-matura "Remembering Mustapha Matura"], Young Vic, 8 March 2020.</ref>
