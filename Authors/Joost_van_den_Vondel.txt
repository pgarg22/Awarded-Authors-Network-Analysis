'''Joost van den Vondel''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈjoːst fɑn dəɱ ˈvɔndəl|lang}};<ref>''Van'' and ''den'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|vɑn|}}, {{IPA-nl|dɛn|}}.</ref> 17 November 1587 – 5 February 1679) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] poet, writer and playwright. He is considered the most prominent Dutch poet and playwright of the 17th century. His plays are the ones from that period that are still most frequently performed, and his epic ''Joannes de Boetgezant'' (1662), on the life of [[John the Baptist]], has been called the greatest Dutch epic.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of the Epic |last=Guerber |first=H. A. |authorlink=H. A. Guerber |year=1913 |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott & Co.|J. B. Lippincott]] |location=Philadelphia |page=356 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13983 }}</ref>

Vondel's theatrical works were regularly performed until the 1960s. The most visible was the annual performance, on New Year's Day from 1637 to 1968, of ''[[Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (play)|Gijsbrecht van Aemstel]]''.

Vondel remained productive until a very old age. Several of his most notable plays like ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lucifer (play)|nl|3=Lucifer (toneelstuk)}}'' and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Adam in Exile|nl|3=Adam in ballingschap}}'' were written after 1650, when he was already 65, and his final play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Noah (play)|nl|3=Noah (toneelstuk)}}'', written at the age of eighty, is considered one of his finest.

==Biography==
Vondel was born on 17 November 1587 on the Große Witschgasse in [[Cologne]], [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His parents were [[Mennonite]]s of [[Antwerp]]ian descent. In 1595 the municipals informed the Mennonites of Cologne that they had to leave the city within fourteen days. The Vondel family was adrift, and went to Frankfurt, Bremen, Emden, and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and eventually settled in [[Amsterdam]] in the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]]. Though the Mennonites were barely tolerated even in Amsterdam, Joost senior acquired citizenship on 27 March 1597, which enabled him to set up a business. He became a silk trader.<ref>Grootes (2012), 102</ref>

From age ten, Vondel was schooled in correct Dutch and also learnt good French. Sons of the mercantile middle class were not sent to the Latin schools, so as an adult Vondel taught himself Latin.<ref>Grootes (2012), 103</ref> He lived in a community of people from Antwerp, and by 1606 was a member of the chamber of rhetoric 't Wit Lavendel (The White Lavender), a chamber founded by immigrants from the Southern Netherlands for literary activity.<ref>Grootes (2012), 104</ref>

In 1606 Vondel was baptized as a Mennonite. The following year his father, who had a silk business in the Warmoesstraat, died, and Vondel was brought in as a business partner.<ref>Smits-Veldt and Spies (2012), 52</ref>

At the age of 23, Vondel married Mayken de Wolff. Together they had four children, of whom two died in infancy. Around 1620 he must have suffered from depression, with a second period of melancholia occurring in 1626.<ref>Smits-Veldt and Spies (2012), 57</ref>

In the meantime, he began to learn Latin and became acquainted with famous poets, such as [[Roemer Visscher]].

Around the year 1641, he converted to Roman [[Catholicism]]. This was a great shock to most of his fellow countrymen because the main faith and ''de facto'' state religion in the Republic was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. It is still unclear why he became a Catholic although his love for a Catholic woman may have played a role in this (Mayken de Wolff had died in 1635). He vigorously defended his newfound faith in works such as ''Altaergeheimenissen'' (''on the holy Eucharist'') and ''De heerlijkheid der kerke'' (''on the Church'').<ref>{{cite book|title=Vondel: volledige dichtwerken en oorspronkelijk proza|first=Albert|last=Verwey|author-link=Albert Verwey|publisher=H. J. W. Becht|language=nl|page=41}}</ref>

During his life, he became one of the main advocates for [[religious tolerance]]. After the arrest, [[Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets|trial]] and the immediate beheading of the most important civilian leader of the States of the Netherlands, [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]] (1619), at the command of his enemy, Prince [[Maurits of Nassau]], and the [[Synod of Dort]] (1618–1619), the Calvinists became the decisive religious power in the Republic. Public practice of Catholicism, [[Anabaptism]] and [[Arminianism]] was from then on officially forbidden but worship in [[clandestine church|clandestine houses of prayer]] was tolerated. Vondel wrote many satires criticising the Calvinists and extolling Oldenbarnevelt. That, together with his new faith, made him an unpopular figure in Calvinist circles. He died a bitter man though he was honoured by many fellow poets, on 5 February 1679.

[[George Borrow]] called him "by far the greatest [man] that Holland ever produced."<ref>[[George Borrow]], ''[[Wild Wales]], p. 105.</ref>

=== ''Lucifer'' (1654) and Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' ===

It has been suggested<ref>Cf. [[George Edmundson]], ''[https://archive.org/details/miltonandvondelc00edmuuoft Milton and Vondel: a curiosity of literature]'', London: 1885.</ref> that [[John Milton]] drew inspiration from ''Lucifer'' (1654) and ''Adam in Ballingschap'' (1664) for his ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667). In some respects the two works have similarities: the focus on [[Lucifer]], the description of the battle in heaven between Lucifer's forces and Michael's, and the anti-climax as Adam and Eve leave Paradise.

One example of similarity is the following:

"Here may we reign secure, and in my choice To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell.

Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven."

:Milton's ''Paradise Lost''

"Is ’t noodlot, dat ick vall’, van eere en staet berooft,<BR>
Laet vallen, als ick vall’, met deze kroone op ’t hooft,<BR>
Dien scepter in de vuist, dien eersleip van vertrouden,<BR>
En zoo veel duizenden als onze zyde houden.<BR>
Dat valle streckt tot eer, en onverwelckbren lof:<BR>
En liever d’ eerste Vorst in eenigh laeger hof,<BR>
Dan in ’t gezalight licht de tweede, of noch een minder<BR>
Zoo troost ick my de kans, en vrees nu leet noch hinder."

Translation:<BR>
''Is it fate that I will fall, robbed of honour and dignity,''<BR>
''Then let me fall, if I were to fall, with this crown upon my head''<BR>
''This sceptre in my fist, this company of loyals,''<BR>
''And as many as are loyal to our side.''<BR>
''This fall would honour one, and give unwilting praise:''<BR>
''And rather [would I be] foremost king in any lower court,''<BR>
''Than rank second in most holy light, or even less''<BR>
''Thus I justify my revolt, and will not fear pain nor hindrance.''

:Vondel's ''Lucifer''

==Commemoration==

Amsterdam's biggest park, the [[Vondelpark]], bears his name. There is a statue of Vondel in the northern part of the park. Also, there is a Vondel Street in [[Cologne]], the ''Vondelstraße'' in the [[Neustadt-Süd]]-district.

The [[Banknotes of the Dutch gulden|Dutch five guilder banknote]] bore Vondel's portrait from 1950 until it was discontinued in 1990.

All works of Joost van den Vondel (WB-editie) were published in 10 volumes (1927-1937).<ref>{{Cite web|last=DBNL|title=Joost van den Vondel · dbnl|url=https://www.dbnl.org/auteurs/auteur.php?id=vond001|access-date=2021-09-15|website=DBNL|language=nl}}</ref>
