'''Walter Georg Alfred Hasenclever''' (8 July 1890 &ndash; 22 June 1940) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] poet and playwright. His works were banned when the Nazis came to power and he went into exile in [[France]]; however, there he was imprisoned as a "foreign enemy". He died in [[Les Milles]] ([[Camp des Milles]]) near [[Aix-en-Provence]].

== Early life==
Born in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]], the son of the doctor Carl Georg Hasenclever (1855–1934) and his wife Mathilde Anna (née Reiss; 1869–1953), Walter Hasenclever began studying [[law]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1908 before changing to the [[University of Lausanne]]. From 1909 to 1914 he studied in [[Leipzig]], where he became interested in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]].

==Career==
In 1910 he published his first volume of poems, ''Towns, nights and people'' (''Städte, Nächte und Menschen''). In 1914 his play ''[[The Son (play)|The Son]]'' (''Der Sohn'') was his first successful [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist drama]].

At first, Hasenclever was pro-war and volunteered for [[military service]]; soon, however, he came to reject the war. He simulated [[mental illness]] and was released from duty in 1917. That same year he was presented with the [[Kleist Prize]] for his passionate adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. He was a good friend of the artist [[Oskar Kokoschka]] who depicted him in his 1918 work "The Friends" with [[Käthe Richter]] in [[Dresden]], where Hasenclever was recuperating from his "illness" in a sanatorium.

In 1924, Hasenclever met [[Kurt Tucholsky]]; at this time he worked as a French correspondent for the magazine ''8-Uhr-Abendblatt'', spending a lot of time in [[Paris]], where he also befriended the dramatist [[Jean Giraudoux]]. In 1926 he produced the successful [[comedy]] ''[[A Better Gentleman]]'' (''Ein besserer Herr'') and in 1928 the comedy ''[[Marriages are Made in Heaven]]'' (''Ehen werden im Himmel geschlossen''). In 1930, he wrote scripts for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for [[Greta Garbo]]; at this time he lived in [[Berlin]] in an "artists' colony".

==Nazi Era & Fate==
When the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]] took power in 1933, his works were banned, burned during the [[book burning]], then removed from libraries. Hasenclever went into [[exile]] in [[Nice]]. In 1934, he married Edith Schläfer there.

During the [[Second World War]] Hasenclever was imprisoned twice as a "foreign enemy" in [[France]]. When France fell to Germany, he was in the prison camp of [[Camp des Milles]] in the south-east of France. In the early hours of 22 June 1940 he took his own life with an overdose of the [[barbiturate]] ''[[Veronal]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Taussig |first=Michael |date=April 13, 2010 |title= Walter Benjamin's Grave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ki6fD2DUZP8C&pg=PT24 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=12 |isbn=978-0226790008}}</ref> so as not to fall into the hands of the Nazis.
