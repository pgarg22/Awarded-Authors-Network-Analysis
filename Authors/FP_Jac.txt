'''F. P. Jac'''  (11 November 1955 – 25 December 2008), born '''Flemming Palle Jakobsen''', was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[poet]].

His first publication was the poetry collection ''Spontane kalender-blade'' (''Spontaneous Calendar-sheets'') from 1976. Even if his production is much "lighter" in tone than his peers of that day, he is counted as belonging to the so-called eighties-generation of poets. He published more than fifty collections of poetry, a few of them in cooperation with some other Danish poets, namely Asger Schnack and Klaus Høeck. His latest work while alive was ''Søvnlysninger'', (''Sleeplightings''), 2007.

Jac often utilised [[autobiographical]] material in his writing, generously twisting everything to an innovative, kind-hearted, humorous and above all distinct voice. Approaching everyday life with a defiant ability to find beauty and oddness he coined many new words describing feelings and situations previously unaccounted for in Danish. This gave him a reputation for being an eccentric with a slanted and highly personal use of language, but also brought him much acclaim among peers and a large fan base. In 2008, 1 month before his death, he was thus awarded the grand prize of the Academy for the Arts for his life achievement in regards to kindling the [[Danish language]].
