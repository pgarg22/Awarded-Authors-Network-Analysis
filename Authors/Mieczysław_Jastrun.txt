'''Mieczysław Jastrun''' born ''Mojsze Agatstein'' (29 October 1903 &ndash; 22 February 1983) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] poet and essayist of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin.<ref>[http://www.sztetl.org.pl/?app=term&id=88&lang=pl_PL&x=showTerm Polish-Jewish literature]</ref> The main themes of his poetry are [[philosophy]] and [[morality]]. He translated [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[German language|German]] poetry to [[Polish language|Polish]].

== Life ==
Jastrun was born in [[Korolivka, Borshchiv Raion]] (in the former [[Eastern Galicia]]) into a Jewish family, the son of Józef Agatstein and Maria Agatstein née Wiensohn. He spent his childhood in [[Jodłowa]], and went to public school in [[Ryglice]], where his father had opened a surgery. The family moved several times to places where Joseph worked. Through 1915−1919 Mieczysław stayed in [[Kraków]], where he went to [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. Due to the onset of [[Polish–Soviet War]] he interrupted his studies and volunteered to the Polish Army. However, he did not participate in engagements as he contracted [[typhus]]. On 9 March 1920 together with his older brother, Jerzy Stanisław (later [[Jerzy Gierowski]]) he was [[baptism|baptised]] in the parish church in Jodłowa. He did not return to Kraków immediately and instead completed the last two high school forms in [[Liceum#Poland|First General Liceum]] in [[Tarnów]]. During that time he lived in Pleśna, with his former governess (1921−1923).

Later during the 1920s, Jastrun studied Polish, German and philosophy at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków; he received a doctorate in 1929. He was also close to the [[Skamander]] group and wrote several works of poetry strongly influenced by [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. At the onset of [[World War II]], Jastrun took refuge in [[Lviv]], then occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], where he worked as a teacher. After [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Lviv in 1941, he relocated to [[Warsaw]], took the name ''Jan Klonowicz'' and worked as an [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground teacher]]. Jastrun's Jewish identity remained undiscovered during the war, and he survived the [[Holocaust]].

After the end of the war, Jastrun lived briefly in Lublin and Lodz before moving back to Warsaw in 1949. He joined the communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR), and in the post-war era wrote several books dealing with the Nazi occupation and the Holocaust in the style of [[socialist realism]]. Jastrun also wrote biographies of [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Juliusz Słowacki]], translated works by poets such as [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]] into Polish, and taught modern poetry at the [[University of Warsaw]].

In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called [[Letter of 34]] to Prime Minister [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]] regarding freedom of culture.

Jastrun died in Warsaw in 1983, and is buried at [[Powązki Cemetery]].
