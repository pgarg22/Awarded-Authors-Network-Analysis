'''Bartley Theodore Campbell''' (August 12, 1843 â€“ July 30, 1888) was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] of the latter 19th century.

==Early years==
Campbell was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] on August 12, 1843, to parents who had [[emigration|emigrated]] from [[Ireland]]. His writing career began at the age of 15 in 1858, when he took a job as a [[reporter]] for the ''Pittsburgh Post''. He later became a [[drama]] [[critic]] for the ''[[Pittsburgh Leader]]'', editor of the ''McKeesport Times'', and founder of the ''Pittsburg Evening Mail'' and the ''Southern Monthly Magazine''.

Campbell's playwright career began in 1871 with the [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''Through Fire'', which ran for four weeks and motivated him to quit [[journalism]]. He wrote numerous plays for [[Theatre in Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh's theatres]] which garnered him national attention.<ref>Conner, Lynne (2007). Pittsburgh In Stages: Two Hundred Years of Theater. University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 39-40. {{ISBN|978-0-8229-4330-3}}. Retrieved 2011-06-06.</ref> He was quite successful and is often noted as the first American to earn a living solely as a playwright; however, there is some debate about whether or not he was truly the first.

His other plays include ''Peril; or, Love at Long Branch'' (1872); ''Fate'' (1873); ''Risks; or, Insure Your Life'', written for [[John Dillon (comedian)|John Dillon]] (1873); ''The Virginian'' (1874); ''The Big Bonanza''; ''My Partner'' (1879), ''The Galley Slave'' (1879); ''The White Slave'' (1882); ''Siberia'' (1882); and his final play, ''Paquita'' (1885).

==Final years==
Campbell's health deteriorated under the strain of financial difficulties associated with his efforts to act as author, producer and director of his plays. He  was declared [[insanity|insane]] in September 1886, and died in the State Hospital for the Insane in [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York]] on July 30, 1888.<ref name="Quinn">{{cite book |last=Quinn |first=Arthur Hobson |year=1936 |orig-year=1927 |title=A History of the Present Day Drama from the Civil War to the Present Day|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofpresent00quinuoft/page/n169 |location=New York |publisher=Appleton Century Crofts }}</ref>{{Rp|124}} He is buried in [[St. Mary Cemetery, Pittsburgh|St. Mary Cemetery]] in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Lawrenceville Historical Society|title=First in Lawrenceville|url=http://lawrencevillehistoricalsociety.com/first-in-lawrenceville/|access-date=2015-11-04}}</ref>

Although his works contain language and situations that would be considered [[Political correctness|politically incorrect]] today, theatre troupes performing his plays can still be found over a century later.
