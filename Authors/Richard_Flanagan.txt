Friedrich killed himself in the middle of the book's writing and it was published posthumously. Simon Caterson, writing in ''[[The Australian]]'', described it as "one of the least reliable but most fascinating memoirs in the annals of Australian publishing".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/all-memoirs-are-verily-unreliable/news-story/3d6b8ed1f983aead31891f393566b486|title=All memoirs are verily unreliable|date=11 April 2008|website=Theaustralian.com.au|access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref>

==Novels==
{{npov|date=November 2021}}
Flanagan's first novel, ''[[Death of a River Guide]]'' (1994), is the tale of Aljaz Cosini, river guide, who lies drowning, reliving his life and the lives of his family and forebears. It was described by ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' as "one of the most auspicious debuts in Australian writing".<ref name=tls>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Vivian|title=Down the Franklin|journal=The Times Literary Supplement|date=3 October 1997|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/down-the-franklin/|access-date=7 April 2019}}</ref> His next book, ''[[The Sound of One Hand Clapping (novel)|The Sound of One Hand Clapping]]'' (1997), which tells the story of Slovenian immigrants, was a major bestseller, selling more than 150,000 copies in Australia. Flanagan's first two novels, declared ''Kirkus Reviews'', "rank with the finest fiction out of Australia since the heyday of [[Patrick White]]".<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-flanagan/death-of-a-river-guide/ Death of a River Guide], ''Kirkus Reviews'', 1 March 2001</ref>

''[[Gould's Book of Fish]]'' (2001), Flanagan's third novel, is based on the life of [[William Buelow Gould]], a convict artist, and tells the tale of his love affair with a young black woman in 1828. It won the 2002 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]]. Flanagan described these early novels as 'soul histories'. His fourth novel was ''[[The Unknown Terrorist]]'' (2006), which ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "stunning ... a brilliant meditation upon the post-9/11 world".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/books/08kaku.html?ref=richard_flanagan | work=The New York Times | first=Michiko | last=Kakutani | title=A Misunderstanding, and a Simple Life Descends into a Nightmare | date=8 May 2007}}</ref> His fifth novel, ''[[Wanting (novel)|Wanting]]'' (2008) tells two parallel stories: about the novelist [[Charles Dickens]] in England, and Mathinna, an Aboriginal orphan adopted by Sir [[John Franklin]], the colonial governor of [[Van Diemen's Land]], and his wife, Lady Jane Franklin.
