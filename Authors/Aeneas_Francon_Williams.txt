Aeneas Francon Williams was born at 15 Leonard Street, [[Liscard]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], [[Cheshire]], the second son of four to [[John Francon Williams]] [[FRGS]], and Barbara Balmain Dougall. Aeneas had three brothers, John Balmain, [[David Dougal Williams]] [[FRSA]] and George Stanley, and a sister, Margaret Mary Ann Williams. Aeneas was baptized at St. Peter's Church, [[Liverpool]], on 20 July 1886.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com – Liverpool F.C., Lancashire, England, Baptisms 1813–1906 – Aeneas Francon Williams, son of John and Barbara Williams, St. Peter's Church, Liverpool F.C., 20 July 1886.</ref> During Aeneas's formative years, he was educated privately. From 1900 to 1906, Aeneas attended the Technical Institute and Student Teacher Centre in [[Walthamstow]], and from 1906 to 1908, he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Moray House Training College]]. In 1932 Aeneas returned to [[Edinburgh]], where he studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] New College for a further two years.

Aeneas's father, [[John Francon Williams]], born in 1854 in the village of [[Llanllechid]] in Caernarvonshire, [[North Wales]], was a published writer, newspaper editor, [[geographer]], inventor, historian and [[cartographer]].<ref>John Francon Williams World Catalogue:http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=John+Francon+Williams&qt=results_page</ref><ref>John Francon Williams, (inventions) reference BT 51/4/5500, registered design No 5500, 1884 April 21, and, registered design reference BT 51/4/5499, 1884 April 21, The National Archives, Kew</ref><ref>A Class-Book of Modern Geography by J.

===Kalimpong===

At the age of twenty-four, Aeneas Williams attended the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]] hosted at the [[Assembly Hall of the United Free Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in Edinburgh from 14 to 23 June. The conference is a marker for the beginning of the modern Protestant Christian ecumenical movement. The [[Church of Scotland]] missionary [[John Anderson Graham]] appeared at the conference both as a guest speaker and as a member of the audience. He was also there to encourage donations to aid his mission [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] in [[Kalimpong]], West Bengal. The Protestant Christian Missionary community slogan drove the conference's spirit: 'The Evangelization of the World in this Generation.' Whether Aeneas attended one meeting, or several is undocumented, but during the event he got his calling to become a [[missionary]]. Later that same year, Aeneas arrived in [[India]] and was stationed in [[Kalimpong]] at St Andrew's Colonial Home (later renamed [[Dr. Graham's Homes]]) – an orphanage/school – where he was the assistant schoolmaster and taught Geography and Science.<ref>Dr. Graham's Kalimpong Homes – [[National Library of Scotland]] Blog with original photographs from [[Kalimpong]] during the early 1900s: http://blog.nls.uk/dr-grahams-kalimpong-homes/</ref><ref>Marriage Certificate for Aeneas Francon Williams and Clara Anne Rendall, 2 December 1914: Findmypast.co.uk – Williams rank of profession is registered as ‘Assistant School Master.’</ref> As the school expanded, Williams took on the role of Bursar.

The committee funded the building of [[John Breeden|St. George's Homes]] in Pulney Hills, [[Kodaikanal]], founded by Rev. [[John Breeden]] in 1914, which was based upon St Andrew's Colonial Homes, hence the connection. Breeden and Wolseley visited St. Andrew's Colonial Homes to draw up plans for St. George's Homes.<ref>''Hindu Times'', 1 March 2010. Retrieved 10 June 2012. St. George's Homes, which opened its doors in May 1914 after planning and fund-raising efforts that John Breeden had started in 1910, is now called the Laidlaw Memorial School and Junior College:[https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Persistence-pays/article15705916.ecehindu.com.

Aeneas quickly settled into his life at St. Andrew's as a missionary and took on several other roles, including financial adviser to Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]], and as a fundraiser for the children's home.<ref>St Andrew's Colonial Home – School and Mission houses (pictures) (c. 1922) from An Indian Pilgrimage – Travel Notes of a Visit to the Indian Fields of the Church of Scotland by The Very Rev.

In Darjeeling, missionaries played a supporting role to the official political figures and aristocracy that governed the region.

Williams’ first book, ''A Pronouncement of the Public Conscience'', was published in 1921. At the beginning of January 1921, Aeneas, his wife, and their two young offspring (aged 4) sailed from [[Calcutta]] on board the ([[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]] Line) SS ''Soudan''<ref>Incoming Passenger List: SS Soudan, port of arrival London, 18 January 1921: passengers A. Francon Williams (schoolmaster), Clara A Williams, Alfred F. and Beatrice C.</ref> en route to the UK. The family arrived in the [[Port of London]] on 18 January from where they travelled up to [[Scotland]]. It was the first time the two young children Alfred and Beatrice, had visited [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. During the trip, Aeneas undertook a short fundraising tour in aid of [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] in Kalimpong, during which he gave lantern shows with spoken commentary. His shows were performed on variety bills and in Church Halls. The photographic slides were projected upon a large screen and depicted life at St Andrew's Colonial Home, views of the [[Eastern Himalayas]], and his experience as a missionary in [[India]]. One of Williams’ presentations was given at a variety concert at [[Elie]] in [[Fife]] held on 23 September at which Major-General Sir [[George Kenneth Scott-Moncrieff]] introduced the acts.<ref>''Dundee Courier'', 24 September 1921, p.3 – Variety Concert at Elie (review) – A variety concert gave a successful entertainment in the Parish Church Hall Elie in aid of the St Andrew's Colonial Home, Kalimpong.</ref> Williams shared the bill with various vocal and instrumental performers, as well as a young dancer.

Aeneas Francon Williams was elected a Fellow of The [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] ([[FRSGS]]) in 1921.<ref>The Royal Scottish Geographical Society, Diploma of Fellowship (FRSGS) register, 1921, Dr. A. Francon Williams, British Bhutan (retrieved 10 October 2017):

The Williams family returned to [[Kalimpong]] from the U.K. in early 1922. In late March/early April 1922, [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] played host to the first [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition|Mount Everest expedition]]. There had been a [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|reconnaissance expedition]] the previous year, but the 1922 expedition was the first attempt to conquer the summit. The main team members were [[Charles Granville Bruce|General Charles Granville Bruce]], [[Edward Lisle Strutt]], [[George Mallory]], [[George Ingle Finch]], [[Edward Felix Norton]], [[Henry Treise Morshead]], [[Howard Somervell]], Arthur Wakefield, and the photographer and movie maker [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]]. Making up the rest of the team was a large group of Tibetan and Nepalese Sherpa's and porters who tendered the pace of donkey's laden with food and equipment. The party arrived by steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station from where they trekked the short distance up the hillside to St Andrew's Colonial Home for three days relaxation. There was much excitement among the staff and children at St Andrew's, with football games, golf, and group evening sing-alongs taking place in the main school hall, with members of the expedition partaking in the activities. Aeneas, his wife Clara, and their two 6-year-old children were at the centre of the hospitality, with Wolseley House (among other houses in the school compound) providing temporary accommodation for the lead mountaineers.<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Level 15 Special Archives, Kalimpong Papers: Files ACC 6039, Box 15 (1) ‘Everest Climbers’ 1922, pages 37–40, documents the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition visit to St Andrew's Colonial Home (within the hand-typed biography of St Andrew's Colonial Home). Mr Williams' enthusiasm is mentioned in the account. :https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/19dd2070-a22d-389b-91c8-a144960371bc</ref> At the end of their stay, the expedition headed off to [[Phari Dzong]] and further on to [[Kampa Dzong]], which they reached on 11 April. They arrived at [[Rongbuk Glacier]] base camp on May 1. Alas, the expedition's attempt to ascent [[Everest]] turned out to be unsuccessful. John Noel produced a movie of the expedition titled ''Climbing Mount Everest (1922)''.<ref>''Climbing Mount Everest'' (1922) – Directed by [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]] – housed at the [[British Film Institute]]: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-climbing-mt-everest-1922-online</ref> The film shows the team arriving on a steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station and at St. Andrew's Colonial Home, although footage taken inside the school compound is not included in the movie. The 1922 expedition did establish a new world record climbing height of 8,326 metres (27,320&nbsp;ft). The team's next attempt to conquer [[Everest]] took place in 1924. It was during this expedition that [[George Mallory]] and his companion [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt to reach the summit together but, at some point, died in a fall. However, until this day, it is still unsure whether or not the pair did reach the summit. Mallory's body was only retrieved in 1999; Irvine's body has never been found.

The object of the present work is to present the facts of meteorology to the general reader in a popular form, and to show how observers equipped with quite simple instruments can find pleasure as well as profit in the study of weather conditions.’

On 5 February 1924, Aeneas and Clara, with their two young children (aged seven), sailed from [[Calcutta]] aboard SS ''Hosang'' (Indo-China Steam Navigation Company) to Shanghai, China. Upon their arrival, they then caught a steamer and sailed 1,000 miles up the [[River Yangtze]] (Cháng Jiāng)<ref>Photograph of the Yangtze River at Yichang, Sichuan, China, in 1927, showing a passenger steamer and other small boats used on the river: International Mission Photography Archive, ca.1860-ca.1960: Yale Divinity Library Special Collections:  http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15799coll123/id/82992/rec/1</ref> to the [[Church of Scotland]] (Training Institution) in [[Ichang]].<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Catalogue of MSS.

Aeneas and Clara immediately took Chinese language lessons, and both became fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The port of [[Ichang]] was one of four ports open to foreign trade, and the highest reached by steamers. The city of [[Ichang]] was situated right in the center of China, on a low promontory on the North bank of the [[River Yangtze]]. It was a prefectural city of considerable importance in the province of [[Hupeh]], and conveniently situated as a mart for the tea trade of Hoh-fung-chow. [[Opium]] was also grown in the district, as was the [[tung tree]], from which tung oil is extracted. ‘The China Inland Mission possessed a number of unique features which set it apart from established missionary societies and gave it an intensity and, perhaps, a glamour, which other more conventional organisations must have envied.’<ref>Dr. Rosemary Seton, former Archivist, School of Oriental and African Studies: China Inland Mission, 1865–1951 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London: http://www.ampltd.co.uk/collections_az/CIM-2/highlights.aspx</ref> During his stay in China, Aeneas wrote the poem ''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)''.<ref>''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'', p. 46-48</ref> In December 1926, Aeneas received a worrying letter from the [[Church of Scotland]] offices in [[Edinburgh]] talking of anxious happenings in [[Hankow]] and the possibility of a General Strike in China.<ref>Letter to Aeneas Francon Williams from the [[Church of Scotland]] office in [[Edinburgh]] dated 30 November 1926 stored in the Dr. Graham Kalimpong Archive held at the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.</ref> In the [[House of Commons]], the [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Austen Chamberlain]] intimated that the British Government was talking of taking immediate steps to protect U.K. nationals stationed in [[China]].

In October 1927, while in the U.K., Aeneas was invited to attend the annual [[Church of Scotland]] Young Men's Guild Conference held in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], over the weekend commencing Friday 21 October. The main objectives of the conference were to revive interest in the work of the Guild, and to demonstrate anew the value and usefulness of such an organization as auxiliary of Church life. Two halls were booked for the occasion, the Beveridge and Adam Smith Halls. On Friday evening, Aeneas gave a missionary address at the Beveridge Hall about his work in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], and in [[Ichang]], [[China]].<ref>''Fife Free Press & Kirkcaldy Guardian'', Saturday 15 October 1927, page 7 – Church of Scotland Young Men's Guild Conference in Kirkcaldy (1927) report (retrieved 6 March 2018)</ref> It was at the 1888 meeting of the Guild held in the town of Kirkcaldy that Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]] made the momentous decision and choice to establish a charitable school for destitute children in [[India]], and was thus ordained as the first missionary supported by the Guild.<ref>''The Meaning of White: Race, Class, and the 'Domiciled Community' in British India 1858–1930'' by Satoshi Mizutani, publ.

The conference opened with a civic reception by the Provost and Magistrates at the Beveridge Hall on the Friday, followed by a welcoming tea, after which Aeneas gave his missionary address at Beveridge Hall.

===Mahakalguri, West Bengal===
In late 1927, Aeneas and Clara returned to [[India]], and were stationed at Mahakalguri, Eastern [[Dooars]] (Duars). Here Aeneas took on the role of missionary Pastor. Their two children Alfred and Beatrice, remained in [[Edinburgh]] to continue their studies at [[George Watson's College]]. The [[Church of Scotland]] ran a children's home in the little country village of [[Duddingston]], near [[Edinburgh]], which was founded specifically for children of foreign missionaries, whose parents were unable to take their children abroad with them. The home was called Home House and run by Miss Paterson (a Deaconess of the [[Church of Scotland]]) and her sister Minnie. The two sisters were referred to as ‘Aunty’ by the children.<ref>''Alice Maxwell Deaconess'' by Mrs. Horatio Macrae, published by Hodder & Stoughton, 1920 – pages 180-181</ref> The house in Old Church Lane had a large rear garden and was close enough to [[Edinburgh]] for the children to attend school there, yet surrounded by the bracing fresh air of the open countryside.<ref>Home-House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston – Category B Listed building: http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB29462</ref> It was at Home House that Alfred and Beatrice boarded during part of their education at [[George Watson's College]].

In [[Jalpaiguri]], on January 16, 1928, Aeneas and his wife, Clara, were appointed non-official visitors of the Alipur Duar Dub-Jail in the district of [[Jalpaiguri]] for a period of two years by the Commissioner of the Rajshahi Division.<ref>''The Calcutta Gazette'', January 26, 1928, p. 184: [https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.10753/page/n349/mode/2up?q=a+francon+williams  A. Francon Williams]</ref>
Also in 1928, Aeneas was licensed by the Presbytery of [[Eastern Himalaya]]. In November of that same year he took his holy orders and was ordained by the Presbytery at [[Siliguri]] in [[North Bengal]]. The [[Presbytery of Edinburgh]] admitted Williams to the [[Church of Scotland]] on 28 May 1932.

===Matelli, West Bengal===
In 1929, Aeneas was stationed at the [[Church of Scotland]] Guild Mission in [[Matelli]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district of [[West Bengal]], where he was the Minister of the [[Jalpaiguri]] Parish. At the Mission compound in Matelli, Aeneas and Clara resided at the Manse. Through its schools – St. Ninian's 'Middle' school, St. Margaret's 'High' school, and its boys and girls Day Schools in Calcutta, a boys school in Chinsura, and the Abbey School, and various primary schools in Budge Budge, and its College – the Church of Scotland Mission offered Christian education from the kindergarten to the University stage.

In 1930, ''Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech'' by Aeneas Francon Williams was published. The book was intended for the use of Christians of the [[Mech Tribe]]s living at the foot of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district. It was the first Hymn Book to be published in this regional dialect of [[Hindi]].<ref>The One Hundred and First Report of the Calcutta Christian Tract and Book Society (Incorporated) 1930/1931, page 7 & 10:(retrieved document 16 July 2017): The document mentions 2,000 copies of Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech by Aeneas Francon Williams were purchased by the Book Society for distribution: http://images.library.yale.edu/divinitycontent/dayrep/Calcutta%20Christian%20Tract%20and%20Book%20Society%201930-1931%20v101.pdf</ref>
While Aeneas was living in [[Matelli]], he owned a [[Cinchona]] ([[quinine]]) plantation.

On 7 March 1930, Clara, being the only female along with two Babu's, was appointed under the provisions of rule 63(2), Chapter IV of the Bengal Jail Code, as a non-official visitor of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail in the [[Jalpaiguri district]] of [[West Bengal]] for two years.<ref>''The Calcultta Gazette'', 13 March 1930 page 390, No. 886J: Babu Manish Chandra Roy, Babu Lalit Behari Ghosh, and Mrs. Francon Williams are appointed as non-official visitors of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.45159/2015.45159.The-Calcutta-Gazette-1930-January---June#page/n873/mode/2up/search/Francon+williams</ref> The appointment of the three non-official visitors was to help rehabilitate the inmates by helping to change the offender's values, motivations, and attitudes, so that they could become contributing members of society upon their release. The non-official visitors would visit the jail periodically and attend to the inmates' requests about their care and welfare. At the end of their visits, they would enter any observations about their time at the jail in the visitor's book.<ref>The State Governments framed rules regarding appointments and visits by official and non official visitors in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section 25 of section 59 of the Prisons Act. 1894:  http://ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/PSI/Prison2012/CHAPTER-10.pdf</ref> Clara had been a non-official visitor for the previous two years at the Alipur Duar Dub-Jail in the district of [[Jalpaiguri]]. 

In 1932, Williams visited [[Scotland]], during which he supported as many church events and meetings as he could comfortably fit into his schedule. In late-September, Williams showed his support for the ‘Forward Movement’ campaign launched by [[West Lothian]] Churches. At the campaign, he gave a powerful speech detailing his all-absorbing work in [[India]] as a missionary.<ref>''Edinburgh Evening News'', Friday 23 September 1932, page 7 – Forward Movement (report) Campaign by West Lothian Churches</ref> On 3 October, Williams attended the Young Men's Guild of the Linlithgow and Falkirk Council. He addressed the large attendance with more stories of his work and adventures as a missionary in [[North Bengal]]. ‘Mr. Williams’ address brought out in a wonderful way the romance of the mission fields, and the speaker dealt in a most interesting manner with his own particular work among the depressed races in the Eastern Duars.’<ref>''Linlithgowshire Gazette'', Friday 7 October 1932, page 5 – Young Men's Guild (report)</ref> In 1934, Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred aged eighteen, enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he studied medicine for the next six years.

In the summer of 1937, Aeneas and Clara, accompanied by their two offspring, Alfred (a medical student) and Beatrice (a nurse), sailed from [[Dooars]], [[India]], to America where they arrived in [[New York City]] on 16 August 1937 aboard SS ''Caledonia'' II.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com – New York Passenger Lists, 1820–1957 – Aeneas Francon Williams arrived New York on 16 August 1937 aboard SS Caledonia II.

Williams’ first volume of poems ''Dream Drift, by a Young Lover'', was published in 1938. The book was dedicated to his wife, Clara. The suggestion of a priest being perceived as a ‘young lover’ was a bold move on Williams and the publisher's part. It was certainly uncommon for a member of the cloth to reveal a poetic side that included talk of lovemaking. ''The Dundee Courier'', in their appraisal of the work, noted that, ‘Mr. Williams' poems reveal their author in many moods, as a nature lover, sportsman, and lover. Only an angler could have written his poems on ''Fishing'' and ''Wound Up''. There is a whimsical, almost ‘Barriesque’ ([[James M. Barrie]]) touch about some of his nature poems, which is infinitely attractive.’<ref>''Dundee Courier'', Thursday 21 July 1938, p.6 – Missionary As Poet (review) ''Dream Drift, by a Young Lover''</ref> ‘Mr. Francon Williams looks through a poet's window and can tell what he sees, as a poet tells, and as those to whom he speaks can understand. Life, in life's vocabulary, lit by a poet's candle, is what he tells to us; and in odd hours of quiet, he is worth listening to.’ The Very Rev. [[Lauchlan Maclean Watt]], DD LLD.<ref>Quote by The Very Rev. [[Lauchlan Maclean Watt]], DD LLD, taken from the front jacket cover of ''Dream Drift by a Young Lover'' – Aeneas Francon Williams, publ.

Aeneas would find small nuggets of inspiration obscured in the noise of life. In his poem, ''To A Dead Bird,'' Williams immortalizes a solitary dead bulbul, an Indian nightingale he found lying near a bush in the Manse in Bengal where he lived. He explains, 'I put it in my pocket-handkerchief, and with a little burial service, I laid it to rest in our consecrated burial ground opposite Manse Gate.<ref>''Let Poet's Sing'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, page 41 – ''To A Dead Bird''.</ref>

On 13 May 1942, Aeneas and Clara's daughter Beatrice married Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh of [[Builth Wells]], [[Breconshire]], [[Wales]].<ref>Northern Isles Family History: https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> The couple later emigrated to [[Tasmania]], where they lived their entire lives in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].

In 1945, Aeneas and Clara spent a summer vacation at [[Kodaikanal]], a resort in the [[Cardamom Hills]] (Yela Mala), a mountain range in [[South India]], where their son Alfred, who was now a Captain in the RAMC ([[Royal Army Medical Corps]]) and stationed in [[Burma]], joined them. It was while Aeneas was in the [[Cardamom Hills]] that he wrote his poem ''Flowers''.<ref>''Flowers'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'' p. 34</ref>

On 1 January 1946, in the New Year Indian Honours List, Clara (Mrs. Francon Williams) was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]] (Emperor of India) Bronze Medal for her work during [[WWII]] being in-charge of [[Red Cross]] work in [[Dooars]], [[Bengal]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical News |journal=The Indian Medical Gazette |date=December 1945 |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=629–632 |pmc=5218119 |pmid=29015760 }}</ref>

In 1947, when [[India]] was granted Independence, Clara returned to [[Scotland]] to set up a home in [[Edinburgh]]. Aeneas remained in India at the Mission during the handover. 
After the inauguration of [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] on 15 August 1947, Aeneas wrote 'Report 1947, The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During a Momentous Year', documenting what he saw and encountered in [[India]] during and after the handover. Much rejoicing took place in all the Mission institutions. The new Constitution (not yet fully adopted) guaranteed freedom 'to profess, practice and propagate' any religion. When pupils were asked, now that India was free would they rather there was no teaching about Christianity in school, the answer was always the same, that it was because of such education that they wished to study at the Mission. The Mission had since Independence Day been besieged with new applications for admission. However, Aeneas noted the College was experiencing a communal 'low' in staffing levels, with the shortage of Christian professors becoming an 'anxiety.' The Mission staffing levels had also fallen (to eight women and four men), and the Foreign Mission Committee was doing everything in its power to find recruits.
Looking ahead, Aeneas spoke of a 'partnership,' a 'Home Mission,' uniting the Mission of the [[Church of Scotland]] in India with the Church in India. In his Report 1947, Aeneas stated: ''The Indian Church is now alive to her missionary responsibilities in this land and is heartily in favor of the new proposals, but the task is out of all proportion to her present resources, and it is only if the Church of Scotland continues her support in personnel and in finances that it can be accomplished. For the Church as for the nation, it may be that a new day is dawning.''<ref>Report 1947: The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During A Momentous Year (1947), pamphlet, published Church of Scotland, 1947 – Centre for the Study of World Christianity Library, University of Edinburgh, Pamphlet – Reference: Pamphlet BV3280. B4. Chu</ref>

In 1948 after the handover, Aeneas sold his [[Cinchona]] plantation and other personal property and returned to the U.K. to join his wife in [[Edinburgh]], where they resided at 46 Belgrave Road. When Aeneas and Clara returned to Edinburgh for good they brought with them their pet chimpanzee named ‘Glyris,’ which lived with them at their home at Belgrave Road.

Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred married Jane Warhurst (née Smith) on 29 March 1950 at St. Aidan's Church, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Marriage announcement in ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, Thursday 30 March 1950, page 10.</ref> Jane is a second cousin once removed of the author [[David Herbert Lawrence]] through her mother Lillian Rex, whose sister Ada (née Rex), married George Beardsall.

==Later life==
Aeneas and Clara were both bilingual; Aeneas spoke eight languages fluently, including [[Hindi]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. In Edinburgh, Aeneas was Chaplain of Edinburgh Social Services Department from 1952 and was affiliated with several churches, including the former Stockbridge Free Church and [[St. Giles Cathedral]]. He was assistant Chaplain of [[HMP Edinburgh]] (Saughton) from 1948 to 1954. 
As a youngster, Aeneas grew up in a literary household (his father John Francon Williams was a newspaper and journal editor and a published writer of many books). As such, Aeneas was encouraged by his father to pursue writing. Throughout Aeneas's life, he had many books published in various fields of knowledge and was also a published poet. In 1942, upon the death of Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]], Aeneas was commissioned by [[Oxford University Press]] to write Dr. Graham's biography for inclusion in their ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]].''

Clara Anne Williams died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 January 1959 and is buried at [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.

After Clara passed away, Aeneas sold their house at Belgrave Road and spent time travelling the world, circumnavigating it several times. There is evidence contained in correspondence between Aeneas and the London publishing house [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan & Co. Ltd.]] that he wrote two books during these travels. His regular visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]], and especially [[Tasmania]] – where his daughter Beatrice lived in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] with her husband, Dr. Stephen Pugh, and their daughter Andrea<ref>Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh & family: North Isles Family History archive:
https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> – appear to have sparked his imagination. Original correspondence from Aeneas to [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] held at The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]] mentions two new manuscripts he had written relating to his travels that he'd submitted to the publishing house. Whether MacMillan or another company published these books is unclear from the letters, as the books identify with [[Australasia]] and may only have been published in that territory, or remained unpublished. The two books in question are ''Tasmanian Apples'' and ''Kiwiland''. The later work is possibly associated with the flightless [[Kiwi (bird)|Kiwi]] bird, which Aeneas had grown particularly fond of during his visits to [[New Zealand]]. ‘I fed these interesting flightless birds in Wellington Zoo,’ Aeneas writes keenly to MacMillan. He also fed the [[tuatara]], courtesy of his friend ‘the Superintendent Mr. Curtis,’ who told him where he could see the ‘pre-historic little tuatara, the only true Saurian left on this earth, whose ancestors were at least 3,000,000 years on this planet, long before we were.’<ref>Letters: Williams, Aeneas Francon ~ 1960–1961 ~ former ref: Second series: The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], Redlands Road, Reading, RG1 5EX: https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/special-collections/MAC_W.pdf</ref> Aeneas also mentions to his publisher that his friend Henry Kelly of the New Zealand Wildlife Department was arranging ‘to send us a live [[Kiwi (bird)|Kiwi]], the first Kiwi to be in Scotland.’<ref>''i-Newspaper'', 15 June 2018, page 18 – Manuscripts and Kiwis Scarce (Reader's Grandfather helped bring first Kiwi to Scotland) (retrieved 16 June 2018): https://www.pressreader.com/uk/i-newspaper/20180615</ref> After returning from his travels abroad, Aeneas moved into 10 Carlton Street, [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh|Stockbridge]], Edinburgh,<ref>The Church of Scotland Yearbook 1967, published 1966.

Aeneas died in [[Nether Edge Hospital]], [[Sheffield]] on 9 December 1971 and is buried with his wife Clara in [[Dean Cemetery]], [[Edinburgh]].

Aeneas Francon Williams is the brother of artist [[David Dougal Williams]] and the grandfather of writer Iain Cameron Williams.<ref>Iain Cameron Williams: http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4751.Iain_Cameron_Williams</ref><ref>Iain Cameron Williams World Catalogue: http://www.worldcat.org/title/underneath-a-harlem-moon-the-harlem-to-paris-years-of-adelaide-hall/oclc/51780394&referer=brief_results</ref>

A niece of Aeneas's named Jane Williams married American [[Edward Burton Hughes]]. In 1967, Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] appointed Edward Burton Hughes as Executive Deputy Commissioner of [[New York State Department of Transportation]]. In 1970, Edward Burton Hughes founded the ''E. Burton Hughes Achievement Award'' given annually to an outstanding Department employee of the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].<ref>''Spotlight Magazine'', 27 December 1973, page 16 – The ''E.
