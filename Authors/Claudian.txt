'''Claudius Claudianus''', known in English as '''Claudian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔː|d|i|ən}}; c. 370 – c. 404 AD), was a Latin poet associated with the court of the Roman emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] at [[Mediolanum]] (Milan), and particularly with the general [[Stilicho]].<ref>Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "[[wikisource:1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Claudianus,_Claudius|Claudianus, Claudius]]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. '''6.''' (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. pp. 463-464.</ref> His work, written almost entirely in [[dactylic hexameter|hexameters]] or [[elegiac couplets]], falls into three main categories: poems for Honorius, poems for Stilicho, and [[classical mythology|mythological]] epic.<ref>Gian Biagio Conte, ''Latin Literature: A History''  (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, originally published 1987 in Italian), p. 658.</ref>

==Life==
Claudian was born in [[Alexandria]]. He arrived in Rome in 394 and made his mark as a court poet with a [[eulogy]] of his two young [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons]], [[Anicius Probinus|Probinus]] and [[Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius|Olybrius]], consuls of 395.<ref>Roberts, Michael. “Rome Personified, Rome Epitomized: Representations of Rome in the Poetry of the Early Fifth Century.” ''The American Journal of Philology'', vol. 122, no. 4, 2001, p. 533.</ref> He wrote a number of [[panegyric]]s on the [[consul]]ship of his patrons, praise poems for the deeds of Stilicho, and [[invective]]s directed at Stilicho's rivals in the Eastern court of [[Arcadius]].

Little is known about his personal life, but it seems he was a convinced pagan: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] refers to him as the 'adversary of the name of Christ' (''[[The City of God|Civitas Dei]]'', V, 26), and [[Orosius|Paul Orosius]] describes him as an 'obstinate pagan' (''paganus pervicassimus'') in his ''Adversus paganos historiarum libri septem'' (VII, 55).

He was well rewarded for his political engagement. In fact, he was granted the rank of ''[[vir illustris]]''. The [[Roman Senate]] honored him with a statue in the [[Roman Forum]] in 400.<ref>Conte, ''Latin Literature,'' p. 658.</ref> Stilicho's wife, [[Serena (wife of Stilicho)|Serena]], secured a rich wife for him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Ancient Epic|last=Barnes|first=Michael H.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=978-1405188388|editor-last=Foley|editor-first=John Miles|pages=541|chapter=Claudian}}</ref>

Since none of Claudian's poems record the achievements of [[Stilicho]] after 404, scholars assume Claudian died in that year. His works don't give an account of the [[sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]], while the writings of [[Olympiodorus of Thebes]] has been edited and made known only in few fragments, which begin from the death of [[Stilicho]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Katie Lynn|last1=Sass|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/PDF/677551503.pdf|format=pdf|title=Alaric: King of Visigoths and Tool of Romans|page=2|date=January 1, 2012|oclc=855973352|access-date=June 28, 2021|publisher=Marquette University}}</ref>

==As poet==
Although a native speaker of [[ancient Greek language|Greek]], Claudian is one of the best Latin poetry stylists of [[late antiquity]]. He is not usually ranked among the top tier of Latin poets, but his writing is elegant, he tells a story well, and his polemical passages occasionally attain an unmatchable level of entertaining vitriol. The literature of his time is generally characterized by a quality modern critics find specious, of which Claudian's work is not free, and some find him cold and unfeeling.

Claudian's poetry is a valuable historical source, though distorted by the conventions of panegyric. The historical or political poems connected with Stilicho have a manuscript tradition separate from the rest of his work, an indication that they were likely published as an independent collection, perhaps by Stilicho himself after Claudian's death.

His most important non-political work is an unfinished [[Epic poetry|epic]], ''De raptu Proserpinae'' ("The Abduction of [[Proserpina]]"). The three extant books are believed to have been written in 395 and 397. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, Claudian has not been among the most popular Latin poets of antiquity, but the epic ''De raptu'' influenced painting and poetry for centuries.<ref>Andrew D. Radford, ''The Lost Girls: Demeter-Persephone and the Literary Imagination, 1850–1930'' (Editions Rodopi, 2007), p. 22 ''et passim''.</ref>
