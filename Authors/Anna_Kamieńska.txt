'''Anna Kamieńska''' (12 April 1920 in [[Krasnystaw]] – 10 May 1986 in [[Warsaw]]) was a Polish poet, writer, translator and literary critic who wrote many books for children and adolescents.

==Life==
Kamieńska was born on 12 April 1920, in [[Krasnystaw]]. Her parents were Tadeusz Kamienski  and Maria z Cękalskich.  Her early years were spent in [[Lublin]]. She frequently stayed with her grandparents in [[Świdnik]].

Her father died early, so the burden of bringing up four daughters fell on her mother.  Anna's first poetry was composed when she was about 14 (1936), published in "[[Płomyczek]]" under the auspices of Joseph Czechowicz.  From 1937, she studied at the Pedagogical School in Warsaw. During the Nazi occupation, she lived in Lublin, and taught in underground village schools.  After graduating from college in Lublin, she studied classical philology - initially at the [[Catholic University of Lublin]], and then at the [[University of Lodz]].

Kamienska was affiliated with the cultural weekly ''Country'', where she was an editor from 1946 -1953, and the weekly ''New Culture'' (poetry editor, 1950-1963), and a monthly ''Work'' (from 1968). In the mid-fifties, she began to write songs for youth.

In 1948, she married poet and translator [[Jan Śpiewak]]. Together they had two sons: Jan Leon (1949-1988 - a journalist, publicist, writer, social activist) and [[Pawel Spiewak|Paweł]] (born in 1951, professor of sociology at the [[University of Warsaw]], and member of the [[Sejm]], 2005 -2007).

Anna and Jan worked together on translations of Russian poetry and drama, and edited numerous books. In 1967, Jan suddenly fell ill with cancer and died 22 December. In her grief, Kamieńska returned to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which deeply influenced her later works.

She died in [[Warsaw]] on 10 May 1986.

==Work==

She wrote fifteen books of poetry, two volumes of "Notebooks", providing a shorthand record of her readings and self-questioning, three volumes of commentaries on the Bible, and translations from several [[Slavic languages]] as well as from [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Her poems record the struggles of a rational mind with religious faith, addressing loneliness and uncertainty in a direct, unsentimental manner.  While exploring the meaning of love and grief, and the yearning for love, Kamienska's poetry still expresses a quiet humor and a pervasive sense of gratitude for human existence and for a myriad of creatures, hedgehogs, birds, and "young leaves willing to open to the sun". {{citequote|date=November 2009}}

Kamienska's poems also touch on [[Judaism]], and the total loss of Jewish culture and the [[Yiddish language]] from Poland as a result of [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]].<ref>''Scripta Judaica Cracoviensia'', vol. 8 - Page 93 ed. Edward Dąbrowa "The Polish poet Anna Kamieńska (1920–1986), who wrote the moving poem .. ... hoped in the following verses, which also depict the total destruction of the world of Polish Jewry, for a time to come in which the murdered Yiddish language would be heard and sung again: "No trace has remained, / Not a word on a stone, "</ref>
