'''Saunders Lewis''' (born '''John Saunders Lewis''') (15 October 1893 – 1 September 1985) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] political activist, poet, dramatist, historian and literary critic. He was a prominent [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh nationalist]] and one of the founders of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (the National Party of Wales), later known as [[Plaid Cymru]]. Lewis is usually acknowledged as one of the most prominent figures of 20th century Welsh-language literature. In 1970, Lewis was nominated for a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Lewis was voted the tenth greatest Welsh hero in the '[[100 Welsh Heroes]]' poll, released on [[St. David's Day]] 2004.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3523363.stm Bevan is ultimate Welsh hero] extracted 12-04-07</ref>

==Early life==
John Saunders Lewis was born into a Welsh family living in [[Wallasey]], England, on 15 October 1893. He was the second of three sons of Lodwig Lewis (1859–1933), a [[Calvinistic Methodist]] minister, and his wife Mary Margaret (née Thomas, 1862–1900). Lewis attended [[Liscard]] High School for Boys<ref name=DWB>{{cite web|last1=Chapman|first1=T. Robin|title=Lewis, John Saunders|url=https://biography.wales/article/s10-LEWI-SAU-1893|website=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|access-date=19 May 2018|date=2014}}</ref> and went on to study [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] at [[Liverpool University]].

==First World War==
When the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out, Lewis enlisted as a volunteer with the [[King's Liverpool Regiment]] in September 1914, and in April 1915 applied for a commission with the [[South Wales Borderers]] and was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|full lieutenant]] in February 1916. He served in France and was wounded in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].<ref name="Alien Face">{{Cite episode |title=Saunders Lewis: Alien Face In The Mirror |series=Writ‌ing On The Line  |first=Gwyn A. |last=Williams |author-link=Gwyn A. Williams |network=[[Channel 4]] |date=1993}}</ref>

During the war, Lewis read the series of novels ''[[The Cult of the Self]]'' (French: ''Le Culte du moi'') by the French writer [[Maurice Barrès]]. Barrès, a [[French nationalist]], heavily influenced Lewis' own [[Welsh nationalism]].<ref name="Alien Face"/>

== Return to Wales ==
In 1922, he was appointed as lecturer in Welsh literature at the [[University of Wales, Swansea|University College of Wales, Swansea]]. During his time at Swansea he produced some of his most significant works of literary criticism: ''A School of Welsh Augustans'' (1924), ''[[William Williams Pantycelyn|Williams Pantycelyn]]'' (1927), and ''{{lang|cy|{{ill|Braslun o hanes llenyddiaeth Gymraeg|cy}}}}'' (An outline history of Welsh literature) (1932).<ref name="Kendall2007">{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=Tim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09LB6-dYwCUC&pg=PA342|title=The Oxford Handbook of British and Irish War Poetry|date=22 February 2007|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-928266-1|page=342}}</ref> He continued in this post until his dismissal for a political act of arson at Penyberth, Gwynedd, in 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/saunders-lewis/|title=BBC - Saunders Lewis}}</ref>

==Founding Plaid Cymru==
Discussions of the need for a "Welsh party" had been conducted since the 19th century.<ref>{{harvp|Davies|1994a|pp=415, 454}}</ref> With the generation or so before 1922 there "had been a marked growth in the constitutional recognition of the Welsh nation," wrote historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]].<ref>{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=544}}</ref> By 1924 there were people in Wales "eager to make their nationality the focus of Welsh politics."<ref name="harvp|Davies|1994a|p=547">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=547}}</ref> Lewis's experiences in [[World War I]], and his sympathy for the cause of [[Irish War of Independence|Irish independence]], brought him to Welsh nationalism.

In 1924, Lewis founded ''{{lang|cy|Y Mudiad Cymreig}}'' ("The Welsh Movement") with a small group of fellow nationalists. The group met secretly for the first time in Penarth on 7 January 1924.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://plaidpenarth.blogspot.com/2013/12/penarths-secret-role-in-welsh-history.html|title=PENARTH'S SECRET ROLE IN WELSH HISTORY|date=5 December 2013|website=Plaid Cymru Penarth}}</ref> The group continued to meet in secret throughout 1924 and began drawing up a set of aims and policies intended to "rescue Wales from political and cultural oblivion."

At around the same time as Lewis formed ''{{lang|cy|Y Mudiad Cymreig}}'', another group of nationalists formed ''{{lang|cy|Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru}}'' ("The Welsh Home Rule Army") in Caernarfon.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://historypoints.org/index.php?page=site-of-plaid-cymrus-founding-pwllheli|title=Site of Plaid Cymru's founding, Pwllheli|website=History Points}}</ref> The group was led by [[Huw Robert Jones]], who made contact with Lewis in early 1925 and proposed to form a new political party.<ref name=":1" /> 
[[File:Penblwydd Plaid Cymru Anniversary - geograph.org.uk - 644944.jpg|thumb|A plaque was inaugurated to mark the 75th anniversary of Plaid Cymru's founding meeting in 2000, on the building where the meeting took place in Pwllheli.]]

Lewis met with Jones, [[Lewis Valentine]], Moses Griffith, Fred Jones and D. Edmund Williams in a café called Maes Gwyn<ref name=":2" /> during the 1925 [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[Pwllheli]], [[Gwynedd]], with the aim of establishing a "Welsh party".<ref name="harvp|Davies|1994a|p=547" /> They founded ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' ("National Party of Wales"), on 5 August 1925.<ref name="Ailgeni">{{harvp|Morgan|2002|p=206}}</ref> The principal aim of the party would be to foster a Welsh speaking Wales.<ref name="Davies_548">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=548}}</ref> To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members sever all links with other British parties.<ref name="Davies_548" /> Lewis insisted on these principles before he would agree to the Pwllheli conference.

According to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of the total population of Wales spoke Welsh as a primary language.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1911.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020726/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1911.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}</ref> This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 54.4% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1891.shtml BBCWales history extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609021026/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1891.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}</ref> With these pre-requisites, Lewis condemned "'Welsh nationalism' as it had hitherto existed, a nationalism characterized by inter-party conferences, an obsession with [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] and a willingness to accept a subservient position for the Welsh language," wrote Davies.<ref name="Davies_548"/> It may be because of these strict positions that the party failed to attract politicians of experience in its early years.<ref name="Davies_548"/> However, the party's members believed its founding was an achievement in itself; "merely by existing, the party was a declaration of the distinctiveness of Wales," wrote Davies.<ref name="Davies_548"/>

==The Lewis Doctrine 1926–1939==
During the inter-war years, ''Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru'' was most successful as a social and educational pressure group rather than as a political party.<ref name="Davies_591">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=591}}</ref> For Saunders Lewis, party president 1926 – 1939, "the chief aim of the party [is] to 'take away from the Welsh their sense of inferiority... to remove from our beloved country the mark and shame of conquest.'" Lewis sought to cast ''Welshness'' into a new context, wrote Davies.<ref name="Davies_591"/>

Lewis wished to demonstrate how Welsh heritage was linked as one of the 'founders of European civilization.<ref name="Davies_591"/> Lewis, a self-described "strong [[Monarchism|monarchist]]", wrote "Civilization is more than an abstraction. It must have a local habitation and name. Here its name is Wales."<ref name="Davies_591"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm |title=Royal plans to beat nationalism |work=[[BBC News]] |date=8 March 2005 |access-date=28 August 2012}}</ref> Additionally, Lewis strove for the stability and well-being of Welsh-speaking communities, decried both capitalism and socialism and promoted what he called ''{{lang|cy|perchentyaeth}}'': a policy of "[[distributism|distributing property among the masses]]".<ref name="Davies_591"/>

Lewis was, in fact, ill-equipped to lead any party, or indeed even convince his immediate colleagues of his theories. Historian Geraint H. Jenkins writes:- "..Lewis was a cold fish. His reedy voice, bow tie, cerebral style and aristocratic contempt for the proletariat were hardly endearing qualities in a political leader, and his conversion to Catholicism lost him the sympathy of fervent Nonconformists. Heavily influenced by the discourse of right-wing French theorists, this profoundly authoritarian figure developed a grand strategy, such as it was, based on the deindustrialization of Wales. Such a scheme was both impractical and unpopular. It caused grave embarrassment to his socialist colleague D.&nbsp;J. Davies, a progressive economist who, writing with force and passion, showed a much better grasp of the economic realities of the time and greater sensitivity towards the plight of working people.<ref>{{harvp|Jenkins|2007}}</ref>

==Broadcasting==

Saunders Lewis perceived the early development of BBC radio broadcasting in Wales (which was almost entirely in English) as serious threat to his aim of arresting the decline of the Welsh language (then down to 36%) and turning Wales back into a 100% Welsh-speaking nation. At the same time he also recognised that if he could exert influence and pressure on the BBC, the Corporation could become a useful tool to serve Plaid Cymru's political ends. In 1929 he declared it would soon be necessary to arrange for "thousands of Welshmen to be prosecuted for refusing to pay for English programmes".<ref>Manchester Guardian 1 August 1929</ref> The following year Lewis was commissioned by E.R. Appleton, Director of the BBC's Cardiff radio station, (who had banned broadcasting in Welsh) to broadcast a talk which would "explain Welsh Nationalism". On vetting the script, which advocated political nationalism in preference to "cultural nationalism", Appleton decided it was too controversial and inflammatory to be broadcast.<ref name="Davies_BBC">{{harvp|Davies|1994b}}</ref> In October 1933 the University of Wales Council, which had been lobbying for more Welsh-language broadcasting, appointed a ten-man council to press the case with the BBC. It included [[David Lloyd George]], [[William R. P. George|William George]], [[William John Gruffydd|W.&nbsp;J. Gruffydd]] and Saunders Lewis – who was continuing to incense the BBC by publicly alleging it was "seeking the destruction of the Welsh language". The University Committee, which was described by BBC Director General [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] as "the most unpleasant and unreliable people with whom it has been my misfortune to deal" gained ever more influence on the BBC in Wales not least in the selection of BBC staff – a function delegated to the Committee by the Corporation. As newspapers of the time noted, appointees seemed primarily drawn from the families of the Welsh-speaking elite including "the son of a professor of Welsh and the offspring of three archdruids".<ref>{{harvp|Davies|1994b|pp=70–71}}</ref> Saunders Lewis's assiduous campaigning over the years was to succeed in cementing an ongoing Plaid Cymru influence within the BBC. When the BBC's Welsh Advisory Council was eventually established in 1946, although half its members were Labour, several Plaid Cymru supporters were appointed including Saunders Lewis's successor as Plaid Cymru president, [[Gwynfor Evans]].<ref name="Davies_BBC"/>

==''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'' 1936==

Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK Government settled on establishing an [[RAF]] training camp and aerodrome at [[Penyberth]]<ref>[[RAF Penrhos]]</ref> on the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] in [[Gwynedd]]. The events surrounding the protest, known as ''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'' ("Fire in Llŷn"), helped define ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}''.<ref name="Davies_593">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=593}}</ref> The UK Government settled on Llŷn as the site for its training camp after similar proposed sites in [[Northumberland]] and [[Dorset]] met with protests.<ref name="Davies_592">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=592}}</ref>

However, UK Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] refused to hear the case against building this 'bombing school' in Wales, despite a deputation representing 500,000 Welsh protesters.<ref name="Davies_592"/> Protest against the project was summed up by Lewis when he wrote that the UK Government was intent upon turning one of the "essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature" into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare.<ref name="Davies_592"/> Construction of this military academy began exactly 400 years after the first [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]] annexing Wales into England.<ref name="Davies_592"/>

On 8 September 1936, the building was set on fire and in the investigations which followed Saunders Lewis, [[Lewis Valentine]], and [[David John Williams|D.&nbsp;J. Williams]] claimed responsibility.<ref name="Davies_592"/> They were tried at Caernarfon, where the jury failed to agree on a verdict. The case was then sent to be retried at the [[Old Bailey]] in London, where the "Three" were convicted, and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. On their release from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], they were greeted as heroes by 15,000 Welsh people at a pavilion in [[Caernarfon]].<ref name="Davies_592"/>

[[File:Llosgi'r Ysgol Fomio - The Burning of the Bombing School - geograph.org.uk - 356846.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|cy|Llosgi'r Ysgol Fomio}}'': "The Burning of the Bombing School"]]

Many Welsh people were angered by the judge's scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty.<ref name="Davies_593"/> [[Dafydd Glyn Jones]] wrote of the fire that it was "the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock."<ref name="Davies_593"/>

However, despite the acclaim the events of ''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'' generated, by 1938 Lewis's concept of ''{{lang|cy|perchentyaeth}}'' ("home ownership") had been firmly rejected as ''not'' a fundamental tenet of the party. In 1939 Lewis resigned as ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' president, saying that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a Roman Catholic.<ref name="Davies_593"/>

Lewis was the son and grandson of prominent [[Presbyterian Church of Wales|Welsh Calvinistic Methodist]] ministers. In 1932, he had converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

==Second World War==
Lewis maintained a strict neutrality in his writings through his column ''{{lang|cy|Cwrs y Byd}}'' in ''{{lang|cy|Y Faner}}''. It was his attempt at an unbiased interpretation of the causes and events of the war.<ref name="Davies_599">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=599}}</ref>

Outside of the party's initial position on the war, party members were free to choose for themselves their level of support for the war effort. ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' was officially neutral regarding involvement the [[Second World War]], which Lewis and other leaders considered a continuation of the [[First World War]]. Central to the neutrality policy was the idea that Wales, as a nation, had the right to decide independently on its attitude towards war,<ref name="Davies_598">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=598}}</ref> and the rejection of other nations to force Welshmen to serve in their armed forces.<ref name="Davies_598"/> With this challenging and revolutionary policy Lewis hoped a significant number of Welshmen would refuse to join the [[British Army]].<ref name="Davies_599"/>

Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh nation "over the loyalty to the British State".<ref name="Davies_598"/> Lewis argued "The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist."<ref name="Davies_599"/>

However, most party members who claimed [[conscientious objection]] status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political policy.<ref name="Davies_599"/> Of these almost all were exempt from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole grounds for exemption, of whom 12 received prison sentences.<ref name="Davies_599"/> For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was "being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures".<ref name="Davies_599"/>

==University of Wales by-election, 1943==
Prior to 1950, universities could elect and return representatives to the House of Commons. The University of Wales seat had become vacant when the constituency's [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament, [[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], had been appointed a [[County Court (England and Wales)|county court]] judge in 1942. Lewis was selected to contest the seat for Plaid Cymru in the ensuing [[1943 University of Wales by-election]].

His opponent was former Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru Deputy Vice-President Dr [[William John Gruffydd]]. Gruffydd had been voicing doubts about Lewis's ideas since 1933,<ref name="Davies_610">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=610}}</ref> and by 1943 he had left Plaid Cymru and joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. His other opponent, independent candidate [[Alun Talfan Davies]], was another former member of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru who would later become Chairman of the [[Welsh Liberal Party]].

The "brilliant but wayward" Gruffydd was a favorite with Welsh-speaking intellectuals and drew 52.3% of the vote, to Lewis's 22.5%.<ref name="Davies_610" />

The election effectively split the Welsh-speaking intelligentsia, and left Lewis embittered with politics, leading him to retreat from direct political involvement.<ref name="Davies_611">{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=611}}</ref> However the experience proved invaluable for Plaid Cymru, as "for the first time they were taken seriously as a political force."<ref name="Davies_611" /> The by-election campaign led directly to "considerable growth" in the party's membership.<ref name="Davies_611" />

==''{{lang|cy|Tynged yr Iaith}}'' and the 1961 census==

In 1962 Lewis gave a radio speech entitled ''{{lang|cy|[[Tynged yr iaith]]}}'' ("The Fate of the Language") in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. Lewis's intention was to motivate Plaid Cymru into more direct action promoting the language; however it led to the formation of ''[[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]]'' (''Welsh Language Society'') later that year at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in [[Pontardawe]] in [[Glamorgan]].<ref>{{harvp|Morgan|2002}}</ref> The foundation of ''{{lang|cy|Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg}}'' allowed Plaid Cymru to focus on electoral politics, while the Cymdeithas focused on promoting the language.

Lewis's radio speech was in response to the 1961 census, which showed a decrease in the percentage of Welsh speakers from 36% in 1931 to 26%, of the population of about 2.5 million.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1961.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1961.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}</ref> In the census the counties of Meirionnydd (Merionethshire), Ynys Môn (Anglesey), Caerfyrddin (Carmarthenshire), and Caernarfon (Caernarvonshire) averaged a 75% proportion of Welsh speakers, with the most significant decreases in the counties of [[Glamorgan]], [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], and [[Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1931.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020655/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1931.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}</ref>

Responding to calls for Welsh devolution, in 1964 the [[Labour government, 1964–1970|Labour Government]] established the [[Welsh Office]] ({{lang-cy|Swyddfa Gymreig}}) and [[Secretary of State for Wales]].

==Nobel nominee==
In 1970, Lewis was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His literary works include plays, poetry, novels and essays. He wrote mostly in Welsh, but he also wrote some works in English. By the time of his death in 1985 some rated him as amongst the most celebrated of Welsh writers.

==Political criticisms==
Lewis's perceived "elitist" views, "and a "condescending attitude towards some aspects of the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]], radical and pacifist traditions of Wales" drew criticism from fellow nationalists such as [[David James Davies|D.&nbsp;J. Davies]], a leftist party member.<ref name="Davies_591"/> Davies argued in favour of engaging English-speaking Welsh communities, and stressed the territorial integrity of Wales. Davies pointed towards [[Scandinavia]]n countries as a model to emulate, and was active in the economic implications of Welsh self-government.<ref>{{harvp|Davies|1994a|pp=591–592}}</ref>

In many ways it was D.&nbsp;J. Davies's ideal of Welsh nationalism which was adopted after the Second World War, wrote John Davies. But it was Lewis's "brilliance and charismatic appeal" which was firmly associated with ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' in the 1930s.<ref name="Davies_592"/>

In 1936, in the midst of the turmoil of ''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'', Lewis praised [[Adolf Hitler]] when he said "At once he fulfilled his promise — a promise which was greatly mocked by the London papers months before that — to completely abolish the financial strength of the Jews in the economic life of Germany."<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011205/halltext/11205h02.htm United Kingdom Parliament]: Debate on ''[[Government of Wales Act 1998]]''. Retrieved 31 August 2006.</ref>

In 2001 [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]], himself a former Plaid Cymru President, declared in a television documentary on Lewis that he was "lousy as a politician, lousy as a writer, but a good Catholic".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2001/08/05/plaid-founder-blasted-91466-11220176/ |title=Plaid founder blasted |date=26 March 2013 |access-date=16 March 2016 |publisher=[[WalesOnline]]}}</ref>

==Literary activity==
Lewis was above all a dramatist. His notable plays include ''{{lang|cy|Blodeuwedd}}'' (The woman of flowers) (1923–25, revised 1948), ''{{lang|cy|[[Buchedd Garmon]]}}'' (The life of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]) (radio play, 1936), ''{{lang|cy|[[Siwan (play)|Siwan]]}}'' (1956), ''{{lang|cy|Gymerwch chi sigarét?}}'' (Will you have a cigarette?) (1956), ''{{lang|cy|Brad}}'' (Treachery) (1958), ''Esther'' (1960), and ''{{lang|cy|Cymru fydd}}'' (Tomorrow's Wales) (1967). He also translated [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''{{lang|fr|[[En attendant Godot]]}}'' from French into Welsh. His plays drew on a wide range of material and covered a range of subject matter including [[Welsh mythology]] and history, as well as the Bible, although he also wrote plays set in contemporary Wales.

Lewis wrote the [[libretto]] for [[Arwel Hughes]]'s opera ''{{lang|cy|Serch yw'r doctor}}'' (Love’s the doctor), based on [[Molière]]'s ''{{lang|fr|[[L'Amour médecin]]}}'' (first performance 1960 by [[Welsh National Opera]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Serch yw'r Doctor (Love's the Doctor)|url=http://operadata.stanford.edu/catalog/10114788|work=Opening Night! Opera & Oratorio Premieres|publisher=Stanford University Library|access-date=16 May 2014}}</ref>

He published two novels, ''[[Monica (Saunders Lewis)|Monica]]'' (1930) and ''{{lang|cy|Merch Gwern Hywel}}'' (The daughter of Gwern Hywel) (1964) and two collections of poems as well as numerous articles and essays in various newspapers, magazines and journals. These articles have been collected into volumes including: ''{{lang|cy|Canlyn Arthur}}'' (Following Arthur) (1938), ''{{lang|cy|Ysgrifau dydd Mercher}}'' (Wednesday essays) (1945), ''{{lang|cy|Meistri'r canrifoedd}}'' (Masters of the centuries) (1973), ''{{lang|cy|Meistri a'u crefft}}'' (Masters and their craft) (1981) and ''{{lang|cy|Ati ŵyr ifainc}}'' (Go to it, young men) (1986).

==Honorary doctorate and demand for Latin mass==
In March 1983, at the age of 89, Saunders Lewis was made an honorary Doctor of Letters of the University of Wales at a ceremony specially conducted at his home in [[Penarth]]. The [[Catholic Herald]], reporting the honour, noted that in the previous year Lewis had made a plea for Mass to be said in Latin in Wales rather than in the "foreign language of English", which he pointed out was "a later arrival".<ref>The Catholic Herald 4 March 1983</ref>
