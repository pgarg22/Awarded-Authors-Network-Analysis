'''Decimius Magnus Ausonius'''<ref>Olli Salomies, "The Nomenclature of the Poet Ausonius", ''Arctos'' 50 (2016), pp. 133–142</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|s|oʊ|n|i|ə|s}}; {{circa|lk=no|310}} &ndash; c. 395) was a [[Latin literature|Roman poet]] and [[Education in ancient Rome|teacher]] of  [[classical rhetoric|rhetoric]] from [[Burdigala]] in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]], modern [[Bordeaux]], [[France]]. For a time he was tutor to the future emperor [[Gratian]], who afterwards bestowed the [[Roman consul|consulship]] on him. His best-known poems are ''Mosella'', a description of the river [[Moselle]], and ''Ephemeris'', an account of a typical day in his life. His many other verses show his concern for his family, friends, teachers, and circle of well-to-do acquaintances and his delight in the technical handling of [[poetic meter|meter]].

==Biography==
Decimius Magnus Ausonius was born {{circa|lk=no|310}} in [[Burdigala]], the son of Julius Ausonius (c. AD 290–378), a [[Roman medicine|physician]] of [[ancient Greeks|Greek]] ancestry,<ref>Harvard Magazine, Harvard Alumni Association, University of Michigan, p.2</ref><ref name= Kenney>The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, Edward John Kenney, Cambridge University Press, p.16</ref> and Aemilia Aeonia, daughter of Caecilius Argicius Arborius, descended on both sides from established, land-owning [[Gallo-Roman]] families of southwestern [[Gaul]].<ref name="Kenney"/> Ausonius was given a strict upbringing by his aunt and grandmother, both named Aemilia. He received an excellent education at Bordeaux and at Toulouse, where his maternal uncle, [[Aemilius Magnus Arborius]], was a professor. Ausonius did well in grammar and rhetoric, but professed that his progress in [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] was unsatisfactory. When his uncle was summoned to Constantinople to tutor one of the sons of emperor [[Constantine I]], Ausonius accompanied him to the capital.

Having completed his studies, he trained for some time as an advocate, but he preferred teaching. In 334 he became a ''grammaticus'' (instructor) at a school of rhetoric in Bordeaux, and afterwards a ''rhetor'' or professor. His teaching attracted many pupils, some of whom became eminent in public life. His most famous pupil was the poet [[St. Paulinus of Nola|Paulinus]], who later became a [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Bishop of Nola]].

After thirty years of this work Ausonius was summoned by emperor [[Valentinian I]] to teach his son, [[Gratianus|Gratian]], the heir-apparent. When Valentinian took Gratian on the German campaigns of 368–9, Ausonius accompanied them. Ausonius was able to turn literary skill into political capital. In recognition of his services emperor Valentinian bestowed on Ausonius the rank of [[quaestor]]. His presence at court gave Ausonius the opportunity to connect with a number of influential people. In 369 he met [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]]; their friendship proved mutually beneficial.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8z027_xmsIC&q=Ausonius#v=snippet&q=Ausonius&f=false Trout, Dennis E., ''Paulinus of Nola: Life, Letters, and Poems'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 33] {{ISBN|9780520922327}}</ref>

Gratian liked and respected his tutor, and when he himself became emperor in 375 he began bestowing on Ausonius and his family the highest civil honors. That year Ausonius was made Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, campaigned against the [[Alemanni]] and received as part of his booty a slave-girl, [[Bissula]] (to whom he addressed a poem), while his father, though nearly ninety years old, was given the rank of Prefect of Illyricum.

In 376 Ausonius's son, [[Decimius Hilarianus Hesperius|Hesperius]], was made [[proconsul]] of Africa. In 379 Ausonius was awarded the [[consulate]], the highest Roman honor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 383 the army of Britain, led by [[Magnus Maximus]], revolted against [[Gratian]] and assassinated him at Lyons; and when emperor [[Valentinian II]] was driven out of Italy, Ausonius retired to his estates near [[Burdigala]] (now Bordeaux) in Gaul.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} When [[Magnus Maximus]] was overthrown by emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 388, Ausonius did not leave his country estates. They were, he says, his ''nidus senectutis'', the "nest of his old age", and there he spent the rest of his days, composing poetry and writing to many eminent contemporaries, several of whom had been his pupils. His estates supposedly included the land now owned by [[Château Ausone]], which takes its name from him.

Ausonius appears to have been a late and perhaps not very enthusiastic convert to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He died about 395.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His grandson, [[Paulinus of Pella]], was also a poet; his works attest to the devastation which Ausonius's Gaul would face soon after his death.

==Some characteristics of his works==

Although admired by his contemporaries, the writings of Ausonius have not since been ranked among [[Latin literature]]'s finest. His style is easy and fluent, and his ''Mosella'' is appreciated for its evocation of the life and country along the river [[Moselle]]; but he is considered derivative and unoriginal.  [[Edward Gibbon]] pronounced in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' that "the poetical fame of Ausonius condemns the taste of his age."<ref>Note 1 to chapter XXVII</ref> However, his works have several points of interest; for example:

1. his references to [[wine]]making, frequently cited by historians as early evidence of large-scale [[viticulture]] in the now-famous wine country around his native [[Bordeaux]].

2. his contribution to the ''[[carpe diem]]'' topic (if the following poem is indeed his):
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|Collige, virgo, rosas, dum flos novus et nova pubes
et memor esto aevum sic properare tuum.}}
|attr1=Epigrammata: «Rosae» 2:49|
Gather, girl, roses while the flower is fresh and fresh is youth,
remembering that your own time is hurrying on.}}

3. his somewhat unique ''Cento Nuptialis'',<ref>translated as ''A Nuptial Cento'' by H.G. Evelyn-White for [[Loeb Classical Library]]</ref> in which he fulfils an imperial commission to compose an [[epithalamium]] using the "love is war" trope<ref>See, for example, the discussion in ''[https://www.purplemotes.net/2019/01/13/ausonius-proba/ Ausonius and Proba on “love is war” and brutalizing men’s sexuality]'' (retrieved, 1 July 2020).</ref> by writing it in the form of a [[cento (poetry)|cento]] (in other words, a [[wiktionary:mashup|mashup]]) lifting lines from [[Vergil]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|Itque reditque viam totiens {{!}} uteroque recusso
transadigit costas {{!}} et pectine pulsat eburno.
Iamque fere spatio extremo fessique sub ipsam
finem adventabant: {{!}} tum creber anhelitus artus
aridaque ora quatit, sudor fluit undique rivis,
labitur exsanguis, {{!}} destillat ab inguine virus.}}
|
Back and forth he plies his path and, the cavity reverberating,
thrusts between the bones, and strikes with ivory quill.
And now, their journey covered, wearily they neared
their very goal: then rapid breathing shakes his limbs
and parched mouth, his sweat in rivers flows;
down he slumps bloodless; the fluid drips from his groin.}}

==Saw mill==
[[File:Römische Sägemühle.svg|thumb|250px|Scheme of a water-driven [[Hierapolis sawmill|Roman sawmill at Hierapolis]], Asia Minor. The 3rd century mill is the earliest known machine to incorporate a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] mechanism.<ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2000, 161">{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}</ref>]]
His writings are also remarkable for mentioning, in passing, the working of a [[water mill]] sawing marble on a tributary of the [[Moselle]]:
 
{{quote|text=....renowned is [[Kyll|Celbis]] for glorious fish, and that other, as he turns his mill-stones in furious revolutions and drives the shrieking saws through smooth blocks of marble, hears from either bank a ceaseless din...}}

[[File:Sutters_mill.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Modern reconstruction of Sutter's Mill, a water-powered 19th century Californian sawmill.]]
The excerpt sheds new light on the development of [[Roman technology]] in using water power for different applications. It is one of the rare references in [[Roman literature]] to water mills used to cut stone, but is a logical consequence of the application of water power to mechanical sawing of stone (and presumably wood also). Earlier references to the widespread use of mills occur in [[Vitruvius]] in his'' [[De Architectura]]'' of circa 25 BC, and the'' [[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] published in 77 AD. Such applications of mills were to multiply again after the fall of the Empire through the [[Middle Ages]] into the modern era. The mills at [[Barbegal]] in southern [[France]] are famous for their application of water power to grinding grain to make flour and were built in the 1st century AD. They consisted of 16 mills in a parallel sequence on a hill near [[Arles]].

The construction of a saw mill is even simpler than a flour or grinding mill, since no gearing is needed, and the rotary saw blade can be driven direct from the water wheel axle, as the example of [[Sutter's Mill]] in California shows. However, a different mechanism is shown by the sawmill at [[Hieropolis]] involving a frame saw operated through a crank and connecting rod.
