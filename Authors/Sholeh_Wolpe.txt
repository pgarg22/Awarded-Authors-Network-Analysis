She attended [[George Washington University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in Radio/TV/Film.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} Followed by studies at [[Northwestern University]] and received a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in Radio/TV/Film and [[Johns Hopkins University]] and received a [[Master of Health Science|MHS]] in [[Public health|Public Health]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The [[Poetry Foundation]] has written that “Wolpé’s concise, unflinching, and often wry free verse explores violence, culture, and gender. So many of Wolpé’s poems deal with the violent situation in the Middle East, yet she is ready to both bravely and playfully refuse to let death be too proud.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/sholeh-wolpe |title=Sholeh Wolpé |publisher=Poetry Foundation |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>

Wolpe's literary translations have garnered several prestigious awards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rothendowment.org/award-alumni/wolpe-sholeh/|title=Sholeh Wolpe|work=The Lois Roth Endowment|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pen.org/penheim-translation-fund-grant-recipients/|title=PEN/Heim Translation Fund Grant Recipients - PEN America|website=pen.org|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref> Wolpé was named a 2020–2021 "Cultural Trailblazer" by the [[City of Los Angeles]], Department of Cultural Affairs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cultural Trailblazers 2020-2021|url=https://culturela.org/programs-and-initiatives/cultural-trailblazers-2020-2021/|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Department of Cultural Affairs|language=en-US}}</ref> She is a Writer-In-Residence at [[University of California, Irvine]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Faculty|url=https://www.humanities.uci.edu/complit/people/visiting.php|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Department of Comparative Literature, [[University of California, Irvine]]}}</ref> and lives in Los Angeles, California.

==Literary career==
A recipient of 2014 PEN/Heim Translation Fund grant, 2014 Hedgebrook Residency, the 2013 Midwest Book Award, and 2010 Lois Roth Persian Translation prize, Wolpé literary work includes five collections of poetry, four books of translations, three anthologies and several plays.

Her play ''The Conference of the Birds'' (world premiere Ubuntu Theater, November 30, 2018) is an adaptation of 12th Century Sufi mystic [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]]'s epic poem. Her play SHAME was a 2016 [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]]'s National Playwright conference semifinalist, and she was one of ten Centenary Stage Women Playwrights Series finalists in 2016.

Wolpé’s first collection, ''The Scar Saloon'', was lauded by Billy Collins as “poems that cast a light on some of what we all hold in common.”<ref name="redhen1">{{cite web|url=http://redhen.org/book/?uuid=96B0A6B5-7936-18FD-0D13-E872C22972CB |title=The Scar Saloon |author=Sholeh Wolpe |website=Redhen.org |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> Poet and novelist Chris Abani called the poems "political, satirical, and unflinching in the face of war, tyranny and loss ... they transmute experience into the magic of the imagined."<ref name="redhen1"/>

The poems in Wolpé’s second collection, ''[[Rooftops of Tehran (poetry collection)|Rooftops of Tehran]]'', were called by poet Nathalie Handal “as vibrant as they are brave,” and Richard Katrovas wrote that its publication was a “truly rare event: an important book of poetry.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redhen.org/book/?uuid=71FF2796-33BA-E2EB-C77D-A105410A0E9D |title=Rooftops of Tehran |author=Sholeh Wolpe |website=Redhen.org |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>

Wolpé’s translations of the Iranian poet [[Forugh Farrokhzad]]’s selected work, ''Sin'', was awarded the Lois Roth Persian Translation Award in 2010. The judges wrote that they “found themselves experiencing Forugh’s Persian poems with new eyes.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rothendowment.org/award-alumni/wolpe-sholeh/ |title=Sholeh Wolpe » The Lois Roth Endowment |website=Rothendowment.org |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> Alicia Ostriker praised the translations as “hypnotic in their beauty and force.” Willis Barnstone found them “extravagantly majestic,” and of such order that “they resurrect Forugh.”<ref name="uapress1">{{cite web|author=In Middle East Studies and Poetry |url=http://www.uapress.com/dd-product/sin/ |title=Sin |website=Uapress.com |date=2010-09-01 |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>

Sholeh Wolpé and [[Mohsen Emadi]]’s translations of [[Walt Whitman]]’s "[[Song of Myself]]" (آواز خويشتن) were commissioned by the University of Iowa’s International Program. They are currently on University of Iowa’s Whitman website and will be available in print in Iran.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iwp.uiowa.edu/whitmanweb/fa/section-1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026151440/http://iwp.uiowa.edu/whitmanweb/fa/section-1 |archive-date=2012-10-26 }}</ref>

[[Robert Olen Butler]] lauded Wolpé's anthology, ''Breaking the Jaws of Silence'' as “a deeply humane and aesthetically exhilarating collection.”<ref name="uapress2">{{cite web|url=http://www.uapress.com/dd-product/breaking-the-jaws-of-silence/ |title=Breaking the Jaws of Silence |website=Uapress.com |date=2013-02-01 |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> Wolpé's 2012 anthology, ''The Forbidden: Poems from Iran and Its Exiles'', a recipient of the 2013 Midwest Book Award, includes many of Wolpé’s own translations, and was called by American poet Sam Hamil a “most welcome gift” that “embraces and illuminates our deepest human bonds and hopes.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/msu-press-honored-with-midwest-book-award/ |title=MSU Press honored with Midwest Book Award &#124; MSUToday &#124; Michigan State University |website=Msutoday.msu.edu |date=2013-05-16 |access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>

Wolpé’s modern translation of ''The Conference of the Birds'' by the 12th Century Iranian Sufi mystic poet "[[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]]", was lauded by PEN lauded as an “artful and exquisite modern translation.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pen.org/poetry/conference-birds|title=The Conference of the Birds {{!}} PEN America|website=pen.org|access-date=2016-06-26}}</ref> About the book, [[W. W. Norton & Company|W.W. Norton & Co]] writes: "Wolpé re-creates the intense beauty of the original Persian in contemporary English verse and poetic prose, fully capturing for the first time the beauty and timeless wisdom of Attar’s masterpiece for modern readers."

In 2019 Wolpé began a collaboration with composer Fahad Siadat and choreographer Andre Megerdichian for an oratorio, The Conference of the Birds, based on Sufi mystic poet Attar's work.

Wolpe's poems and translations have been set to music by American composer Shawn Crouch, Iranian composers [[Niloufar Nourbakhsh]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-01|title=Opera|url=https://niloufarnourbakhsh.com/listen/opera/|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Nilou Nour {{!}} Composer Pianist|language=en}}</ref> and  [[Sahba Aminikia]]<ref>''Rhyme by Rhyme,'' Sahba Aminikia (composer) Commissioned by Amaranth Quartet to be premiered at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington D.C. as part of Shenson Chamber Music series on May 8, 2019.
