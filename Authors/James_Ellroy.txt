'''Lee Earle "James" Ellroy''' (born March 4, 1948) is an American [[crime fiction|crime fiction writer]] and [[essayist]]. Ellroy has become known for a telegrammatic [[prose style]] in his most recent work, wherein he frequently omits connecting words and uses only short, [[staccato]] sentences,<ref name = "Miller">{{Cite news

==Life and career==
Ellroy was born in [[Los Angeles, California]]. His mother, Geneva Odelia (née Hilliker), was a nurse. His father, Armand, was an accountant and a onetime business manager of [[Rita Hayworth]].<ref>{{cite web

His first reaction upon hearing of her death was relief: he could now live with his father, whom he preferred.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blott |first1=Chris |title=Shooting at shadows |url=https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/1995-02-24/11/ |publisher=The List |access-date=3 July 2019 |date=24 February 1995}}</ref> The police never found the perpetrator, and the case remains unsolved. The murder, along with reading ''The Badge'' by [[Jack Webb]] (a book comprising sensational cases from the files of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], a birthday gift from his father), were important events of Ellroy's youth.<ref name="Murder by the Book" /><ref name="Dark">{{cite book|last=Ellroy|first=James|title=[[My Dark Places (book)|My Dark Places]]|publisher=Knopf|year=1996|location=New York|isbn=0-679-44185-9}}</ref>

Ellroy's inability to come to terms with the emotions surrounding his mother's murder led him to [[transference|transfer]] them onto another murder victim, [[Elizabeth Short]]. Nicknamed the "Black Dahlia," Short was a young woman murdered in 1947, her body cut in half and discarded in Los Angeles, in a notorious and unsolved crime. Throughout his youth, Ellroy used Short as a surrogate for his conflicting emotions and desires.<ref name="Murder by the Book" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/summer/ellroy-mother-dahlia/|date= Summer 2006|access-date=May 7, 2007|last=Ellroy|first=James|title=My Mother and the Dahlia|work=[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]}}</ref> His confusion and trauma led to a period of intense [[clinical depression]], from which he recovered only gradually.<ref name="Murder by the Book" /><ref name="Dark"/>

Ellroy dropped out of school and joined the [[United States Army|US Army]] for a short while. During his teens and 20s, he drank heavily and abused [[Propylhexedrine#Recreational use|Benzedrex inhalers]].<ref name="Desert Island Discs">''Desert Island Discs'' Interview, BBC Radio 4, January 17, 2010</ref> He was engaged in minor crimes<ref name="auto4">{{cite web|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/02/james-ellroy-hollywood-interview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202105932/http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/02/james-ellroy-hollywood-interview.html |title=Great Conversations: James Ellroy |first1=Alex |last1=Simon |archive-date= February 2, 2017 |date=April 2001 |work=thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com |access-date=February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (especially shoplifting, house-breaking, and burglary) and was often homeless.

In 1981, Ellroy published his first novel, ''[[Brown's Requiem (novel)|Brown's Requiem]]'', a detective story drawing on his experiences as a caddie.<ref>{{cite book

Ellroy followed these three novels with the [[Lloyd Hopkins Trilogy]]. The novels are centered on Hopkins, a brilliant but disturbed LAPD robbery-homicide detective, and are set mainly in the 1980s.

Ellroy describes it as a "direct, shorter-rather-than-longer sentence style that's declarative and ugly and right there, punching you in the nards."<ref name="Onion"/> This signature style is not the result of a conscious experimentation but of chance and came about when he was asked by his editor to shorten his novel ''[[L.A. Confidential]]'' by more than one hundred pages. Rather than removing any subplots, Ellroy abbreviated the novel by cutting every unnecessary word from every sentence, creating a unique style of prose.<ref name="auto1"/>  While each sentence on its own is simple, the cumulative effect is a dense, [[baroque]] style.<ref name = "Timberg"/>

{{main|L.A. Quartet}}

While his early novels earned him a cult following and notice among crime fiction buffs, Ellroy earned much greater success and critical acclaim with the [[L.A. Quartet]]''—[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'', ''[[The Big Nowhere]]'', ''[[L.A. Confidential]]'', and ''[[White Jazz]]''.<ref name = "Onion" /> The four novels represent Ellroy's change of style from the tradition of classic modernist [[noir fiction]] of his earlier novels to what has been classified as [[postmodern]] [[historiographic metafiction]].<ref>{{cite book

===Underworld USA Trilogy===
{{main|Underworld USA Trilogy}}
In 1995, Ellroy published ''[[American Tabloid]]'', the first novel in a series informally dubbed the "[[Underworld USA Trilogy]]"<ref name = "Salon"/> that Ellroy describes as a "secret history" of the mid-to-late 20th century.<ref name = "Onion"/> ''Tabloid'' was named ''[[Time magazine|TIME]]''{{'}}s [[fiction]] book of the year for 1995. Its follow-up, ''[[The Cold Six Thousand]]'', became a bestseller.<ref name = "Salon"/> The final novel, ''[[Blood's a Rover]]'', was released on September 22, 2009.

===''My Dark Places''===
After publishing ''American Tabloid'', Ellroy began a [[memoir]], ''[[My Dark Places (book)|My Dark Places]]'', based on his memories of his mother's murder, the unconventional relationship he had with her, and his investigation of the crime.<ref name="Dark"/> In the memoir, Ellroy mentions that his mother's murder received little [[News media (United States)|news coverage]] because the media were still fixated on the stabbing death of mobster [[Johnny Stompanato]], who was dating actress [[Lana Turner]]. [[Frank C. Girardot]], a reporter for ''[[The San Gabriel Valley Tribune]]'', accessed files on Geneva Hilliker Ellroy's murder from detectives with Los Angeles Police Department.<ref name="Dark"/> Based on the [[cold case (criminology)|cold case]] file, Ellroy and investigator Bill Stoner worked the case but gave up after 15 months, believing any suspects to be dead.<ref name="Dark"/> After the final pages of ''My Dark Places'', a contact page is provided, stating: "The investigation continues. Information on the case can be forwarded to Detective Stoner either through the toll-free number, 1-800-717-6517, or his e-mail address, detstoner@earthlink.net."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellroy |first1=James |title=My Dark Places: An L.A.

=== Future writings ===
Ellroy is currently writing a "Second L.A. Quartet" taking place during the [[Second World War]], with some characters from the first ''L.A. Quartet'' and the ''Underworld USA Trilogy'' reappearing in younger depictions. The first book, ''[[Perfidia (James Ellroy novel)|Perfidia]]'', was released on September 9, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/second-la-quartet-william-heinemann.html|title=Second LA Quartet to William Heinemann}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://venetianvase.co.uk/2010/12/06/ellrovian-prose/|title=Ellrovian Prose|work=The Venetian Vase|date=6 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://venetianvase.co.uk/2009/12/17/james-ellroy-to-write-second-la-quartet/|title=James Ellroy to Write Second LA Quartet|work=The Venetian Vase|date=17 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="auto3">{{cite web|url=http://www.thechannels.org/features/2012/11/29/the-channels-interviews-james-ellroy/ |title=James Ellroy interview|first=Emerson|last=Malone|date=November 29, 2012|work=The Channels|access-date= February 2, 2017|publisher=Santa Barbara City College}}</ref> The second book is titled ''[[This Storm (Ellroy novel)|This Storm]]'' <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/Frankfurt-Book-Fair/article/71572-the-big-titles-u-s-agencies-will-be-selling-at-the-frankfurt-book-fair.html|title=The Big Titles U.S. Agencies Will be Selling at the 2016 Frankfurt Book Fair|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=May 16, 2017|language=en}}</ref> which had a release date of May 14, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/james-ellroy/this-storm.htm|title=This Storm at Fantastic Fiction}}</ref> It was released May 30, 2019, in the United Kingdom, and June 4, 2019 in the United States.

A [[Waterstones]] exclusive limited edition of ''Perfidia'' was published two days after its initial release and included an essay by Ellroy titled "Ellroy's History — Then and Now"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/james%20ellroy/perfidia%20-%20waterstones%20exclusive%20edition/10289447/|title=Perfidia by James Ellroy - Waterstones|work=waterstones.com|access-date= February 2, 2017}}</ref><!-- retrieved 10 September 2014 -->.

The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] is "Envy thou not the oppressor, And choose none of his ways" from [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 3:31.

In collaboration with the Los Angeles Police Museum and Glynn Martin, the museum's [[executive director]], Ellroy released ''[[LAPD '53]]'' on May 19, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesellroy.net/book/lapd-53 |archive-date=2015-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520232454/http://www.jamesellroy.net/book/lapd-53 |title=LAPD '53 |work=James Ellroy |url-status=dead }}</ref> Photography from the museum's archives are presented alongside Ellroy's writings about crime and law enforcement during that era.

In the fall of 2017, Ellroy investigated the murder of [[Sal Mineo]]. Reminiscent of how he investigated his mother's unsolved murder, Ellroy worked with Glynn Martin, an ex-LAPD officer, the LAPD Museum's current executive director, and co-author of ''LAPD '53''. Ellroy wrote about this investigation for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in digital form on December 21, 2018, and it also appeared in published form in the December 18th, 2018 issue of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ellroy |first1=James |title=James Ellroy: Cracking the Case of Murdered Actor Sal Mineo |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/investigation-murder-sal-mineo-1169880 |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= April 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102053619/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/investigation-murder-sal-mineo-1169880 |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |date=December 21, 2018}}</ref>

==Public life and views==
In media appearances, Ellroy has adopted an outsized, stylized public persona of hard-boiled [[nihilism]] and self-reflexive subversiveness.<ref name = "Onion"/> He frequently begins public appearances with a monologue such as:

<blockquote>Good evening peepers, prowlers, pederasts, panty-sniffers, punks and pimps. I'm James Ellroy, the demon dog with the hog-log, the foul owl with the death growl, the white knight of the far right, and the slick trick with the donkey dick. I'm the author of 16 books, masterpieces all; they precede all my future masterpieces. These books will leave you reamed, steamed and drycleaned, tie-dyed, swept to the side, true-blued, tattooed and bah fongooed. These are books for the whole fuckin' family, if the name of your family is Manson.<ref>{{cite web| last = Guillen| first = Michael | title = NOIR CITY 6—James Ellroy Intro to Dalton Trumbo Doublebill|publisher = The Evening Class| date = January 28, 2008

Another aspect of his public persona involves an almost comically grand assessment of his work and his place in literature. For example, he told the ''[[New York Times]]'', "I am a master of fiction. I am also the greatest crime novelist who ever lived. I am to the crime novel in specific what [[Tolstoy]] is to the Russian novel and what [[Beethoven]] is to music."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Solomon| first = Deborah| title = The Mother Load: Questions for James Ellroy| newspaper = [[New York Times Magazine]]|date = November 5, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/magazine/05wwln_q4.html}}</ref>

Ellroy has frequently espoused [[conservative]] political views, which have ranged from a vague anti-[[liberalism]] to [[authoritarianism]].<ref name="Onion"/> In an October 15, 2009, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Ellroy said that in the 1960s and 1970s "I was never a peacemaker; I was a fuck-you right-winger." He has also been an outspoken and unquestioning admirer of the Los Angeles Police Department (despite his explicit depictions of brutality, corruption and Machiavellian bureaucratic  scheming in the LAPD that appear in some of his works), and he dismisses the department's flaws as aberrations, telling the ''[[National Review]]'' that the coverage of the [[Rodney King]] beating and [[LAPD Rampart Division|Rampart police scandals]] were overblown by a [[Media bias|biased media]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Dunphy| first = Jack|title = Ellroy Confidential|newspaper = National Review| date = November 15, 2005| url = http://www.nationalreview.com/dunphy/dunphy200511150827.asp| access-date = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, like other aspects of his persona, he often deliberately obscures where his public persona ends and his actual views begin. When asked about his "right-wing tendencies," he told an interviewer, "Right-wing tendencies? I do that to fuck with people."<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite news | last = Woods | first = Sean | title = James Ellroy's American apocalypse: The master of modern noir has completed an epic secret history of America — a trilogy so dark that he lost his mind writing it | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/james-ellroys-american-apocalypse-20091015 | work = Rolling Stone | date = October 15, 2009 | pages = 60–63 }}</ref> Similarly, in the film ''Feast of Death,'' his (now ex-) wife describes his politics as "bullshit," an assessment to which Ellroy responds only with a knowing smile.<ref name = "Feast"/> Privately, Ellroy opposes the [[death penalty]] and [[gun control]] (he owns more than 30 guns).<ref>{{cite news |last = Duncan| first = Paul (editor)| title = Call Me Dog| work = The Third Degree: Crime Writers in Conversation| publisher = No Exit Press| year = 1997| location = Harpenden, Great Britain   }}</ref>  In a 2009 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', he discussed the contemporary political environment:

<blockquote>I thought [[George W. Bush|Bush]] was a slimeball and the most disastrous American president in recent times. I voted for [[Barack Obama|Obama]]. He's a lot like [[John F. Kennedy|Jack Kennedy]]—they both have big ears and infectious smiles. But Obama is a deeper guy. Kennedy was an appetite guy. He wanted pussy, hamburgers, booze. Jack did a lot of dope.<ref name=RollingStone/></blockquote>

Ellroy has subsequently denied voting for Obama and admitted that most of his statements on modern politics are willful misrepresentations.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_OPLt8gY4 "James Ellroy on why he denies the modern world"], ''Overheard with Evan Smith'', November 5, 2014. YouTube video.</ref>

Structurally, several of Ellroy's books, such as ''The Big Nowhere'', ''L.A. Confidential'', ''American Tabloid'', and ''The Cold Six Thousand'', have three disparate [[point of view (literature)|points of view]] through different characters, with chapters alternating between them. Starting with ''The Black Dahlia'', Ellroy's novels have mostly been historical dramas about the relationship between corruption and law enforcement.<ref name = "Dahlia" />

A predominant theme of Ellroy's work is the myth of "closure". "Closure is bullshit",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/1110/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309211255/http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/1110/ |archive-date= 9 March 2010 |title=CLOSURE IS BULLSHIT: AN INTERVIEW WITH JAMES ELLROY |author=Tony DuShane |work=filmthreat.com |access-date= February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ellroy often remarks, "and I would love to find the man who invented closure and shove a giant closure plaque up his ass."<ref>{{cite web| last = McFarland| first = Melanie|title = Why James Ellroy Will Never Be Asked to Host Masterpiece Theater| work = TV Gal| publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer| date = January 11, 2006| url = http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/archives/101072.asp|access-date = March 13, 2009}}</ref>  In his works characters often die or vanish quickly before otherwise traditional closure points in order to capitalize this idea.

Ellroy has claimed that he is done writing noir crime novels.<ref name="auto4"/> "I write big political books now," he says. "I want to write about LA exclusively for the rest of my career. I don't know where and when."<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Hannah| title = James Ellroy, I'm an LA Guy| publisher = GreenCine| date = September 15, 2006| url = http://www.greencine.com/article?action=view&articleID=332| access-date = March 13, 2009| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607092212/http://www.greencine.com/article?action=view&articleID=332| archive-date = June 7, 2011}}</ref>

On April 29, 2015, Ellroy and [[Lois Duncan]] were the Grandmasters at the 2015 [[Edgar Award]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theedgars.com/nominees.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223225727/http://www.theedgars.com/nominees.html |title=Edgar Award Nominees |archive-date=23 February 2015 |work=TheEdgars.com |access-date= February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Film adaptations and screenplays==
Several of Ellroy's works have been adapted to film, including ''[[Blood on the Moon (novel)|Blood on the Moon]]'' (adapted as ''[[Cop (film)|Cop]]''), ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', ''[[Brown's Requiem (film)|Brown's Requiem]]'', ''[[Killer on the Road]]/Silent Terror'' (adapted as ''[[Stay Clean]]''), and ''[[The Black Dahlia (film)|The Black Dahlia]]''. In each instance, screenplays based on Ellroy's work have been penned by other screenwriters.

While he has frequently been disappointed by these adaptations (such as ''Cop''), he was very complimentary of [[Curtis Hanson]] and [[Brian Helgeland]]'s screenplay for ''L.A. Confidential'' at the time of its release.<ref>{{cite video| people = Curtis Hanson (Director)
|title = L.A. Confidential| publisher = Warner Home Video DVD|date = 1998}}</ref> In succeeding years, however, his comments have been more reserved:

{{quote|
''L.A. Confidential'', the movie, is the best thing that happened to me in my career that I had ''absolutely nothing to do with''. It was a fluke—and a wonderful one—and it is ''never going to happen again''—a movie of that quality.

Here's my final comment on ''L.A. Confidential'', the movie:  I go to a video store in [[Prairie Village, Kansas]]. The youngsters who work there know me as the guy who wrote ''L.A. Confidential''. They tell all the little old ladies who come in there to get their G-rated family flick. They come up to me, they say, "OOOO… you wrote ''L.A. Confidential''.... Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful movie. I saw it four times. You don't see storytelling like that on the screen anymore." ... I smile, I say, "Yes, it's a wonderful movie, and a salutary adaptation of my wonderful novel. But listen, Granny:  You love the movie. ''Did you go out and buy the book''?" And Granny invariably says, "Well, no, I didn't." And I say to Granny, "Then ''what the fuck good are you to me?''"<ref name="Feast"/>}}

Of the released film, Ellroy told the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], "Look, you're not going to get me to say anything negative about the movie, so you might as well give up."<ref name="Timberg"/> He had, however, mocked the film's director, cast, and production design before it was filmed.<ref name="auto"/>

Ellroy co-wrote the original screenplay for the 2008 film ''[[Street Kings]]'' but refused to do any publicity for the finished film.<ref name="Timberg"/>

In 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' reported that [[HBO]], along with [[Tom Hanks]]'s production company, [[Playtone]], was developing ''American Tabloid'' and ''The Cold Six Thousand'' for either a miniseries or ongoing series.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Fleming| first = Michael| title = 'Tabloid' news for HBO| newspaper = Daily Variety| date = September 18, 2008| url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-186382844.html}}</ref> In a 2009 interview, Ellroy himself stated, "All movie adaptations of my books are dead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chuckpalahniuk.net/interviews/authors/james-ellroy|title=You're digging it, right? James Ellroy interview|last=Conley|first=Stephen|publisher=Chuckpalahniuk.net|access-date=February 25, 2010}}</ref>

In a 2012 interview, when asked about how movie adaptations distort his books, he remarked, "[Film studios] can do whatever the f–k they want as long as they pay me."<ref name="auto3"/>

In an October 13, 2017, interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' Tom Hanks stated he would be interested in playing the part of Lloyd Hopkins if a film or stage adaptation was put into production.<ref>[http://nyti.ms/2g9oN3i "Tom Hanks: By the Book"], ''The New York Times'', October 13, 2017.</ref>
