== Works ==

=== ''Spook's'' ===
{{Main|Spook's}}
''Spook's'' (published in America as ''The Last Apprentice'') follow Tom Ward, the seventh son of a seventh son, on his adventures as apprentice to John Gregory, the local "Spook" or master fighter of supernatural evil. John is the Spook for "the County" and gives Tom practical instruction on tackling ghosts, ghasts, witches, boggarts, and all manner of other things that serve "The Dark". Tom soon discovers that most of his predecessors have failed for various reasons—including death. As the ''Chronicles'' progress the focus expands to other characters such as the assassin Grimalkin and the young witch Alice Deane.

==== ''The Wardstone Chronicles'' ====
Overall the first series' arc, titled ''The Wardstone Chronicles'', develops the plot line of Tom being destined to either save the world or destroy it. "The County" referred to in the ''Chronicles'' is based on [[Lancashire]] in the north west of England. Several of the locations mentioned in the books are thinly-veiled versions of actual places; Priestown is the author's hometown of Preston, Caster is [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], Black Pool is [[Blackpool]], and Chipenden is [[Chipping, Lancashire|Chipping]].<ref name=":0" />
