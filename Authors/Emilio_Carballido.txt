This was followed by a huge number of plays, including ''Un pequeño día de ira'' (1961), which earned him the [[Casa de las Américas Prize]], ''¡Silencio Pollos pelones, ya les van a echar su maíz!'' (1963), ''Te juro Juana que tengo ganas'' (1965), ''Yo también hablo de la rosa'' (1965), ''Acapulco los lunes'' (1969), ''Las cartas de Mozart'' (1974), and the box office hit ''Rosa de dos aromas'' (1986).

In addition to more than a hundred plays and scripts, he also wrote two volumes of short stories and nine novels, and worked randomly as a stage director.

His career in the Mexican film industry began with the script for ''La torre de marfil'', written in collaboration with [[Luisa Josefina Hernández]] in 1957. In 1972 he received two [[Premio Ariel|Ariels]] for the storyline and script of [[Alfonso Arau]]'s ''El Águila Descalza''.
