'''Jan Nepomuk Neruda''' (Czech: [[Help:IPA for Czech|[ˈjan ˈnɛpomuk ˈnɛruda]]]; 9 July 1834 – 22 August 1891<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://katalog.ahmp.cz/pragapublica/permalink?xid=12DEBA2D745C48CA961A532F8E94D49E&scan=213#scan213|title=Matriculation record of the Death and Funeral|website=katalog.ahmp.cz}}</ref>) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] journalist, writer, poet and art critic; one of the most prominent representatives of [[Literary realism|Czech Realism]] and a member of the "[[May School]]".

==Early life==
[[File:Jan Neruda.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A young Neruda<br /> (date unknown)]]
Jan Neruda was born in [[Prague]], [[Bohemia]];  son of a small grocer who lived in the [[Malá Strana]] district. Initially, they lived on  Újezd Street and later, when he was four, moved to Ostruhová Street (now called {{ill|Nerudova Street|cs|Nerudova (Praha)}}, in his honor), where they owned a house known as “U Dvou Slunců” (At the Two Suns).

His studies began in 1845 at the local Grammar school then, in 1850, continued at the Academic Grammar School in [[Clementinum]]. His favourite writers at the time were [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Karel Hynek Mácha]] and [[Václav Bolemír Nebeský]].

After graduation he tried to study law, but he failed. He worked as a clerk for a short time, but was unhappy, so he  decided to study [[philosophy]] and [[philology]] at [[Charles University]]. He then worked as a teacher until 1860, when he became a [[freelance]] journalist and writer.

He started his career at  ''[[Národní listy]]'' (National Sheets). Later, he worked for ''Obrazy života'' (Pictures of Life) and ''{{ill|Čas|cs|Čas (časopis)}}'' (Time). He also contributed to ''{{ill|Květy|cs|Květy (časopis)}}''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lexikon české literatury: osobnosti, díla, instituce..|last=HAMAN|first=Aleš|year=2000|location=Prague|pages=493–502}}</ref> (Blossoms) and ''[[Lumír]]''.

He became the de facto leader of a generation of writers that included  [[Karolina Světlá]], [[Vítězslav Hálek]], [[Adolf Heyduk]] and [[Karel Sabina]]; devoted to continuing the legacy of Karel Hynek Mácha. They published their works in the literary almanac ''[[Máj (literary almanac)|Máj]]''.

By 1871, various groups had labeled Neruda as a "Traitor to the Nation", so he decided to spend  some time away; visiting [[Italy]], [[Greece]], France, [[Germany]], [[Hungary]] and [[Egypt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ireferaty.cz/100/4260/Neruda-Jan|title=Neruda Jan|website=ireferaty.cz}}</ref> He kept detailed records of these journeys, which provide  an interesting testimony to his life and times, with various insights that prove him to be a good observer.

From 1883 to his death he lived on Vladislavova Street, 1382/14 in [[New Town, Prague|Nové Město]], Prague.

==Personal life==
Neruda was a loner and an introvert, although he was a friend of composer [[Bedřich Smetana]].

Neruda never married, but he had close relationships with Anna Holinová and [[Karolina Světlá|Karolína Světlá]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesky-jazyk.cz/zivotopisy/jan-neruda.html#axzz4hWoWXTZI|title=Jan Neruda|website=cesky-jazyk.cz}}</ref>

Holinová was his first love. Many of his poems were meant for her. Through her father, Neruda was able to meet [[Božena Němcová]] and [[Karel Jaromír Erben]], famous Czech nationalist writers.

His second love was Světlá, a married woman who was also a writer. They supported each other emotionally with their works. She also supported him financially. When he found himself deeply in debt, she sold a precious brooch and lent him the money. Unfortunately her husband, {{ill|Petr Mužák|cs}},  found out about it and forced him to give up the relationship. He also had to give him all the letters they had written to each other. These letters became the source for the movie called ''Příběh lásky a cti'' (The Story of Love and Honor). Throughout his life, the poet had been in material need, although he was an extremely prolific and respected journalist. Once a week, for example, he wrote a column for the National Papers, worked as a theater officer and literary critic, and edited several popular science journals.

He had a close relationship with his mother. Her death in 1869 greatly affected him and brought a sadder tone to his works.

==Career==

In his work, Neruda supported the [[Czech National Revival]] and promoted [[Czech nationalism]]. He participated in all the central cultural and political struggles of his generation, and gained a reputation as a sensitive critic. Neruda became, along with [[Vítězslav Hálek]], one of the most prominent representatives of the new literary trends.

==Death==
[[Image:Jan Neruda grave Vysehrad Cemetery Prague CZ 807.jpg|right|thumb|Neruda's grave.]]
Beginning in 1880, he suffered from a swelling  of his veins, which contributed to a number of diseases that afflicted him for the rest of his life. In the  winter of 1888, he shattered his kneecap when he slipped on some ice. From that time on, he relied on messengers to deliver his articles to ''[[Národní listy]]''.

He died on August 22, 1891, from an  inflammation of his digestive tract caused by [[intestinal cancer]].

He was buried at [[Vyšehrad Cemetery]] in Prague. His funeral became the occasion for an expression of Czech nationalist sentiment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lexikon české literatury: osobnosti, díla, instituce|last=HAMAN|first=Aleš|year=2000|location=Prague|pages=493–502}}</ref>

== Works ==

=== Poetry ===
*''[[Hřbitovní kvítí|Hřbitovní kvít<u>í</u>]]'' (“Graveyard Flowers”) - His first poetry. It was published in 1858. The entire book is pessimistic, skeptical and hopeless. [[Verse (poetry)|Verse]]s are growing out of disappointment with contemporary life, societies, the inactivity of the Nation, resistance of the set morality. There is also a social issue, dealing with [[poverty]]. He does not trust love or people. Feelings of loneliness, fervor.
*''[[Knihy veršů]]'' (“Books of Verses”)- published in 1867. He moderates his pessimism, finds the point of his life - at work and sacrifice to the whole [[Nation]]. It shows love for his parents.This book is much more readable than other books, the poems are of good quality. Even here we find his gloomy social [[ballad]]s. This book consists of three parts: 1. [[Kniha veršů výpravných]] (“Book of Narrative Verses”), 2. [[Kniha veršů lyrických a smíšených]] (“Book of Lyrical and Mixed Verses”) 3. [[Kniha veršů časových a příležitostných]] (“Book of Time and Occasional Verses”).
*''[[Písně kosmické]]'' (“Cosmic songs”) - published in 1878. In this books he is again discovering the meaning of his life, trying to be optimistic, responding to the development of science and technology. It celebrates cosmic bodies and human [[desire]] for knowledge. There is a materialistic understanding of the world. This work expresses feelings of the Generation called [[Májovci]].
*''[[Balady a romance]]'' ("Ballads and Romances)" - published between 1878 and 1883. He confuses ballads with romances so that they often sound like the opposites. The ballads often process national themes from the [[Bible]] or old legends, and the subject of mother-son relationships appears. Some of the favourite ballads or romances are for example [[Romance štědrovečerní]] (“Christmas Romance”), [[Romance o Karlu IV.]] (“Romance about Charles IV.”), [[Balada česká]] (“Czech Ballad”) or [[Balada o duši K.H.Borovského|Balada o duši K. H. Borovského]] (“Ballad about the soul of [[Karel Havlíček Borovský|K. H. Borovský]]”).
*''[[Prosté motivy]]'' ("Plain Themes / Simple Motifs") - published in 1883. This is his intimate diary. Natural theme is really important here. The human life coincides with a cycle of seasons. [[Spring (season)|Spring]] = youth, [[summer]] = maturity, [[autumn]] = old age, [[winter]] = death. He describes this period.
*''[[Zpěvy páteční]]'' ("Friday Songs") - published in 1896. This is his top work. This book came out after his death, prepared by [[Jaroslav Vrchlický]]. The life of the nation is compared to the Great Fate, showing the belief that the resurrection will come. It speaks of great love for the nation and reflects on national history - it turns to [[Hussites|Hussitism]]. Parts of this book are [[V zemi kalichu]] (“In the country of the cup”), [[Anděl strážný]] (“Guardian angel”), [[Ecce homo and Láska]] (“Love”).

=== Prose ===
*''Arabesky''- This is his first prosaic book published in 1864. This is a set of short stories, whose core consists of stories from the late 1850s and early 1860s. In the forefront of these short stories there is no plot, but descriptive characteristics, reflection and dialogue. Significant is humor, irony, sarcasm. In the foreground there are peculiar figurines that are captured in contrast to the environment they are included in. These are people from the periphery that society has eliminated. Neruda uncovers their sad and tragic moments, presenting them as full-fledged, emotionally rich. This puts them in opposition to prejudice and a time of conventional view. Neruda uses his own experiences and familiar environments, gives readers only cuts from the lives of characters. Stories [[Měla Gusto!]]  and [[Za půl hodiny]] (“Within half an hour”) when sexual and erotic motifs appear at that time, they were added after Neruda's death.
*''[[Různí lidé]]'' (“Different People”) - Studies and pictures of the nature and fate of the people he met abroad.
*''Trhani''- A novel about [[railroad]] workers.
*''[[Pražské obrázky]]'' (“Pictures of Prague”) - This book captures the lives of the poor.
*''[[Povídky malostranské|Povídky malostránské]]'' (“Tales of the Lesser Quarter”) -This is his top prosaic work published in 1877. He created the picture of Prague's Lesser Quarter before 1848 on the basis of his own memories. Neruda's stories take the reader to its streets and yards, shops, churches, houses, and restaurants. It shows typical figures of Czech [[Bourgeoisie]]. With humor depicting their qualities, he criticizes local life. It uses the form of a novelistically integrated story, sometimes its narrative consists of a series of tiny shots of everyday life. Heroes are precisely characterized, each with a different expression. It was translated into English in 1957 by the novelist and mystery writer [[Ellis Peters]].
