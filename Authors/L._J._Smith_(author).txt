== Career ==
Smith began her career as an elementary school teacher,<ref name="vanity">{{cite journal|language=Italian|author=Laura Pezzino|title=''Twilight''? Non conosco (lit.: ''Twilight''?

Smith has said that she realized she wanted to be a writer sometime between kindergarten and first grade, "when a teacher praised a horrible poem I'd written",<ref>L.J. Smith Biography: [https://www.amazon.com/L.-J.-Smith/e/B000AQ3EMA/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0 amazon.com] Retrieved 2010-12-23.</ref> and she began writing in earnest in elementary school.<ref name="interview">Interview with Novelist L.J.

Her first book, ''The Night of the Solstice'', written during high school and college,<ref name= Booklist >{{cite web|url=http://www.ljanesmith.net/booklist.php|title=Booklist}}</ref> was published by [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] in 1987, followed by ''Heart of Valor'' in 1990. They sold poorly, as they were labeled for 9 to 11-year-olds and not for young adults, as Smith wanted.

''[[The Vampire Diaries (novel series)|The Vampire Diaries]]'' series was commissioned by Elise Donner, editor of [[Alloy Entertainment]] in 1990: Smith immediately wrote the scene when Elena, Bonnie and Meredith are decorating the gym and the heroine meets Damon (scene later included in the first novel), while, as for the other characters, she adapted those of ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'',<ref name="vanity" /> an adult book she was writing.  She chose the setting of ''The Vampire Diaries'' in Virginia because she has family there and was inspired by the small towns and lifestyles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookalicio.us/2009/03/an-interview-with-l-j-smith/|title=An interview with L.

Three [[trilogy|trilogies]] followed: ''[[The Secret Circle]]'' (1992), ''[[The Forbidden Game (novel)|The Forbidden Game]]'' (1994) and [[Dark Visions Trilogy|''Dark Visions'']] (1995). The first installment of ''[[Night World]]'' series was published in 1996, followed by eight more over the next two years.<ref>[http://www.iblist.com/author10603.htm L.J.

In 1998, Smith began a decade-long hiatus from writing, returning in 2008 with a new website and a series of new short stories. ''The Vampire Diaries'' series was reissued in 2007, followed by reprintings of ''The Secret Circle'' trilogy and ''Night World'' series in 2008–2009.<ref>[http://ljs.insanitysandwich.com The L.J.

The final volume of ''The Vampire Diaries'' written entirely by Smith (''The Return: Midnight'') was released in March 2011. Smith submitted a draft of the next installment (''The Hunters: Phantom''), but after a dispute regarding a pivotal plot twist, her involvement was terminated by the publisher and the episode was revised by a [[ghostwriter]].<ref name="bookalicious">{{cite web|url=http://bookalicio.us/2011/05/interview-with-l-j-smith-part-duex/|title=Interview with L.J.
