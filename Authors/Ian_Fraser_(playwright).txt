'''Ian Fraser''' (born 18 April 1962) is a South African playwright, writer, comedian, anti-[[Apartheid]] activist, artist, anarchist, and social agitator, now living in the USA. He began as South Africa's first street-level comedian, "[[ranting-verse]]" poet, and acerbic anti-government satirist. He has consistently been a pro-democracy, anti-establishment voice, both under [[Apartheid]] and under the new dispensation in South Africa.

Fraser has won many awards for his plays, including the 1992 [[Amstel Playwright of the Year Award]] and the 1992 Tonight-AA Life Vita Award for Comedy. His comedic work has been compared with that of Americans [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Bill Hicks]], and his dramatic writing to that of [[Charles Bukowski]], [[William Burroughs]], and [[Tom Stoppard]].  Critics characterised Fraser's work as alternatively swinging between brutality and violence, and delicacy, sensitivity and grace.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
  
Alongside his plays, Fraser also performed eight [[one-person show|"one-man"]] satire shows, primarily at the [[Grahamstown]] [[National Arts Festival]] in South Africa, Africa's largest Arts Festival.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Arthur, Thomas H. |author2=Arthur, Michael D. |title=The 1992 Grahamstown Festival[Revs.]| journal=South African Theatre Journal|volume= 7|issue=1|date= 1993|pages=88–103|doi=10.1080/10137548.1993.9688081 }}</ref> His works repeatedly won the coveted "Pick of the Fringe" award.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Biography==
Born Brent Haupt, Fraser did not finish high school or complete any formal training.  After being conscripted in the then [[South African Defence Force]], for a two-year period (1981–82), he began to write and perform his own material from 1985 onwards.

Fraser's experiences in the South African Defence Force provided much of the background for his first novel, published by Penguin Books (''My Own Private Orchestra'', {{ISBN|0-14-023050-5}}).  In 1994, he began writing as an Internet technology columnist for the Johannesburg daily newspaper, ''The Star''.  He later wrote a weekly "Fraser's Razor" column for the ''Mail and Guardian'' newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articleList.aspx?area=/insight/partners__frasers_razor/|title=''Frasers Razor'' newspaper columns|website=Mail and Guardian|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914065504/http://www.mg.co.za/articleList.aspx?area=%2Finsight%2Fpartners__frasers_razor%2F|archive-date=14 September 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

From 1994, he gradually became regarded as one of the leading [[voice-over]] talents in South Africa.  He was an official on-air "voice" for the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and their TV 2 channel. One of his popular TV ads for a hotel chain in South Africa (City Lodge) has emerged on [[YouTube]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC4oOrqhGGI "Lessons from the Boot of a Car by Reg Lascaris: City Lodge (Soggy pants) TV advert"]. YouTube.</ref>

Fraser was threatened with police and legal action because of one of his fictional blog postings, ''Killing the President''. This short work stands as one of the harshest satiric attacks ever on the ruling [[African National Congress]] government and Deputy President [[Jacob Zuma]]. The government was not amused, and only timely intervention by the Freedom of Expression Institute<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fxi.org.za/home/ |title=Maintaining and creating a safe space for freedom of expression in South Africa &#124; Freedom of Expression Institute |access-date=2014-12-14 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214080412/http://fxi.org.za/home/ |archive-date=14 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> on Fraser's behalf prevented charges of [[treason]] and [[sedition]].

In April 2006, Fraser relocated to the United States, where he is now a legal resident.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  He is writing novels and raising children.  The [[University of Wisconsin]]'s Oshkosh Theater,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwosh.edu/theatre/Theatre/ThSeas.html|website=Oshkosh Theater|title=Official Website}}</ref> staged ''Dogs of the Blue Gods''<ref>http://www.uwosh.edu/theatre/history</ref> and ''The Sugar Plum Fairy''<ref>http://www.uwosh.edu/theatre/history</ref> in early 2008.

He won the AcidTheatre's Freedom of Speech Monologue Competition 2007, in the UK, for ''Putting the Fun Back into School Shootings''. It was staged in Scotland in 2008, retitled for legal reasons, ''The Normal Sound of Architecture''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.gariochtheatrefestival.org.uk/gtf-2005-9.html |title = GTF 2005 - 9}}</ref>

The [[National English Literary Museum]] in Grahamstown, South Africa, contains a large collection of Fraser's papers and writings, as part of their collection of South African writers and playwrights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ru.ac.za/affiliates/nelm/|website=National English Literary Museum in South Africa|title=the museum maintains an extensive collection of Fraser's work, manuscripts, and clippings|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609095808/http://www.ru.ac.za/affiliates/nelm/|archive-date=9 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In July 2009, his ''Dogs of the Blue Gods'' play was staged at [[Brown University]] at Brown/Trinity Playwrights Repertory Theatre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://providence.thephoenix.com/arts/87218-three-ring-circus/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921235901/http://providence.thephoenix.com/arts/87218-three-ring-circus/ |archive-date=21 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
