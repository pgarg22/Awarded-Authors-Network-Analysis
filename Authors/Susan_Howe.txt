'''Susan Howe''' (born June 10, 1937) is an [[American poet]], scholar, essayist and critic, who has been closely associated with the [[Language poets]], among other poetry movements.<ref name="Poetry">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/susan-howe "Susan Howe"], The Poetry Foundation, Retrieved 24 December 2014.</ref> Her work is often classified as [[Postmodern]] because it expands traditional notions of genre ([[fiction]], [[essay]], [[prose]] and [[poetry]]). Many of Howe's books are layered with historical, mythical, and other references, often presented in an unorthodox format. Her work contains lyrical echoes of sound, and yet is not pinned down by a consistent metrical pattern or a conventional poetic rhyme scheme.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bamidele |first=Jeremy |title=Susan Howe and David Grubbs perform at Armado Hall |newspaper=34th Street Magazine|location=Philadelphia }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/susan-howe |title = Susan Howe|date = 2019-08-06}}</ref>

Howe is the recipient of the 2017 [[Robert Frost Medal]] awarded by the [[Poetry Society of America]], the recipient of the 2011 [[Bollingen Prize in American Poetry]], and a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].
