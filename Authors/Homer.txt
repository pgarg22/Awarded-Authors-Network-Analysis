'''Homer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|m|ər}}; {{lang-grc|Ὅμηρος}} {{IPA-grc|hómɛːros|}}, ''Hómēros'') was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] author and [[epic poetry|epic poet]]. He is the reputed author of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the two epic poems that are the foundational works of [[ancient Greek literature]]. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential writers of all time.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/summary/Homer-Greek-poet|title=Learn about Homer’s The Iliad and The Odyssey|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |access-date=31 August 2021}}</ref>

The ''Iliad'' is set during the [[Trojan War]], the ten-year siege of the city of [[Troy]] by a coalition of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] kingdoms. It focuses on a quarrel between King [[Agamemnon]] and the warrior [[Achilles]] lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The ''Odyssey'' focuses on the ten-year journey home of [[Odysseus]], king of [[Ithaca]], after the fall of Troy. Many [[ancient accounts of Homer|accounts of Homer's life]] circulated in [[classical antiquity]], the most widespread being that he was a blind [[bard]] from [[Ionia]], a region of central coastal [[Anatolia]] in present-day [[Turkey]]. Modern scholars consider these accounts [[legend]]ary.<ref name="LitList">

The [[Homeric Question]]&mdash;concerning by whom, when, where and under what circumstances the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were composed&mdash;continues to be debated. Some scholars consider that the two works were written by different authors.<ref name=":0" /> It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last1=Croally |first1=Neil |last2=Hyde |first2=Roy |title=Classical Literature: An Introduction |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1136736629 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-arAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 |language=en |year=2011 |access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref>

The poems are in [[Homeric Greek]], also known as Epic Greek, a [[literary language]] which shows a mixture of features of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hose |first1=Martin |last2=Schenker |first2=David |title=A Companion to Greek Literature |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1118885956 |page=445 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgBSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA445 |language=en |year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=D.

== Works attributed to Homer ==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Homer and his Guide (1874).jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Homer and His Guide'' (1874) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]

Today only the ''Iliad'' and ''the'' ''Odyssey'' are associated with the name 'Homer'. In antiquity, a very large number of other works were sometimes attributed to him, including the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]'', the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'', the ''[[Nostoi]]'', the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'', the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Epigoni (epic)|Epigoni]]'', the comic mini-epic ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ("The Frog-Mouse War"), the ''[[Margites]]'', the ''[[Capture of Oechalia]]'', and the ''[[Phocais]]''. These claims are not considered authentic today and were by no means universally accepted in the ancient world. As with the multitude of legends surrounding Homer's life, they indicate little more than the centrality of Homer to ancient Greek culture.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=Adrian D. |chapter=Homerica |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0606 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Graziosi |first1=Barbara |last2=Haubold |first2=Johannes |title=Homer: The Resonance of Epic |date=2005 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0715632826 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiDUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Graziosi |first1=Barbara |title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521809665 |pages=165–168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC |language=en}}</ref>

==Ancient biographical traditions==
{{details|Ancient accounts of Homer}}
Some ancient claims about Homer were established early and repeated often. They include that Homer was blind (taking as self-referential a passage describing the blind bard [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graziosi |first1=Barbara |title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521809665 |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC&pg=PA138 |language=en}}</ref><ref>Odyssey, 8:64ff.</ref>), that he was born in [[Chios]], that he was the son of the [[river Meles]] and the nymph [[Critheïs]], that he was a wandering bard, that he composed a varying list of other works (the "Homerica"), that he died either in [[Ios (island)|Ios]] or after failing to solve a riddle set by fishermen, and various explanations for the name "Homer" (Ὅμηρος : Hómēros).

The two best known ancient biographies of Homer are the ''[[Life of Homer (Pseudo-Herodotus)|Life of Homer]]'' by the Pseudo-Herodotus and the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lefkowitz |first1=Mary R. |title=The Lives of the Greek Poets |date=2013 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-1472503077 |pages=14–30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1H9xrMAkrcC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=Adrian D. |chapter=Biographies of Homer |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0243 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref>

In the early 4th century BC [[Alcidamas]] composed a fictional account of a poetry contest at Chalcis with both Homer and [[Hesiod]]. Homer was expected to win, and answered all of Hesiod's questions and puzzles with ease. Then, each of the poets was invited to recite the best passage from their work. Hesiod selected the beginning of ''[[Works and Days]]'': "When the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]] born of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] ... all in due season". Homer chose a description of Greek warriors in formation, facing the foe, taken from the ''[[Iliad]]''. Though the crowd acclaimed Homer victor, the judge awarded Hesiod the prize; the poet who praised [[husbandry]], he said, was greater than the one who told tales of battles and slaughter.<ref>{{cite book |last=West |first=M.

In 1488, the Greek scholar [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles]] published the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the Homeric poems.<ref name="Lamberton2010"/> The earliest modern Homeric scholars started with the same basic approaches towards the Homeric poems as scholars in antiquity.<ref name="Lamberton2010"/><ref name="West2011"/><ref name="Dickey2012"/> The allegorical interpretation of the Homeric poems that had been so prevalent in antiquity returned to become the prevailing view of the [[Renaissance]].<ref name="Lamberton2010"/> Renaissance humanists praised Homer as the archetypically wise poet, whose writings contain hidden wisdom, disguised through allegory.<ref name="Lamberton2010"/> In western Europe during the [[Renaissance]], [[Virgil]] was more widely read than Homer and Homer was often seen through a Virgilian lens.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Heiden |first1=Bruce |chapter=Scholarship, Renaissance through 17th Century |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1310 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref>

In 1664, contradicting the widespread praise of Homer as the epitome of wisdom, [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]] wrote a scathing attack on the Homeric poems, declaring that they were incoherent, immoral, tasteless, and without style, that Homer never existed, and that the poems were hastily cobbled together by incompetent editors from unrelated oral songs.<ref name="West2011"/> Fifty years later, the English scholar [[Richard Bentley]] concluded that Homer did exist, but that he was an obscure, prehistoric oral poet whose compositions bear little relation to the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' as they have been passed down.<ref name="West2011"/> According to Bentley, Homer "wrote a Sequel of Songs and Rhapsodies, to be sung by himself for small Earnings and good Cheer at Festivals and other Days of Merriment; the ''Ilias'' he wrote for men, and the ''Odysseis'' for the other Sex. These loose songs were not collected together in the Form of an epic Poem till [[Peisistratos|Pisistratus]]' time, about 500 Years after."<ref name="West2011"/>

[[Friedrich August Wolf]]'s ''Prolegomena ad Homerum'', published in 1795, argued that much of the material later incorporated into the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' was originally composed in the tenth century BC in the form of short, separate oral songs,<ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship">{{Cite book |last1=Heiden |first1=Bruce |chapter=Scholarship, 18th Century |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1311 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship">{{Cite book |last1=Heiden |first1=Bruce |chapter=Scholarship, 19th Century |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1312 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref name="West2011"/> which passed through oral tradition for roughly four hundred years before being assembled into prototypical versions of the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' in the sixth century BC by literate authors.<ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/><ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/><ref name="West2011"/> After being written down, Wolf maintained that the two poems were extensively edited, modernized, and eventually shaped into their present state as artistic unities.<ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/><ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/><ref name="West2011"/> Wolf and the "Analyst" school, which led the field in the nineteenth century, sought to recover the original, authentic poems which were thought to be concealed by later excrescences.<ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/><ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/><ref name="West2011"/><ref name="Taplin1986">{{cite book |last=Taplin |first=Oliver |author-link=Oliver Taplin |date=1986 |chapter=2: Homer |title=The Oxford History of the Classical World |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EloAAAAMAAJ&q=Homer |editor1-last=Boardman |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Griffin |editor2-first=Jasper |editor3-last=Murray |editor3-first=Oswyn |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0198721123 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofc00john/page/50 50–77] |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofc00john/page/50}}</ref>

Within the Analyst school were two camps: proponents of the "lay theory", which held that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were put together from a large number of short, independent songs,<ref name="West2011"/> and proponents of the "nucleus theory", which held that Homer had originally composed shorter versions of the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', which later poets expanded and revised.<ref name="West2011"/> A small group of scholars opposed to the Analysts, dubbed "Unitarians", saw the later additions as superior, the work of a single inspired poet.<ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/><ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/><ref name="West2011"/> By around 1830, the central preoccupations of Homeric scholars, dealing with whether or not "Homer" actually existed, when and how the Homeric poems originated, how they were transmitted, when and how they were finally written down, and their overall unity, had been dubbed "the Homeric Question".<ref name="West2011"/>

Following [[World War I]], the Analyst school began to fall out of favor among Homeric scholars.<ref name="West2011"/> It did not die out entirely, but it came to be increasingly seen as a discredited dead end.<ref name="West2011"/> Starting in around 1928, [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]], after their studies of folk bards in the Balkans, developed the "Oral-Formulaic Theory" that the Homeric poems were originally composed through improvised oral performances, which relied on traditional epithets and poetic formulas.<ref name="Foley1988">{{cite book |last1=Foley |first1=John Miles |title=The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology |date=1988 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0253342607 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo-665SEuqsC |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Taplin1986"/><ref name="West2011"/> This theory found very wide scholarly acceptance<ref name="Foley1988"/><ref name="Taplin1986"/><ref name="West2011"/> and explained many previously puzzling features of the Homeric poems, including their unusually archaic language, their extensive use of stock epithets, and their other "repetitive" features.<ref name="Taplin1986"/> Many scholars concluded that the "Homeric question" had finally been answered.<ref name="West2011"/>

Meanwhile, the 'Neoanalysts' sought to bridge the gap between the 'Analysts' and 'Unitarians'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Heiden |first1=Bruce |chapter=Scholarship, 20th Century |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1313 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Mark W. |chapter=Neoanalysis |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0968 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref> The Neoanalysts sought to trace the relationships between the Homeric poems and other epic poems, which have now been lost, but of which modern scholars do possess some patchy knowledge.<ref name="West2011"/> Neoanalysts hold that knowledge of earlier versions of the epics can be derived from anomalies of structure and detail in the surviving versions of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''. These anomalies point to earlier versions of the ''Iliad'' in which Ajax played a more prominent role, in which the Achaean embassy to Achilles comprised different characters, and in which Patroclus was actually mistaken for Achilles by the Trojans. They point to earlier versions of the ''Odyssey'' in which Telemachus went in search of news of his father not to Menelaus in Sparta but to Idomeneus in Crete, in which Telemachus met up with his father in Crete and conspired with him to return to Ithaca disguised as the soothsayer Theoclymenus, and in which Penelope recognized Odysseus much earlier in the narrative and conspired with him in the destruction of the suitors.<ref>Reece, Steve.

===Contemporary===
Most contemporary scholars, although they disagree on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were not produced by the same author, based on "the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the ''Odyssey'' in relation to the ''Iliad''."<ref>{{cite journal  | last1=West  | first1=M.

"'Homer" is a name of unknown etymological origin, around which many theories were erected in antiquity. One such linkage was to the Greek {{lang |grc |ὅμηρος}} (''hómēros''), "hostage" (or "surety"). The explanations suggested by modern scholars tend to mirror their position on the overall Homeric question. Nagy interprets it as "he who fits (the song) together". West has advanced both possible Greek and Phoenician etymologies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graziosi |first1=Barbara |title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521809665 |pages=51–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC&pg=PA51 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="east_face_622">{{cite book  | first=M.

Scholars continue to debate questions such as whether the Trojan War actually took place – and if so when and where – and to what extent the society depicted by Homer is based on his own or one which was, even at the time of the poems' composition, known only as legends. The Homeric epics are largely set in the east and center of the [[Mediterranean]], with some scattered references to [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]] and other distant lands, in a warlike society that resembles that of the Greek world slightly before the hypothesized date of the poems' composition.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Raaflaub |first1=Kurt A. |chapter=Historicity of Homer |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0601 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Finley |first1=Moses I. |title=The World of Odysseus |date=1991 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0140136869 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaeBPwAACAAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wees |first1=Hans van |title=War and Violence in Ancient Greece |date=2009 |publisher=ISD LLC |isbn=978-1910589298 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PtODgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Ian |title=The Use and Abuse of Homer |journal=Classical Antiquity |date=1986 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=81–138 |doi=10.2307/25010840 |jstor=25010840}}</ref>

In ancient Greek chronology, the sack of Troy was dated to 1184 BC. By the nineteenth century, there was widespread scholarly skepticism that the Trojan War had ever happened and that Troy had even existed, but in 1873 [[Heinrich Schliemann]] announced to the world that he had discovered the ruins of Homer's Troy at [[Hissarlik]] in modern [[Turkey]]. Some contemporary scholars think the destruction of Troy VIIa ''circa'' 1220 BC was the origin of the myth of the Trojan War, others that the poem was inspired by multiple similar sieges that took place over the centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dowden |first1=Ken |last2=Livingstone |first2=Niall |title=A Companion to Greek Mythology |date=2011 |page=440 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1444396935 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XsN0O_BQ0cC&pg=PA440 |language=en}}</ref>

The Homeric epics are written in an artificial [[literary language]] or 'Kunstsprache' only used in epic [[hexameter]] poetry. Homeric Greek shows features of multiple regional Greek dialects and periods, but is fundamentally based on [[Ionic Greek]], in keeping with the tradition that Homer was from Ionia. Linguistic analysis suggests that the ''Iliad'' was composed slightly before the ''Odyssey'', and that Homeric formulae preserve older features than other parts of the poems.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Willi |first1=Andreas |chapter=Language, Homeric |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0792 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1=Egbert J. |title=A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1444317404 |page=401 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oa42E3DP3icC&pg=PA401 |language=en}}</ref>

== Homeric style ==

The Homeric poems were composed in unrhymed [[dactylic hexameter]]; ancient Greek [[metre (poetry)|metre]] was quantity-based rather than stress-based.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=W.

These habits aid the extemporizing bard, and are characteristic of oral poetry. For instance, the main words of a Homeric sentence are generally placed towards the beginning, whereas literate poets like [[Virgil]] or [[John Milton|Milton]] use longer and more complicated syntactical structures. Homer then expands on these ideas in subsequent clauses; this technique is called [[parataxis]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Mark W. |chapter=Style |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1377 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref>

The so-called '[[type scene]]s' (''typische Szenen''), were named by [[Walter Arend]] in 1933. He noted that Homer often, when describing frequently recurring activities such as eating, [[Homeric prayer|praying]], fighting and dressing, used blocks of set phrases in sequence that were then elaborated by the poet. The 'Analyst' school had considered these repetitions as un-Homeric, whereas Arend interpreted them philosophically. Parry and Lord noted that these conventions are found in many other cultures.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Reece |first1=Steve T. |chapter=Type-Scenes |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1488 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=MW |title=Homer and Oral Tradition: The Type-Scene |journal=Oral Tradition |date=1992 |volume=7 |pages=284–330 |url=http://www.citeulike.org/group/5373/article/4187736}}</ref>

'Ring composition' or [[chiastic structure]] (when a phrase or idea is repeated at both the beginning and end of a story, or a series of such ideas first appears in the order A, B, C ... before being reversed as ... C, B, A) has been observed in the Homeric epics. Opinion differs as to whether these occurrences are a conscious artistic device, a mnemonic aid or a spontaneous feature of human storytelling.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stanley |first1=Keith |title=The Shield of Homer: Narrative Structure in the Illiad |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1400863372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz8ABAAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Minchin |first1=Elizabeth |chapter=Ring Composition |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1287 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref>

The orally transmitted Homeric poems were put into written form at some point between the eighth and sixth centuries BC. Some scholars believe that they were dictated to a scribe by the poet and that our inherited versions of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were in origin orally-dictated texts.<ref>Steve Reece, "Homer's Iliad and Odyssey: From Oral Performance to Written Text", in Mark Amodio (ed.), ''New Directions in Oral Theory'' (Tempe: Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005) 43-89.</ref>  [[Albert Lord]] noted that the Balkan bards that he was studying revised and expanded their songs in their process of dictating.<ref>Albert B. Lord, ''The Singer of Tales'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1960).</ref> Some scholars hypothesize that a similar process of revision and expansion occurred when the Homeric poems were first written down.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=G.S. |title=Homer and the Oral Tradition |date=1976 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521213097 |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgHVXQfEzA4C&pg=PA117 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Foley |first1=John Miles |chapter=Oral Dictated Texts |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1029 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref>

Other scholars hold that, after the poems were created in the eighth century, they continued to be orally transmitted with considerable revision until they were written down in the sixth century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nagy |first1=Gregory |title=Poetry as Performance: Homer and Beyond |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521558488 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GCHXNMeHMoC |language=en}}</ref> After textualisation, the poems were each divided into 24 rhapsodes, today referred to as books, and labelled by the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. Most scholars attribute the book divisions to the Hellenistic scholars of Alexandria, in Egypt.<ref>U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, ''Homerische Untersuchungen'' (Berlin, 1884) 369; R. Pfeiffer, ''History of Classical Scholarship'' (Oxford, 1968) 116-117.</ref>  Some trace the divisions back further to the Classical period.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=West |first1=Martin L. |chapter=Book Division |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0253 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}; S.

Stanley, ''The Shield of Homer'' (Princeton, 1993) 37, 249ff.</ref>

In antiquity, it was widely held that the Homeric poems were collected and organised in Athens in the late sixth century BC by the tyrant [[Peisistratos]] (died 528/7 BC), in what subsequent scholars have dubbed the "Peisistratean recension".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Minna Skafte |title=The Homeric Question and the Oral-formulaic Theory |date=1980 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |isbn=978-8772890968 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgyJoouOkyAC&pg=PA128 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Lamberton2010"/> The idea that the Homeric poems were originally transmitted orally and first written down during the reign of Peisistratos is referenced by the first-century BC Roman orator [[Cicero]] and is also referenced in a number of other surviving sources, including two ancient ''Lives of Homer''.<ref name="Lamberton2010"/> From around 150 BC, the texts of the Homeric poems seem to have become relatively established. After the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]], Homeric scholars such as [[Zenodotus]] of Ephesus, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and in particular [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] helped establish a canonical text.<ref name=Haslam2012>{{Cite book |last1=Haslam |first1=Michael |chapter=Text and Transmission |title=The Homer Encyclopedia |date=2012 |doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1413 |language=en |isbn=978-1405177689}}</ref>

The first printed edition of Homer was produced in 1488 in [[Milan]], Italy. Today scholars use medieval manuscripts, [[papyri]] and other sources; some argue for a "multi-text" view, rather than seeking a single definitive text. The nineteenth-century edition of [[Arthur Ludwich]] mainly follows Aristarchus's work, whereas van Thiel's (1991, 1996) follows the medieval vulgate. Others, such as [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin West]] (1998–2000) or T.W. Allen, fall somewhere between these two extremes.<ref name=Haslam2012/>
