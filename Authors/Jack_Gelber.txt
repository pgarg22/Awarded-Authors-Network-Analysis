'''Jack Gelber''' (April 12, 1932 &ndash; May 9, 2003) was an American playwright best known for his 1959 drama ''[[The Connection (play)|The Connection]]'', depicting the life of drug-addicted jazz musicians. The first great success of the [[Living Theatre]], the play was translated into five languages and produced in ten nations.  Gelber continued to work and write in New York, where he also taught writing, directing and drama as a professor, chiefly at [[Brooklyn College]], [[City University of New York]], where he created the [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] program in playwriting.  In 1999 he received the [[Edward Albee]] Last Frontier Playwright Award in recognition of his lifetime of achievements in theatre.

==Early life and education==
Jack Gelber was born April 12, 1932 in [[Chicago]], the first of three sons of Molly (Singer) and Harold Gelber,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/79/Jack-Gelber.html|title = Jack Gelber Biography (1932-)}}</ref> a Jewish American couple of Russian and Romanian descent. Harold was a [[Sheet Metal Workers' International Association|sheet metal worker]], a trade the younger Gelber would briefly adopt to finance his education at the [[University of Illinois]]. While at the university, he developed an interest in fiction and began to write short stories. After graduating with a B.S. in [[Journalism]] in 1953, Gelber traveled to San Francisco, where he found work as a shipfitter's helper.

==Career==
In New York, Gelber first worked as a mimeograph operator at the [[United Nations]] headquarters. He began writing his first play, ''[[The Connection (play)|The Connection]]'', in late 1957. Two years later, he offered the script to [[Judith Malina]] and [[Julian Beck]] of the [[Living Theatre]]. Malina directed the production, Beck designed it, while Gelber was part of casting, directing rehearsals, and selling tickets. Opening in July 1959, the play was then controversial. Several theatre critics, particularly those writing for the daily newspapers, objected to the play's graphic depiction of [[heroin addiction]] and its performance style. The play also attracted prominent supporters, such as the drama critics [[Kenneth Tynan]] and [[Henry Hewes (critic)|Henry Hewes]], the poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], the writer [[Norman Mailer]], director [[Harold Clurman]], and [[Jerry Tallmer]], who lauded what they perceived as its innovative style, authentic language, and realism.

''The Connection'' became the Living Theatre's first great success.  It brought publicity to both Gelber and the Living Theatre as significant in American theatre. It won the [[Obie Award]]s of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' for Best New Play, Best Production, and Best Actor ([[Warren Finnerty]] in the role of Leach) of the 1959-1960 season. Gelber also received the [[Drama Desk|Vernon Rice Award]] (now known as the Drama Desk Award). In 1961 the Living Theatre took its production to Europe, where it earned the ''Grand Prix'' at the ''[[Théâtre des Nations]]'' Festival in Paris. Ultimately the Living Theatre performed ''The Connection'' a total of 722 times in the first years of the 1960s. ''The Connection'' has since been translated into five languages and performed in ten countries, as well as throughout the United States. The [[The Connection (1961 film)|film version]] of the play, produced by Lewis Allen and directed by [[Shirley Clarke]] in 1961, was also controversial at the time.

Gelber never achieved the same success with his later plays, but he enjoyed a long and active career writing, directing, and teaching drama. His second play, ''The Apple'', opened at the Living Theatre in 1961, but it was the last of Gelber's works produced by the company.  Not long after that production, the company moved overseas. In 1963 the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] awarded Gelber a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|fellowship]] (which it renewed three years later) to support his writing, and in 1964 he published his novel ''On Ice''.

In 1965 he became writer-in-residence at the [[City College of New York]]. His third play, ''Square in the Eye'' (1965) (also known as ''Let's Face It'') was produced by the Establishment Theatre Company at the [[Theatre De Lys]] soon eafter. Gelber earned his first directing credit in the 1966 production of [[Arnold Wesker]]'s ''[[The Kitchen (play)|The Kitchen]]''.

In 1967 [[Columbia University]] appointed Gelber as a part-time [[adjunct professor]] of drama. In 1968 he completed the script for, and directed a production of, his fourth play ''The Cuban Thing''. This work drew upon his travels as a journalist in Cuba  during the 1950s, along with more recent visits in 1964 and 1967.  He portrayed a middle-class family's experience of the 1959 revolution. Produced at [[Henry Miller's Theatre]], the play was controversial for what some believed was a favorable portrayal of the communist leader [[Fidel Castro]], when the Cold War was going strong. This interpretation sparked large and sometimes violent protests by Cuban exiles and others against the production, and the play ended its run after only one night. He appears as himself in the 1968 Cuban film ''[[Memories of Underdevelopment]]''.

In 1968, Gelber signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''[[New York Post]]''</ref>

In 1972 the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] awarded Gelber a fellowship for a residency at the [[American Place Theatre]], where his next play, ''Sleep'', was performed. That same year Gelber become a full-time Professor of English at [[Brooklyn College]] of the [[City University of New York]].  He created the College's MFA program in playwriting, which he would run until his retirement from CUNY in the late 1990s. In the roughly thirty years he spent at Brooklyn College, he balanced his teaching career with directing professional and student productions and teaching theatre workshops.  He received the Obie Award for Distinguished Direction in 1973 when he oversaw the American Place Theatre's production of ''The Kid'' by [[Robert Coover]].<ref name=Gussow/>

Gelber's writing was also supported by a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and a CBS Fellowship from [[Yale University]]. In 1973 the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] produced ''Barbary Shore'', Gelber's adaptation of a 1951 novel written by Norman Mailer. His next production, entitled ''Farmyard'' and staged by the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in 1975, was an adaptation of Franz Xaver Kroetz' 1971 play ''Stallerhof''.<ref name=Gussow/>

Gelber returned to creating original plays, directing a 1976 production of his drama ''Jack Gelber's New Play: Rehearsal'' at the American Place Theatre, and ''Starters'' at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center|Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center]] in 1980. It was eight years before he had his tenth play, ''Big Shot'', produced at Wildcliff Theatre by the East Coast Arts company. In the 1990s, three more of Gelber's plays were produced: ''Magic Valley'' (1990), and ''Rio Preserved'' and ''Chambers'' (1998).<ref name=Gussow/>

In the mid-part of the decade, he became an adjunct professor at the [[Actors Studio#The Actors Studio Drama School|Actors Studio Drama School]] at the [[New School University]], a position he would hold until his death. Gelber's last play to be produced was ''Dylan's Line''. Gelber completed the script in 2000 and performed a portion of it at the Last Frontier Theatre Conference in [[Valdez, Alaska]] that same year. It premiered at the [[McCarter Theatre]] in Princeton, New Jersey during 2003.<ref name=Gussow/>

This was not long after Gelber died on May 9, 2003 in New York, due to [[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia]], a [[cancer]] of the blood.<ref name=Gussow/>

"I was so affected [as a young man] and energized by ''The Connection''", [the playwright] [[Edward Albee]] said after his death. "It was exciting, dangerous, instructive and terrifying - all things theater should be."<ref name=Gussow>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/10/theater/jack-gelber-71-connection-playwright.html MEL GUSSOW, "Jack Gelber, 71, 'Connection' Playwright"], ''New York Times'', 10 May 2003, accessed 22 Nov 2010</ref>
