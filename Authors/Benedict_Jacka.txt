==Biography==

From 2000 on, he developed a fantasy setting for which he wrote four books, whose main characters were teenage elementals. None of the four were published. In 2009, he decided to try again with an adult character and a more information-based ability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orbit's website|url=http://www.orbitbooks.net/2013/06/14/francis-knight-interviews-benedict-jacka-author-of-the-alex-verus-novels/#more-35704|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Three years later, in 2012, he published the first book of the ''Alex Verus'' series, two more followed the same year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacka's website|url=http://benedictjacka.co.uk/about-me/|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> Jacka married in 2015 to Rolari Kuti.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sng Weddings|url=http://loveweddingsng.com/2015/07/yeni-kutis-daughter-rolari-weds-benedict-jacka-awgz-photography/|accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref>
