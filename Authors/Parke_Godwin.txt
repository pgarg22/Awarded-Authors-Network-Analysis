==Works==
Godwin is known for his novels of legendary figures placed in realistic historical settings, written in a lyrical yet precise prose style and sardonic humor. His retelling of parts of the [[King Arthur|Arthur legend]], ''Firelord'' in 1980, ''Beloved Exile'' in 1984, and ''The Lovers: The Legend of Tristan and Yseult'' in 1999 (under the pseudonym Kate Hawks) is set in the 5th century during the collapse of the [[Roman empire]], and his reinterpretation of [[Robin Hood]] (''Sherwood'', 1991, and ''Robin and the King'', 1993) takes place during the [[Norman conquest]] and features kings [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]] as major characters. His other well-known works include ''[[Waiting for the Galactic Bus]]'' (1988) and its sequel, ''[[The Snake Oil Wars]]'', which is also known as ''[[The Snake Oil Variations]]'', in 1989.  These were humorous critiques of American [[popular culture|pop culture]] and religion.

His short fiction has appeared in several anthologies. His short story "Influencing the Hell out of Time and Teresa Golowitz" was the [[Time and Teresa Golowitz|basis of an episode]] of the television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

Godwin was also at various times a radio operator, a research technician, a professional actor, an advertising man, a dishwasher and a maitre d' hotel.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

==Reception==
Reviewing Godwin's novel ''Sherwood'' (1991), James Idema stated "Once into Parke Godwin`s absorbing and highly original account of the ancient story, an appealing new Robin Hood will come to life...With impressive skill and vivid imagination, he portrays a hero, from childhood to young manhood, who is altogether credible in human terms".<ref name="ji">James Idema, "[https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-08-06-9103260258-story.html A New Robin Hood"].
