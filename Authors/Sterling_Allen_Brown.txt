'''Sterling Allen Brown''' (May 1, 1901 – January 13, 1989) was an American professor, [[folklorist]], [[poet]], [[literary critic]], and the first [[Poet Laureate of the District of Columbia]]. He chiefly studied black culture of the [[Southern United States]] and was a professor at [[Howard University]] for most of his career.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born May 1, 1901 on the campus of Howard University in [[Washington D.C.]], where his father, Sterling N. Brown, a former slave, was a prominent minister and professor at Howard University Divinity School.<ref name="Taylor 2008"/><ref name=brown>{{cite journal |jstor=3299758 |title=Looking for Sterling Brown's Howard County |author=Ellen Conroy Kennedy |year=1998 |journal=[[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]] |volume=21 |issue=4 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |doi=10.1353/cal.1998.0227 |pages=870–881|s2cid=162070516 }}</ref> His mother Grace Adelaide Brown, who had been the valedictorian of her class at [[Fisk University]],<ref name ="Gabbin 1985">{{cite book|last=Gabbin|first=Joanne|title=Sterling A.

Both his parents grew up in [[Tennessee]] and often shared stories with Brown and his sister Mary Edna Brown (an early member of [[Delta Sigma Theta|Delta Sigma Theta sorority]]) about famous leaders such as [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Booker T. Washington]].<ref name="Taylor 2008">{{cite journal|last=Thompson-Taylor|first=Betty|title=The Poetry of Brown|journal=Master Plots II: African American Literature|year=2008}}</ref>

Brown's early childhood was spent on a farm on [[Whiskey Bottom Road]] in [[Howard County, Maryland]]. He was educated at Waterford Oaks Elementary and [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]], where he graduated as the top student. He received a scholarship to attend [[Williams College]] in Massachusetts. Graduating from Williams [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1922, he continued his studies at [[Harvard University]], receiving an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English a year later.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|date=September 30, 1996}}</ref> That same year of 1923, he was hired as an English lecturer at [[Virginia University of Lynchburg|Virginia Theological Seminary and College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], a position he held for the next three years. He never pursued a doctorate degree, but several colleges gave him honorary doctorates.<ref name="Taylor 2008"/> Brown won the Graves Prize for his essay "The Comic Spirit in Shakespeare and Moliere" during his senior year at Williams.<ref name="Blackpast">{{Cite web |last=Tidwell |first=John |date=2007-09-29 |title=Sterling A.

==Marriage and family==
Brown married Daisy Turnbull in 1927 and they adopted a son, John L. Dennis. Daisy was an occasional muse for Brown; his poems "Long Track Blues" and "Against That Day" were inspired by her.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson-Taylor|first=Betty|title=The Poetry of Brown|quote=His wife Daisy inspired Brown's poems, 'Long Track Blues' and 'Against That Day.' |year=2008}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Brown began his teaching career with positions at several universities, including [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]] and [[Fisk University]], before returning to Howard in 1929. He was a professor there for 40 years. Brown's poetry used the South for its setting and chronicled the experiences of enslaved African-American people. In his creative work, Brown often imitated southern African-American speech, using "variant spellings and apostrophes to mark dropped consonants".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson-Taylor|first=Betty|title=Sterling Brown|journal=Critical Survey of Poetry|year=2002}}</ref> He taught and wrote about [[African-American literature]] and [[folklore]]. He was a pioneer in the appreciation of this genre. He had an "active, imaginative mind" when writing and "a natural gift for dialogue, description and narration".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sterling+Brown's+A+Negro+Looks+at+the+South.-a0167026834|last=Fleming|first=Robert|title=A Negro Looks At The South|journal=Black Issues Book Review|date=May 1, 2007|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>

Brown was known for introducing his students to concepts in [[jazz]], which, along with [[blues]], [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and other forms of black music, formed an integral component of his poetry.

In addition to his career at Howard University, Brown served as a visiting professor at [[Vassar College]], [[New York University]], [[Atlanta University]], and [[Yale University]]. Some of his notable students include [[Toni Morrison]], [[Kwame Ture]] ({{aka}} Stokely Carmichael), [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Ossie Davis]], and [[Amiri Baraka]] ({{aka}} LeRoi Jones).

In 1969 Brown retired from his faculty position at Howard and turned full-time to poetry.

==Literary career==
In 1932 Brown published his first book of poetry ''Southern Road''. It was a collection of poems, many with rural themes, and treated the simple lives of poor, black, country folk with poignancy and dignity. Brown's work included pieces of authentic dialect and structures as well as formal work.<ref>[https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2019/01/sonnets-and-seeds-by-hollis-robbins.html "Sonnets and Seeds {by Hollis Robbins}"], ''The Best American Poetry'', January 17, 2019.</ref>  Despite the success of this book, he struggled to find a publisher for the follow-up, ''No Hiding Place''.

His poetic work was influenced in content, form and cadence by [[African-American music]], including work songs, blues and jazz. Like that of [[Jean Toomer]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Langston Hughes]] and other black writers of the period, his work often dealt with race and class in the United States. He was deeply interested in a folk-based culture, which he considered most authentic. Brown is considered{{by whom|date=June 2021}} part of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] artistic tradition, although he spent the majority of his life in the [[Brookland, Washington, D.C.|Brookland]] neighborhood of [[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|Northeast Washington, D.C.]]

==Honors==

The home where Brown resided is located in the [[Brookland (Washington, D.C.)|Brookland]] section of Northeast Washington, DC. An engraved plaque and a sign created by the [[DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities]] are featured in front of the house.<ref>[http://brooklandbridge.com/899/brookland-history-lives-sterling-brown-house/ "Brookland History Lives!
