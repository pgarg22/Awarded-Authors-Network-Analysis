'''Anya Seton''' (January 23, 1904 â€“ November 8, 1990), born '''Ann Seton''', was an American author of historical fiction, or as she preferred they be called, "[[biographical novel]]s".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weir |first= Alison |year=2007 |title=Mistress of the Monarchy: The Life of [[Katherine Swynford]], Duchess of Lancaster' |page=310 |location=New York |publisher=Ballantine Books }}</ref><ref name=AustinChronicle/>

==Career==
Seton published her first novel, ''[[My Theodosia]]'', in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moser|first1=Margaret|title=Love in the Time of 'Green Darkness'|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2006-09-29/406101/|access-date=18 March 2015|website=Austin Chronicle}}</ref>

Seton's [[historical novel]]s were noted for how extensively she researched the historical facts,<ref name="ChicagoObit" /><ref name="WPostObit" /> and some of them were best-sellers: ''Dragonwyck'' (1944) and ''Foxfire'' (1950) were both made into Hollywood films.<ref name="AustinChronicle" /><ref name="ChicagoObit" /> Three of her books are classics in their genre and continue in their popularity to the present: ''Katherine'', the story of [[Katherine Swynford]], the mistress and eventual wife of [[John of Gaunt]], and their children, who were the direct ancestors of the Tudors, Stuarts, and the modern British royal family; ''[[Green Darkness]]'', the story of a modern couple plagued by their past life incarnations; and ''[[The Winthrop Woman]]'' about the notorious [[Elizabeth Fones]], niece and daughter-in-law of [[John Winthrop]], the first governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].<ref name="NYObit">{{cite web|last1=Fowler|first1=Glenn|title=Anya Seton, Author of 'Foxfire' and Other Novels, is Dead at 86|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/10/obituaries/anya-seton-author-of-foxfire-and-other-novels-is-dead-at-86.html|work=New York Times|access-date=18 March 2015}}</ref> Most of her novels have been recently republished, several with forewords by [[Philippa Gregory]]. In 2003, ''Katherine'' was chosen as the 95th best British novel of all time in a nationwide poll conducted by the [[BBC]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml |title=The Big Read Top 100 |work=[[BBC]] |date=August 2004 |access-date=8 July 2013 }}</ref>

Her 1962 novel ''[[Devil Water]]'' concerns [[James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater|James]], the luckless [[Earl of Derwentwater]] and his involvement with the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. She also narrates the story of his brother [[Charles Radclyffe|Charles]], beheaded after the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 rebellion]], the last man to die for the cause. The action of the novel moves back and forth between [[Northumberland]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]], and the United States. Seton stated that the book developed out of her love for Northumberland. She certainly visited her Snowdon cousins at [[Felton, Northumberland|Felton]]. [[Billy Pigg]], the celebrated [[Northumbrian smallpipe|Northumbrian piper]] played "Derwentwater's Farewell" especially for her. The novel shows her typical thorough research of events and places, though the accents are a little wayward. Seton said that her greatest debt of all was to Miss [[Amy Flagg]] of [[Westoe]] Village in [[South Shields]], her father's birthplace.<ref name="DevilWaterBook">{{cite book |last= Seton|first= Anya|date= 2013|title= Devil Water|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XCouJtOgI94C&pg=PT557|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page= 557|isbn=9780547685281}}</ref>
