==Early life==
Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz was born 6 February 1758 in Skoki, near Brest in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].  Niemcewicz, scion of a moderately well-to-do Polish noble family, graduated from the [[Warsaw]] [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Corps of Cadets]].<ref name="founders1798">{{cite web|title=To George Washington from Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, 14 June 1798|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-02-02-0253|website=founders.archives.gov|publisher=Founders Online|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Ursyn Niemcewicz by Barwicki.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Niemcewicz'', by Barwicki.]]
After graduating from the Corps of Cadets, he subsequently served as aide to [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]] and visited [[France]], [[England]] and [[Italy]].  Niemcewicz served as a deputy to the [[Great Sejm]] of 1788–1792 and was an active member of the [[Patriotic Party]] that pushed through adoption of the historic [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of 3 May 1791]].  He was subsequently a founder of the [[Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej|Friends of the Constitution]], formed to support the implementation of that progressive document. After the victory of the [[Targowica Confederation]] in 1792 and the consequent overthrow of the May 3 Constitution, Niemcewicz, along with other Patriotic Party members, emigrated to [[Germany]].<ref name="Knight1856"/>

During the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] in 1794, Niemcewicz served as aide to [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]].  Both were captured by the Russians at the [[Battle of Maciejowice]] in 1794 and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] at [[St. Petersburg]] along with Niemcewicz's aide-de-camp named [http://www.kuzniewski-genealogy.com/ Kuźniewski].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kneski|first1=John|title=The History of the Kuźniewski Clan of Koziebrody|url=http://www.kuzniewski-genealogy.com/html/4.html|website=Kuzniewski & Kneski Genealogy - The History of the Kuźniewski Family|publisher=Prof. John Kneski|access-date=2 April 2016}}</ref><ref name="Niemcewicz2008">{{cite book|last1=Niemcewicz|first1=Julian Ursyn|title=Notes of My Captivity in Russia|date=2008|isbn=9780554505015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLpvTnSXj7MC|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>  In 1796, on the death of [[Tsaritsa]] [[Catherine the Great]], they were released by Tsar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and made their way together to the [[United States]].<ref name="Kusielewicz1961">{{cite book|last1=Kusielewicz|first1=Eugene|last2=Niemcewicz|first2=Julian Ursyn|last3=Jefferson|first3=Thomas|title=Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and America|date=1961|publisher=Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HJWAAAAMAAJ|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>  They sailed on the ship ''Adriana'' from [[Bristol]], in England, in the company of the Portuguese abbot and botanist, [[José Correia da Serra]], who served as the chaplain on ship for Niemcewicz and Kościuszko.

Niemcewicz was upset when Kościuszko decamped for Europe without giving him any notice.<ref>Niemcewicz, ''Under Your Vine and Fig Tree''.</ref> After [[Napoleon]]'s 1807 invasion of Poland, Niemcewicz returned to Warsaw and was made secretary of the senate.<ref name=acab/> After the [[Congress of Vienna]], he was secretary of state and president of the constitutional committee in Poland. In the years of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] Niemcewicz was the central figure of Polish cultural life and his moral influence was sometimes compared with political and military strength of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]].<ref name="Knight1856"/><ref name="Fish1977">{{cite book|last1=Fish|first1=Hamilton|title=Lafayette in America during and after the Revolutionary War and other essays on Franco-American relations|date=1977|publisher=[[Vantage Press]]|page=236|isbn=9780533023141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgARAQAAMAAJ|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

On 11 May 1830, he unveiled a new landmark before the [[Staszic Palace]], the seat of the [[Society of Friends of Science in Warsaw]] — a [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw|monument to Nicolaus Copernicus]] sculpted by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. During the failed [[November Uprising]] of 1830–31, Niemcewicz was a member of the insurrectionary Polish government.  In the final months of the Uprising the poet went on a diplomatic mission to London (as the last Polish envoy to Britain) and he remained in exile, first in Britain, then in France, until his death in 1841.<ref name="Knight1856"/><ref name="Harrison1896">{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Mrs. Martha J.

===Works===
As a writer, Niemcewicz tried many styles of composition. His political comedy, ''The Return of the Deputy'' (1790), enjoyed great acclaim.<ref name="Robinson1834">{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Edward|title=The Biblical Repository|date=1834|publisher=Gould and Newman|page=[https://archive.org/details/biblicalreposit00robigoog/page/n109 512]|url=https://archive.org/details/biblicalreposit00robigoog|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>  His novel, ''John of Tenczyn'' (1825), written in the style of [[Sir Walter Scott]], gives a vigorous picture of old Poland. He also wrote a ''History of the Reign of Sigismund III'' (3 volumes, 1819) and a collection of memoirs for ancient Polish history (6 volumes, 1822–23).<ref name="Lach-Szyrma1823"/>

Niemcewicz's 1817 pamphlet ''Rok 3333 czyli sen niesłychany'' (The Year 3333, or an Incredible Dream), first published posthumously in 1858, describes a Poland transformed into a sinister [[Judeopolonia|Judeo-Polonia]]. The pamphlet has been described as "the first Polish work to develop on a large scale the concept of an organized Jewish conspiracy directly threatening the existing social structure."<ref>Magdalena Opalski, Israel Bartal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VQqO8LBNBbsC&pg=PA29 ''Poles and Jews: A Failed Brotherhood''], University Press of New England, 1992.</ref> His collected works were published in 47 volumes at Leipzig in 1838-40.<ref name="Lach-Szyrma1823">{{cite book|last1=Lach-Szyrma|first1=Krystyn|title=Letters, Literary and Political, on Poland: Comprising Observations on Russia and Other Sclavonian Nations and Tribes|date=1823|publisher=Constable|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwIeAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA281|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>
