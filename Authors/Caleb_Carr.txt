== Early years and education==
He was born on August 2, 1955, in Manhattan, one of three sons born to [[Beat Generation]] figure [[Lucien Carr]] and Francesca Von Hartz.<ref name=":38"/> Lucien's close circle of friends included [[William Burroughs]], [[Jack Kerouac]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]], whom Lucien had known since his college days. Their frequent presence in the Carr household affected Carr's future career: "They were noisy drunks that were a disruption. They made me determined never to be a fiction writer".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Carr trouble - Books - Entertainment - theage.com.au|url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/carr-trouble/2005/11/05/1130823432052.html|website = www.theage.com.au|access-date = 2016-01-29|date = 2005-11-06}}</ref> This reaffirmed an earlier sentiment in a 1997 interview, where he stated that as a child, he "wanted nothing less than to be a fiction writer".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=1997-10-04|title=The Salon Interview, Caleb Carr|url=http://www.salon.com/1997/10/04/cov_si_04carr/|access-date=2016-01-29|website=Salon}}</ref>

Carr received his primary education from [[St. Luke's School (Manhattan)|St. Luke's School]] in Greenwich Village and his secondary education from [[Friends Seminary]], also in downtown New York City.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title = Ezequiel Vinao: Merlin the Opera (about Caleb Carr)|url = http://merlin.tloneditions.com/about_Caleb_Carr.html|website = merlin.tloneditions.com|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref> Carr's interest in military history did not help him fit in at Friends Seminary, a [[Quaker]] school. He was an excellent student, but he was guilty of pranks like setting off [[cherry bomb]]s in the school lavatories. When he discovered that his school transcript was marked "Socially Undesirable", he was "stunned". "We had guys in our school who dealt opium and cocaine out of their lockers, and the teacher would take them aside and have conversations". The designation was enough to keep him out of Harvard.<ref name=":0" /> He attended [[Kenyon College]], in [[Gambier, Ohio]], from 1973 to 1975 and returned to New York City in 1975 to complete his education at [[New York University]], where, in 1977, he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in military and diplomatic history.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">Purdy, Matthew.

Much of Carr's fiction deals with violence perpetrated by people whose behavior has its origins in childhood abuse.<ref name=":38">{{Cite web|title = Time Traveler |url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108377,00.html|website = [[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = BookPage Interview|url = http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/boulevard/2739/AngelInterview3.html|website = www.oocities.org|access-date = 2016-01-31}}</ref> These stories are rooted in Carr's family history. The author's father, Lucien Carr, was born in 1925 in New York City. Lucien's parents separated when he was five, and the balance of his childhood was spent in [[St. Louis]], where both the elder Carrs, Russell and Marion, had been born to socially prominent families.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title = Beat Culture: Lifestyle, Icons and Impact|last = Lawlor|first = William|year = 2005}}</ref> David Kammerer followed Lucien wherever the younger man went—including moves to out-of-state schools. Eventually, the two landed in New York City.<ref name=":1"/> Lucien had left [[University of Chicago]] after a suicide attempt, which he tried to pass off as a piece of [[performance art]], and enrolled at [[Columbia University]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title = This is the Beat Generation|last = Campbell}}</ref> Kammerer followed him and took up residence in the [[West Village]], not far from where his friend [[William Burroughs]] was by then living. While at Columbia, Carr met [[Allen Ginsberg]] and, through another friend, [[Jack Kerouac]]. Lucien in turn introduced the two men to one another and to Burroughs. This circle of friends, with Lucien Carr at its hub, became the nucleus of the [[Beat Generation]]. On the outside looking in was David Kammerer.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Columbia University {{!}} Treasures of New York {{!}} Video {{!}} Thirteen - New York Public Media|url = http://www.thirteen.org/programs/treasures-of-new-york/columbia-university/|website = Thirteen - New York Public Media|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>

Accounts of the Lucien Carr{{spnd}}David Kammerer story have varied widely. Whatever the truths behind their relationship were, it ended on August 13, 1944, in New York's [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]]. Carr stabbed Kammerer to death with a [[Boy Scout]] knife and dumped his body into the [[Hudson River]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Columbia Student Kills Friend and Sinks Body in Hudson River|last = Adams|first = Frank|date = August 17, 1944|work = The New York Times}}</ref> Afterwards he went to Burroughs, who told him to turn himself in to the police. Carr instead sought out Kerouac, who helped him dispose of the murder weapon. Then the two went to a movie.<ref name=":6" /> Finally, Carr went to the New York District Attorney's office. He was charged with second degree murder, pleaded guilty to first degree manslaughter, and was sentenced to one-to-twenty years in prison, with a recommendation from the judge for psychiatric treatment.<ref name=":4" /> He served almost two years of his sentence before being released on parole. Kerouac and Burroughs were arrested as [[material witness]]es but soon were released.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Lucien Carr, 79; Catalyst, Muse for Beat Writers|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/30/local/me-carr30|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2005-01-30|access-date = 2016-01-31|issn = 0458-3035 |first = Myrna|last = Oliver}}</ref>

After his release from prison Lucien went to work for United Press (later [[United Press International]]). While there he met and married reporter Francesca von Hartz, and the couple had three sons: Simon, Caleb, and Ethan. From 1946 until his retirement in 1993, Carr rose steadily through the ranks from [[copy boy]] to manager of the world news desk.<ref name=":0" />

Lucien inflicted physical and emotional abuse upon his wife and children. Caleb remembers being singled out for his father's beatings: "He was enormously threatened by me, from the time I was a child—threatened by my tendency to speak what I perceived. Alcoholics don't tend to like children like that." The physical and verbal abuse fueled by alcohol and rage didn't stop even after Caleb's parents divorced when he was eight.<ref name="theage.com.au">{{Cite web|title = Carr trouble - Books - Entertainment - theage.com.au|url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/carr-trouble/2005/11/05/1130823432052.html?page=2|website = www.theage.com.au|access-date = 2016-01-29|date = 2005-11-06}}</ref>

Carr did not learn about his father's crime until he was 18. He recalls being shocked, "but not exactly surprised".<ref name="theage.com.au"/>

The frequent presence of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs in the Carr home was a "little unnerving". "They could be perfectly nice people one-to-one", Carr told ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' in a 1997 interview. "Kerouac was a very nice man. Allen could be a very nice guy. Burroughs was a little strange for a child. But they weren't children people. You needed to be grown up to be around them if you wanted to not be terrified. What they were up to was not gonna make any child reassured."<ref name=":1" />

After the Carrs' divorce, Kerouac proposed marriage to Caleb's mother, but she turned him down and afterwards married writer John Speicher. Carr's new stepfather was another heavy drinker, and Carr made weekly visits to Lucien. "There was a lot of craziness in the family," Carr remembers, "and a lot of alcoholism among the adults." Speicher had three daughters from a previous marriage, and they and the three Carr brothers bonded, a group that Caleb would label "the dark Brady Bunch". They spent most summers at a house in [[upstate New York]], originally bought by Carr's maternal grandparents, then owned by his mother.<ref name=":7" /> "When the adults weren't around it was a place of great solace. When they were, it was a place of great exploration because being in the house too much wasn't an option."<ref name=":0" />

Likewise, when the family was back in New York, Caleb spent as much time as possible away from their apartment.<ref>{{Cite web|title =Man Possessed |date=November 3, 1997 |url = http://www.weeklywire.com/ww/11-03-97/chicago_bookfeat.html|website =Weekly Wire |access-date = 2016-01-31|first =Sam |last =Jemielity}}</ref> Among his favorite havens, other than the streets of Manhattan themselves, were the city's movie theaters. He at first preferred classic and then war movies, and became increasingly interested in military history. "Part of it was a desire to find violence that was, in the first place, directed toward some sort of purposeful end, and second, governed by a definable ethical code. And I think it's fairly obvious why I would want to do that", he told ''New York'' magazine in 1994.<ref name=":0" />

==Career==
Carr first went to work for the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] after high school as a library assistant, and rose during his college year summers (and a semester off) to research assistant.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108377,00.html|title=Time Traveler : People.com|website=www.people.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> He also wrote freelance articles on global issues.<ref name=":2" /> During this period, he published his first nationally noticed broadside: a long indictment, published on the letters page of the ''New York Times'', of Henry Kissinger's foreign policy.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/15/archives/letters-to-the-editor-kissingers-19thcentury-diplomacy.html|title=Letters to the Editor; Kissinger's 19th-Century Diplomacy|last=Safire|first=William|date=1974-10-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> This assisted noted historian and expert on U.S. foreign policy [[James Chace]] in helping Carr, after he left New York University, to get a job as a researcher and editorial assistant for the ''Foreign Affairs Quarterly'',<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=http://publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19980803/38669-pw-james-chace-policy-with-panache.html|title=PW: James Chace: Policy With Panache|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> where Chace was managing editor. A longtime friend of John Speicher, Chace had known Carr since he was nine and became his mentor. "Because of his difficult upbringing, Caleb didn't trust many adults", Chace told ''New York'' magazine in 1994. "I became the exception because he sensed I was on his side."

In 1980, Carr left Foreign Affairs to fine-tune and publish his first novel, ''[[Casing the Promised Land]]'', a coming of age story about three young men in New York City. It was dedicated to "Everyone who fed me and to: James Chace". Nearly 20 years after ''Casing the Promised Land'' was published, the extreme prices that book dealers were offering for the volume forced Carr to post this "self-criticism" on the book's Amazon.com page: "I am the author of this book. It has a few good scenes, but is essentially 'roman a clef' nonsense that every writer has to get out of his system early on. Do yourself a favor and read ''anything'' else I've written (you'll be doing me a favor, too). Forgive the follies of youth." (emphasis in the original)<ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=Casing the Promised Land|last=Carr|first=Caleb|date=1980-06-01|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=978-0-06-010707-9|edition=1st|location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/casingpromisedla00carr}}</ref>

James Chace brought Carr on to organize and edit his acclaimed book, ''Endless War'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Endless War|last=Chace|first=James|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1984|isbn=978-0-394-72779-0}}</ref> dealing with the crisis in Central America, which Carr then covered as a freelance journalist for the ''Berkshire Eagle'' and ''The New York Times''.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":9" /> In 1988 Carr and Chace co-authored ''America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security from 1812 to Star Wars'',<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|title=America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security from 1812 to Star Wars|publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc|year=1988|isbn=978-0-671-61778-3|url=https://archive.org/details/americainvulnera00chac}}</ref> an unprecedented and highly acclaimed study of America's traditional and unequivocal approach to national security, beginning with the Founders. From the book: "For more than two centuries, the United States has aspired to a condition of perfect safety from foreign threats. Alarmed by even potential dangers to the nation's security, Americans have forcefully responded to both real and imagined assaults against our own borders as well as against those of foreign nations and provinces whose security we have seen as either strategically or politically linked to our own ... Yet the goal of absolute security has constantly eluded us."

In 1989 he became a contributing editor to ''MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History'',<ref name=":2" /> a position he still held in 1994.<ref name=":3" />

In 1991 Carr published ''The Devil Soldier: The Story of Frederick Townsend Ward, the American Soldier of Fortune Who Became a God in China'',<ref name=":30">{{Cite book|title=The Devil Soldier|last=Carr|first=Caleb|publisher=Random House|year=1992|isbn=978-0-679-41114-7|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsoldiers00carr}}</ref> a biography, and the first of his books to receive wide recognition.<ref name=":0" /> According to the ''New York Times'', "by marshaling his scholarship well and setting it out as an adventure story, Mr. Carr gives a good picture of the buccaneering milieu of the time, and makes a plausible case for the devil soldier being on the side of the angels."<ref name=":31">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/19/books/a-yank-in-the-manchu-dynasty.html|title=A Yank in the Manchu Dynasty|last=Kobak|first=Annette|date=1992-01-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref>

Carr was also active in Hollywood in the 1980s and '90s as a screenwriter and producer. He wrote one movie for television, ''[[Bad Attitudes]]'' (1991), but the revision and execution of his script deeply disappointed him.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":38" /><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139627/|title=Caleb Carr|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref>

Carr returned to New York to begin researching and writing what would prove his breakthrough novel, ''[[The Alienist]]'', published in 1994. The book became an international bestseller and has been translated into more than 24 languages. Winner of the 1995 Anthony Award<ref name=":11" /> for best first novel (although technically it was his second), the book, set in 1896 New York City follows the exploits of a small band of individuals determined to catch a serial killer. The book was also nominated for the 1995 Bram Stoker award.<ref name=":32">{{Cite web|url=http://horror.org/awards/stokerwinnom.htm#1995|title=Horror Writers Association - Past Bram Stoker Award Nominees & Winners|website=horror.org|access-date=2016-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202142043/http://horror.org/awards/stokerwinnom.htm#1995|archive-date=2017-02-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Carr's lifelong interest in violence, which initially fed his study of military history, expanded into a study of serial killers with the advent of the Son of Sam murders of 1976–1977.<ref name=":0" /> (Once again, this was not a mere fascination with brutality, but with the underlying causes of violence and with people—especially military leaders—who seek to limit killing.) Later, as ''The Alienist'' began taking shape in his imagination, Carr immersed himself in the history of the New York City neighborhoods in which he had grown up and biographies of its notable figures of the Nineteenth century.<ref name=":3" /> He also sought the counsel, during a series of meetings, with Dr. [[David Abrahamsen]], the psychiatrist who examined [[David Berkowitz]] after his capture and "unraveled the mind" of the Son of Sam killer.<ref name=":0" /> Carr sold the movie rights for ''The Alienist'' to Paramount based on an early draft of the book.<ref name=":0" />

Returning to Hollywood, Carr wrote the pilot for a dystopian vision of the far future, ''[[The Warlord: Battle for the Galaxy|The Osiris Chronicles]]'', for Paramount Television. After a vigorous auction, sale of the broadcast rights went to CBS. Once again, however, the execution of the production was deeply disappointing to Carr, and the show was not picked up. Consulted by Paramount TV as to what could be done to salvage the pilot, Carr told Paramount that, if left to work on his own with the assistant editor, he could produce a new cut of the show for a television movie that would at least be moderately successful, especially abroad. Paramount agreed, and the movie, titled ''[[The Warlord: Battle for the Galaxy]]'' (1998), did indeed prove a modest success, particularly in foreign markets.<ref name=":10" />

At the same time, he appeared on the History Channel's ''Jack the Ripper: Phantom of Death'' (1995) as an expert commentator; additionally he was a guest commentator on PBS's ''American Experience: New York Underground''. He was also a featured commentator in [[Ric Burns]]' 1999 documentary New York: A Documentary History. Back in Los Angeles, he performed a page-one rewrite of [[William Wisher Jr.]]'s script for a prequel to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' for [[Morgan Creek Productions]], resulting in a screenplay that attracted the legendary [[John Frankenheimer]] to direct, [[Liam Neeson]] to star, and the famed cinematographer [[Vittorio Storaro]] to shoot. But when Frankenheimer suddenly died and was replaced by [[Paul Schrader]], who insisted on his own version of the script, Neeson abandoned the project and Carr, deeply disillusioned, returned to New York for the last time. He is given partial story credit for the two films eventually produced from the script, ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'' and ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]'', although, in a subsequent interview with the ''[[LA Weekly]]'', Carr emphasized that the movies bore little to no relation to his story.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":24">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/hell-hath-no-fury-2138663|title=Hell Hath No Fury|last=Foundas|first=Scott|website=[[LA Weekly]]|access-date=2016-04-10|date=2004-08-12}}</ref>

For his next novel, Carr brought back the principals from ''The Alienist'' to solve another serial murder case in ''[[The Angel of Darkness]]'', published in 1997. The sequel not only sold more copies than its predecessor, it received more critical acclaim. This time, the killer at the center of the hunt is a female murdering infants. The narrator for this adventure is Stevie Taggart, the street urchin Dr. Laszlo Kreizler saved from jail years earlier. When asked about the subject matter, Carr stated, "You want to believe that there's one relationship in life that's beyond betrayal--a relationship that's beyond that kind of hurt--and there isn't. The simple fact is, if the mothers that we see in the press are doing this kind of stuff, then the numbers who are actually doing it are probably much higher."<ref name=":1" />

In 1996 he wrote a piece in the ''[[World Policy Journal]]'' titled "Terrorism as Warfare: the Lessons of Military History".<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209499|jstor = 40209499|title = Terrorism as Warfare: The Lessons of Military History|last1 = Carr|first1 = Caleb|journal = World Policy Journal|year = 1996|volume = 13|issue = 4|pages = 1–12}}</ref> He also published widely recognized essays on the Somalia intervention ("The Consequences of Somalia"<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209313|jstor = 40209313|title = The Consequences of Somalia|last1 = Carr|first1 = Caleb|journal = World Policy Journal|year = 1993|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 1–4}}</ref>) on the corruption and what he saw as the immorality of the CIA ("Aldrich Ames and the Conduct of American Intelligence"<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209359|jstor = 40209359|title = Aldrich Ames and the Conduct of American Intelligence|last1 = Carr|first1 = Caleb|journal = World Policy Journal|year = 1994|volume = 11|issue = 3|pages = 19–28}}</ref>), and the pointlessness of trying to pursue purely "humanitarian" military interventions, which the Clinton administration was trying to establish as a doctrine ("The Humanitarian Illusion"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/opinion/the-humanitarian-illusion.html|title=Opinion &#124; the Humanitarian Illusion|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 September 1993|last1=Carr|first1=Caleb}}</ref>), along with numerous other security and military policy pieces. In recognition of these efforts, Random House appointed Carr editor for the Modern Library War series. Carr is also a member of their Modern Library Board. As such, in 1998 and 1999, he participated in the "100 best" project, voting on the 100 best novels and 100 best non-fiction works of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernlibrary.com/about/the-modern-library-board-members/|title=The Modern Library Board Members|publisher=Modern Library|access-date=2016-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307045349/http://www.modernlibrary.com/about/the-modern-library-board-members/|archive-date=2016-03-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2000, Carr published his next novel, ''Killing Time'', another dystopian tale of the future, this time the near future: 2023. First serialized in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1999. The book finds a world with an abundance of information too easily manipulated, thus frequently obscuring reality. The characters travel from New York to the jungles of Africa in their quest to use such manipulation for the benefit of mankind, only to find themselves enmeshed in the central tragic paradox of their efforts, summed up best in a line from the book that is now a commonplace: "Information is not knowledge". Although some agreed with ''[[USA Today]]'' that ''Killing Time'' was "a techno-terrifying tale of the information age run amok" and "a daring departure from the successful Alienist formula, but Carr is still a master of the cliffhanger, serving up a non-stop thrill ride as the story builds to a surprising finish", many found its stark view of information manipulation and its consequences too pessimistic, and the book was only briefly a ''New York Times'' bestseller.<ref name=":40">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hour25online.com/Hour25_Previous_Shows_2000-6.html#caleb-carr_2000-12-15|title=Hour 25 - Previous Shows - November & December 2000|website=www.hour25online.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref>

Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, which were along the lines that Carr had warned of in his writings on terrorism, he returned to the subject, using his "Terrorism as Warfare" piece as the basis for his best-selling, highly acclaimed but controversial book, ''The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians''.<ref name=":15">{{Cite book|title=The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians|last=Carr|first=Caleb|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=978-0-375-76074-7}}</ref> Published in 2002, this study of the history of terrorism from ancient Rome to the present was among the first to provide a precise definition of terrorism, one that has endured and made the book a landmark book in the field:  Once again, reviews were extreme but mixed: some did not share the opinion of the Christian Science Monitor, which foretold correctly that, "After the deadly attacks against the United States, many Americans may now find Carr's earlier arguments prescient and his approach the only one that has a chance of working;"<ref name=":16">{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0214/p16s01-bogn.html|title=Terrorism never works, never has|last=Rose|first=Peter I.|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|issn=0882-7729|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> instead, many critics agreed with ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} opinion that, "''The Lessons of Terror'' is so earnest, so well informed and so outrageous ... that almost any reader will find something to love and something that will make you want to throw the book across the room.

Lynn|John Lynn]], subsequently declared, in his own ensuing volume, ''Battle: a History of Combat and Culture'', that Carr's "insistence that Terrorism [sic] can be traced back to the ancient world and that great armies and great states have engaged in attacks on civilians designed to intimidate and terrorize them is important in both obvious and subtle ways",<ref name=":18">{{Cite book|title=Battle: A History of Combat and Culture|last=Lynn|first=John|publisher=Westview Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8133-3372-4|pages=324}}</ref> as well as among terrorism experts, and the military and defense communities that Carr had sought; and it formed the basis of his deeper involvement in an advisory capacity for members of the government.

Carr was scheduled to appear on February 6, 2002, at the Council on Foreign Relations to discuss his book, ''The Lessons of Terror''. On February 4, 2002, the appearance was cancelled. Various reasons for the halting of the engagement were put forth in the media. One council member was told there was a scheduling conflict; others alleged not enough members signed up; yet Carr believed the real reason was due to his criticisms of Henry Kissinger, who was a member of the council.<ref name=":42">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/02/05/the-reliable-source/2e5914cb-6ee7-48aa-aaeb-758f78fec464/|title=The Reliable Source|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|date=2002-02-05|newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0190-8286|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>

In 2005 Carr published ''[[The Italian Secretary]]'', subtitled ''A Further Adventure of Sherlock Holmes''.  The project was initially to be part of an anthology of new Sherlock Holmes stories by modern mystery writers. When asked why he took on this project, Carr responded, "I think my interest in Holmes is probably like a lot of authors'. There are authors for whom the Holmes stories are part of the beginning of their decision to become writers, especially writers who aspire to popular fiction that has a bit more to it."<ref name=":33">{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/18465-returning-to-holmes.html|title=Returning to Holmes: PW talks with Caleb Carr| work = [[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=2016-04-10 | date = 18 April 2005 }}</ref>

Carr's next fiction endeavor, an ambitious volume he had been tinkering with since the 1980s,<ref name=":39">{{Cite web|url=http://wamc.org/post/book-show-1280-caleb-carr#stream/0|title=The Book Show #1280 - Caleb Carr|last=Donahue|first=Joe|website=wamc.org|date=29 January 2013|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> was published under the title ''The Legend of Broken''<ref name=":34">{{Cite book|title=The Legend of Broken|last=Carr|first=Caleb|publisher=Random House|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8129-8452-1}}</ref> in 2012. This work of speculative history set during a time period we know little about—the Dark Ages—imagines a multilayered tale where cultures collide in their bid to rule a kingdom where the borders of the natural world seem to almost bleed over into the unnatural, at times, although Carr was and is adamant in his declaration that the book was ''not'' a work of fantasy. The fictional kingdom of Broken occupies the part of modern Germany known as the Harz Mountains, in particular the mountain peak known as Brocken, which for centuries had been considered the seat of supernatural doings, because, Carr demonstrates, of the ignorance and superstition of man. As the book progresses we see how the word "broken" pertains, not only to the city, but also to the characters. The book is an allegory, a cautionary tale for our own time that ''The Washington Post'' declared, "an excellent and old-fashioned entertainment&nbsp;... ''The Legend of Broken'' seamlessly blends epic adventure with serious research and asks questions that men and women grappled with in the Dark Ages and still do today."<ref name=":35">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-the-legend-of-broken-by-caleb-carr/2012/11/26/556f04ac-3288-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html|title=Book review: 'The Legend of Broken' by Caleb Carr|last=Hand|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-11-26|newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref>

Carr spent several years researching and writing his most recent novel, ''Surrender, New York'', published August 23, 2016, by Penguin Random House.<ref name=":36">{{Cite web|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/24379/surrender-new-york-by-caleb-carr/|title=Surrender, New York by Caleb Carr {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> He stated, "This book is essentially a modern application of the principles and theories of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler to criminal behavior especially that directed at children."<ref name=":37">{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679455698/|title=Surrender, New York: A Novel|last=Carr|first=Caleb|date=2016-08-23|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-679-45569-1}}</ref>

After many failed attempts at adapting ''The Alienist'' to film, Paramount announced, in the summer of 2015, that it had partnered with TNT to produce a TV series adaptation helmed by [[Cary Fukunaga]], Emmy-winning director of ''[[True Detective]]''. Carr, tentatively hired on (pending his approval of the final scripts produced) as a consulting producer, commented, "After twenty years of tough struggle and countless failed attempts, I'm delighted that Paramount Television, Anonymous Content and TNT have decided to join forces and bring 'The Alienist' to life in what, based on the material I've read, has the potential to be a faithful and exciting TV series." [[Hossein Amini]], [[Gina Gionfriddo]], [[E. Max Frye]] and [[John Sayles]] also joined the Paramount Television and Anonymous Content project as writers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/the-alienist-tnt-caleb-carr-consulting-producer-1201544785/|title='The Alienist' Author Caleb Carr Boards TNT Series as Consulting Producer (Exclusive)|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|website=Variety |access-date=2016-04-10|date=2015-07-21}}</ref>

Carr has consistently kept up his nonfiction writing, on terrorism, especially. In response to the continued threats from ISIS near the end of 2015 and early in 2016, for example, Carr published a quartet of essays embodying once again his roots as a noted military scholar. The first article, published in the ''Los Angeles Times'', was "If France Wants to Succeed against Islamic State, it should Study the U. S. Invasion of Afghanistan".<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1123-carr-afghanistan-invasion-france-20151123-story.html|title=If France wants to succeed against Islamic State, it should study the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2016-04-10|date=2015-11-23}}</ref> That was followed by "Let Europe Lead the War in Syria: History Counsels Caution for American Troops", published in the [[New York Daily News|New York ''Daily News'']].<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/caleb-carr-europe-lead-war-syria-article-1.2446892|title=Caleb Carr: Let Europe lead the war in Syria|website=New York Daily News|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> Next, ''Vanity Fair'' published, "The Frantic Media Response to San Bernardino is Making Us Less Safe;"<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/caleb-carr-media-response-to-san-bernardino-shooting|title=What We Can Learn from the Frantic Media Response to San Bernardino|last=Carr|first=Caleb|website=Vanity Fair|date=9 December 2015|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> and most recently, the ''Daily News'' published another essay of Carr's called, "Strangling Isis, Slowly but Surely".<ref name=":23">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/caleb-carr-defeating-isis-slowly-surely-article-1.2583199|title=Caleb Carr: Defeating ISIS, slowly but surely|website=New York Daily News|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> The last warned what Carr saw as an American public that has never fully recovered psychologically from the attacks of 9/11 that the Global War on Terrorism will never have "a Hiroshima moment", and should not attempt one; instead, victory will only be gained patiently and over a span of decades.

=== Other work ===
While Carr's early years at home were fraught with chaos and abuse, author [[James Chace]], a childhood friend, stated the house was also "full of learning ... The thing is, most people tend to be narrow. But all the Carrs know music incredibly well, history, literature—they're extraordinarily remarkable." In the 1980s Carr pursued his career as a scholar and journalist; he spent his nights working in the theater directing both repertory works as well as productions of his own plays. Additionally, he played guitar in a band called Hell and High Water.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":38" />

The late 1990s found Carr expanding his literary repertoire while working as librettist for the opera ''Merlin'', a reinterpretation of the Arthurian legends, with his friend and composer, [[Ezequiel Vinao]]. A staged recital of the first scene was performed with a full orchestra at the Paris Opera House in 1999. The work is unfinished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://merlin.tloneditions.com/introduction.html|title=Ezequiel Vinao: Merlin the Opera (introduction)|website=merlin.tloneditions.com|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Carr has lived the majority of his life on Manhattan's Lower East Side, spending his summers and many weekends at his family's home in [[Cherry Plain, New York]]. In 2000, he purchased his own property, known as Misery Mountain, in Cherry Plain; and in 2006 he moved there permanently. As of 2016, he shares his home with his Siberian cat, Masha.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Caleb-Carr/e/B00LZX9ZQ6/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1460342983&sr=1-2-ent|title=Amazon.com: Caleb Carr: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle|website=www.amazon.com|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref>
