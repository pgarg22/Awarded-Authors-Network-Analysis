'''Sarah Doudney''' (15 January 1841, [[Portsea, Portsmouth]], Hampshire – 8 December 1926, [[Oxford]])<ref name="odnb">Charlotte Mitchell, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55573 "Doudney, Sarah (1841–1926)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2005, retrieved 11 July 2008</ref> was an English fiction writer and poet. She is best known for her children's literature and her hymns.

==Family and life==
Doudney's father ran a candle and soap-making business. One of her uncles was the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] clergyman [[David Alfred Doudney]], editor of ''[[The Gospel Magazine]]'' and ''Old Jonathan''.<ref name="odnb"/> Doudney was educated at a school for French girls, and started to write poetry and prose as a child. "The Lesson of the Water-Mill", written when she was 15 and published in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ''Churchman's Family Magazine'' (1864), became a well-known song in Britain and the United States. Doudney continued to live with her parents near [[Catherington]] until she was 30.

Doudney's first novel, ''Under Grey Walls'', appeared in 1871. Success came with her third, ''Archie's Old Desk'', in 1872. In the 1881 census Doudney described herself as a "Writer for Monthly Journals".<ref name="helenvict0r">{{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/helenvict0r/Doudney.html |title=Sarah Doudney (1841–1926) |accessdate=2008-07-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026135321/http://www.geocities.com/helenvict0r/Doudney.html |archivedate=26 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> She contributed poetry and fiction to periodicals that included [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]'s ''[[All the Year Round]]'', the ''Churchman's Shilling Magazine'',<ref name="odnb"/> the [[Religious Tract Society]]'s  ''[[Girl's Own Paper]]'', ''[[The Sunday Magazine (magazine)|The Sunday Magazine]]'', ''[[Good Words]]'' and ''[[The Quiver]]''.<ref name="helenvict0r"/> By 1891, when she described herself in the census as a novelist, she had written about 35 novels.<ref name="helenvict0r"/> Most of these were written for young girls, but she also wrote some for adults. Many of them end tragically, but look forward to happiness after death. ''Anna Cavaye, or, The Ugly Princess'' tells of a dying child comforted by knowing she has brought other people together.<ref>Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (eds): ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present''. (London, Batsford, 1990).</ref>

Doudney's hymns include ''The Christian's Good Night'', set by [[Ira D. Sankey]] in 1884 and sung at [[Charles Spurgeon]]'s funeral.<ref name="helenvict0r"/>

Sarah's mother Lucy Doudney died in 1891 and her father in 1893. Sarah Doudney then moved to [[Oxford]], where she died in December 1926.<ref>Web Archive biography: {{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/helenvict0r/Doudney.html |title=Retrieved 6 December 2011 |accessdate=2008-07-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026135321/http://www.geocities.com/helenvict0r/Doudney.html |archivedate=26 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}.</ref>
