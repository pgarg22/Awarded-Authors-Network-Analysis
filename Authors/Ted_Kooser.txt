==Biography==

===Early life===
Ted Kooser was born in [[Ames, Iowa]], on April 25, 1939. Growing up, Kooser attended Ames Public Schools for elementary and middle school. When Kooser arrived at [[Ames High School]], his interest diverted from the library and went to cars. He joined the Nightcrawlers Car Club and became secretary of the group in 1956. His motivation for writing in high school can be in part credited to one of his teachers, Mary McNally, who encouraged him to continue writing essays and poems that reflected his life. Kooser decided as a teenager that he was going to be a famous poet for three reasons: glory, immortality, and to leave the bohemian lifestyle behind.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

=== Education ===
Kooser graduated from Ames High School with a class of 175 students and enrolled at [[Iowa State University]], the alma mater of his uncles. He began writing short nonfiction stories for the Iowa State student literary magazine. He also joined the Iowa State Writer’s Round Table, which he credits for fine-tuning his writing skills; Iowa Senator [[Tom Harkin]] was also a part of the group. In 1961, Kooser moved to [[Marshalltown, Iowa]], to student teach English classes. The following year he graduated with a BS in English education from Iowa State University and moved to [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], to live with his parents.<ref name=":0" /> He was offered a graduate readership opportunity at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] and in 1963, he and his wife moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nebraskaauthors.org/authors/ted-kooser|title=Ted Kooser |publisher=Nebraska Authors}}</ref> After winning the Vreeland Award for poetry in 1964, he soon after lost his graduate readership from the University for his poor GPA. In 1967, he received his MA from Nebraska.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Poetry Of Ted Kooser|last=Stillwell|first=Mary|publisher=Bison Books|year=2013|location=Lincoln|pages=1–60}}</ref>

===Career===
After earning his MA, Kooser worked at Bankers Life Nebraska.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nebraskaauthors.org/authors/ted-kooser|title=Ted Kooser |publisher=Nebraska Authors}}</ref> He eventually went on to work for Lincoln Benefit Life (a subsidiary of Allstate), an insurance company, for 35 years before retiring as vice president at the age of 60. <ref>{{cite book|author=Various|title=Good Poems, American Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4me3_4ndTQC&pg=PT237|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-47619-2|page=237}}</ref> He wrote for an hour and a half before work every morning, and by the time he retired, Kooser had published seven books of poetry.<ref name=":3" /> Kooser taught as a Presidential Professor in the English department of the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] and is currently a Professor Emeritus <ref>{{cite web |url=https://directory.unl.edu/people/tkooser2 |publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln}}</ref>

On August 12, 2004, he was named [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] by the [[Librarian of Congress]] to serve a term from October 2004 through May 2005. 

In April 2005, Ted Kooser was appointed to serve a second term as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry. During that same week, Kooser received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his book ''Delights & Shadows''<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/delights-shadows-by-ted-kooser/|title = Delights & Shadows by Ted Kooser}}</ref> ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2004). [[Edward Hirsch]] wrote: "There is a sense of quiet amazement at the core of all Kooser’s work, but it especially seems to animate his new collection of poems, ''Delights & Shadows''."

Kooser's most recent books are ''Kindest Regards: New and Selected Poems'' and ''Red Stilts'' (2020).

He founded and hosted the newspaper project "American Life in Poetry".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kooser|first=Ted|title=American Life in Poetry|url=https://www.americanlifeinpoetry.org/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.americanlifeinpoetry.org}}</ref> In 2020, Kooser chose [[Kwame Dawes]], a chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]], to be his successor as of January 1, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=KHGI|date=2020-09-09|title=Kwame Dawes named successor for national "American Life in Poetry" column|url=https://nebraska.tv/news/local/kwame-dawes-named-successor-for-national-american-life-in-poetry-column|access-date=2020-11-03|website=KHGI}}</ref> Kooser also edits the Ted Kooser Contemporary Poetry series published by the [[University of Nebraska Press]].

=== Midwest Poetry Renaissance ===
Ted Kooser was part of the Midwest Poetry Renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s. The Midwest Poetry Renaissance drew on elements of [[Rural America]] through a five state swath of the [[Great Plains]] region. Poets of the midwest were respected among artists throughout the country due to being informed of larger societal forces, such as the distrust of a media-driven culture.<ref name=":6" />

More small presses opened up in that time, and Midwestern poets began publishing more work. [[Warren Woessner]] regards the catalyst of the MPR to be the anthology [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8531500-heartland Heartland] in 1967. The movement began to develop after that point, along with the works of Ted and other poets such as [[Victor Contoski]], Mak Vinz, David Steinglass, Gary Gildner, James Hazard, [[Greg Kuzma]], Judith Minty, and Kathy Weigner (as well as many others) who exemplified the rural subject matter and conversational tone. Most of the poets were in their twenties or early thirties and published their first books.

Ted was in his late twenties and thirties during the decade the Midwest Poetry Renaissance occurred. He published his first book through the [[University of Nebraska Press]] at age 30, titled “[https://www.amazon.com/OFFICIAL-ENTRY-BLANK-Ted-Kooser/dp/B00D37ZWP0 Official Entry Blank].” Ted’s first full-length book was already out of print by the early 1970s, at which time he became more of a [[small press]] poet like many other poets in the Midwest. Ted continued to receive publication of individual poems within anthologies, and published several more books on small presses. He also began to edit ''The New Salt Creek Reader'', which had six anthologies by 1974.

According to a Warren Woessner, a poet during the Midwest Poetry Renaissance, the movement ended in 1975 with the publication of Heartland II.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Woessner|first=Warren|year=2005|title=Let Us Now Praise Rusty Tractors-- Ted Kooser and the Midwest Poetry Renaissance|url=http://libmetafind1a.unl.edu:50081/ebsco-e-b/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=941899fa-ab09-4519-9078-444185b399d9%40sessionmgr104&vid=1&hid=113|journal=Midwest Quarterly|volume=6|pages=5|via=EBSCO}}</ref>

=== Poetic Style ===
Ted Kooser is known for his conversational style of poetry that is accessible to a nonliterary public.<ref name=":4" /> Critic Dana Gioia, in his book ''[http://danagioia.com/essays/reviews-and-authors-notes/ted-kooser-the-predicament-of-popular-poetry/ Can Poetry Matter?]'', describes Kooser’s style as "drawn from common speech, with subject matter common to the Midwest."<ref name=":4" /> Kooser's early and contemporary work involves both troubles for Midwesterners, and observations from everyday life.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/ted-kooser|title=Ted Kooser|website=Poetry Foundation|date=14 August 2021|publisher=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> Recurring themes include love, family, place, and time, but he does not consider himself a regional poet.<ref name=":5" />

===Personal life===
Kooser lives on an acreage near the village of [[Garland, Nebraska]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Various|title=Good Poems, American Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4me3_4ndTQC&pg=PT237|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-47619-2|page=237}}</ref> Kooser has served on the Lincoln Library Board. He was founding president of The Nebraska Literary Heritage Association.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nebraskaauthors.org/authors/ted-kooser|title=Ted Kooser |publisher=Nebraska Authors}}</ref>

Kooser is married to Kathleen Rutledge, former editor of the ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]''.
