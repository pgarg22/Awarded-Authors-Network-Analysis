==Military career 2==
In 1915, Ord was a military aide on the staff of the governor of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the [[Agua Prieta, Sonora|Battle of Agua Prieta]]. This was where [[Pancho Villa]] sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized and wandered around northern [[Mexico]] foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of [[Columbus, New Mexico]] on the Mexican side of the border in March 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|Battle of Columbus]]. Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona.<ref name=Special/>

As the result of his Arizona service, on June 3, 1916, Ord was advanced to the grade of major on the Army retired list. In early 1917, he returned to full active duty, serving at [[Big Bend, Texas]]; [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]]; and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]].<ref name=Special/>

In December 1918, because of complications of his yellow fever sustained in Cuba, he retired from the Army due to ill health.<ref name=Special/>

==Later life==
