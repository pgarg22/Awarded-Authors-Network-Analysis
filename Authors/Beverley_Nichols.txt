==Career==
Between his first book, the novel, ''Prelude'', published in 1920, and his last, a book of poetry, ''Twilight'', published in 1982, Nichols wrote more than 60 books. In addition to fiction, essays, theatre scripts and children's books, he wrote non-fiction works on travel, politics, religion, cats, parapsychology, and autobiography. He contributed to many magazines and newspapers throughout his life, notably weekly columns for the London ''Sunday Chronicle'' newspaper (1932–1943) and ''[[Woman's Own]]'' magazine (1946–1967).<ref name="life">{{Cite book |last1=Connon |first1=Bryan |title=Beverley Nichols: A Life |date=1991 |publisher=Constable |isbn=1604690445}}</ref>

Nichols is best remembered for his books about his homes and gardens, the first of which, ''Down the Garden Path'' (1932), was illustrated by [[Rex Whistler]], as were its two sequels. It went through 32 editions and has remained in print almost continuously. The trilogy chronicled the difficulties and delights of maintaining a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] thatched cottage in [[Glatton]], Cambridgeshire, the village he fictionalised as Allways. The books are written in a poetic, richly creative style, evoking emotional and sensual responses, leavened with humour and irony.<ref>''Down the Garden Path'' (1932) {{ISBN|978-0-88192-710-8}}</ref> The three books were so popular that they led to  humorous imitations, including ''Mon Repos'' (1934) by "Nicholas Bevel" (a parody by Muriel Hine) and ''Garden Rubbish'' (1936) by [[W. C. Sellar]] and [[R. J. Yeatman]], a satire on garden writers, which included a Nichols-like figure named "Knatchbull Twee."

Nichols's next garden and home book was ''Green Grows the City'' (1939), about his modern house and urban garden near [[Hampstead Heath]], London. That book introduced Reginald Arthur Gaskin, Nichols's manservant from 1924 until Gaskin's death in January 1967. Gaskin was a popular character in the book and was included in Nichols' succeeding gardening books.

A second trilogy (1951–1956) began with ''Merry Hall'', documenting Nichols's travails with his extravagant [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor in Agates Lane, [[Ashtead]], Surrey (fictionalised as Meadowstream), where Nichols lived from 1946 to 1956. The books often featured his gifted but laconic gardener "Oldfield". Nichols's final trilogy (1963–1968) chronicled his adapting to a more modest living arrangement, beginning in 1958, in a late 18th-century attached cottage (''Sudbrook'') at [[Ham, London, England|Ham]], near [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Surrey]]. This was Nichols's final home and garden, where he lived for 25 years until his death in 1983.

Nichols wrote on a wide range of subjects, always looking for "the next big thing". He [[Ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] [[Dame Nellie Melba]]'s 1925 "autobiography" ''Memories and Melodies'' (he was at the time her personal secretary, and his 1933 book ''Evensong'' was believed to be based on aspects of her life).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29170569 
|title=''The Mercury (Hobart) 5 December 1934'' |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref> In 1934, Nichols wrote a bestseller advocating [[pacifism]], ''Cry Havoc!'',<ref name="mc">Martin Ceadel, ''Pacifism in Britain, 1914–1945 : the defining of a faith''. Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0198218826}} (p.239).</ref> but by 1938, he had abandoned his pacifism and supported the British campaign in the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name="mc"/> In 1966 he wrote ''A Case of Human Bondage'' about the marriage and divorce of writer [[William Somerset Maugham]] and his interior-decorator wife, [[Gwendoline Maud Syrie Barnardo|Syrie]], which was highly critical of Maugham. ''Father Figure'' (1972), in which Nichols described how he tried to murder his alcoholic, abusive father, caused uproar and calls for his prosecution. He was disappointed by the reception of a book of his about [[spiritualism]].

Nichols was also a competent mystery writer. His five detective novels (1954–1960) featured a middle-aged private detective of independent means called Horatio Green.

Apart from authorship, Nichols's main interest was gardening, especially garden design and winter flowers. His many acquaintances in all walks of life included some famous gardeners, such as [[Constance Spry]] and [[Charles McLaren, 3rd Baron Aberconway|Lord Aberconway]], President of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] and owner of [[Bodnant Garden]] in North Wales.

Nichols made one film appearance, in ''[[Glamour (1931 film)|Glamour]]'' (1931), directed by [[Seymour Hicks]] and [[Harry Hughes]], playing the small part of the Hon. Richard Wells. The film is now lost.

==Personal life==
Nichols was at school at [[Marlborough College]] before proceeding to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in January 1917. His education was interrupted by military service with the Intelligence section at the War Office, as an instructor to the Officer Cadet Battalion in Cambridge, and as aide-de-camp to [[Arthur Shipley]] on the British University Mission to the United States. Nichols then returned to Oxford, where he was President of the [[Oxford Union]] and editor of ''[[Isis (magazine)|Isis]]''.<ref name="life"/> He was homosexual and is thought to have had a brief affair with the war poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Jean Moorcroft Wilson |title=Siegfried Sassoon: The Journey from the Trenches: a Biography (1918-1967) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO9KDzIYSZoC |year=2003 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-96713-6|page=42}}</ref> Nichols's long-term companion was [[Cyril Butcher]], the main beneficiary of Nichols's will, amounting to £131,750.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Beverley Nichols' will – Sunday 22 January 1984, p. 5 |journal=The Observer |date=1984 |page=5 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16787118/the_observer/ |accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>

Nichols died on 15 September 1983 and his ashes were scattered over St Nicholas' Churchyard, [[Glatton]], Cambridgeshire, England.
