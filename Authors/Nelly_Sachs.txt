'''Nelly Sachs''' ({{IPA-de|ˈnɛliː zaks|-|De-Nelly Sachs.ogg}}; 10 December 1891 – 12 May 1970) was a German-Swedish [[Poetry|poet]] and [[playwright]]. Her experiences resulting from the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in [[World War II]] Europe transformed her into a poignant spokesperson for the grief and yearnings of her fellow [[Jews]]. Her best-known play is ''{{Lang-de|Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels|label=none}}'' (1950); other works include the poems "{{Lang-de|Zeichen im Sand|italic=no|label=none}}" (1962), "{{Lang-de|Verzauberung|italic=no|label=none}}" (1970), and the collections of poetry ''{{Lang-de|In den Wohnungen des Todes|label=none}}'' (1947), ''{{Lang-de|Flucht und Verwandlung|label=none}}'' (1959), ''{{Lang-de|Fahrt ins Staublose|label=none}}'' (1961), and ''{{Lang-de|Suche nach Lebenden|label=none}}'' (1971). She was awarded the [[1966 Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966]].

==Life and career==
Leonie Sachs was born in Berlin-[[Schöneberg]], Germany, in 1891 to a [[Jewish]] family. Her parents were the wealthy [[natural rubber]] and [[gutta-percha]] manufacturers Georg William Sachs (1858–1930) and his wife Margarete, née Karger (1871–1950).<ref>{{Nobelprize}}</ref> She was educated at home because of frail health. She showed early signs of talent as a [[dance]]r, but her protective parents did not encourage her to pursue a profession. She grew up as a very sheltered, introverted young woman and never married. She pursued an extensive correspondence with her friends [[Selma Lagerlöf]]<ref name=":0" /> and [[Hilde Domin]]. As the Nazis took power, she became increasingly terrified, at one point losing the ability to speak, as she would remember in verse: "When the great terror came/I fell dumb." Sachs fled with her aged mother to Sweden in 1940. It was her friendship with Lagerlöf that saved their lives:<ref name=":0" /> shortly before her own death Lagerlöf intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure their release from Germany. Sachs and her mother escaped on the last flight from Nazi Germany to Sweden, a week before Sachs was scheduled to report to a [[concentration camp]]. They settled in Sweden and Sachs became a Swedish citizen in 1952.

Living in a tiny two-room apartment in Stockholm, Sachs cared alone for her mother for many years, and supported their existence by translations between Swedish and German.<ref name=":0" /> After her mother's death, Sachs suffered several nervous breakdowns characterized by [[hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], and [[delusion]]s of persecution by Nazis, and spent a number of years in a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]]. She continued to write while hospitalized, and eventually recovered sufficiently to live on her own, though her mental health remained fragile. Her worst breakdown was ostensibly precipitated by hearing spoken German during a trip to Switzerland to accept a literary prize. But she maintained a forgiving attitude toward younger Germans, and corresponded with many German-speaking writers of the postwar period, including [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]].

On the 127th anniversary of her birthday, 10 December 2018, Sachs was commemorated with a [[Google Doodle]] in parts of Europe and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/nelly-sachs-127th-birthday|title=Nelly Sachs' 127th Birthday|website=www.google.com}}</ref>

== Paul Celan and lyrical poetry==

In the context of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]], her deep friendship with "brother" poet [[Paul Celan]] is often noted today. Their bond was described in one of Celan's most famous poems, "{{Lang|de|Zürich, Zum Storchen|italic=no}}" ("Zürich, The Stork Inn").<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/c/celan-selected.html Excerpt ''Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan''], translated by John Felstiner. [[W. W. Norton & Company|W. W. Norton]]. In ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Sachs and Celan shared the Holocaust and the fate of the Jews throughout history, their interest in Jewish and Christian beliefs and practices, and their literary models; their imagery was often remarkably similar, though developed independently. Their friendship was supportive during professional conflicts. Celan also suffered from artistic infighting ([[Claire Goll]]'s accusations of [[plagiarism]]) during a period of frustration with his work's reception. When Sachs met Celan she was embroiled in a long dispute with Finnish-Jewish composer {{ill|Moses Pergament|sv}} over his adaptation of her play ''{{Lang|de|Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels}}''. In Celan she found someone who understood her anxiety and hardships as an artist.

Sachs's poetry is intensely [[lyric poetry|lyrical]] and reflects some influence by [[German Romanticism]], especially in her early work. The poetry she wrote as a young woman in Berlin is more inspired by Christianity than Judaism and makes use of traditional Romantic imagery and themes. Much of it concerns an unhappy love affair Sachs suffered in her teens with a non-Jewish man who would eventually be killed in a concentration camp. After Sachs learned of her only love interest's death, she bound up his fate with that of her people and wrote many love lyrics ending not only in the beloved's death, but in the catastrophe of the Holocaust. Sachs herself mourns no longer as a jilted lover but as a personification of the Jewish people in their vexed relationship to history and God. Her fusion of grief with subtly romantic elements is in keeping with the imagery of the [[kabbalah]], where the [[Shekhinah]] represents God's presence on earth and mourns for the separation of God from His people in their suffering. Thus Sachs's Romanticism allowed her to develop self-consciously from a German to a Jewish writer, with a corresponding change in her language: still flowery and conventional in some of her first poetry on the Holocaust, it becomes ever more compressed and surreal, returning to a series of the same images and tropes (dust, stars, breath, stones and jewels, blood, dancers, fish suffering out of water, madness, and ever-frustrated love) in ways that are sometimes comprehensible only to her readers, but always moving and disturbing. Though Sachs does not resemble many authors, she appears to have been influenced by [[Gertrud Kolmar]] and [[Else Lasker-Schüler]] in addition to Celan.

In 1961 Sachs won the first [[Nelly Sachs Prize]], a [[literary award]] given biennially by the German city of [[Dortmund]] and named in her honour. The city commissioned [[Walter Steffens (composer)|Walter Steffens]] to compose the opera ''[[Eli (opera)|Eli]]'' based on her mystery play, which premiered at [[Opernhaus Dortmund|the new opera house]] in 1967. When, with [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], she was awarded the 1966 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], she observed that Agnon represented Israel whereas "I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobel-winners.com/Literature/nelly_sachs.html|title=Nelly Sachs|website=www.nobel-winners.com|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref> She read her poem "In der Flucht" at the ceremony.<ref name="Nobel Prize Speech">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1966/sachs/speech/|title=Nelly Sachs – Banquet Speech|access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> 

Sachs died from [[colorectal cancer]] in 1970. She was interred in the [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm. Her possessions were donated to the [[National Library of Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kb.se/|title=Kungliga biblioteket|website=www.kb.se}}</ref>
