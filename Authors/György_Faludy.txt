'''György Faludy''' (September 22, 1910, [[Budapest]] – September 1, 2006, Budapest), sometimes [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as '''George Faludy''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[poet]], writer and translator.

== Life ==

=== Travels, vicissitudes, and the memoirs born from them ===
Faludy completed his schooling in the [[Fasori Gimnázium|Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium]] and studied at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin and Graz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/09/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries|title=Obituary: Gyorgy Faludy|last=Gomori|first=George|date=2006-09-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref> During these times he developed radical liberalist views, which he maintained till the very last days of his life.

In 1938, he left Hungary for Paris because of his [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] ancestry, and then for the U.S. During World War II, he served in the American forces. He arrived back in Hungary in 1946. In April 1947 he was among a group{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that destroyed a Budapest statue of [[Ottokár Prohászka]], a Hungarian bishop who is respected by many but who is often considered antisemitic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0619&article=2006-0514-1347-06YOUI |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-09-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223224506/http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0619&article=2006-0514-1347-06YOUI |archive-date=2007-02-23 }}</ref> He only admitted his participation forty years later.

In 1949 he was condemned with fictitious accusations and was sent to the labor camp of [[Recsk]] for three years. During this time, he lectured other prisoners in literature, history and philosophy. After his release he made his living by translation. In 1956 (after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Revolution]]) he escaped again to the West. He settled in London, and was the editor of a Hungarian literary journal.

It was during his stay in London that Faludy wrote his memoir, which was soon translated to English, by which he is still best known outside Hungary: ''My Happy Days in Hell''. (It was only published in his native language in 1987, and since then in several further editions.) He moved to [[Toronto]] in 1967 and lived there for twenty years. He gave lectures in Canada and the U.S. and was the editor of Hungarian literary journals. In 1976, he received a Canadian citizenship and two years later was elected as an honorary doctor of the [[University of Toronto]] where he regularly taught. His poems were published by The New York Resident in 1980 (see below with the other collections).

In 1988 Faludy returned to Hungary. After the fall of communism, his works, which were forbidden, confiscated, destroyed and distributed as [[samizdat]] during the Communist period, were at last published in Hungary. New collections of poems appeared in the 1990s, and several translations as well. In 1994 he received the most prestigious award in Hungary, the [[Kossuth Prize]]. In 2000 he published the sequel of ''My Happy Days in Hell'': "After My Days in Hell" in Hungarian (no data available about any English translation), about his life after the labour camp. In the years preceding his death, Faludy was considered not only as a poet, a writer and a translator but as a living legend in Hungary.

Renowned for his anecdotes as well as his writing, he was a celebrated wit whose life story attracted the attentions of many a foreign author. Besides the many European based authors who visited Faludy, there was the Canadian author [[George Jonas]] who penned [[Munich (2005 film)|Munich]] as well as the columnist and poet/playwright [[Turn left at Gilgamesh|Rory Winston]].

=== Relationships ===
Faludy's first wife was Vali Ács. His second wife, Zsuzsa Szegő, died in 1963. They had a son, Andrew, born in 1955. Faludy's grandson, [[Alexander Faludy]], born in 1983,<ref>{{Cite journal

In 1963 Eric Johnson (1937–2004), a US ballet dancer and later a renowned poet in contemporary [[Latin]] poetry, read the memoir ''My Happy Days in Hell,'' became enchanted with the author, and traveled to Hungary in search of Faludy. At this time he began to learn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and finally caught up with Faludy three years later in Malta. He became his secretary, translator, co-author and partner for the next 36 years.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/96723 Poet's name lives on in parkette, Judy Stoffman, The Toronto Star, Oct 04, 2006</ref> In 2002 when Faludy married again, Johnson left for Kathmandu, Nepal, and died there in February 2004. In 1984, while living in Toronto, Faludy married Leonie Kalman (née Erenyi), a long-time family friend from Budapest and Tangier, Morocco, at Toronto City Hall.  George and Leonie kept their separate residences and did not consummate their marriage, but Leonie kept the Faludy name until her death in 2011 (in Fleet, Hants, UK), aged 102. In 2002, Faludy married a 26-year-old poet, Fanny Kovács. Faludy published poems written jointly with his wife. Even though Faludy was extremely open about his bisexuality, it wasn't revealed to the public until the Hungarian state-owned television broadcast an interview with him after his death.

=== A memorial park in Toronto ===
In 2006, a memorial park was built in his honor designed by the landscape architect Scott Torrance, facing his former apartment at 25 St. Mary's Street. It was initiated by the Toronto Legacy Project to commemorate the outstanding cultural figures of the city. A bronze plaque was placed in the park with his portrait, made by the Hungarian-born sculptor [[Dora de Pedery-Hunt]]. His poem ''Michelangelo's Last Prayer'', chosen by the poet, was carved on the plaque in English and in Hungarian.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1127253019174&call_pageid=968867495754&col=969483191630&DPL=IvsNDS%2f7ChAX&tacodalogin=yes {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref>

== Work ==

Faludy's translations of the ballads of [[François Villon]], and even more prominent rewritings (as he admitted several times), brought him huge popularity on their initial publication in 1934, and have been since published about forty times. He could have hardly expressed these ideas in any other way in his time. He wrote several volumes of poetry as well, some of which were published in English. His other outstanding success was ''My Happy Days in Hell'' (Pokolbéli víg napjaim), a memoir first published in 1962 in English translation, which was translated to French and German as well, but did not appear in the original Hungarian until much later.
