==Life and work==
Blessing was born in Minneapolis, and graduated from [[Minnetonka High School]] in 1967. He began his college education at the [[University of Minnesota]], Minneapolis, but later transferred to [[Reed College]] in Oregon where he earned a B.A. in English in 1971. After Blessing earned his degree, his parents offered the young graduate the choice between a used car or a trip to Russia. Blessing chose Russia where he found inspiration to write his best-known work, the award-winning ''[[A Walk in the Woods (play)|A Walk in the Woods]]''.  According to interviews with Blessing, the play, which depicts the developing relationship between a Russian and an American arms limitation negotiator is based on fact. Apparently, during the 1982 talks in Geneva, Switzerland, Soviet [[Yuli Kvitsinsky]] and American [[Paul Nitze]] left the formal discussions to literally take a walk in the woods. Following its premiere in Waterford, Connecticut, ''A Walk in the Woods'' was nominated for both a [[Tony award]] and a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Though the production won neither award, it was reprised produced in Moscow in 1989 and later adapted for television.<ref name="biography1"/>

Upon returning from his tenure abroad, Blessing went on to study playwriting at the University of Iowa where he received MFA degrees in English and Speech and Theater. He would later return to teach at the Iowa's Playwrights Workshop and the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] in addition to his time as an instructor at the Playwright's Center in Minneapolis.<ref name="biography2">{{cite book|title=''"Lee (Knowlton) Blessing."''
