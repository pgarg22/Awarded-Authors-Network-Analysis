She was at first incapable of reading due to a mild form of dyslexia, which was diagnosed later in life, but when she was aged 8, her father taught her to read in about a month, and she began to write at the age of 9.<ref name="carlson" /> She worked as a library assistant and a waitress before she tried herself as a writer.

=== Education ===
Because Lee's parents had to move for jobs, Lee attended numerous primary schools, then [[Prendergast School|Prendergast Grammar School for Girls]].<ref name="bio" /><ref name="moran" /> Three subjects inspired Lee: English, history, and religion. After high school, Lee attended [[Croydon College|Croydon Art College]] for a year. Realising that was not what she wanted to do, she dropped out of her course and held a number of occupations, including file clerk, waitress, shop assistant, and assistant librarian.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="moran" /><ref name="Gidney">{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/interviews/09/13/tanith-lee-queer-authors/|title=Tanith Lee: Channeling Queer Authors|author=Craig Gidney|date=13 September 2010|access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref>

=== Writing career ===
She began publishing work of genre interest with ''The'' ''Betrothed'' (1968), a short story privately printed by a friend, but started her career proper with several Children's Fantasies. Of these, The Dragon Hoard (1971), her first novel, is a comic fantasy, in which an affronted Enchantress compels the Quest-ridden protagonist to shapeshift humiliatingly into a raven at unpredictable moments. Princess Hynchatti & Some Other Surprises (collection of linked stories in 1972) puts its cast through various travails. In Companions on the Road (1975) the Companions are the Villains, a trio of hellish Revenants who kill through their control of Dreams as they search for the holders of a magic chalice. The Winter Players (1976) – assembled with the previous book as ''Companions on the Road and The Winter Players: Two Novellas'' ('''1977''') – dramatizes the interaction between a young woman and the Accursed Wanderer whom she ultimately redeems. Even in these early works, several characteristic motifs dominate: the Rite of Passage whereby a young protagonist comes to terms – often via Metamorphosis – with his or her extraordinary nature, and strives for Balance in a riven world; vivid, but indeterminate, landscapes serving as almost interchangeable backdrops for psychic dramas; and a fine indifference to any moralistic settling of scores, her tales tending to close with Good and Evil characters settling into uneasy equipoise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sf-encyclopedia.uk/fe.php?nm=lee_tanith|title=Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997) – Lee, Tanith|website=sf-encyclopedia.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>

Her first professional sale came from "Eustace," a ninety-word vignette at the age of 21 in 1968. She continued to work in various jobs for almost another decade, due to rejection of her books.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="Gidney" /> Her first novel (for children) was ''The Dragon Hoard'', published in 1971 by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]].<ref name="bio" /> Her career really took off with the acceptance in 1975 by DAW Books USA of her adult fantasy epic ''The Birthgrave'' – a mass-market paperback. Many British publishers rejected ''[[The Birthgrave]]'' thus she wrote to [[DAW Books]]. Lee subsequently maintained a prolific output in popular genre writing.<ref name="schweltzer" /><ref name="bio" /><ref name="martin">{{cite book|author1=George R. R.

She produced adult and young adult novels, science fiction, fantasy, horror, crime, spy fiction, erotica, a historical novel, radio plays and two episodes of the television space opera Blake's 7. Yet all her work shares a tone – Lee captured like few other modern writers a gothic, not to say goth, sensibility in which the relentless pursuit of personal autonomy and sensual fulfillment leads her characters to the brink of delirium, as well as to a fierce integrity that can co-habit with self-sacrificing empathy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/tanith-lee|title=Tanith Lee obituary|last=Kaveney|first=Roz|date=2015-06-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

However, Internet sales succeeded in reviving her writing.<ref name="Tanith"/>

==== Book sales ====
Lee had "quietly phenomenal sales" at certain periods throughout her career.<ref name="schweitzer2" /> When she tried changing her genre some of her works were liked by critics and published by small publishers, but it made no difference. The royalties were good before the publishers went bankrupt.<ref name="schweitzer2" />

=== Personal life and death ===
In 1987, Lee met artist and writer John Kaiine.<ref name="bio" /> In 1992, the couple married.<ref name="bio" />

When Lee was younger, she could write for long periods of time into the early morning hours.<ref name="carlson" /> Lee's routine began to modify because, as she aged, her stamina decreased.<ref name="carlson" /><ref name="LeeSide">{{cite web | url= http://www.tabula-rasa.info/Horror/TanithLee.html | title= On the Lee Side | year= 2011 | publisher= Tabula-Rasa | access-date= 1 October 2012}}</ref> Lee ended her workday around 6pm to break for dinner as opposed to writing all night.<ref name="carlson" /> In her free time, she watched history and nature channels on television. Lee and Kaiine were also huge fans of ''[[Doctor Who]]''. They lived in the south of England.<ref name="carlson" />

Lee died at her home in [[East Sussex]] of breast cancer on 24 May 2015.<ref name="LocusObit">{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/05/tanith-lee-1947-2015/|title=Locus Obituary|date=26 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="Obituary">[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/books/tanith-lee-fantasy-and-horror-novelist-dies-at-67.html?ref=obituaries Obituary:Tanith Lee, Fantasy and Horror Novelist, Dies at 67], By SAM ROBERTS, 1 JUNE 2015, The New York Times</ref>

== Works ==
According to Mavis Haut who has analyzed Tanith Lee's books to a great degree, Lee has an apparent liking for the transitional character of the bildungsroman.

In ''Birthgrave'', the experienced adolescent Uastis-Karrakaz, who is about to enter a male-preferring, adult world, starts out with unusually low self-esteem. She has been severed from childhood by a wholly dormant (latency) period and born directly into young womanhood. Haunted by blurred and often unintelligible memories, it is difficult for her to distinguish between the real and imaginary. Her contacts with the opposite sex are bruising and full of confusion and contradiction.

With great effort she learns to control her rebellious passions. She affects a studious bravado to mask her lack of confidence, but even at her most naive it is precisely her inability to resist her instincts and desires that is the foundation of her integrity. As she pieces herself together according to her own wayward nature, she is also piecing together a lost matriarchal culture.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmOSHrtlBK8C&q=tanith+lee&pg=PA10|title=The Hidden Library of Tanith Lee: Themes and Subtexts from Dionysos to the Immortal Gene|last=Haut|first=Mavis|date=2015-11-12|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786483686|language=en}}</ref>

Her two longest werewolves stories, "Wolfland" and ''Lycanthia'', follow Lee's custom of reversing the images of popular culture icons. The 20th century image of the werewolf is largely derived from Hollywood cinema; a man is involuntarily transmogrified into a crazed man-beast, which is consumed by an overwhelming desire to rend that which it loves best. Lee turns that typical portrayal on its head, a departure from Hollywood and folklore tradition and actually approximates the werewolves behaviors into the social and hunting patterns of natural wolves. In altering such a trope, she endows werewolf stories with a new and more positive mythos, a more natural symbolism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heldreth|first=Lillian M.|date=1989|title=Tanith Lee's Werewolves Within: Reversals of Gothic Traditions|journal=Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts|volume=2|issue=1 (5)|pages=14–23|issn=0897-0521|jstor=43310205}}</ref>

Tanith Lee's 1971 debut was the children's book ''The Dragon Hoard''; her first adult book was ''The Birthgrave'' in 1975.<ref name="Locus">{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/1998/Issues/04/Lee.html |title=Tanith Lee: Love & Death & Publishers|work=[[Locus Online]] |access-date=17 March 2009 |date=April 1998}}</ref> Lee's prolific output spans a host of different genres, including adult [[fantasy]], children's fantasy, science fiction, [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] horror, Gothic romance, and historical fiction. Her series of interconnected tales called ''[[Tales from the Flat Earth|The Flat-Earth Cycle]]'', beginning with ''Night's Master'' and ''Death's Master'', is similar in scope and breadth to [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[The Dying Earth]]''.<ref name="haut">{{cite book|author=Mavis Haut|title =The hidden library of Tanith Lee: themes and subtexts from Dionysos to the immortal gene|publisher =Wildside Press LLC|year =2001|isbn =978-0-7864-1085-9|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XmOSHrtlBK8C}}</ref>
''Night's Master'' contains allegorical tales involving Azhrarn, a demonic prince who kidnaps and raises a beautiful boy and separates him from the sorrow of the real world. Eventually, the boy wants to know more about the earth, and asks to be returned, setting off a series of encounters between Azhrarn and the Earth's people, some horrific, some positive. Later tales are loosely based on [[Babylonian mythology]]. In the science fiction ''Four-BEE'' series, Lee explores youth culture and identity in a society which grants eternally young teenagers complete freedom. They are even killed and receive new bodies, gender and/or identity over and over again. Lee has also dabbled in the historical novel with ''The Gods are Thirsty'', set during the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="haut" /><br />During the late 80's she published three collections - ''Dreams of Dark and Light'' (1986), ''Women as Demons'' (1989) and ''The Forests of the Night'' (1989).<ref name="Tanith" />

A large part of her output was children's fantasy, which has spanned her entire career from ''The Dragon Hoard'' in 1971 to the more recent ''The Claidi Journals'' containing ''Wolf Tower'', ''Wolf Star'', ''Wolf Queen'' and ''Wolf Wing'' in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name="holley">{{cite book|author=Pam Spencer Holley|title =Quick and Popular Reads for Teens|publisher =ALA Editions|year =2009|page=146|isbn =978-0-8389-3577-4|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=a1s36QUsvLcC&pg=PA146}}</ref>

Lee was published by various imprints, particularly depending on whether she is offering adult fiction or children's fantasy. Her earlier children's fantasy novels were published in hardcover by Macmillan UK and subsequently printed as paperbacks in the US often by DAW, with occasional hardcovers by St. Martin's Press. Some of her work was only printed in paperback, mainly in the US by DAW in the 1970s to the early 1980s. She has received some small press treatment, such as the Arkham House edition of short stories ''Dreams of Dark and Light: The Great Short Fiction of Tanith Lee'' in 1986, and in the first "Night Visions" instalment published by Dark Harvest. Some of her work has been released exclusively in the UK with US publications often pending.<ref name="schweltzer" />

== Writing style ==
Lee's style is frequently remarked upon for its use of rich [[poetic prose]] and striking [[Imagery (literature)|imagery]].<ref name="haut" /> Critics describe her style as weird, lush, vibrant, exotic, erotic, rich, elegant, perverse, and darkly beautiful.<ref name="Gidney2">{{cite web | url= http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2005_03_tanithlee.html | title= Delirium's Mistress: The Weird & Beautiful Fiction of Tanith Lee | author= Craig L.

== Themes ==
Lee's writing frequently featured nonconformist interpretations of [[fairy tales]], [[Vampire literature|vampire stories]], [[myth]]s, and the fantasy genre;<ref name="haut" /> as well as themes of [[feminism]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].<ref name="reid">{{cite book|author=Robin Anne Reid|title =Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews|publisher =ABC-CLIO|year =2009|pages=38, 199, 219|isbn =978-1-4391-5014-6|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jKr0jWY8FLkC}}</ref><ref name="fernandez">{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris/StudentProjects/Student_FairyTales/WebProject/Bios/Tanith%20Lee.htm|title=Tanith Lee|author=Angel Fernandez|year=2003|publisher=Modern and Traditional Fairy Tales, San José State University|access-date=25 July 2011}}</ref> She also wrote [[lesbian fiction]] under the pseudonym Esther Garber.<ref name="haase">{{cite book|author=Donald Haase|title =The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: G-P|publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group|year =2008|pages=568–569|isbn =978-0-313-33443-6|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-sj5cJz0_OsC&pg=PA558}}</ref> Other than feminism and sexuality, Lee used a wide range of other themes in her stories. From 1975 to 1980, she began writing Gothic science fiction; her first Gothic novel "Sabella or the Bloodstone" features themes of loneliness and fear.<ref name="Gidney2" /> Lee's most celebrated story "Elle Est Trois", which examines the relationship between self-destruction and creativity "has themes of psychosis and sexuality, the subjugation of women, and the persuasive power of myth interwoven through it". You will see myth again (along with [[Race (human classification)|race]]) in her stories "The Storm Lord", "Anackire", and "The White Serpent".<ref name="haut" /> Three unique horror series were produced by Lee in the '90s; the first story, ''[[The Book of the Damned (Tanith Lee)|The Book of the Damned]]'', features themes of body thievery and shape-shifting. Themes of [[homophobia]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]] are seen in Lee's sequence The Blood Opera, and ''The Venus Cycle'' features themes of love, loss, and revenge. Her collection ''Disturbed By Her Song'' features themes of [[eroticism]], despair, isolation, and the pressure of an unforgiving and unwelcoming society.<ref name = "Mandelo">{{cite web| url= http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/09/queering-sff-new-booksdisturbed-by-her-song-by-tanith-lee | title= Queering SFF: New Books-Disturbed by Her Song by Tanith Lee| author= Mandelo, Lee| date= 20 September 2010| publisher= Tor.com| access-date= 15 October 2012}}</ref> These themes reoccur in her 1976 novel ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'' where the characters are involved in a very erotic lifestyle and the protagonist experiences despair. Eroticism shows up again in her novel "Death's Master" which examines the childhood origins of eroticism and the "later conflicts that arise from it". The sequel to ''Don't Bite the Sun'', ''[[Drinking Sapphire Wine]]'', is thematically similar to her other works, in that it features themes of Death and renewal, sexuality, and love. The theme of recognition also appears in ''Drinking Sapphire Wine'', where the characters are forced to recognize others and themselves in a world where physical form is so readily alterable.<ref name="haut" />

== Influences ==
Tanith Lee was influenced by multiple genres, including other writers, music, movies, and "small things".<ref name="Innsmouth">{{cite web|url= http://www.innsmouthfreepress.com/blog/?p=3360|title= Tanith Lee Interview |author= Administrator |date=17 November 2009|publisher= Innsmouth Free Press|access-date=15 October 2012}} - An interview with Tanith Lee</ref> Her [[Flat Earth Series]] was inspired by a game she played with her mother; some of her other works are influenced by fairy tales her mother told her.

=== Other genres ===
Lee was also influenced by painters, movies, television, and music. She cites [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (whose symphonies influenced certain scenes in Anackire), [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Johnny Cash]] as musical influences. Film influences include ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (with [[Vivien Leigh]] and [[Claude Raines]]), Coppola's ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Dracula]]'', The ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (subtitled version), Olivier's ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]''. The various [[Bernard Quatermass|Quatermass]] TV series and films inspired Lee, along with the films ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956), [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957) and ''[[Plunkett & Macleane]]'' (1999). The TV version of [[Georg Büchner]]'s play ''[[Danton's Death]]'' (1978), inspired her to write her French historical novel. The painters that have inspired her include [[Vincent van Gogh]], Cotman, [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Gustav Klimt]], Rousseau, [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], and several pre-Raphaelites.<ref name="Locus" /><ref name="Innsmouth" />
