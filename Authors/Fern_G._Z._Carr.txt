==Personal life and education==
Fern G. Z. Carr was born in 1956 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Carr attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) and her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB). She received her Call to the Bar from the [[Law Society of Manitoba]]. After briefly practising law, Carr decided to pursue her interest in languages. She enrolled at le Collège Universitaire de Saint-Boniface where she received her Certificat en Éducation and was the recipient of the Manitoba Government Book Prize for highest standing in her program.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Manitoba 104th Annual Convocation |date=1983}}</ref> She subsequently taught French Immersion before moving to [[Kelowna]] with her family in 1999. She is married and is the sister-in-law of [[Jim Carr]], Member of Parliament for [[Winnipeg South Centre]].

==Writing style and influences==
Carr's early poetry from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s is more representative of traditional meter and rhyme. She subsequently began to experiment with different forms and styles while continuing to compose traditional poetry in set forms such as [[pantoum]] and [[ghazal]]. An admirer of [[Emily Dickinson]], Carr liked the use of [[em dashes]] and often incorporated them into her poems. In the 2000s, Carr's poetry style became more eclectic as she experimented with design. This was particularly evident in her [[Visual poetry|visual]] and [[concrete poetry]] as well as in her experimental math / science poems such as "The Fickle Nature of the Parabola"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=The Fickle Nature of the Parabola |journal=Windsor Review |date=Fall 2010 |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=128}}</ref> and "Holocaust Genealogy".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=Holocaust Genealogy |journal=Mgversion2 |date=July 2016 |volume=85 |page=84}}</ref> To date, her stylistic focus is [[free verse]].

While Carr's poetry primarily is written in English, she also composes poems in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Yiddish]] and the [[Chinese Mandarin]] dialect. Even though she occasionally translates the works of other poets, she tends to focus on bilingual and trilingual side-by-side translations of her own poetry.

Many of Carr's poems were influenced by her early years in Winnipeg's West End where she bore witness to poverty and crime. While this darkness is evident in some of her poetry, she also composes poems which evoke a diverse array of human emotions.

==''Shards of Crystal''==
''Shards of Crystal'' reflects a dichotomy and as such, is described as a metamorphosis of darkness to light. Dealing with issues such as suicide, trauma, dementia, cruelty to animals, and the death of a child, the book then gradually changes course. It begins its transformative move towards the beauty of life with poems about musicality, spiritual liberation and the philosophy of existence. It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, "I Am".<ref name="parl.ca">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>

The imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of "Shards" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of "Crystal" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: "Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Misérables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>
