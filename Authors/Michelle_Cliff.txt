'''Michelle Carla Cliff''' (2 November 1946 – 12 June 2016) was a Jamaican-American author whose notable works included ''[[Abeng (novel)]]'' (1985), ''[[No Telephone to Heaven]]'' (1987), and ''[https://www.amazon.com/Free-Enterprise-Novel-Ellen-Pleasant/dp/0872864375/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=free+enterprise+michelle+cliff&qid=1582404257&s=books&sr=1-1 Free Enterprise]'' (2004).

In addition to novels, Cliff also wrote short stories, [[Prose Poem|prose poems]] and works of [[literary criticism]]. Her works explore the various complex [[identity (social science)|identity]] problems that stem from the experience of [[post-colonialism]], as well as the difficulty of establishing an authentic individual identity in the face of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[gender]] constructs. A historical revisionist, many of Cliff's works seek to advance an alternative view of history against established mainstream narratives. She often referenced her writing as an act of defiance—a way to reclaim a voice and build a narrative in order to speak out against the unspeakable by tackling issues of sex and race.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American biography|others=Knight, Franklin W.,, Gates, Henry Louis, Jr.|year = 2016|isbn=978-0-19-993579-6|location=New York|oclc=927363773}}</ref>

Identifying as biracial and bisexual, Cliff, who had both [[Jamaica]]n and American citizenship used her voice to create a body of work filled with prose poetry, novels and short stories. Her writings were enriched by the power, privilege and pain of her multi-locatedness to creatively reimagine Caribbean identity.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Career and works==
Her first published work came in the form of [https://www.amazon.com/Claiming-Identity-They-Taught-Despise/dp/0930436067 Claiming an Identity They Taught Me to Despise]<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and covered the many ways Cliff herself experienced racism and prejudice.

Having found fellowship and community with African American and Latina feminists, Cliff's work thrived and contributed to enabling other's voices to be heard. Cliff was a contributor to the 1983 [[Black feminism|Black feminist]] anthology ''[[Home Girls]]: A Black Feminist Anthology''.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1984, Cliff published [https://www.amazon.com/Abeng-Michelle-Cliff/dp/0452274834/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CUVEAYFXX2M9&keywords=abeng+michelle+cliff&qid=1582401233&s=books&sprefix=abeng+miche%2Cstripbooks%2C205&sr=1-1 Abeng], a semi autobiographical novel that explores topics of female sexual subjectivity and Jamaican identity. Next came [https://www.amazon.com/Land-Look-Behind-Prose-Poetry/dp/0932379087/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Land+of+Look+Behind%3A+Prose+and+Poetry&qid=1582401720&s=books&sr=1-1 The Land of Look Behind: Prose and Poetry] (1985), which uses the Jamaican folk world, its landscape and culture to examine identity.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

At the heart of this novel, which continues the story of Clare Savage from her first novel, [https://www.amazon.com/Abeng-Michelle-Cliff/dp/0452274834/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=abeng+michelle+cliff&qid=1582404372&s=books&sr=1-1 Abeng], she explores the need to reclaim a suppressed African past.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

From 1990 on, Cliff's work is seen as having taken a more global focus, especially with her first collection of short stories, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525248641/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3 Bodies of Water].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In 1993 she published her third novel, [https://www.amazon.com/Free-Enterprise-Novel-Ellen-Pleasant/dp/0872864375 Free Enterprise], and in 1998 she published another collection of short stories, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0395901294/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i8 The Store of a Million Items].
