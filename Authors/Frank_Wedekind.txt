'''Benjamin Franklin Wedekind''' (July 24, 1864 &ndash; March 9, 1918) was a German [[playwright]].  His work, which often criticizes [[bourgeois]] attitudes (particularly towards sex), is considered to anticipate [[expressionism]] and was influential in the development of [[Epic theater|epic theatre]].<ref name="express">See Banham (1998) and Willett (1959). In his ''[[Messingkauf Dialogues]]'', Brecht cites Wedekind, along with [[Georg Büchner|Büchner]] and [[Karl Valentin|Valentin]], as his "chief influences" in his early years: "he", Brecht writes of himself in the third person, "also saw the writer ''Wedekind'' performing his own works in a style which he had developed in cabaret. Wedekind had worked as a [[ballad]] singer; he accompanied himself on the [[lute]]." (1965, 69).</ref>

In the English-speaking world, before 2006 Wedekind was best known for the "Lulu" cycle, a two-play series—''[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]'' (''Earth Spirit'', 1895) and ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die Büchse der Pandora]]'' (''Pandora's Box'', 1904)—centered on a young dancer/adventuress of mysterious origin. In 2006 his earlier play ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Frühlings Erwachen]]'' (''Spring Awakening'', 1891) became well known because of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical adaptation.

==Life and career==
Benjamin Franklin Wedekind was born on July 24, 1864, in [[Hanover]], [[German Confederation]], Große Aegdienstraße 13 (today: Friedrichswall 10). His mother was Swiss and became pregnant with him in [[San Francisco]]. His father, a German, had a Swiss castle in which Wedekind grew up, after the family had left Hanover in 1872. Until [[World War I]], when he was forced to obtain a German passport, he was an American citizen and traveled throughout Europe.<ref name="Simon">{{cite web|author=John Simon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/books/how-sex-killed-frank-wedekind.html?pagewanted=all |title=How Sex Killed Frank Wedekind - New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=1990-11-18 |access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref> He lived most of his adult life in [[Munich]], though he had a brief period working in advertising, for the [[Maggi]] soup firm, in Switzerland in 1886.<ref name="soup">Willett (1959, 98n).</ref>

Having worked in business and the circus, Wedekind went on to become an actor and singer. In this capacity, he received wide acclaim as the principal star of the [[satire|satirical]] cabaret ''Die elf Scharfrichter'' (''The Eleven Executioners''), launched in 1901.<ref name="cabaret">See Banham (1998) and Willett (1959, 87)</ref>  Wedekind became an important influence on the tradition of German satirical writing for the theatre, paving the way for the cabaret-song satirists [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]] and [[Erich Kästner]] among others, who after Wedekind's death would invigorate the culture of the [[Weimar Republic]]; "all bitter social critics who used direct, stinging satire as the best means of attack and wrote a large part of their always intelligible light verse to be declaimed or sung".<ref name="cabaret2">Willett (1959, 87).</ref> At the age of 34, after serving a nine-month prison sentence for ''[[Lèse majesté|lèse-majesté]]'' (thanks to the publication in ''[[Simplicissimus]]'' of some of his satirical poems), Wedekind became a [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] (a play-reader and adapter) at the [[Munich Kammerspiele|Munich Schauspielhaus]].<ref name="dramaturg">Willett (1959, 87, 106).</ref>

His sex life was promiscuous and he frequented prostitutes, contracting [[syphilis]]. He also enjoyed the pleasure of platonic female company and kept his tendencies toward [[homosexuality]] and [[sadism]] in check.<ref name="Simon" /> He had an affair with [[Frida Uhl]], who bore him a child.<ref>Meyer, Michael. ''Strindberg: A Biography'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987, p.363.</ref>  In 1906, he married the Austrian actress Tilly Newes, 22 years his junior and became strictly monogamous. His relationship with his wife was turbulent, with Wedekind prone to jealousy and he felt pressure to maintain strenuous creative and sexual activity in order to please her. They had two daughters, Pamela and Kadidja,<ref name="imdb.com">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1361159/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm] Bio of Tilly Wedekind on the IMDB website</ref> but his jealousy led his wife to attempt both separation and suicide.<ref name="Simon" />

Near the end of his life, Wedekind underwent an [[appendectomy]] and immediately began acting again, leading to a [[hernia]]. His doctor refused to operate immediately but Wedekind insisted and complications from the surgery led to his death at the age of 53 on March 9, 1918.<ref name="Simon" />

Tilly Wedekind went on to appear in such films as ''[[Travelling People (film)|Travelling People]]'' and was romantically linked to the author [[Gottfried Benn]].<ref name="imdb.com"/> In 1969, at age 83, she published an autobiography in German, ''Lulu: Die Rolle meines Lebens'' (Lulu: The Role of My Life).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45440083.html |title=DER SPIEGEL 47/1969 - Ehe und Atlas |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=1969-11-17 |access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref>

==Works==
Wedekind's first major play, ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Frühlings Erwachen]]'' (''Spring Awakening'', 1891), which concerns sexuality and puberty among some young German students, caused a scandal as it contained scenes of [[homoeroticism]], implied group male masturbation, actual male masturbation, [[sado-masochism]] between a teenage boy and girl, rape and suicide, as well as references to abortion.

The "Lulu" plays ''[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]'' (''Earth Spirit'', 1895) and ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die Büchse der Pandora]]'' (''Pandora's Box'', 1904) were probably his best known works until [[Spring Awakening (musical)|the 2006 adaptation of ''Spring Awakening'']]. Originally conceived as a single play, the two pieces tell a continuous story of a sexually-enticing young dancer, who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but who later falls into poverty and prostitution.<ref name="mueller">Mueller, Carl R. "Introduction" to''Frank Wedekind: Four Major Plays'', Vol 1, Lyme, New Hampshire: Smith and Krauss, 2000</ref> The frank depiction of sexuality and violence in these plays, including  [[lesbianism]] and an encounter with  [[Jack the Ripper]] (a role which Wedekind played in the original production),<ref name="willett">Willett (1959, 73n).</ref> pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] also helped Wedekind stage it in Vienna.<ref name="Bru06">Bru, Sascha and Martens, Gunther (2006) ''The invention of politics in the European avant-garde (1906–1940)'' pp.52-3</ref>

''[[The Court-Singer (play)|Der Kammersänger]]'' (''The Court-Singer'', 1899) is a one-act character study of a famous opera singer who receives a series of unwelcome guests at his hotel suite.

In ''[[Franziska (play)|Franziska]]'' (1910), the title character, a young girl, initiates a [[Faust|Faustian pact]] with the Devil, selling her soul for the knowledge of what it is like to live life as a man (reasoning that men seem to have all the advantages).

A number of Wedekind's works have been translated into English by [[Samuel Atkins Eliot Jr.]]
