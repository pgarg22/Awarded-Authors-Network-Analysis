'''Hans Wollschläger''' (17 March 1935, [[Minden]] &ndash; 19 May 2007, [[Bamberg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] writer, translator, historian, and editor of German literature.

==Biography==
Wollschläger is widely known as the translator of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]]. He also translated the complete works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (together with [[Arno Schmidt]]), and novels by [[Raymond Chandler]] and [[Dashiell Hammett]]. He was vice chairman of the '' Karl-May-Gesellschaft'' (''[[Karl May]] society'') and was one of the editors of the historical [[textual criticism|critical edition]] of this author.

He wrote several books of fiction and non-fiction, including a history of the [[Crusades]] which has a polemical aspect (at the close of the book he suggests the Catholic Church be declared a criminal organisation) but also contains excerpts from several Arabic sources never previously translated into German.

Originally Hans Wollschläger had studied music. He wrote three symphonies which have never been performed in public. He also worked on a performing edition of the draft of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s unfinished [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|Tenth Symphony]], which he never completed. However, under the influence of [[Erwin Ratz]], Wollschläger came to the conclusion that an unfinished masterwork should not be touched, and publicly withdrew his edition in 1962.
