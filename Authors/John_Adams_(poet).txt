'''John Adams''' (1704 â€“ January 22, 1740) was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]].

==Biography==
Adams was the only son of Hon. John Adams (merchant) of [[Nova Scotia]], and he graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1721.  He joined the ministry of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], on April 11, 1728, in opposition to the wishes of Mr. Clap, who was pastor there. Clap's friends formed a new society, and Adams was dismissed in about two years.

He was distinguished for his intellect and piety. As a preacher he was much esteemed. His uncle, Matthew Adams, described him as "master of nine languages," and claimed that he was conversant with the most famous Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish authors, as well as with the noblest English writers. He also speaks of his nephew's "great and undissembled piety, which ran, like a vein of gold, through all his life and performances."

Adams published a sermon on his ordination, 1728, and a poem on the love of money. He published two volumes of poetry: ''A Collection of Poems by Several Hands'' (1744), and ''Poems on Several Occasions'' (1745),<ref>''Who Was Who in America: Historical Volume, 1607-1896.'' Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1963.</ref> which contains imitations and paraphrases of several portions of scripture, translations from  Horace, and the whole book of Revelation in heroic verse, together with original pieces. The versification is remarkably harmonious for the period and the country. The following is an extract from his poem on [[Cotton Mather]]:<ref name=Allen/>

{{Poemquote|What numerous volumes, scattered from his hand,
Lightened his own, and warmed each foreign land?
What pious breathings of a glowing soul
Live in each page, and animate the whole?
The breath of heaven the savory pages show,
As we Arabia from its spices know.&mdash;
Ambitious, active, towering was his soul,
But flaming piety inspired the whole.|source=''Massa.-mag. for April 1789''; ''Backus' hist.'' abr. 158 ; ''Pref. to his poems''; ''Specimens of Amer. poetry'', I. 67.<ref name=Allen/>}}

He died at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on January 22, 1740, at the age of 36, deeply lamented by his acquaintance.<ref name=Allen>Allen, William.
