'''Adrienne Kennedy''' (born September 13, 1931) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]].<ref name="WPOD">Peterson, Jane T., and Suzanne Bennett. "Adrienne Kennedy." ''Women Playwrights of Diversity''. Westport, CT: [[Greenwood Press]], 1997. 201–205.</ref> She is best known for ''[[Funnyhouse of a Negro]]'', which premiered in 1964 and won an [[Obie Award]].<ref name="texas">[[Harry Ransom Center]]. "Biographical sketch". ''[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00067/hrc-00067.html Adrienne Kennedy: An Inventory of Her Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]''. [[University of Texas–Austin|University of Texas at Austin]].</ref> She won a lifetime Obie as well. In 2018 she was inducted into the [[Theater Hall of Fame]].

Kennedy has been contributing to American theater since the early 1960s, influencing generations of playwrights with her haunting, fragmentary lyrical dramas. Exploring the violence racism brings to people's lives, Kennedy's plays express poetic alienation, transcending the particulars of character and plot through ritualistic repetition and radical structural experimentation. Much of her work explores issues of race, kinship, and violence in American society, and many of her plays are "autobiographically inspired."<ref name="sollers_vii">Sollors, Werner. "Introduction", ''The Adrienne Kennedy Reader'', Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2001, p. vii. ([https://americanrepertorytheater.org/inside/articles/theater-adrienne-kennedy "An introduction to the playwright's work"], A.R.T.)</ref>

Kennedy is noted for the use of [[surrealism]] in her plays, which are often plotless and symbolic, drawing on mythical, historical, and imaginary figures to depict and explore the [[African Americans|African-American]] experience.<ref name="DLB">Wilkerson, Margaret B. "Adrienne Kennedy", in Thadious M. Davis and [[Trudier Harris]] (eds), ''Afro-American Writers after 1955: Dramatists and Prose Writers''. [[Dictionary of Literary Biography]] vol. 38. Detroit: [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]], 1985, p. 163.</ref>

In 1969, ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] wrote: "While almost every black playwright in the country is fundamentally concerned with realism—[[LeRoi Jones]] and [[Ed Bullins]] at times have something different going but even their symbolism is straightforward stuff—Miss Kennedy is weaving some kind of dramatic fabric of poetry."<ref name="nyt_owens">{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Clive |title='A Rat's Mass' Weaves Drama of Poetic Fabric |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 1, 1969 |page=39}}</ref> In 1995, critic Michael Feingold of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' wrote, "with [[Samuel Beckett]] gone, Adrienne Kennedy is probably the boldest artist now writing for the theater."<ref>Feingold, Michael. "Blaxpressionism." ''[[Village Voice]]'', October 3, 1995, p. 93.</ref> She has also written in other genres, including poetry and essays.

==Life and career==

Adrienne Kennedy was born Adrienne Lita Hawkins on September 13, 1931, in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Her mother, Etta Hawkins,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPl-p8tC4xg "Mrs Etta Hawkins 1926 Atlanta University scrapbook (mother of playwright Adrienne Kennedy)"]. YouTube.</ref> was a teacher, and her father, Cornell Wallace Hawkins, was a social worker. She spent most of her childhood in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], attending [[Cleveland Public Schools|Cleveland public schools]].<ref name="Andrews, William L. 1997">Andrews, William L., et al. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-9XtCY7cijMC&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=%22Adrienne+Cornell%22+adrienne+kennedy&source=bl&ots=3Eu8YKoGBy&sig=7PGdn8NI2dcpl3Oo5MLd5zRvMWQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiK76Olp4zXAhURY1AKHTmSA6gQ6AEITDAI#v=onepage&q=%22Adrienne%20Cornell%22%20adrienne%20kennedy&f=false "Adrienne Kennedy"], in William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster and Trudier Harris (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to African American Literature'', New York: [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]], 1997. 418–19.</ref> She grew up in an integrated neighborhood and didn't experience much racism until attending college at [[Ohio State University]]. As a child, she spent most of her time reading books like ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' instead of playing games with other children.

She admired actors like [[Orson Welles]] and began to focus on theater during her teenage years. ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' was among the first plays she saw produced, inspiring her to explore her passion for [[playwriting]]. Her interest in playwriting continued when she started at Ohio State in 1949. She graduated from Ohio State in 1953 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in education and continued her studies at [[Columbia University]] in 1954–56. She married Joseph Kennedy on May 15, 1953, a month after graduating from Ohio State,<ref>French, Ellen Dennis, [https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/kennedy-adrienne-1931 "Kennedy, Adrienne 1931—"], encyclopedia.com.</ref> and the couple had two children, Joseph Jr. and [[Adam P. Kennedy]].<ref name="Andrews, William L. 1997" /> They divorced in 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sternlicht|first1=Sanford|title=A Reader's Guide to Modern American Drama|date=2002|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=0815629397|pages=[https://archive.org/details/readersguidetomo0000ster/page/171 171]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/readersguidetomo0000ster/page/171}}</ref>

Her first play to be produced was ''[[Funnyhouse of a Negro]]'', a one-act play she wrote in 1960, the year she visited [[Ghana]] for a few months with her husband on his grant from the African Research Foundation.<ref>[[Hilton Als|Als, Hilton]], [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work "Adrienne Kennedy’s Startling Body of Work"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 12 & 19, 2018.</ref> The play draws on Kennedy's African and European heritage as she explores a "black woman's psyche, riven by personal and inherited psychosis, at the root of which is the ambiguously double failure of both rapacious white society and its burdened yet also distorted victims."<ref>[[Henry Louis Gates Jr.|Gates, Henry Louis Jr.]], et al. "Adrienne Kennedy", in Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Valerie A. Smith (eds.), ''Norton Anthology of African American Literature''. 3rd edition. Vol. 2, New York: Norton, 2014, pp. 617–19.</ref>

''A Rat's Mass'' was produced at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] twice in 1969<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.

As of 2018, Kennedy has written thirteen published and five unpublished plays, several autobiographies, a novella, and a short story. Kennedy used the alias Adrienne Cornell for the short story "Because of the King of France", published in ''[[Black Orpheus: A Journal of African and Afro-American Literature]]'' in 1963.<ref>Wetmore, Jr., Kevin J., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AiA96CqpgMoC&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=%22Because+of+the+King+of+France%22+adrienne+cornell&source=bl&ots=AsltR2IdUv&sig=FqF4EoB_nKxdScOvroLvkgquZ0U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz_e2KqozXAhXSa1AKHa40CHUQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=%22black%20orpheus%22%20%22Because%20of%20the%20King%20of%20France%22%20adrienne%20cornell&f=false "Adrienne Kennedy and Greek Tragedy"], in ''Black Dionysus: Greek Tragedy and African American Theatre'', [[McFarland & Company]], 2003, p. 88.</ref> Much of Kennedy's work is based on her lived experience.<ref name="Andrews, William L. 1997" />

Kennedy was a founding member of the Women's Theatre Council in 1971, a member of the board of directors of [[PEN American Center|PEN]] in 1976–77, and an [[International Theatre Institute]] representative in [[Budapest]], Hungary, in 1978.<ref name="Andrews, William L. 1997" />

== The Alexander Plays (1992) ==
Suzanne Alexander is a recurring character in several of Kennedy's plays. ''She Talks to Beethoven'', ''The Ohio State Murders'', ''The Film Club'', and ''The Dramatic Circle'' are collectively known as the Alexander Plays, and were published together under that title in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/adrienne-kennedy|title=African American Literature Adrienne Kennedy|author=Lovalerie King|year=2002|work=The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=November 23, 2013}}</ref> A letter written from Suzanne Alexander's perspective, "Letter to My Students on My Sixty-First Birthday by Suzanne Alexander," was also published in 1992. The Alexander plays are less overtly surreal than many of Kennedy's earlier works, but still avoid linear narrative. In the foreword to the printed collection of plays, Alisa Solomon, professor in the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University]], wrote: "the action of these plays is made up not of the events of Suzanne's life but of the process of turning memory into meaning."<ref name="Solomon">Solomon, Alisa. "Foreword", ''The Alexander Plays''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1992, p. xvi. {{ISBN|978-0816620777}}.</ref>
