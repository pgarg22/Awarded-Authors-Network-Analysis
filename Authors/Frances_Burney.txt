'''Frances Burney''' (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840), also known as '''Fanny Burney''' and later '''Madame d'Arblay''', was an English satirical novelist, diarist and playwright. In 1786–1790 she held the post as "Keeper of the Robes" to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], George III's queen. In 1793, aged 41, she married a French exile, General Alexandre d'Arblay. After a long writing career and wartime travels that stranded her in France for over a decade, she settled in [[Bath, England]], where she died on 6 January 1840. The first of her four novels, ''[[Evelina]]'' (1778), had the best success and remains best regarded. Most of her plays were not performed in her lifetime. She wrote a memoir of her father (1832) and many letters and journals that have been gradually published since 1889.

==Overview of career==
Frances Burney was a novelist, diarist and playwright. In all, she wrote four novels, eight plays, one biography and twenty-five volumes of journals and letters. She has gained critical respect in her own right, but she also foreshadowed such [[novel of manners|novelists of manners]] with a satirical bent as [[Jane Austen]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].

She published her first novel, ''[[Evelina]]'', anonymously in 1778. During that period, novel reading was frowned upon as something young women of a certain social status should not do, while novel writing was out of the question.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} Burney feared that her father would find what she called her "scribblings". When she published ''Evelina'' anonymously, she only told her siblings and two trusted aunts. Eventually her father read the novel and guessed that Burney was its author. News of her identity spread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/glance-evelina-fanny-burney/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029021304/www.openlettersmonthly.com/glance-evelina-fanny-burney/ |archive-date=29 October 2010 |title=Second Glance: Wave and Say Hello to Frances {{!}} Open Letters Monthly – an Arts and Literature Review |website=www.openlettersmonthly.com |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> The novel brought Burney almost immediate fame with its unique narrative and comic strengths. She followed it with ''[[Cecilia (Burney novel)|Cecilia]]'' in 1782, ''[[Camilla (Burney novel)|Camilla]]'' in 1796 and ''[[The Wanderer (1814 novel)|The Wanderer]]'' in 1814.

All Burney's novels explore the lives of English aristocrats and satirise their social pretensions and personal foibles, with an eye to larger questions such as the politics of female identity. With one exception, Burney never succeeded in having her plays performed, largely due to objections from her father, who thought that publicity from such an effort would be damaging to her reputation. The exception was ''Edwy and Elgiva'', which unfortunately was not well received by the public and closed after the first night's performance.

Although her novels were hugely popular during her lifetime, Burney's reputation as a writer of fiction suffered after her death at the hands of biographers and critics, who felt that the extensive diaries, published posthumously in 1842–1846, offer a more interesting and accurate portrait of 18th-century life. Today critics are returning to her novels and plays with renewed interest in her outlook on the social lives and struggles of women in a predominantly male-oriented culture. Scholars continue to value Burney's diaries as well, for their candid depictions of English society.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 231">Commire, Klezmer, p. 231.</ref>

Through her whole writing career, Burney's talent for satirical caricature was widely acknowledged: figures such as [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Samuel Johnson]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Hester Thrale|Hester Lynch Thrale]] and [[David Garrick]] were among her admirers. Her early novels were read and enjoyed by Jane Austen, whose own title ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' derives from the final pages of ''Cecilia''. Thackeray is said to have drawn on the first-person account of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] recorded in her diaries while writing his ''Vanity Fair''.<ref>[http://dept.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/burney/biofb.html Biography of Frances Burney<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616055007/http://dept.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/burney/biofb.html |date=16 June 2006}}</ref>

Burney's early career was strongly affected by her relations with her father and the critical attentions of a family friend, [[Samuel Crisp]]. Both encouraged her writing, but used their influence in a critical fashion, dissuading her from publishing or performing her dramatic comedies, as they saw the genre as inappropriate for a lady. Many feminist critics have since seen her as an author whose natural talent for satire was somewhat stifled by such social pressures on female authors.<ref name="Commire">Commire, Anne and Deborah Klezmer. ''Women in World History: a biographical encyclopedia''. (Waterford: Yorkin Publications, 1999–2002), p. 231.</ref> Burney persisted despite the setbacks. When her comedies were poorly received, she returned to novel writing, and later tried her hand at tragedy. She supported both herself and her family on the proceeds of her later novels, ''Camilla'' and ''The Wanderer''.

==Family life==
Frances was born in Lynn Regis, now [[King's Lynn]], England, on 13 June 1752, to the musician Dr [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814) and his first wife, Esther Sleepe Burney (1725–1762), as the third of her mother's six children. Her elder siblings were Esther (Hetty, 1749–1832) and James (1750–1821); those younger were Susanna Elizabeth (1755–1800), Charles (1757–1817) and Charlotte Ann (1761–1838). Of her brothers, [[James Burney|James]] became an admiral and sailed with Captain [[James Cook]] on his second and third voyages. The younger [[Charles Burney (scholar)|Charles Burney]] became a well-known classical scholar, after whom [[Burney Collection of Newspapers|The Burney Collection of Newspapers]] is named.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/newspdigproj/burney/index.html |title=17th and 18th Century Burney Collection Database |last=Turner |first=Adrian |website=www.bl.uk |language=en |access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> Her younger sister Susanna married in 1781 Molesworth Phillips, an officer in the Royal Marines who had sailed in Captain Cook's last expedition; she left a journal that gives a principal eye-witness account of the [[Gordon Riots]].<ref>Philip Olleson, ''The Journals and Letters of Susan Burney: Music and Society in Late Eighteenth-Century England''. Ashgate, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5592-3}}</ref> Her younger half-sister [[Sarah Burney|Sarah Harriet Burney]] (1772–1844) also became a novelist, publishing seven works of fiction.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 228">Commire, Klezmer 228.</ref> Esther Sleepe Burney also bore two other boys, both named Charles, who died in infancy in 1752 and 1754.

Frances Burney began composing small letters and stories almost as soon as she learnt the alphabet. She often joined with her brothers and sisters in writing and acting in plays. The Burney family had many close friends. "Daddy Crisp" was almost like a second father to Frances and a strong influence on her early writing years. Burney scholar Margaret Anne Doody has investigated conflicts within the Burney family that affected Burney's writing and her personal life.<ref>''Frances Burney: The Life in The Works'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press 1988), pp. 277 ff.</ref> She alleged that one strain was an incestuous relationship between Burney's brother James and their half-sister Sarah in 1798–1803, but there is no direct evidence for this and it is hard to square with Frances's affection and financial assistance to Sarah in later life.<ref>Lorna J. Clark, "Introduction", p. xii. In: Sarah Burney: ''The Romance of Private Life'', ed. Lorna J. Clark (London: Pickering & Chatto, 2008. {{ISBN|1-85196-873-3}}).</ref>

Frances Burney's mother, Esther Sleepe, described by historians as a woman of "warmth and intelligence", was the daughter of a French refugee named Dubois and had been brought up a Catholic. This French heritage influenced Frances Burney's self-perception in later life, possibly contributing to her attraction and subsequent marriage to Alexandre d'Arblay. Esther Burney died in 1762 when Frances was ten years old.<ref>Doody, p. 11.</ref>

Frances's father, [[Charles Burney]], was noted for his personal charm, and even more for his talents as a musician, a musicologist, a composer and a man of letters.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 228"/> In 1760 he moved his family to London, a decision that improved their access to the cultured elements of English society, and so their social standing.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 228"/> They lived amidst an artistically inclined social circle that gathered round Charles at their home in Poland Street, [[Soho]].

In 1767 Charles Burney eloped to marry for a second time, to Elizabeth Allen, the wealthy widow of a King's Lynn wine merchant. Allen had three children of her own, and several years after the marriage the two families merged into one. This new domestic situation was fraught with tension. The Burney children found their new stepmother overbearing and quick to anger, and they took refuge by making fun of her behind her back. However, their collective unhappiness served in some respects to bring them closer to one another. In 1774 the family moved again, to what had been the house of [[Isaac Newton]] in St Martin's Street, Westminster.

==Education==
Frances's sisters Esther and Susanna were favoured over Frances by their father, for what he perceived as their superior attractiveness and intelligence. At the age of eight, Frances had yet to learn the alphabet; some scholars suggest she suffered from a form of [[dyslexia]].<ref name=Epstein>Julia Epstein, ''The Iron Pen: Frances Burney and the Politics of Women's Writing''. (Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989) p. 23.</ref> By the age of ten, however, she had begun to write for her own amusement. Esther and Susanna were sent by their father to be educated in [[Paris]], while at home Frances educated herself by reading from the family collection, including [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives'', works by [[Shakespeare]], histories, sermons, poetry, plays, novels and [[courtesy book]]s.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 450">''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol. 4 (Chicago, London: Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 1971) p. 450.</ref> She drew on this material, along with her journals, when writing her first novels. Scholars who have looked into the extent of Burney's reading and self-education find a child who was unusually precocious and ambitious, working hard to overcome an early disability.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 450"/>

A critical aspect of Frances's literary education was her relationship with a Burney family friend, the "cultivated ''littérateur''" Samuel Crisp.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 450"/> He encouraged Burney's writing by soliciting frequent journal-letters from her that recounted to him the goings-on in her family and social circle in London. Frances paid her first formal visit to Crisp at [[Chessington Hall]] in Surrey in 1766. Dr Burney had first made Crisp's acquaintance in about 1745 at the house of [[Francis Greville, 1st Earl of Warwick|Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville]]. Crisp's play ''Virginia'', staged by [[David Garrick]] in 1754 at the request of the [[Maria Coventry, Countess of Coventry|Countess of Coventry (née Maria Gunning)]], had been unsuccessful, and Crisp had retired to Chessington Hall, where he frequently entertained Dr Burney and his family.

==Journal-diaries and ''Caroline Evelyn''==
The first entry in Frances Burney's journal was dated 27 March 1768 and addressed to "Nobody". The journal itself was to extend over 72 years. A talented storyteller with a strong sense of character, Burney kept the journal-diary as a form of correspondence with family and friends, recounting life events and her observations of them. The diary contains a record of her extensive reading in her father's library, as well as the visits and behaviour of noted personalities in the arts who came to their home. Frances and her sister Susanna were particularly close, and Frances continued to send journal-letters to her throughout her adult life.

Burney was 15 when her father remarried in 1767. Her diary entries suggest that she had begun to feel pressure to abandon her writing as something "unladylike" that "might vex Mrs. Allen."<ref>Doody 36.</ref> Feeling that she had transgressed, that same year she burnt her first manuscript, ''The History of Caroline Evelyn'', which she had written in secret. Despite this repudiation, Frances recorded in her diary an account of the emotions that led up to that dramatic act. She eventually recouped some of the effort by using it as a foundation for her first novel, ''Evelina'', which follows the life of the fictional Caroline Evelyn's daughter.

In keeping with Burney's sense of propriety, she savagely edited earlier parts of her diaries in later life, destroying much of the material. Editors Lars Troide and Joyce Hemlow recovered some of this obscured material while researching their late-20th-century editions of the journals and letters.

==''Evelina''==
[[File:Evelina vol II 1779.jpg|thumb|''[[Evelina]]'', Volume II, 4th edition (1779)|alt=Frontispiece of volume two of fourth edition of Evelina]]
Burney's ''[[Evelina]] or the History of a Young Lady's Entrance into the World'' was published anonymously in 1778 without her father's knowledge or permission, by Thomas Lowndes, who voiced an interest after reading its first volume and agreed to publish it upon receipt of the finished work. The novel had been rejected by a previous publisher, Robert Dodsley, who declined to print an anonymous work.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451">''Encyclopædia Britannica'', p. 451.</ref> Burney, who worked as her father's [[amanuensis]], had copied the manuscript in a "disguised hand" to prevent any identification of the book with the Burneys, thinking that her own handwriting might be recognised by a publisher. Burney's second attempt to publish it involved the collusion of her eldest brother James, who posed as its author to Lowndes. Inexperienced at negotiating with a publisher, he only extracted twenty guineas (£21) as payment for the manuscript.

The novel was a critical success, with praise from respected persons, including the statesman [[Edmund Burke]] and the literary critic [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 450"/> It was admired for its comic view of wealthy English society and realistic portrayal of working-class London dialects. It is known today as a satire.<ref>{{Cite web

Frances Burney and the Next Generations of Women Novelists". ''CW3 Journal'' [https://www2.shu.ac.uk/corvey/cw3journal/Issue%20one/pearson.html Retrieved 20 September 2015.]</ref> Burney's father read public reviews of it before learning that the author was his daughter. Although the act of publication was radical for its time, he was impressed by the favourable reactions and largely supported her. He certainly saw social advantages in having a successful writer in the family.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 229">Commire, Klezmer, p. 229.</ref>

==Critical reception==
Written in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] form just as this was reaching its height of popularity, ''Evelina'' portrays the English upper middle class through a 17-year-old woman who has reached marriageable age. It was a [[Bildungsroman]] ahead of its time. ''Evelina'' pushed boundaries, for female protagonists were still "relatively rare" in that genre.<ref name="foo-bar">Doody, p. 45.</ref> Comic and witty, it is ultimately a satire of the oppressive masculine values that shaped a young woman's life in the 18th century, and of other forms of social hypocrisy.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 228"/> ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' calls it a "landmark in the development of the novel of manners".<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 450"/>

In choosing to narrate the novel through letters written by the protagonist, Burney made use of her own writing experience. This course has won praise from critics past and present, for the direct access it provides to events and characters, and the narrative sophistication it demonstrates in linking the roles of narrator and heroine.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 229"/> The authors of ''Women in World History'' argue that she identifies difficulties faced by women in the 18th century, especially those on questions of romance and marriage.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 229"/> She is seen as a "shrewd observer of her times and a clever recorder of its charms and its follies". What critics have consistently found interesting in her writing is the introduction and careful treatment of a female protagonist, complete with character flaws, "who must make her way in a hostile world." These are recognisable also as features of Jane Austen's writing, and show Burney's influence on her work.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 228"/> Furthermore, she sought to put to use the epistolary form espoused periodically by Burney, as seen in ''[[Lady Susan]]'' and to a lesser extent ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1256&context=masters-theses |title=Jane Austen's use of the epistolary method |last=Bender |first=Barbara Tavss |access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref>

As a testament to its popularity, the novel went through four immediate editions. In 1971, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' stated of ''Evelina'': "Addressed to the young, the novel has a quality perennially young."<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/>

==Hester Thrale and Streatham==
The novel brought Burney to the attention of a patron of the arts, Hester Thrale, who invited Burney to visit her home in [[Streatham]]. The house was a centre for literary and political conversation. Though shy by nature, Frances impressed those she met, including Dr Johnson, who would remain a friend and correspondent throughout the period of her visits, from 1779 to 1783. Thrale wrote to Dr Burney on 22 July: "Mr. Johnson returned home full of the Prayes of the Book I had lent him, and protesting that there were passages in it which might do honour to [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]]: we talk of it for ever, and he feels ardent after the dénouement; he could not get rid of the Rogue, he said." Many of Dr Johnson's compliments were transcribed into Frances's diary. Sojourns at Streatham occupied months at a time, and on several occasions the guests, including Frances Burney, made trips to Brighton and to Bath. Like other notable events, these were recorded in letters to her family.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/>

==''The Witlings''==
In 1779, encouraged by the public's warm reception of comic material in ''Evelina'', and with offers of help from [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], Burney began to write a dramatic comedy called ''[[The Witlings]]''.

The play satirised a wide segment of London society, including the literary world and its pretensions. It was not published at the time because Burney's father and the family friend Samuel Crisp thought it would offend some of the public by seeming to mock the [[Blue Stockings Society|Bluestockings]], and because they had reservations about the propriety of a woman writing comedy.<ref>Doody, p. 451.</ref> The play tells the story of Celia and Beaufort, lovers kept apart by their families due to "economic insufficiency".<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 229"/>

Burney's plays came to light again in 1945 when her papers were acquired by the [[Berg Collection]] of the [[New York Public Library]].<ref>[[Orange Tree Theatre]], Richmond, Surrey: programme notes by the director [[Sam Walters]] for his world première production of ''The Woman Hater'' 19 December 2007.</ref> A complete edition was published in Montreal in 1995, edited by Peter Sabor, Geoffrey Sill, and Stewart Cooke.<ref>''The Complete Plays of Frances Burney''. Vol. 1, Comedies; Vol. 2, Tragedies (McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal, 1995). {{ISBN|0-7735-1333-7}}</ref>

==''Cecilia''==
In 1782 she published ''[[Cecilia (Burney novel)|Cecilia, or Memoirs of an Heiress]]'', written partly at [[Chessington Hall]] and after much discussion with Crisp. The publishers, [[Thomas Payne]] and [[Thomas Cadell (publisher)|Thomas Cadell]], paid Frances £250 for her novel, printed 2000 copies of the first edition, and reprinted it at least twice within a year.<ref>Journal entry of Charlotte Ann Burney, 15 January, [1783]. In: The Early Diary of Frances Burney 1768–1778, ed. Annie Raine Ellis (London: G. Bell and Sons Ltd., 1913 [1889]), p. 307.</ref>

The plot revolves around a heroine, Cecilia Beverley, whose inheritance from an uncle comes with the stipulation that she find a husband who will accept her name. Beset on all sides by would-be suitors, the beautiful and intelligent Cecilia's heart is captivated by a man whose family's pride in its birth and ancestry would forbid such a change of name. He finally persuades Cecilia, against all her judgement, to marry him secretly, so that their union – and consequent change of name – can be presented to the family as a ''fait accompli''. The work received praise for the maturity of its ironic third-person narration, but was viewed as less spontaneous than her first work, and weighed by the author's self-conscious awareness of her audience.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/> Some critics claim to have found the narration intrusive, while friends found the writing too closely modelled on Johnson's.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 229"/> Edmund Burke admired the novel, but moderated his praise with criticism of the array of characters and tangled, convoluted plots.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/>

Jane Austen seems to have been inspired by a sentence in ''Cecilia'' to name her famous novel ''Pride and Prejudice'':
"The whole of this unfortunate business," said Dr Lyster, "has been the result of pride and prejudice."

==The Royal Court==
[[File:Madame D'Arblay, by E. Burney.jpg|thumb|left|Print of 1782]]
In 1775 Burney turned down a marriage proposal from one Thomas Barlow, a man whom she had met only once.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 230">Commire, Klezmer 230.</ref> Her side of the Barlow courtship is amusingly told in her journal.<ref>''The Early Diary of Frances Burney 1768–1778''..., Vol. II, pp. 48 ff.</ref> During 1782–1785 she enjoyed the rewards of her successes as a novelist; she was received at fashionable literary gatherings throughout London. In 1781 Samuel Crisp died. In 1784 Dr Johnson died, and that year also brought her failure in a romance with a clergyman, [[George Owen Cambridge]]. She was 33 years old.

In 1785, an association with [[Mary Delany|Mary Granville Delany]], a woman known in both literary and royal circles, allowed Frances to travel to the court of [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] and [[Queen Charlotte]], where the Queen offered her the post of "Keeper of the Robes", with a salary of £200 per annum. Frances hesitated, not wishing to be separated from her family, and especially resistant to employment that would restrict free use of her time in writing.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/> However, unmarried at 34, she felt constrained to accept and thought that improved social status and income might allow her greater freedom to write.<ref>Literature Online 2.</ref> Having accepted the post in 1786, she developed a warm relationship with the queen and princesses that lasted into her later years, yet her doubts proved accurate: the position exhausted her and left her little writing time. Her sorrow was intensified by poor relations with her colleague [[Juliane von Schwellenberg|Juliane Elisabeth von Schwellenburg]], co-Keeper of the Robes, who has been described as "a peevish old person of uncertain temper and impaired health, swaddled in the buckram of backstairs etiquette."<ref>Austin Dobson, ''Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay)'' (London: Macmillan, 1903), pp. 149–150.</ref>

Burney's journals continued during her court years. To her friends and to Susanna, she recounted her life in court, along with major political events, including the [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|public trial]] of [[Warren Hastings]] for "official misconduct in India". She recorded the speeches of Edmund Burke at the trial.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 230"/> She was courted by an official of the royal household, Colonel [[Stephen Digby]], but he eventually married another woman of greater wealth.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 230"/> The disappointment, combined with the other frustrations of office, contributed to her health failing at this time. In 1790 she prevailed on her father (whose own career had taken a new turn when he was appointed organist at Chelsea Hospital in 1783) to request that she be released from the post, which she was. She returned to her father's house in Chelsea, but continued to receive a yearly pension of £100. She kept up a friendship with the royal family and received letters from the princesses from 1818 until 1840.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/>

==Marriage==
[[File:Juniper Hall Field Centre - geograph.org.uk - 111395.jpg|thumb|[[Juniper Hall]], near [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]] in [[Surrey]], where Burney met Alexandre d'Arblay]]
In 1790–1791 Burney wrote four blank-verse tragedies: ''Hubert de Vere'', ''The Siege of Pevensey'', ''Elberta'' and ''Edwy and Elgiva''. Only the last was performed. Although it was one of a profusion of paintings and literary works about the early English king [[Eadwig]] (''Edwy'') and his wife [[Ælfgifu, wife of Eadwig|Ælfgifu]] (''Elgiva'') to appear in the later 18th century, it met with public failure, opening in London in March for only one night.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica 451; ODNB entry for Eadwig: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8572 Retrieved 18 August 2011. Subscription required.]</ref>

The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789; Burney was among many literary figures in England who sympathized with its early ideals of equality and social justice.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 231"/> During this period Frances became acquainted with some French exiles known as "Constitutionalists", who had fled to England in August 1791 and were living at [[Juniper Hall]], near [[Mickleham, Surrey|Mickleham]], Surrey, where Frances's sister Susanna lived. She quickly became close to General Alexandre d'Arblay, an artillery officer who had been adjutant-general to [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], a hero of the French Revolution whose political views lay between those of [[Chouannerie|Royalist]] and of [[French First Republic|Republicans]]. D'Arblay taught her French and introduced her to the writer [[Germaine de Staël]].

Burney's father disapproved of d'Arblay's poverty, Catholicism, and ambiguous social status as an [[émigré]]. Nonetheless she and d'Arblay were married on 28 July 1793 at St Michaels and All Angels Church in Mickleham. The same year she produced her pamphlet ''Brief Reflections relative to the Emigrant French Clergy''. This short work resembled other pamphlets produced by French sympathisers in England, calling for financial support for the revolutionary cause. It is noteworthy for the way that Burney employed her rhetorical skills in the name of tolerance and human compassion. On 18 December 1794, Frances gave birth to a son, Alexander Charles Louis (died 19 January 1837), who took holy orders, being minister of Ely Chapel, London, and [[perpetual curate]] of [[Camden Town]] Chapel.<ref>Biographical Register of Christ's College, 1505–1905, vol. II, 1666–1905, John Peile, Cambridge University Press, 1913, p. 385.</ref><ref>The Annual Register, or a view of the History and Politics of the year 1840, J. G. F. & J. Rivington, London, 1841, p. 150.</ref> Her sister Charlotte's remarriage in 1798 to the pamphleteer [[Ralph Broome (pamphleteer)|Ralph Broome]] caused her and her father further consternation, as did the move by her sister Susanna and penurious brother-in-law Molesworth Phillips and their family to Ireland in 1796.

==''Camilla''==
The newly-weds were saved from poverty in 1796 by the publication of Frances's "courtesy novel" ''Camilla, or a Picture of Youth'', a story of frustrated love and impoverishment.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 230"/> The first edition sold out; she made £1000 on the novel and sold the copyright for another £1000. This was sufficient for them to build a house in [[Westhumble]] near [[Dorking]] in Surrey, which they called Camilla Cottage. Their life at this time was by all accounts happy, but the illness and death in 1800 of Frances's sister and close friend Susanna cast a shadow and ended a lifelong correspondence that had been the motive and basis for most of Burney's journal writing. However, she resumed her journal at the request of her husband, for the benefit of her son.<ref>''Encyclopædia Britannica'', p. 452.</ref>

==Comedies==
In the period 1797–1801 Burney wrote three comedies that remained unpublished in her lifetime: ''Love and Fashion'', ''A Busy Day'' and ''The Woman Hater''. The last is partly a reworking of subject-matter from ''The Witlings'', but with satirical elements toned down and more emphasis on reforming her characters' faults. First performed in December 2007 at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], it retains one of the central characters, Lady Smatter – an absent-minded but inveterate quoter of poetry, perhaps meant as a comic rendering of a Bluestocking. All other characters in ''The Woman Hater'' differ from those in ''The Witlings''.<ref>''The Witlings'' and ''The Woman-Hater'', plays by Fanny Burney; ed. Peter Sabor and Geoffrey Sill, Broadview Press (2002) {{ISBN|1-55111-378-3}}</ref>

==Life in France: revolution and mastectomy==
In 1801 d'Arblay was offered service with the government of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in France, and in 1802 Burney and her son followed him to Paris, where they expected to remain for a year. The outbreak of war between France and England overtook their visit and they remained there in exile for ten years. Although isolated from her family while in France, Burney was supportive of her husband's decision to move to [[Passy]], outside Paris.

In August 1810 Burney developed pains in her breast, which her husband suspected could be due to [[breast cancer]]. Through her royal network, she was eventually treated by several leading physicians, and a year later, on 30 September 1811, underwent a [[mastectomy]] performed by "7 men in black, [[Dominique Jean Larrey|Dr. Larrey]], M. Dubois, Dr. Moreau, Dr. Aumont, Dr. Ribe, & a pupil of Dr. Larrey, & another of M. Dubois". The operation was performed like a battlefield operation under the command of M. Dubois, then ''accoucheur'' (midwife or obstetrician) to the Empress [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] and seen as the best doctor in France. Burney later described the operation in detail, since she was conscious through most of it, as it took place before the development of anaesthetics.
<blockquote>I mounted, therefore, unbidden, the Bed stead – & M. Dubois placed me upon the Mattress, & spread a cambric handkerchief upon my face. It was transparent, however, & I saw, through it, that the Bed stead was instantly surrounded by the 7 men & my nurse. I refused to be held; but when, Bright through the cambric, I saw the glitter of polished Steel – I closed my Eyes. I would not trust to convulsive fear the sight of the terrible incision. Yet – when the dreadful steel was plunged into the breast – cutting through veins – arteries – flesh – nerves – I needed no injunctions not to restrain my cries. I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision – & I almost marvel that it rings not in my Ears still? so excruciating was the agony. When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. I concluded the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it!</blockquote>

She sent her account of this experience months later to her sister Esther without rereading it. It remains one of the most compelling early accounts of a mastectomy.<ref>Frances Burney letter 22 March 1812, in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, New York.[http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&annid=12724.]</ref> It is impossible to know today whether the breast removed was indeed cancerous.<ref name="Batt">{{Cite book |last1=Batt |first1=Sharon |title=Patient no more: the politics of breast cancer |date=2003 |publisher=Gynergy |isbn=978-0921881308 |pages=58–67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZY809r0PlUC&pg=PA58 |access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref> She survived, and returned to England with her son in 1812 to visit her ailing father and to avoid young Alexander's conscription into the French army. Charles Burney died in 1814, and she went back to France later that year after the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] had been concluded, to be with her husband.

In 1815 [[Napoleon]] escaped from [[Elba]], and [[Hundred Days|returned to power in France]]. D'Arblay, who was serving with the King's Guard, remained loyal to King [[Louis XVIII]] and became involved in the military actions that followed. Burney fled to Belgium. When her husband was wounded she joined him at [[Trier|Trèves (Trier)]] and together they returned to Bath in England, to live at 23 Great Stanhope Street. Burney wrote an account of this experience and of her Paris years in her Waterloo Journal of 1818–1832. D'Arblay was promoted to lieutenant-general, but died shortly afterwards of cancer, in 1818.<ref>Peter Sabor and Lars E. Troide, ''Chronology'' from ''Frances Burney – Journals and Letters''. Penguin Classics, 2001.</ref>

==''The Wanderer'' and ''Memoirs of Dr Burney''==
Burney published her fourth novel, ''[[The Wanderer: Or, Female Difficulties]]'', a few days before her father's death. "A story of love and misalliance set in the French Revolution", it criticises the English treatment of foreigners in the war years.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 231"/> It also pillories the hypocritical social curbs put on women in general – as the heroine tries one means after another to earn an honest penny – and the elaborate class criteria for social inclusion or exclusion. That strong social message sits uneasily within an unusual structure that might be called a melodramatic proto-[[mystery fiction|mystery]] novel with elements of the [[picaresque]]. The heroine is no scallywag, in fact a bit too innocent for modern taste, but she is wilful and for obscure reasons refuses to reveal her name or origin. So as she darts about the South of England as a fugitive, she arouses suspicions; it is not always easy to agree with the author that these are unfair or unjustified. There are a dismaying number of coincidental meetings of characters.

Some parallels of plot and attitude have been drawn between ''The Wanderer'' and early novels of [[Helen Craik]], which she could have read in the 1790s.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Adriana Craciun |author2=Kari Lokke |author3=Kari E. Lokke |title=Rebellious Hearts: British Women Writers and the French Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auxPmpSkTjsC |date=2001 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-4969-1 |page=219}}</ref>

Burney made £1500 from the first run, but the work disappointed her followers and did not go into a second English printing, although it met her immediate financial needs. Critics felt it lacked the insight of her earlier novels.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 231"/> It remains interesting today for the social opinions that it conveys and for some flashes of Burney's humour and discernment of character. It was reprinted in 1988 with an introduction by the novelist [[Margaret Drabble]] in the "Mothers of the Novel" series.<ref>Fanny Burney: ''The Wanderer or, Female Difficulties'' (London: Pandora Press, 1988). {{ISBN|0-86358-263-X}}</ref>

After her husband's death at 23 Great Stanhope Street, Bath, Burney moved to London to be nearer to her son, then a fellow at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/> In homage to her father she gathered and in 1832 published in three volumes the ''Memoirs of Doctor Burney''. These were written in a panegyric style, praising her father's accomplishments and character, and she drew on many of her own personal writings from years before to produce them. Always protective of her father and the family reputation, she destroyed evidence of facts that were painful or unflattering and was soundly criticised by contemporaries and later by historians for doing so.<ref name="Commire, Klezmer 231"/>

==Later life==
Burney outlived her son, who died in 1837, and her sister Charlotte Broome, who died in 1838. While in Bath, Burney received visits from younger members of the Burney family, who found her a fascinating storyteller with a talent for imitating the personalities that she described.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 451"/> She continued to write often to members of her family.

Frances Burney died on 6 January 1840. She was buried with her son and her husband in [[Walcot, Bath|Walcot]] cemetery in Bath. A gravestone was later erected in the churchyard of [[Church of St Swithin, Bath|St Swithin's]] across the road, adjacent to that of Jane Austen's father, [[George Austen (clergyman)|George Austen]].

==Plaques and memorials==
In addition to the gravestone erected in the churchyard of St Swithin, Bath, other memorials and plaques record Burney's life.

A plaque on the wall at 84 High Street, [[King's Lynn]], shows where she and her father lived in the 1750s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frances Burney and Charles Burney green plaque |url=https://openplaques.org/plaques/42342 |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=openplaques.org |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 1780, two years after the publication of Evelina, she stayed at 14 South Parade, Bath, with Mr and Mrs Thrale, who were great friends of Dr Johnson.  A plaque on the wall of the house records her visit.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fanny Burney |url=http://bath-heritage.co.uk/burney.html |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=bath-heritage.co.uk}}</ref>

At 78 West Street, [[Brighton]], Sussex a [[blue plaque]] records her visits to the Thrales' home there.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Henry Thrale, Hester Thrale, Samuel Johnson, and Frances Burney blue plaque |url=https://openplaques.org/plaques/975 |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=openplaques.org |language=en-GB}}</ref>

At Windsor Castle Wall, St Alban's Street, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], a plaque records the residence of [[Mary Delaney]] between 1785 and 1788, where she was frequently visited by Burney.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frances Burney and Mary Delany blue plaque |url=https://openplaques.org/plaques/1810 |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=openplaques.org |language=en-GB}}</ref>

A blue plaque on a wall in Chapel Lane, [[Westhumble]], Surrey records the d'Arblays' life there in their cottage, 'Camilla', which they built and in which they lived between 1797 and 1801.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frances Burney and Alexandre D'Arblay blue plaque |url=https://openplaques.org/plaques/1119 |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=openplaques.org |language=en-GB}}</ref>

At St Margaret's Vicarage, St Margaret's Place, [[Kings Lynn]] a blue plaque records Burney's regular visits there, where she observed the social life of Lynn.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frances Burney and St Margaret's Vicarage green plaque |url=https://openplaques.org/plaques/1705 |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=openplaques.org |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 2013, a marble plaque was unveiled in the gallery of St Swithin's Church, Bath, to record Burney's life. This replaces two original plaques – one to her and one to her half-sister Sarah Harriet – that were lost. In 1958, the St Swithin's church authorities had sought to protect the plaques by removing them during renovations to the church organ, but they later disappeared.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davenport |first=Hester |date=2013 |title=Fanny Burney's Bath Plaque Unveiled – Number One London |url=http://numberonelondon.net/2013/06/fanny-burneys-bath-plaque-unveiled/ |access-date=2020-06-15 |language=en-US}}</ref>
