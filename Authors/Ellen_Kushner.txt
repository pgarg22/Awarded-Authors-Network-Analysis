== Career ==
Kushner's first books were five [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] [[gamebook]]s. During that period, she published her first [[novel]], ''[[Swordspoint]]'' in 1987. A sequel set 18 years after ''Swordspoint'', called ''The Privilege of the Sword'', was published in July 2006, with a first hardcover edition published in late August 2006 by [[Small Beer Press]]. ''The Fall of the Kings'' (2002) (co-authored by Sherman) is set 40 years after ''Swordspoint.'' All three books are considered [[mannerpunk]] novels, and take place in a nameless imaginary [[capital city]] and its raffish district of Riverside, where swordsmen-for-hire ply their trade.

From 2011 to 2014 [[audiobook]] versions of all three novels were produced under the label of [[Neil Gaiman]] Presents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.acx.com/2011/10/25/neil-gaiman-presents-launches-on-acx/|title='Neil Gaiman Presents' Launches on ACX|date=25 October 2011}}</ref> The ''Swordspoint'' adaptation won the 2013 [[Audie Award]] for Best Audio Drama,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audible.com/mt/Audie_Awards_2013a_Aud_Drama/ref=amb_link_371776942_87?ie=UTF8&pf_rd_m=A2ZO8JX97D5MN9&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_r=00J27M60Y7B3285QDG8N&pf_rd_p=1561307642&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_i=Audie_Awards_2013|title=Audie Award Best Drama|access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref> an Earphones Award from ''[[AudioFile (magazine)|AudioFile]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/reviews/read/70648/|title=Swordspoint:A Melodrama of Manners|access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref> and the 2013 Communicator Award: Gold Award of Excellence (Audio).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.communicatorawards.com/winners/list/?event=8&category=1&award=E|title=19th annual Communicator Award of Excellence Winners|access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref> The adaptation of ''The Fall of the Kings'' won the 2014 Wilbur Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suemediaproductions.com/awards.html|title= Sue Media Productions – Awards|access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref>
