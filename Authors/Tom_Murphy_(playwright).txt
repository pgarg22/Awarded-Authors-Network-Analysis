'''Tom Murphy''' (23 February 1935 – 15 May 2018) was an Irish dramatist who worked closely with the [[Abbey Theatre]] in Dublin and with [[Druid Theatre]], Galway. He was born in [[County Galway]], Ireland and later lived in [[Dublin]].

Murphy's first successful play, ''[[A Whistle in the Dark]]'', was performed at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] in London in 1961 and caused considerable controversy both there and in Dublin when it was later given its Irish premiere at the Abbey having initially been rejected by its artistic director.

==Life==
Murphy was born in [[Tuam]], [[County Galway]], the youngest of ten children.<ref name= OMahony>{{cite news |last= O'Mahony |first= John |date=7 March 2010 |title= Playwright Tom Murphy: 'There is a rage within me' |url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/07/tom-murphy-the-sanctuary-lamp |newspaper= The Guardian |accessdate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> His elder siblings gradually emigrated to [[Birmingham]] until he was left alone with his mother.<ref name= Toibin>{{cite news |last= Toibín |first= Colm |date= Summer 2012 |title= Tom Murphy |url= http://bombsite.com/issues/120/articles/6616 |newspaper= Bomb Magazine |accessdate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> He played at centre half back for the Galway Vocational Schools [[Gaelic football]] team in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Carney|author-link=Jim Carney (poet)|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/why-have-football-and-hurling-remained-a-cultural-wasteland-for-our-writers-and-artists-39103123.html|title=Why have football and hurling remained a cultural wasteland for our writers and artists?|work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=5 April 2020}}</ref> He attended  [[Archbishop McHale College]] in Tuam , was an apprentice at the Tuam Sugar Factory and later became a metalwork teacher at Archbishop McHale College.

He began writing in the late 1950s: "In 1958, my best friend said to me, why don't we write a play? I didn't think it was an unusual question, because in 1958 everyone in Ireland was writing a play". His second play, ''[[A Whistle in the Dark]]'', was written in his Tuam kitchen on his free Friday and Saturday nights. It was entered into a competition for amateur plays, which it won, and was eventually produced in London in 1961, having been rejected by the [[Abbey Theatre]].

Though Murphy was religious as a boy, His 1975 play ''[[The Sanctuary Lamp]]'' was produced in the [[Abbey Theatre]] and received a hostile reception due to its anti-Catholic nature, with theatregoers walking out and much negative criticism in the media.

After this controversy Murphy worked as a farmer for some years.

Murphy died on 15 May 2018. He is survived by his wife, actress Jane Brennan and his three children by his first wife Mary and a granddaughter. The President of Ireland [[Michael D. Higgins]] said: "The importance of Tom Murphy’s contribution to Irish theatre is immeasurable and outstanding. We have had no greater use of language for the stage than in the body of work produced by Tom Murphy since his earliest work in the 1960s."<ref>Clement, Olivia.

==Writing career==
Considered by many to be one of Ireland's greatest playwrights,<ref>{{cite news |last= McKeon |first= Belinda|date=9 July 2012 |title= Home to Darkness: An Interview with Playwright Tom Murphy |url= http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/07/09/home-to-darkness-an-interview-with-playwright-tom-murphy/ |newspaper= Paris Review |accessdate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> Tom Murphy was honoured by the Abbey Theatre in 2001 by a retrospective season of six of his plays. His plays include the historical epic ''Famine'' (1968) which deals with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of Ireland]] between 1846 and spring 1847, the anti-clerical ''[[The Sanctuary Lamp]]'' (1975), ''[[The Gigli Concert]]'' (1983) and for many his masterpiece, the lyrical ''Bailegangaire'' and the bar-room comedy ''[[Conversations on a Homecoming]]'' (both 1985).

His work is characterised by a constant experimentation in form and content from the apparently naturalistic ''[[A Whistle in the Dark]]'' to the surreal ''The Morning After Optimism'' and the spectacularly verbal ''[[The Gigli Concert]]''. Recurring themes include the search for redemption and hope in a world apparently deserted by God and filled with suffering. Although steeped in the culture and mythology of Ireland, Murphy's work does not trade on familiar clichés of Irish identity, dealing instead with Dostoyevskian themes of violence, nihilism and despair while never losing sight of the presence of laughter, humour and the possibilities of love and transcendence. His works are often described as being filled with rage, with Murphy himself stating "There is a rage in me which I think is a natural thing. It was in me when I was 24 or 25, scribbling with my stub of a pencil. And it's still there in everything I do. Rage not against the unfairness of life – life is of course unfair – but against the inequalities, the arrogance of power."<ref name=OMahony/>

Younger playwrights whose work shows an indebtedness to him include [[Conor McPherson]], [[Martin McDonagh]] and [[Gary Mitchell]]. His latest plays include ''The Wake'' (1997), ''The House'' (2000) and ''The Alice Trilogy'', which premiered in 2005 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London with [[Juliet Stevenson]] in the eponymous role. In 2006 Murphy directed the Irish premiere of the same play at the Peacock Theatre in Dublin with Jane Brennan in the lead role. In 2009, his play, ''The Last Days of a Reluctant Tyrant'' premiered at the Abbey Theatre.

His play ''The Sanctuary Lamp'' was performed at the [[Arcola Theatre]] in [[Dalston]], London from 10 March to 3 April 2010, directed by Murphy himself.

He wrote one novel, ''The Seduction of Morality'' (1994).
