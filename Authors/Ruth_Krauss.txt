'''Ruth Ida Krauss''' (July 25, 1901 – July 10, 1993) was an American writer of [[children's books]], including ''[[The Carrot Seed]]'', and of theatrical poems for adult readers.<ref name=wills/> Many of her books are still in print.<ref name=harper/><ref name=carrot60/>

==Early life and education==
Ruth Krauss was born July 25, 1901, in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] to Julius Leopold and Blanche Krauss.<ref name=nel/> As a child, Ruth had numerous health problems, including the rare autoimmune disorder [[pemphigus]].<ref name=nel/> She began writing and illustrating her own stories while still a child, hand sewing her pages into books.<ref name=nel/>

Ruth went to a local high school but left in 1917 after her sophomore year to focus on the study of art. She enrolled in the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (now known as the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]). The school's focus on applied arts did not suit her and she left after about a year.<ref name=nel/> Her next stop was a girls camp, Camp Walden in Maine, where she discovered her love for writing; the camp yearbook for 1919 contains her first published piece of writing.<ref name=nel/> After the camp, she spent some time studying violin in the Peabody Institute of Music's preparatory program. She was considered a gifted but undisciplined musician by her teachers.<ref name=nel/>

Ruth's father died in late 1921, requiring Ruth to drop out of school. She took a series of office jobs. In 1927, she decided to enroll at the [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parsons School of Design]] in New York.<ref name=NYT/> Graduating from Parsons in 1929, as the [[Great Depression]] was beginning, she found it difficult to get work as an illustrator. Among the work she did find in this period was the first pictorial book jacket for the Modern Library (''Alice in Wonderland'', 1932).<ref name=nel/>

Ruth was a member of the Writers' Laboratory at the [[Bank Street College of Education]] in New York during the 1940s.

In the 1930s, Ruth was married to journalist and crime novelist [[Lionel White]]; they divorced shortly before World War II.

==Personal life and career==
Ruth Krauss married children's book author [[Crockett Johnson]] in 1943. They collaborated on many books, among them ''[[The Carrot Seed]]'', ''How to Make an Earthquake'', ''Is This You?'' and ''The Happy Egg''.<ref name=NYT/>

Another eight of her books were illustrated by [[Maurice Sendak]], starting with ''A Hole Is to Dig'' (1952), which launched Sendak's career.<ref name=nel/><ref name=NYT/> The Krauss-Sendak collaborations spawned a host of imitators of their "unruly" and "rebellious" child protagonists.<ref name=jules/> The peculiar definitional phrasing of Krauss's writing in this book—with sentences like "A party is to make little children happy"—became something of a cultural phenomenon when the book was first published and has helped to maintain its popularity.<ref name=nel/>

Krauss also illustrated a few of her own books.<ref name=papers/> In addition to her books for children, Krauss wrote three collections of poetry and plays in verse for adults.<ref name=NYT/>

==Recognition==
Two books that Krauss wrote were runners-up for the prestigious [[Caldecott Medal]], which is awarded to children's book illustrators:''The Happy Day'' (1950) and ''A Very Special House'' (1954).<ref name=NYT/> 

Maurice Sendak characterized Krauss as a giant in the world of children's literature, saying: "Ruth broke rules and invented new ones, and her respect for the natural ferocity of children bloomed in to poetry that was utterly faithful to what was true in their lives".<ref name="nel" /> He honored her in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cover illustration for Sept. 27, 1993, which shows a homeless boy using Krauss's book ''A Hole Is to Dig'' as a pillow.<ref name="nel" />
