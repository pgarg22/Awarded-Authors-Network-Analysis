'''Maurice Henry Hewlett''' (1861 – 15 June 1923) was an English historical novelist, poet and essayist.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Harris, George William|title=The Work of Maurice Hewlett|journal=The American Review of Reviews|year=1909|volume=40|pages=251–252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5H8fAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA251}}</ref>

==Biography==
He was born at [[Weybridge]], the eldest son of Henry Gay Hewlett, of Shaw Hall, Addington, Kent. He was educated at the [[London International College]], Spring Grove, [[Isleworth]], and was called to the bar in 1891. He gave up the law after the success of ''The Forest Lovers''. From 1896 to 1901 he was Keeper of Lands,  Revenues, Records and Enrolments, a government post as adviser on matters of medieval law.

Hewlett married [[Hilda Hewlett|Hilda Beatrice Herbert]] on 3 January 1888 in [[St Peter's Church, Vauxhall]], where her father was the incumbent vicar. The couple had two children, a daughter, Pia, and a son, Francis, but separated in 1914, partly due to Hilda's increasing interest in aviation. In 1911, Hilda had become the first woman in the UK to gain a pilot's licence.<ref>[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_civil/1911.cfm British Civil Aviation in 1911] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709031451/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_civil/1911.cfm |date=2009-07-09 }} Rafmuseum.org.uk</ref>

He settled at [[Broad Chalke]], [[Wiltshire]]. His friends included [[Evelyn Underhill]], and [[Ezra Pound]], whom he met at the [[Poets' Club]] in London. He was also a friend of [[J. M. Barrie]], who named one of the pirates in ''[[Peter Pan]]'' "Cecco" after Hewlett's son.

Hewlett's 1900 novel ''The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay'', about [[Cultural depictions of Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], was a favourite novel of [[T. E. Lawrence]]. Lawrence said he had read ''The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay'' several times.<ref>"He (Lawrence) studied medieval writings such as the [[chansons de geste]], and also enjoyed historical romances about the Middle Ages, reading Maurice Hewlett's ''Richard Yea and Nay'' over and over again..." [[Jeremy Wilson|Wilson, Jeremy]], ''[[Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence]]'' Atheneum, 1990. {{ISBN|9780689119347}}  (p.52).</ref> Another of Hewlett's historical novels was ''The Queen's Quair'' (1904), about [[Cultural depictions of Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary, Queen of Scots]]. ''The Queen's Quair'' was cited as an influence by [[Ford Madox Ford]], who said that ''The Queen's Quair'' "taught me a good deal".<ref>Wiesenfarth, Joseph, ''History and Representation in Ford Madox Ford's Writings''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2004 {{ISBN|9789042016132}} (p.112).</ref> Hewlett also wrote six novels based on the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic Family sagas]], these include ''The Light Heart'' and ''Thorgils of Treadholt''. Hewlett also wrote ''The Outlaw'' (based on ''[[Gísla saga|Gisli's Saga]]''), ''A Lover's Tale'' (based on ''[[Kormáks saga|Kormak's Saga]]''), ''Frey and His Wife'' (based on [[Ögmundar þáttr dytts|Ogmund Dytt]]'s tale), and ''Gudred the Fair'' (based on the ''[[Grœnlendinga saga|Greenland sagas]]'').<ref>Sutherland, Brice, ''Maurice Hewlett: A Bibliography''. Boston : F.W. Faxon Company, 1935. (p. 5)</ref>

Hewlett was parodied by [[Max Beerbohm]] in ''[[A Christmas Garland]]'' in the part titled "Fond Hearts Askew".

Maurice Hewlett died in London on 15 June 1923 at age 62.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41344663/maurice_hewlett_british_novelist_dies/ |title=Maurice Hewlett, British Novelist Dies in London |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |location=London |page=33 |date=1923-06-17 |access-date=2019-12-30 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>
