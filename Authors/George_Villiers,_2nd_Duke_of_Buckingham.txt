==Life==

===Early life===
{{main|Villiers family}}
George was the son of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]],{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}} [[royal favourite|favourite]] of [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and his wife [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine Manners]]. He was only seven months old when his father was assassinated at [[Portsmouth]] by the renegade officer [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]].{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=68}} Subsequently, he was brought up in the royal household of Charles I, together with his younger brother Francis and the King's own children, the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[James II of England|James II]].{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=68}} He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he obtained the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] in 1642.{{sfn|ACAD|VLRS641G}} For a time he was taught geometry by [[Thomas Hobbes]].{{snf|Hobbes|Malcolm|1994|p=778}} During this time he was also acquainted with [[George Aglionby]], whose influence he later accredited with persuading him to follow the English King in the Civil War.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1871|p=30}}.</ref>

=== Involvement in the English Civil War ===

In the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he fought for [[Charles I of England|the King]], and took part in [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s [[Siege of Lichfield|attack on Lichfield Close]] in April 1643.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

Under the care of the [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], George and his brother travelled abroad and lived in [[Florence]] and [[Rome]]. When the [[Second English Civil War]] broke out they joined Royalists under the command of [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland]] in [[Surrey]], in July 1648.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

Holland scraped together a small force of 600 men and appointed Buckingham as his General of the Horse.{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=69 ff.}} This force was scattered after a minor engagement near [[Kingston upon Thames]] in which Buckingham's brother Francis was killed.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}} Buckingham himself escaped after an heroic stand against six Roundhead opponents, his back against an oak tree, which became the stuff of [[Cavalier]] legend.{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=69 ff.}} After another doomed [[battle of St Neots|combat at St Neots]] the Duke succeeded in escaping to the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

=== Exile with Charles II ===

Because of his participation in the rebellion, his lands, which had been restored to him in 1647 on account of his youth, were confiscated and given to his future father-in-law, Thomas, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]]. On 19 September 1649, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] conferred on him the [[Order of the Garter]] (KG)  and admitted him to his [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 6 April 1650.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=724}}

In opposition to Hyde, Buckingham supported the alliance with the Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, accompanied Charles to [[Scotland]] in June, and allied himself with the [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Marquess of Argyll]], dissuading Charles from joining the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] plot of October 1650, and being suspected of betraying the plan to the covenanting leaders.  That May, he had been appointed general of the eastern association in England, and was sent to raise forces abroad; the following year, he was chosen to lead the projected movement in [[Lancashire]] and to command the Scottish royalists. He fought alongside Charles at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, but escaped alone to [[Rotterdam]] in October.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|pp=724–725}}

His subsequent negotiations with [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s government, and his readiness to sacrifice the interests of the church, separated him from the rest of Charles's advisers and diminished his influence.  His estrangement from the royal family was completed by his audacious courtship of the king's widowed sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess of Orange]], and by a money dispute with Charles.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

=== Return and imprisonment ===

In 1657, he returned to England, and on 15 September married [[Mary Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Mary]], daughter of [[Anne Fairfax|Anne]] and [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron]],{{sfn|Eales|2004}} who had fallen in love with him although the [[banns]] of her intended marriage with [[Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield]] were being called in church.{{snf|Yardley|2009}} Buckingham was soon suspected of organizing a Presbyterian plot against the government. An order was issued for his arrest{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}} on 9 October, despite Fairfax's interest with Cromwell. He was placed under house arrest at [[York House, Strand|York House]] in April 1658, escaped, and was rearrested on 18 August.  He was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] until his [[Anne Fairfax|mother]] and father-in-law negotiated his release on 23 February 1659. He was freed after promising not to assist the enemies of the government, and on Fairfax's security of £20,000.{{sfn|Eales|2004}} He joined Fairfax in his march against [[John Lambert (general)|General John Lambert]] in January 1660, and afterwards claimed to have gained Fairfax to the cause of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

=== After the Restoration===

The returning King Charles at first received Buckingham (who met him at his landing at [[Dover]]) coldly, but Buckingham was soon back in favour.  He was appointed a [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]], carried the [[Sovereign's Orb]] at the coronation on 23 April 1661, and was made [[Lord Lieutenant]] of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 21 September. The same year, he accompanied Princess [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta]] to Paris to marry the [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orleans]], but made such shameless advances to her that he was recalled. On 28 April 1662 he was admitted to the [[Privy Council]]. His confiscated estates, amounting to £26,000 a year, were restored to him, and he was said to be the king's richest subject. He helped suppress the projected insurrection in [[Yorkshire]] in 1663, went to sea in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1665, and took measures to resist the Dutch or French invasion in June 1666.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

He was, however, debarred from high office by the influence of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]], the Chancellor.  Buckingham now plotted to effect the Chancellor's ruin. He organized parties in both Houses of Parliament to support the [[Importation Act 1667]] prohibiting the import of Irish cattle, partly to oppose Clarendon and partly to thwart [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|the Duke of Ormonde]]. Having asserted during the debates that "whoever was against the bill had either an Irish interest or an Irish understanding", he was challenged to a duel by Ormonde's son [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Lord Ossory]]. Buckingham avoided the encounter, and Ossory was sent to the Tower. A short time afterwards, during a conference between the two Houses on 19 December, he came to blows with the [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester|Marquess of Dorchester]]: Buckingham pulled off the marquess's [[periwig]], and Dorchester also "had much of the duke's hair in his hand."  According to Clarendon, no misdemeanour so flagrant had ever before offended the dignity of the [[House of Lords]]. The offending peers were both sent to the Tower, but were released after apologising; and Buckingham vented his spite by raising a claim to the title of [[Baron Ros]], held by [[John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland|Dorchester's son-in-law]]. His opposition to the government had lost him the king's favour, and he was now accused of treasonable intrigues, and of having cast the king's horoscope. His arrest was ordered on 25 February 1667, and he was dismissed from all his offices. He avoided capture till 27 June, when he gave himself up and was imprisoned in the Tower.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

He was released by 17 July, was restored to favour and to his appointments on 15 September, and took an active part in the prosecution of Clarendon. When Clarendon fell, he became the chief minister, even though he held no high office except that of [[Master of the Horse]], bought from [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|the Duke of Albemarle]] in 1668.

Villiers was a signatory to ''The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa'', a document published in 1667 which led to the creation of the [[Royal African Company|Royal Africa Company]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davies, K. G.

In 1671 he was elected chancellor of Cambridge, and in 1672 high steward of the [[University of Oxford]]. He favoured religious toleration, and earned the praise of [[Richard Baxter]]; he supported a scheme of comprehension in 1668, and advised the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]] in 1672. He upheld the original jurisdiction of the Lords in [[Skinner's Case]]. With these exceptions Buckingham's tenure of office was chiefly marked by scandals and intrigues. His illicit connection with [[Anna Maria Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|the Countess of Shrewsbury]] led to a [[duel]] with [[Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury|her husband the Earl]] at [[Barn Elms]] on 16 January 1668, in which the Earl was fatally wounded. The tale that the countess witnessed the encounter disguised as a page appears to have no foundation; but Buckingham provoked an outrage when he installed the "widow of his own creation" in his own and his wife's house, and sent his wife to her father's house.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

Buckingham was thought to be behind the idea of obtaining the divorce of the childless queen, [[Catherine of Braganza]] (though this never happened). He intrigued against [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], against Sir [[William Coventry]]—one of the ablest statesmen of the time, whose fall he procured by provoking Coventry to send him a challenge—and against the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]], who was dismissed in 1669. He was even suspected of having instigated [[Thomas Blood]]'s attempt to kidnap and murder Ormonde, and was charged with the crime in the king's presence by Ormonde's son, [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Lord Ossory]], who threatened to shoot him dead in the event of his father's meeting with a violent end. [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Arlington]], next to Buckingham himself the most powerful member of the [[Cabal Ministry|"Cabal"]] and a favourite of the king, was less easy to overcome; and he derived considerable influence from the control of foreign affairs entrusted to him. Buckingham always been an adherent of the French alliance, while Arlington concluded through Sir [[William Temple (British politician)|William Temple]] the [[Triple Alliance of 1668]]. On the complete ''volte-face'' and surrender made by Charles to [[Kingdom of France|France]] in 1670, Arlington, a [[Roman Catholic]], was entrusted with the first [[Secret treaty of Dover|Treaty of Dover]] of 20 May—which besides providing for the united attack on the [[Dutch Republic]], included Charles's undertaking to proclaim himself a Catholic and to reintroduce the Roman Catholic faith into England,—while Buckingham was sent to France to carry on the sham negotiations which led to the public treaties of 31 December 1670 and 2 February 1672. He was much pleased with his reception by [[Louis XIV]], declared that he had "more honours done him than ever were given to any subject", and, was presented with a pension of 10,000 [[French livre|livres]] a year for Lady Shrewsbury.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

In June 1672, during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], he accompanied Arlington to [[Nieuwerbrug]] to impose terms on the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]], and when these were refused with Arlington arranged a new treaty, the [[Accord of Heeswijk]] with Louis. After all this activity he suffered a keen disappointment in being passed over for the command of the newly formed [[Blackheath Army]] in favour of [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|the Duke of Schomberg]]. Buckingham was given command of a regiment, but resented serving under Schomberg. He now knew of the secret treaty of Dover, and towards the end of 1673 his jealousy of Arlington became open hostility. He threatened to impeach him, and endeavoured with the help of Louis to stir up a faction against him in parliament.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

===Downfall ===

This, however, was unsuccessful, and in January 1674 both houses of Parliament attacked Buckingham.  In the [[House of Lords|Lords]], the trustees of the young [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]] complained that Buckingham publicly continued his affair with the Countess, and that a son of theirs had been buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] with the title of [[Earl of Coventry]]; Buckingham and the countess were required to apologize and give security for £10,000 not to cohabit together again. In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] he was attacked as the promoter of the French alliance, of "popery" and arbitrary government. He defended himself chiefly by endeavouring to blame Arlington; but the house approved a petition to the king to remove Buckingham from his councils, presence and from employment forever. Charles, who had been waiting for a favourable opportunity, and who was enraged at Buckingham's disclosures, quickly consented.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=725}}

Buckingham retired, reformed his ways, attended church with his wife, began to pay his debts, became a "patriot", and was claimed by the country or opposition party as one of their leaders. In the spring of 1675 he was conspicuous for his opposition to the [[Test Acts|Test Oath]] and for his abuse of the bishops, and on 16 November he introduced a bill for the relief of the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s. On 15 February 1677 he was one of the four lords who tried to embarrass the government by raising the question whether the parliament, not having assembled according to the act of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] once in the year, had not been dissolved by the recent prorogation. The motion was rejected and the four lords were ordered to apologize. When they refused, they were sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]], Buckingham in particular exasperating the House by ridiculing its censure. He was released in July, and immediately entered into intrigues with [[Paul Barillon]], the French ambassador, with the object of hindering the grant of supplies to the king; and in 1678 he visited Paris to get the assistance of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] for the opposition's cause.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|pp=725–726}}

He took an active part in prosecuting those implicated in the "[[Popish Plot]]", and accused the lord chief justice (Sir [[William Scroggs]]) in his own court while on circuit of favouring the [[Roman Catholic]]s.  Because of this, a writ was issued for his arrest, but it was never served. He promoted the return of [[British Whig Party|Whig]] candidates to Parliament, constituted himself the champion of the dissenters, and was admitted a [[Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]]. He, however, separated himself from the Whigs on the exclusion question, probably on account of his dislike of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]], was absent from the great debate in the Lords on 15 November 1680, and was restored to the king's favour in 1684.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}

===Retirement===
[[File:Augustus Leopold Egg - The Death of Buckingham - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Death of Buckingham'' by Victorian artist [[Augustus Egg]]. The scene of his death derives from the exaggerated account in Alexander Pope's ''Epistle to Bathurst'':
<poem>In the worst inn’s worst room, with mat half-hung,	
The floors of plaster, and the walls of dung,	
On once a flock-bed, but repaired with straw,	
With tape-tied curtains never meant to draw,	
The George and Garter dangling from that bed
Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red.
</poem>]]
He took no part in public life after [[James II of England|James II]]'s accession, but returned to his manor of [[Helmsley]] in [[Yorkshire]], probably because of poor health and exhausted finances. In 1685 he published a pamphlet, entitled ''A short Discourse on the Reasonableness of Man's having a Religion'' in which after discussing the main subject he returned to his favourite topic, religious toleration. The tract provoked some rejoinders and was defended, amongst others, by [[William Penn]], and by the author himself in ''The Duke of Buckingham's Letter to the unknown author of a short answer to the Duke of Buckingham's Paper'' (1685). In hopes of converting him to Roman Catholicism, James sent him a priest, but Buckingham ridiculed his arguments. He died on 16 April 1687, from a chill caught while hunting, in the house of a tenant in [[Kirkbymoorside]] in Yorkshire (it is known as Buckingham House and it is located in the town centre), expressing great repentance and feeling himself "despised by my country and I fear forsaken by my God".{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}

The miserable picture of his end drawn by [[Alexander Pope]] is greatly exaggerated. Buckingham was buried on 7 June 1687 in [[Henry VII Lady Chapel|Henry VII's chapel]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], with greater splendour than the late king. With his death, the family founded by the extraordinary rise to power and influence of the first duke ended. As he left no legitimate children, the title became extinct, and his great estate was completely dissipated; of the enormous mansion{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}} he constructed at [[Cliveden]] in Buckinghamshire only the arcaded terrace remains.{{sfn|Oxford Archaeology|2002|pp=1–2 (PDF 4–5)}}

== Character ==
Buckingham was one of the archetypal Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], part of the "Merry Gang" of courtiers whose other members included [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], [[Charles Sedley|Sir Charles Sedley]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]], and the playwrights [[William Wycherley]] and [[George Etherege]].{{snf|Linnane|2006|p=19–20}} Following the tone set by the monarch himself, these men distinguished themselves in drinking, sex and witty conversation. Buckingham is often judged ostentatious, licentious, and unscrupulous, the "[[Alcibiades]] of the seventeenth century."  But even his critics agree that he was good-humoured, good-natured, generous, an unsurpassed mimic, and the leader of fashion.  His good looks and amusing wit made him irresistible to his contemporaries, in spite of his moral faults and even crimes.  A contemporary observer at the Court of Charles II found him: "Courteous, affable, generous, magnanimous...he is adored by the people....On the other hand he is an atheist, blasphemer, violent, cruel and infamous for his licentiousness, in which he is so wrapped up that there is no sex, nor age, nor condition of persons who are spared from it".{{sfn|Middleton|1980|pp=47–48}} His portrait has been drawn by Burnet, Count Hamilton in the ''Memoires de Grammont'', [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]] in the ''Epistle to Lord Bathurst'', and Sir [[Walter Scott]] in ''Peveril of the Peak''. [[John Reresby]] calls him "the first gentleman of person and wit I think I ever saw", and [[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet]] bears the same testimony. Dean Lockier, after alluding to his unrivalled skill in riding, dancing and fencing, adds, "When he came into the presence-chamber it was impossible for you not to follow him with your eye as he went along, he moved so gracefully". Racing and hunting were his favourite sports, and his name long survived in the hunting songs of Yorkshire.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}

The Duke was the patron of [[Abraham Cowley]], [[Thomas Sprat]], [[Matthew Clifford]] and [[William Wycherley]]. He dabbled in [[chemistry]], and according to [[Thomas Burnet]], "he thought he was very near the finding of the [[philosopher's stone]]." He set up the [[Vauxhall glassworks]] at [[Lambeth]], the productions of which were praised by [[John Evelyn]]; and he spent much money, according to his biographer Brian Fairfax, in building ''[[Substructiones Insanae|substructiones insanae]].'' [[John Dryden]] described him under the character of Zimri in celebrated lines in the poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' (to which Buckingham replied in ''Poetical Reflections on a late Poem ... by a Person of Honour'', 1682):{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}

{{quote|
A man so various that he seemed to be/Not one, but all mankind's epitome;/Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,/Was everything by starts and nothing long;/But, in the course of one revolving moon/Was chymist, fiddler, statesman and buffoon../..Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late,/He had his jest, but they had his estate.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}
}}

Buckingham, however, cannot with any truth be called "mankind's epitome". On the contrary, the distinguishing features of his life are incompleteness, aimlessness, imperfection, insignificance, neglected talent and wasted opportunity. "He saw and approved the best", says Brian Fairfax, "but did too often ''deteriora sequi'' (Latin > "follow the worst")". He is more severely but more justly judged by himself. In light-hearted moments he wrote "Methinks, I see the wanton houres flee, And as they passe, turne back and laugh at me", but his last recorded words, "O! what a prodigal have I been of that most valuable of all possessions—Time!" express with exact truth the fundamental flaw of his character and career, of which he had at last become conscious.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}

==Works==

Buckingham wrote [[occasional verse]]s, pamphlets, lampoons, satires and plays showing undoubted (but undeveloped) poetic gifts, a collection of which, containing however many pieces not from his pen, was first published by [[Tom Brown (satirist)|Tom Brown]] in 1704; while a few extracts from a [[commonplace book]] of Buckingham of some interest are given in an article in the ''Quarterly Review'' of January 1898. He was the author of ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'', an amusing and clever satire on the heroic drama and especially on Dryden's ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (first performed on 7 December 1671, at the Theatre Royal, and first published in 1672), a deservedly popular play which was imitated by [[Henry Fielding]] in ''Tom Thumb the Great'', and by [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]] in ''The Critic''.  It is believed that [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] had a hand in it. Dryden had his revenge in his picture of Buckingham as ''[[Zimri (king)|Zimri]]'' in ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]''.  Buckingham also published two adapted plays: a version of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] ''[[The Chances]]'' (1682) and ''The Restoration or Right will take place'', from [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[Philaster (play)|Philaster]]'' (publ. 1714); and also ''The [[Battle of Sedgmoor]]'' and ''The Militant Couple'' (publ. 1704). The latest edition of his works is that by T. Evans (2 vols. 8vo, 1775). Another work is named by Wood, ''A Demonstration of the Deity'', of which there is now no trace.{{sfn|Yorke|1911|p=726}}

Like [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|his father]], the younger Duke makes an appearance in [[Alexandre Dumas pere|Alexandre Dumas père]]'s "Musketeer" novels. ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' sees him escorting [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s sister, [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], to [[France]] to be married to [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]]. He is soon smitten with the young lady, which Philippe perceives quickly, and appeals to his mother, [[Anne of Austria]]. Anne, whose love for Villiers Senior was chronicled in ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', convinces him that, due to his feelings, it would be best for French-English relations if he returned home. While in France, however, he earns the enmity of Comte de Wardes, whose father was the lover of [[Milady de Winter]], who was responsible for the old Villiers' death. De Wardes escorts him to a boat destined for England, but before departing, the two men duel and de Wardes is injured.{{citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=for the whole paragraph}}
