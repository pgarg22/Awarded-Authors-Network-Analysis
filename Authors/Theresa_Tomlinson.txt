'''Theresa Tomlinson''' (born 1946 in [[Crawley]], [[Sussex]]) is an English writer for children, mainly of historical fiction.<ref>Goodreads [http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/528122.Theresa_Tomlinson Retrieved 21 August 2016.]</ref> She advocates giving children "the opportunity to consider many different role models and ways of life, so that they can make up their own minds about what is right for them."

==Life and work==
The daughter of Alan and Joan Johnston, she lived as a child in [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] and [[North Yorkshire]], where her father was an [[Anglican]] [[vicar]]. She attended [[Hull School of Art|Hull College of Art]] and later [[Kingston upon Hull College of Education|Hull College of Education]].<ref name="EngAssn" >English Association [http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/sigs/childrens-literature/authors/theresa-tomlinson Retrieved 21 August 2016.]</ref> Tomlinson spent much of her married life in [[Sheffield]], and it was there, as she began to tell stories to her three children, that she began to enjoy writing. She especially likes working on [[historical fiction]].

Now a grandmother, she lives in [[Whitby]] with her husband.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/catalog/authorcb.htm?authorID=2344 |title=Theresa Tomlinson |accessdate=18 March 2010 |publisher= Random House Children's Books}}</ref> In recent years she has been particularly interested in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period.<ref>Author's site [http://www.theresatomlinson.com/about.html Retrieved 21 August 2016.]</ref> She is a member of the National Association of Writers in Education and the British Society of Authors.<ref name="Rank">Rank Biography [http://biography.jrank.org/pages/1965/Tomlinson-Theresa-1946.html Retrieved 21 August 2016.]</ref>

==Reception==
Reviewing Tomlinson's first novel, ''The Flither Pickers'' (1987), about the hard lives of Yorkshire fishermen's wives, the magazine ''Junior Bookshelf'' called it "a most distinguished novel which is also a convincing piece of historical reconstruction."<ref name="Rank"/>

''Summer Witches'' (1991) is a young-adult novel addressing the way powerful women are misunderstood. ''The Horn Book Magazine'' review by Martha V. Parravano forecast that "middle-grade girls will be hooked immediately by the private hideaway with a sense of mystery surrounding it," and by Tomlinson's tale, which "unfolds, living up to its enticing premise."<ref name="Rank"/>

''The Forestwife'' (1993) was praised by the US ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' for portraying Maid Marian as "more than a glorified moll to the Merry Men," but the reviewer noted also "a heavy-handed and somewhat self-righteous social agenda" that eclipsed the story-telling.<ref>''Publishers Weekly'' [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-531-09450-1 Retrieved 21 August 2016.]</ref>

Completion of the Forestwife Trilogy (with ''Child of the May'', 1998, and ''Path of the She-Wolf'', 2000) led to a 2001 interview with Allen W. Wright, in which Tomlinson looked beyond story-telling to argue that young people should "read widely and have the opportunity to consider many different role models and ways of life, so that they can make up their own minds about what is right for them." She said also that she found the traditional role of Marian in literature "boring", although she made an exception for [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s treatment.<ref>Interviews in Sherwood [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/robint/tomlinson1.html Retrieved 21 August 2016.]</ref> The trilogy was reissued in paperback in 2003.<ref name="Rank"/>

Tomlinson suffered from breast cancer and drew on that experience in ''Dancing Through the Shadows'' (1997). Five of her children's adventure stories explore [[time slip]]s (1997–2004). Greek mythology provides the background for the young-adult novel ''[[The Moon Riders]]'' (2002) and its sequel ''The Voyage of the Snake Lady'' (2004).<ref name="Rank"/>

==Influences==
Tomlinson told an [[English Association]] interview that her favourite childhood books were ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' by ''C. S. Lewis'' and [[Francis Hodgson Burnett]]'s ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' In adulthood she became attracted to the work of [[Alan Garner]] and [[Jane Gardam]].<ref name="EngAssn" />
