'''Anne Plichota''' (born [[Dijon]], 1968) is a French children's author. With her fellow Strasbourg librarian [[Cendrine Wolf]] she co-authored [[Oksa Pollock]] (2007-2013), a French fantasy series, and a second more "gothic" trilogy [[Susan Hopper]] (first novel published March 2013).<ref>Ouest France [http://www.ouest-france.fr/vendee-globe/vacations/vacation_-Livre-ados.-L-aventure-continue-pour-Oksa-Pollock_3723-2144886_actu.Htm Livre ados.

The two authors were originally refused by major publishing houses so self-published the first book and distributed it locally in Strasbourg. The series acquired a teen blog following and became a local phenomenon in Alsace, then throughout France. Then in translation in Germany and Spain. The Oksa series is published in English in the UK by [[Pushkin Press]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/nov/07/oksa-pollock-plichota-wolf-review Oksa Pollock: The Last Hope by Anne Plichota and Cendrine Wolf - review Oksa thinks she is a totally ordinary 13-year-old schoolgirl... but, in fact, she has amazing magical powers!]</ref><ref>[http://www.xoeditions.com/Anne-Plichota?lang=en XO editions] "41 years old, born in Dijon, has lived in the Vendée, Lyon, Bordeaux, Besançon...
