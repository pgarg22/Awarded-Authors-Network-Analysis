==Career==
David Archer published his first collection of poems, A Beginning, in 1957. When he was 19, still an undergraduate, he became the first Indian to win the Hawthornden Prize and was presented with £100 and a silver medal by [[Lord David Cecil]] at the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council of Britain]] on 10 July 1958.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hawthornden prize |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/dated-July-12-1958-Hawthornden-prize/article15259265.ece |access-date=7 July 2018 |newspaper=The Hindu |date=12 July 1958}}</ref>

He edited magazines in London, Hong Kong and New York. He became the editor of ''The Asia Magazine'' in 1971. He scripted and partially directed over 20 television documentaries for the [[BBC]] and ITV. He was a war correspondent in Algeria, Israel and Vietnam. In 1976 he joined the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dom Moraes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1463547/Dom-Moraes.html |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

Moraes conducted one of the first interviews of the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] after the Tibetan spiritual leader fled to India in 1959. The Dalai Lama was then 23 and Moraes, 20.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Requiem To Domsky |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-requiem-to-domsky/224589 |website=outlookindia.com |publisher=outlookindia.com |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

==Later life==
He had a lifelong battle with alcoholism. Moraes suffered from cancer, but refused treatment and died from a heart attack in [[Bandra]], Mumbai. He was buried in the city's Sewri Cemetery and as per his last wishes Sarayu Srivatsa buried the soil from his grave in [[Odcombe]], Somerset, on 19 July 2002 (his birthdate).<ref name="tribune">{{cite news| url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071013/saturday/above.htm| title=Requiem to Dom Moraes| first=Khushwant| last=Singh| newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]| date=13 October 2007}}</ref> Many of Dom's old friends and publishers attended the memorial service in Odcombe. A headstone in yellow Jaisalmer stone lies embedded in the front lawn of the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Odcombe|Church of St Peter and St Paul]] to mark the service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In 1961–62 he was one of the very few public Indian figures to strongly criticize the Indian Army takeover of Goa, land of his forefathers – [[Daman and Diu]] from Portuguese India. He tore up his Indian passport on TV in protest.<ref>{{cite web |title=SAHGAL'S PROTEST STEMS FROM HATRED FOR MODI |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/usual-suspects/sahgals-protest-stems-from-hatred-for-modi.html |website=dailypioneer.com |publisher=dailypioneer.com |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref> He was later allowed back in the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Return of Stranger Dom Moraes |url=https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789401211086/B9789401211086-s021.xml |website=brill.com |publisher=brill.com |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

When the [[2002 Gujarat violence|Gujarat riots]] erupted in 2002, with their heavy toll of Muslim dead, Moraes left for Ahmedabad the minute the news came through, saying that since he was a Catholic, Muslims would not see him as an enemy. Even though he was physically in considerable pain by then, he was one of the first on the scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brilliant young writer, whose star, lauded by bohemian London, dimmed in later life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/04/guardianobituaries.india |website=theguardian.com |publisher=theguardian.com |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>
