'''Edward Archibald "Archie" Markham''' [[FRSL]] (1 October 1939 – 23 March 2008) was a [[Montserrat]]ian poet, playwright, novelist and academic. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1956, where he remained for most of his life, writing as well as teaching at various academic institutions. He was known for writing subtle, witty and intelligent poetry, which refused to conform to the conventions, and stereotypes, of British and Caribbean poetry alike.<ref name="Guardian Obituary">{{cite news|last=Fraser|first=Peter|title=Obituary: E.

On leaving Kilburn Polytechnic, Markham founded the Caribbean Theatre Workshop, which aimed to explore "non-naturalistic ways of writing and playing", and which he led on a successful tour of Montserrat, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]] and other parts of the Eastern Caribbean in 1970–71.<ref name="Hinterland" /><ref name="Wasafiri Article" /> Shortly after his return from the tour, Markham left for France, where he worked, building houses with a French co-operative movement (the Cooperative Ouvrière du Batiment) in the Alpes Maritimes, from 1972 to 1974.<ref name="Independent Obituary" /><ref name="Hinterland" /> On returning to the UK, he joined a touring group called the Bluefoot Travellers, and was awarded a series of writing fellowships at [[Hull College]] (1978–79), in Brent, London (on a [[C. Day-Lewis]] Fellowship from 1979–80), Ipswich (1986), and at the [[University of Ulster]] (1988–91).<ref name="Independent Obituary" /><ref name="Hinterland" /> He also worked as an active member of numerous literary groups and committees, including the [[Poetry Book Society]], the [[Poetry Society]] (General Council, 1976–77) and the Minority Arts Advisory Service (MAAS), whose magazine, ''Artrage'', he edited from 1985 to 1987.<ref name="Wasafiri Article" /><ref name="Many Voices">{{cite book|last=Markham|first=E.

[[File:E. A. Markham. A Papua New Guinea Sojourn.jpg|150px|left]]In a long itinerant period he took a [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] position for two years (1983–85) in [[Papua New Guinea]], working as media co-ordinator for the provincial authorities in [[Enga province]].<ref name="Independent Obituary" /><ref name="Wasafiri Article" /> He would later recall this experience in his memoir, ''A Papua New Guinea Sojourn'' (1993). In 1997 he took up the position of Professor of Creative Writing at [[Sheffield Hallam University]], where he co-founded the MA in creative writing and directed the biennial Hallam Literature Festival.<ref name="Guardian Obituary" /> On the occasion of his 60th birthday, Sheffield Hallam published ''A Festschrift for E. A. Markham'' (1999), and in 2005, when Markham retired, the university made him an [[Emeritus]] professor. He was awarded the Certificate of Honour by the government of Montserrat, in 1997; and was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 2003.<ref name="Independent Obituary"/>

In 2005, Markham moved to [[Paris, France]]. He died there, of a [[heart attack]] on Easter day, 23 March 2008,<ref name="Peepal Tree">{{cite web|last=Poynting|first=Jeremy|title=We have just received the sudden and shocking news of the death of E.

== Poetry and other works ==

Although Markham is mainly known for his poetry, he worked in many artistic genres across the years, producing plays, short stories, a novel and an autobiography as well as multiple collections of poetry.<ref name="British Council">{{cite web|last=Procter|first=James|title=E. A. Markham: Critical Perspectives|url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/ea-markham|publisher=[[British Council]]|access-date=10 June 2012|year=2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205181115/http://literature.britishcouncil.org/ea-markham|archive-date=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He found his first "artistic outlet" in drama, writing and producing a play called ''The Masterpiece'' while still at university in the early 1960s.<ref name="Hinterland" />

A defining characteristic of Markham's work is his tireless exploration of multiple voices and perspectives.<ref name="Independent Obituary" /><ref name="Wasafiri Article" /><ref name="British Council" /> In a short introduction to his work entitled "Many Voices, Many Lives" (1989), he wrote: "The dramatic revelation that poets [...] in the Caribbean had two voices – [[nation language]] and Standard English – released many energies; but we had to be sure that this wasn't to be interpreted that we had ''only'' two voices, ''only'' two modes of expression [...] I was interested in testing the whole range of voices [...] that were possibly real for me"<ref name="Many Voices" /> As part of his exploration of multiple personae, Markham often published his works under [[pseudonyms]].<ref name="Independent Obituary"/><ref name="British Council"/> In the 1970s, Markham wrote a series of poems (including ''Lambchops'', ''Lampchops in Disguise'' and ''Philpot in the City'') in the fictional personae of Paul St. Vincent – a young, black man from [[Antigua]], living in South London – and these poems were published in St. Vincent's name.<ref name="British Council" /> Unlike much of Markham's poetry, the Paul St. Vincent poems are mainly written in nation language. Later, in the 1980s, Markham wrote through the fictional persona of Sally Goodman: a white, Welsh feminist.<ref name="British Council" /> Some of the "Sally Goodman" poems were later anthologised in Markham's collection ''Living in Disguise''. He argued that in inventing these multiple personae, "the test was to force their creator to accommodate types of consciousness which, at the very least, served to enlarge one area of Westindianness".<ref name="Many Voices" />

Markham's writing in genres other than poetry – the short story, the novel, autobiography and travel-writing – was well received by critics.<ref name="Wasafiri Article" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hannan|first=Jim|title=E. A. Markham. Marking Time|journal=[[World Literature Today]]|year=2000|volume=74|issue=2|page=345|doi=10.2307/40155597}}</ref> In addition to his creative writing, Markham also edited two important anthologies of Caribbean writing: ''Hinterland: Caribbean Poetry from the West Indies and Britain'' (1979) and ''The Penguin Book of Caribbean Short Stories'' (1996).
