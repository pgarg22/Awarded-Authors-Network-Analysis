'''Grigory Petrovich Danilevsky''' ({{lang-ru|Григо́рий Петро́вич Даниле́вский}}; {{OldStyleDate|26 April|1829|14 April}} &ndash; {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1890|6 December}}) was a [[Russian literature|Russian writer]], historical [[novelist]], and [[Privy Councillor (Russia)|Privy Councillor of Russia]]. Danilevsky is well known as the author of the novel ''Beglye v Novorossii'' (''Fugitives in New Russia'', 1862).

==Life==
Born into the family of an impoverished landowner, Petr Ivanovich Danilevsky, in the Izyumsky district of [[Kharkov Governorate]], Grigory was educated in the Moscow ''Dvoryansky institut'' (Institute of the Nobility) from 1841 to 1846, then studied law at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]]. In 1849 he was mistakenly arrested in connection with the [[Mikhail Petrashevsky|Petrashevsky]] case and spent several months in the prison of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], but he was released and received his certification as ''[[Candidate of Sciences|kandidat]]'' in 1850. From 1850 to 1857 he served in the Ministry of Education, where he was sent a number of times to examine the archives of monasteries in the south. In 1856 he was one of the writers sent by [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich]] to study the borderlands of Russia.

In 1857 he retired to his estates in the [[Kharkov Governorate]], serving in various local offices, but in 1869 he became an assistant editor of the new ''Pravitelstvenny vestnik'' (Government Herald) and in 1881 was named the chief editor, thus becoming part of the council supervising the Russian press.  He died in December 1890 in [[Saint Petersburg]] and was buried in the village of Prishib in the [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]] (present-day Kharkiv, [[Ukraine]]).

==Literary career==
Aside from some minor verses and translations, Danilevsky's first literary work was a series of stories of Ukrainian life and traditions, collected in 1854 in the book ''Slobozhane'' ([[Sloboda]] dwellers). His first novel, ''Beglye v Novorossii'' (Fugitives in [[Novorossiya]], 1862), published under the pseudonym D. Skavronsky, brought him wide success; it was followed by ''Beglye vorotilis'' (The return of the fugitives, 1863) and ''Novye mesta'' (New places, 1867), the whole trilogy describing the settlement of the Ukrainian steppe by runaway serfs.<ref>Myroslav Shkandrij, ''Russia and Ukraine: Literature and the Discourse of Empire from Napoleonic to Postcolonial Times'' (McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2001: {{ISBN|0-7735-2234-4}}), p. 169.</ref> His 1868 story "Zhizn cherez sto let" (Life a hundred years from now, 1868) was a work of [[science fiction]] imagining the year 1968.

Better known are his novels of the following decades, published in ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' and ''[[Russkaya Mysl]]'' (Russian Thought). In 1874 appeared ''Devyaty val'' (The ninth wave), about the struggle between conservatives and reformers in the 1860s. The following year he wrote ''Mirovich'', which "deals with the tragic fate of the deposed child-emperor [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ioann Antonovich]] and the foiled attempt by Lieutenant [[Vasily Mirovich|Mirovich]] to free him from [[Shlisselburg]]," but it was banned by the censor and did not appear until 1879;<ref>Dan Ungurianu, ''Plotting History: The Russian Historical Novel in the Imperial Age'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2007: {{ISBN|0-299-22500-3}}), p. 128.</ref> [[Isabel Florence Hapgood]] called it his best novel, "though it takes unwarrantable liberties with the personages of the epoch depicted."<ref>Isabel Florence Hapgood, ''A Survey of Russian Literature, with Selections'' (Chautauqua Press, 1902), p. 230.</ref> It was followed by ''Na Indiyu pri Petre'' (To India in [[Peter I of Russia|Peter]]'s day, 1880); ''Knyazhna Tarakanova'' (Princess Tarakanova, 1883), about the self-proclaimed daughter of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]; ''Sozhzhennaya Moskva'' (Moscow destroyed by fire, 1886), about [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion]] in 1812; ''Cherny god'' (The black year, 1888), about [[Pugachev's Rebellion]]; and a series of short stories.

Though Danilevsky was popular in his day, [[Prince Mirsky]] says he was "looked down by the advanced and the literate," and calls his novels "derivative and second-rate."<ref>D.S. Mirsky, ''A History of Russian Literature from Its Beginnings to 1900'' (Northwestern University Press, 1999: {{ISBN|0-8101-1679-0}}), p. 297.</ref> However, Dan Ungurianu writes, "Despite their lack of conceptual and artistic integrity, Danilevsky's novels remain among the best works of historical fiction of the period."<ref>Ungurianu, ''Plotting History'', p. 129.</ref>
