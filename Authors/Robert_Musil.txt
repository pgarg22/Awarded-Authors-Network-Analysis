'''Robert Musil''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁoːbɛɐ̯t ˈmuːzɪl|lang}}; 6 November 1880 – 15 April 1942) was an Austrian philosophical writer. His unfinished novel, ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften}}), is generally considered to be one of the most important and influential [[modernist novel]]s.

==Family==
[[File:Robert Musil 1900.jpg|thumb|Musil in 1900]]
Musil was born in Klagenfurt, [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], the son of engineer Alfred ''Edler von''<ref name="since October 22, 1917">He was baptized ''Robert Mathias Musil'' and his name was officially ''Robert Mathias Edler von Musil'' from 22 October 1917, when his father received a hereditary title of nobility [[Edler]], until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was [[Austrian nobility#Abolition of nobility in 1919|forbidden in Austria]].</ref> Musil (1846, [[Timișoara]] – 1924) and his wife Hermine Bergauer (1853, [[Linz]] – 1924). The [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Alois Musil]] ("The Czech [[Lawrence Of Arabia|Lawrence]]") was his second cousin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualvienna.net/main/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=299&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 |title=Virtual Vienna Net – The Great Austrian Writer Robert Musil |publisher=Virtualvienna.net |date=15 April 1942 |access-date=10 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617054722/http://www.virtualvienna.net/main/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=299&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 |archive-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Soon after his birth, the family moved to [[Chomutov]] in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and in 1891 Musil's father was appointed to the chair of Mechanical Engineering at the [[German Technical University in Brno]] and, later, he was raised to hereditary nobility in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He was baptized ''Robert Mathias Musil'' and his name was officially ''Robert Mathias Edler von Musil'' from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled (made ''[[Edler]]''), until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was [[Austrian nobility#Abolition of nobility in 1919|forbidden in Austria]].

==Early life==
[[File:Robert Musil, pamětní deska, Brno.JPG|right|thumb|Commemorative plaque in [[Brno]]]]
Musil was short in stature, but strong and skilled at wrestling, and by his early teens, he proved to be more than his parents could handle. They sent him to a military boarding school at [[Eisenstadt]] (1892–1894) and then [[Hranice (Přerov District)|Hranice]] (1894–1897). The school experiences are reflected in his first novel ''Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless'' (''[[The Confusions of Young Törless]]'').

==Youth and studies==
After graduation Musil studied at a military academy in Vienna during the fall of 1897, but then switched to mechanical engineering, joining his father's department at the Technical University in Brno. During his university studies, he studied [[engineering]] by day, and at night, read [[literature]] and [[philosophy]] and went to the theatre and art exhibitions. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Ernst Mach]] were particular interests of his university years. Musil finished his studies in three years and, in 1902–1903, served as an unpaid assistant to Professor of Mechanical Engineering {{Interlanguage link multi|Julius Carl von Bach|de|3=Carl von Bach}}, in [[Stuttgart]]. During that time, he began work on ''[[The Confusions of Young Törless|Young Törless]]''.

He also invented {{Interlanguage link multi|Musilscher Farbkreisel|de|3=Musilscher Farbkreisel}}, the Musil [[Color triangle|color top]], a motorised device for producing mixed colours by additive colour-mixing with two differently colored, sectored, rotating discs. This was an improvement over earlier models, allowing a user to vary the proportions of the two colors during rotation and to read off those proportions precisely.<ref>Rupp, H. (1908).

Musil's sexual life around the turn of the century, according to his own records, was mainly with a prostitute, which he treated partly as an experimental self-experience.<ref>Corino S. 2003, 151–154.</ref> But he also was infatuated with the pianist and mountaineer Valerie Hilpert, who assumed mystical features.<ref>Pfohlmann 2012, S. 32–34; Corino 2003, S. 156–167. Pekar comments: "Sigmund Freud's observation of the splitting of the love life in Eros and Sexus, the distant, pure lover and the whore find their clear confirmation here." (Pekar 1997, S. 13)</ref> 
In March 1902, Musil underwent treatment for syphilis with mercurial ointment. During this time, his several years of relationship began with Hermine Dietz, the 'Tonka' of his own novel, published in 1923. Hermine's syphilitic miscarriage in 1906 and her death in 1907 may have been due to infection from Musil.<ref>Pfohlmann 2012, S. 34; Corino 2003, S. 190–194 und S. 1882 f.</ref>

Musil grew tired of engineering and what he perceived as the limited world-view of the engineer. He launched a new round of doctoral studies (1903–1908) in psychology and philosophy at the [[University of Berlin]] under Professor [[Carl Stumpf]]. In 1905, Musil met his future wife, Martha Marcovaldi (née Heimann, 21 January 1874 – 6 November 1949). She had been widowed and remarried, with two children, and was seven years older than Musil. His first novel, ''Alumnus Törless'', was published in 1906.

==Author==
In 1909, Musil completed his doctorate and Professor [[Alexius Meinong]] offered him a position at the [[University of Graz]], which he turned down to concentrate on writing of novels. Over the next two years, he wrote and published two stories, ("The Temptation of Quiet Veronica" and "The Perfecting of a Love") collected in ''Vereinigungen'' (''Unions'') published in 1911. During the same year, Martha's divorce was completed, and Musil married her. As she was Jewish and Musil Roman Catholic, they both converted to [[Protestantism]] as a sign of their union.[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5012d14x#page-10] [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz67509.html] [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D12180.php] Until then, Musil had been supported by his family, but he now found employment first as a librarian in the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and then in an editorial role with the Berlin literary journal ''[[Die neue Rundschau]]''. He also worked on a play entitled ''Die Schwärmer'' (''The Enthusiasts''), which was published in 1921.

[[File:Klagenfurt - Musilhaus - Robert Musil.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Musil at the Musilhaus in [[Klagenfurt]]]]
When [[World War I]] began, Musil joined the army and was stationed first in [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] and then at Austria's Supreme Army Command in [[Bolzano]]. In 1916, Musil visited [[Prague]] and met [[Franz Kafka]], whose work he held in high esteem. After the end of the war and the collapse of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Musil returned to his literary career in Vienna. He published a collection of short stories, ''Drei Frauen'' (''Three Women''), in 1924. He also admired the Bohemian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], whom Musil called "great and not always understood" at his memorial service in 1927 in Berlin. According to Musil, Rilke "did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time", but by the time of his death, Rilke had turned into "a delicate, well-matured liqueur suitable for grown-up ladies".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/rilke-the-clay-pot/ |work=The Times Literary Supplement|first=Robert|last=Vilain|title=Rilke the clay pot|date=16 September 2009 }}</ref> However, his work is "too demanding" to be "considered relaxing".<ref>Robert Musil, ''Precision and Soul: Essays and Addresses'', trans. Burton Pike and David S. Luft (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1995).</ref>

In 1930 and 1933, his masterpiece, ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'' (''Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften'') was published<ref name="Bookseller">{{cite web | last = Peter L.

The novel deals with the moral and intellectual decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through the eyes of the book's protagonist, Ulrich, an ex-mathematician who has failed to engage with the world around him in a manner that would allow him to possess ''qualities''. It is set in [[Vienna]] on the eve of [[World War I]].

''The Man Without Qualities'' brought Musil only mediocre commercial success. Although he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], he felt that he did not receive the recognition he deserved. He sometimes expressed annoyance at the success of better known colleagues such as [[Thomas Mann]] or [[Hermann Broch]], who admired his work deeply and tried to shield him from economic difficulties and encouraged his writing even though Musil initially, was critical of Mann.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In the early 1920s, Musil lived mostly in Berlin. In Vienna, Musil was a frequent visitor to [[Eugenie Schwarzwald]]'s salon (the model for [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in ''The Man Without Qualities''). In 1932, the Robert Musil Society was founded in Berlin on the initiative of Mann. In the same year, Mann was asked to name outstanding contemporary novels, and he cited only one, ''The Man Without Qualities''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 1936, Musil suffered his first stroke.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

== Thought ==
The fundamental problem Musil confronts in his essays and fiction is the crisis of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values that engulfed Europe during the early twentieth century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|pages=155}}</ref> He endorses the Enlightenment project of emancipation, while at the same time, examining its shortcomings with a questioning irony.<ref name=":0" /> Musil believed that the crisis required a renewal in social and individual values that, accepting science and reason, could liberate humanity in beneficent ways.<ref name=":0" /> Musil wrote:<blockquote>After the Enlightenment most of us lost courage. A minor failure was enough to turn us away from reason, and we allowed every barren enthusiast to inveigh against the intentions of a [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] or a [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] as mere rationalism. We beat the drums for feeling against intellect and forgot that without intellect... feeling is as dense as a blockhead (''dick wie ein Mops ist'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|pages=161}}</ref></blockquote>

He took aim at the ideological chaos and misleading generalizations about culture and society promoted by nationalist reactionaries. Musil wrote a withering critique of [[Oswald Spengler]] entitled, "Mind and Experience: Notes for Readers Who Have Escaped the Decline of the West (''Geist und Erfahrung: Anmerkung für Leser, welche dem Untergang des Abendlandes entronnen sind'')", in which he dismantles the latter's misunderstanding of science and misuse of axiomatic thinking to try to understand human complexity and promote a deterministic philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|pages=166–169}}</ref>

He deplored the social conditions under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and foresaw its disappearance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|pages=171–173}}</ref> Surveying the upheavals of the 1910s and 1920s, Musil hoped that Europe could find an internationalist solution to the "dead end of imperial nationalism."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|pages=187}}</ref> In 1927, he signed a declaration of support for the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Payne |first1=Philip |last2=Bartram |first2=Graham |last3=Tihanov |first3=Galin |title=A Companion to the Works of Robert Musil |date=2007 |publisher=Camden House |page=428}}</ref>

Musil was a staunch [[individualist]] who opposed the authoritarianism of both right and left. A recurring theme in his speeches and essays through the 1930s is the defense of the autonomy of the individual against the authoritarian and collectivist concepts then prevailing in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Russia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Payne |first1=Philip |last2=Bartram |first2=Graham |last3=Tihanov |first3=Galin |title=A Companion to the Works of Robert Musil |date=2007 |publisher=Camden House |pages=69–70}}</ref> He participated in the anti-fascist International Writers' Congress for the Defense of Culture in 1935 in which he spoke in favor of artistic independence against the claims of the state, class, nation, and religion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Payne |first1=Philip |last2=Bartram |first2=Graham |last3=Tihanov |first3=Galin |title=A Companion to the Works of Robert Musil |date=2007 |publisher=Camden House |page=78}}</ref>

==Later life==
The last years of Musil's life were dominated by [[Nazism]] and [[World War II]]: the Nazis banned his books. He saw early Nazism first-hand while he was living in Berlin from 1931 to 1933. In 1938, when Austria [[Anschluss|was annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]], Musil and his Jewish wife, Martha, left for exile in Switzerland, where he died at the age of 61. Martha wrote to Franz Theodor Csokor that he had suffered a stroke.<ref>Der Monat 026/1950, pp. 185–189, on www.ceeol.com</ref>

Only eight people attended his [[cremation]]. Martha cast his ashes into the woods of Mont [[Salève]].<ref>[http://www.sbg.ac.at/exil/lecture_5023.pdf Markus Kreuzwieser] 
 {{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> From 1933 to his death, Musil was working on Part III of ''The Man Without Qualities''. In 1943 in Lausanne, Martha published a 462-page collection of material from his literary remains, including the 20 galley chapters withdrawn from Part III before Volume 2 appeared in 1933,<ref name="Bookseller"/> as well as drafts of the final incomplete chapters and notes on the development and direction of the novel.<ref name="Freed"/> She died in Rome in 1949.

==Legacy==
After his death, Musil's work was almost forgotten. His writings began to reappear during the early 1950s. The first translation of ''The Man Without Qualities'' in English was published by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins in 1953, 1954, and 1960. An updated translation by Sophie Wilkins and [[Burton Pike]], containing extensive selections from unpublished drafts, appeared in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|author=The Man Without Qualities (2 volume set) |title=The Man Without Qualities (2 volume set): Robert Musil, Burton Pike, Sophie Wilkins: 9780394510521: Amazon.com: Books |isbn=0394510526 }}</ref>
