'''Sir John Betjeman''' {{postnom|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|tʃ|ə|m|ən}}; 28 August 1906{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1984) was an English poet, writer, and broadcaster. He was [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] from 1972 until his death. He was a founding member of the [[Victorian Society]] and a passionate defender of [[Victorian architecture]], helping to save [[St Pancras railway station]] from demolition. He began his career as a journalist and ended it as one of the most popular British Poets Laureate and a much-loved figure on British television.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Betjeman was born John Betjemann. He was the son of a prosperous silverware maker of Dutch descent. His parents, Mabel (''née'' Dawson) and Ernest Betjemann, had a family firm at 34–42 [[Pentonville Road]] which manufactured the kind of ornamental household furniture and gadgets distinctive to [[Victorian era|Victorians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=119449|title=Survey of London: volume 47: Northern Clerkenwell and Pentonville|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2008|access-date=28 February 2014|pages=339–372}}</ref>

During the First World War the family name was changed to the less German-looking Betjeman. His father's forebears had actually come from the present day [[Netherlands]] more than a century earlier, setting up their home and business in [[Islington]], London, and during the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] had, ironically, added the extra "-n" to avoid the anti-Dutch sentiment existing at the time.<ref name="Mowl2011">{{cite book|last=Mowl|first=Timothy |author-link=Timothy Mowl|title=Stylistic Cold Wars: Betjeman Versus Pevsner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKR9DwEACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0-571-27535-9|page=13}}</ref>

Betjeman was baptised at St Anne's Church, Highgate Rise, a 19th-century church at the foot of Highgate West Hill.  The family lived at [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]] Mansions in the [[Lissenden Gardens]] private estate in [[Gospel Oak]] in north London.

In 1909, the Betjemanns moved half a mile north to more opulent [[Highgate]]. From West Hill they lived in the reflected glory of the [[Holly Lodge Estate|Burdett-Coutts estate]]:

{{bquote|<poem>

I heard the old [[North London Railway|North London]] puff and shunt,
Glad that I did not live in Gospel Oak.{{sfn|Betjeman|1960|p=}}
</poem>}}

Betjeman's early schooling was at the local [[Byron House School|Byron House]] and [[Highgate School]], where he was taught by poet [[T. S. Eliot]]. After this, he boarded at the [[Dragon School]] [[Preparatory school (England)|preparatory school]] in North Oxford and [[Marlborough College]], a [[Independent school (UK)|public school]] in Wiltshire. In his penultimate year, he joined the secret Society of Amici<ref name="Hinde1992">{{cite book|last=Hinde|first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Hinde|title=Paths of Progress: A History of Marlborough College|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOerAAAACAAJ|year=1992|publisher=James & James|isbn=978-0-907383-33-8}}</ref> in which he was a contemporary of both [[Louis MacNeice]] and [[Graham Shepard]]. He founded ''[[The Heretick]]'', a satirical magazine that lampooned Marlborough's obsession with sport. While at school, his exposure to the works of [[Arthur Machen]] won him over to [[High Church]] [[Anglicanism]], a conversion of importance to his later writing and conception of the arts.<ref name="Gardner2006">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Kevin J. |title=Faith and Doubt of John Betjeman: An Anthology of his Religious Verse|url={{google books|id=VKW6BwAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes|keywords=high church|page=xxi}}|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-5354-8}}</ref> Betjeman left Marlborough in July 1925.<ref name=register>{{cite book|title=Marlborough College Register 1843–1952|publisher=The Bursar|location= Marlborough|date= 1953|page= 653|chapter=Betjeman, John}}</ref>

===Magdalen College, Oxford===
Betjeman entered the [[University of Oxford]] with difficulty, having failed the mathematics portion of the university's matriculation exam, [[Responsions]]. He was, however, admitted as a [[Commoner (academia)|commoner]] (i.e. a non-scholarship student) at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] and entered the newly created School of English Language and Literature. At Oxford, Betjeman made little use of the academic opportunities. His tutor, a young [[C. S. Lewis]], regarded him as an "idle prig" and Betjeman in turn considered Lewis unfriendly, demanding, and uninspiring as a teacher.<ref name="OxfordToday">{{cite web|last=Priestman|first=Judith|url=http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2005-06/v18n3/05.shtml|title=The dilettante and the dons|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417002131/http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2005-06/v18n3/05.shtml |archive-date=17 April 2009 |work=[[Oxford Today]]|date= 2006}}</ref> Betjeman particularly disliked the coursework's emphasis on linguistics, and dedicated most of his time to cultivating his social life and his interest in [[Church architecture of England|English ecclesiastical architecture]], and to private literary pursuits.

At Oxford, he was a friend of [[Maurice Bowra]], later (1938 to 1970) to be Warden of [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]]. Betjeman had a poem published in ''[[Isis (magazine)|Isis]]'', the university magazine, and served as editor of the ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' student newspaper during 1927. His first book of poems was privately printed with the help of fellow student [[Edward James]]. He brought his teddy bear [[Archibald Ormsby-Gore]] up to Magdalen with him, the memory of which inspired his Oxford contemporary [[Evelyn Waugh]] to include [[Sebastian Flyte]]'s teddy [[Aloysius (Waugh)|Aloysius]] in ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''. Much of this period of his life is recorded in his [[blank verse]] autobiography ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'' published in 1960 and made into a television film in 1976.<ref name="Peterson2006">{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=William S. |title=John Betjeman: A Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wLNathQPNgC|year=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-818403-4}}</ref>

It is a common misapprehension, cultivated by Betjeman himself, that he did not complete his degree because he failed to pass the compulsory holy scripture examination, [[Oxford er|known colloquially as "Divvers"]], short for "Divinity". In [[Hilary term]] 1928, Betjeman failed Divinity for the second time. He had to leave the university for the [[Trinity term]] to prepare for a retake of the exam; he was then allowed to return in October. Betjeman then wrote to the Secretary of the Tutorial Board at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen]], G. C. Lee, asking to be entered for the Pass School, a set of examinations taken on rare occasions by undergraduates who are deemed unlikely to achieve an [[British undergraduate degree classification|honours degree]]. In ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'' Betjeman claims that his tutor, C. S. Lewis, said "You'd have only got a third"&nbsp;– but he had informed the tutorial board that he thought Betjeman would not achieve an honours degree of any class.<ref name="OxfordToday"/>

Permission to sit the Pass School was granted. Betjeman decided to offer a paper in Welsh. [[Osbert Lancaster]] tells the story that a tutor came by train twice a week (first class) from [[Aberystwyth]] to teach Betjeman. However, [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]] had a number of Welsh tutors who more probably would have taught him. Betjeman finally had to leave at the end of the [[Michaelmas term]], 1928.<ref name="Hillier2003">{{cite book|last=Hillier|first=Bevis |author-link=Bevis Hillier|title=Young Betjeman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYpDPgAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=John Murray|isbn=978-0-7195-6488-8|pages=181–194}}</ref> Betjeman did pass his Divinity examination on his third try but was expelled after failing the Pass School. He had achieved a satisfactory result in only one of the three required papers (on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other English authors).<ref name="OxfordToday" /> Betjeman's academic failure at Oxford rankled with him for the rest of his life and he was never reconciled with C.S. Lewis, towards whom he nursed a bitter detestation. This situation was perhaps complicated by his enduring love of Oxford, from which he accepted an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|doctorate of letters]] in 1974.<ref name="OxfordToday" />

===After university===
[[File:Wadebridge, The John Betjeman Centre Memorabilia Room - geograph.org.uk - 211005.jpg|thumb|right|The John Betjeman Centre Memorabilia Room showing the office from his home in [[Trebetherick]]]]
Betjeman left Oxford without a degree. Whilst there, however, he had made the acquaintance of people who would later influence his work, including [[Louis MacNeice]] and [[W. H. Auden]].<ref name="Taylor-Martin1983">{{cite book|last=Taylor-Martin|first=Patrick |title=John Betjeman, his life and work|url={{google books|id=eMIVAAAAMAAJ|page=35|keywords=Wystan Auden|plainurl=yes}}|year=1983|publisher=Allen Lane|page=35}}</ref> He worked briefly as a private secretary, school teacher and film critic for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', where he also wrote for their high-society gossip column, the [[Londoner's Diary]]. He was employed by the ''[[Architectural Review]]'' between 1930 and 1935, as a full-time assistant editor, following their publishing of some of his freelance work. [[Timothy Mowl]] (2000) says, "His years at the ''Architectural Review'' were to be his true university".<ref name="Mowl2011" /> At this time, while his prose style matured, he joined the [[MARS Group]], an organisation of young modernist architects and architectural critics in Britain.

Betjeman's sexuality can best be described as [[bisexual]], and his longest and best documented relationships were with women, and a fairer analysis of his sexuality may be that he was "the hatcher of a lifetime of schoolboy crushes – both gay and straight", most of which progressed no further.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Johnathan|title=Betjeman Poet, hero of Middle England & a very bad boy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/betjeman-poet-hero-of-middle-england-amp-a-very-bad-boy-411661.html|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=1 December 2015|date= 13 August 2006}}</ref> Nevertheless, he has been considered "temperamentally gay", and even became a penpal of [[Lord Alfred Douglas|Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas]] of [[Oscar Wilde]] fame.<ref name="Gowers2008">{{Cite news|title=Why John Betjeman is a true gay icon|last=Gowers|first=Justin|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 December 2008|access-date=31 July 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/dec/17/john-betjeman-gay-icon-wilde}}</ref> On 29 July 1933 Betjeman married the Hon. [[Penelope Chetwode]], the daughter of [[Field Marshal]] [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Lord Chetwode]]. The couple lived in [[Berkshire]] and had a son, Paul, in 1937, and a daughter, [[Candida Lycett Green|Candida]], in 1942. In 1937, Betjeman was a [[churchwarden]] at [[Uffington, Oxfordshire|Uffington]], the Berkshire village (in [[Oxfordshire]] since boundary changes of 1974) where he lived. That year, he paid for the cleaning of the church's royal arms and later presided over the conversion of the church's [[oil lamp]]s to electricity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaney|first=Frank|title=Betjeman Country|date=1983|page=158|publisher=Paladin (Granada)|isbn=0-586-08499-1}}</ref>

The ''[[Shell Guides]]'' were developed by Betjeman and [[Jack Beddington]], a friend who was publicity manager with [[Shell-Mex & BP]], to guide Britain's growing number of motorists around the counties of Britain and their historical sites. They were published by the Architectural Press and financed by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. By the start of World War II 13 had been published, of which ''[[Cornwall]]'' (1934) and ''[[Devon]]'' (1936) were written by Betjeman. A third, ''[[Shropshire]]'', was written with and designed by his good friend [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] in 1951.

In 1939, Betjeman was rejected for military service in World War II but found war work with the films division of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. In 1941 he became British press attaché in neutral [[Dublin]], Ireland, working with [[John Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby|Sir John Maffey]]. His secretary in Dublin was the journalist and writer [[Shevawn Lynam]], the author of the novel ''[[The Spirit and the Clay]]'', about the [[resistance to Francoism]] in the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque Country]]. Betjeman may have been involved with the gathering of [[Military intelligence|intelligence]]. He is reported to have been selected for murder by the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|IRA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/22/books.booksnews|title=How verse saved poet laureate from the IRA|last=Gibbons|first=Fiachra|date=23 April 2000|website=The Guardian|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> The order was rescinded after a meeting with an unnamed Old IRA man who was impressed by his works.

Betjeman wrote a number of poems based on his experiences in [[The Emergency (Ireland)|Ireland]] during the "Emergency" (the war) including "The Irish Unionist's Farewell to Greta Hellstrom in 1922" (written during the war) which contained the refrain "Dungarvan in the rain". The object of his affections, "Greta", has remained a mystery until recently revealed to have been a member of a well-known [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglo-Irish]] family of Western [[county Waterford]]. His official brief included establishing friendly contacts with leading figures in the Dublin literary scene: he befriended [[Patrick Kavanagh]], then at the very start of his career. Kavanagh celebrated the birth of Betjeman's daughter with a poem "Candida"; another well-known poem contains the line ''Let John Betjeman call for me in a car''. From March to November 1944 Betjeman was assigned to another wartime job, working on publicity for the Admiralty in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

===After the Second World War===
[[File:John Betjeman's house on Cloth Fair.jpg|thumb|Betjeman's house on [[Cloth Fair]] in the [[City of London]]]]
Betjeman's wife Penelope became a Roman Catholic in 1948. The couple drifted apart and in 1951 he met [[Lady Elizabeth Cavendish]], with whom he developed an immediate and lifelong friendship. By 1948 Betjeman had published more than a dozen books. Five of these were verse collections, including one in the USA. Sales of his ''Collected Poems'' in 1958 reached 100,000.<ref name="FandF">{{Cite web | title = John Betjeman  | work = Faber & Faber | date = n.d. | access-date = 31 July 2018 | url = https://www.faber.co.uk/author/john-betjeman/ }}</ref> The popularity of the book prompted [[Ken Russell]] to make a film about him, ''John Betjeman: A Poet in London'' (1959).

He continued writing guidebooks and works on architecture during the 1960s and 1970s and started broadcasting. He was a founder member of the [[Victorian Society]] (1958). Betjeman was closely associated with the culture and spirit of [[Metro-land]], as outer reaches of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] were known before the war. In 1973 he made a widely acclaimed television documentary for the BBC called ''[[Metro-Land (TV film)|Metro-Land]]'', directed by [[Edward Mirzoeff]]. On the centenary of Betjeman's birth in 2006, his daughter led two celebratory railway trips: from London to [[Bristol]], and through [[Metro-land]], to [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]]. In 1974, Betjeman and Mirzoeff followed up ''Metro-Land'' with ''[[A Passion for Churches]]'', a celebration of Betjeman's beloved Church of England, filmed entirely in the Diocese of Norwich. In 1975, he proposed that the Fine Rooms of [[Somerset House]] should house the Turner Bequest, so helping to scupper the plan of the [[Minister for the Arts]] for a [[Theatre Museum]] to be housed there. In 1977 the BBC broadcast "The Queen's Realm: A Prospect of England", an aerial anthology of English landscape, music and poetry, selected by Betjeman and produced by Edward Mirzoeff, in celebration of the Queen's Silver Jubilee.

[[File:Betjeman memorial.JPG|thumb|right|John Betjeman's grave]]
Betjeman was fond of the ghost stories of [[M.R. James]] and supplied an introduction to [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]]'s book ''M. R. James&nbsp;– Book of the Supernatural''. He was susceptible to the supernatural; [[Diana Mitford]] tells the story of Betjeman staying at her country home, [[Biddesden House]], in the 1920s. She says, "he had a terrifying dream, that he was handed a card with wide black edges, and on it his name was engraved, and a date. He knew this was the date of his death".<ref name="Mitford2008">{{cite book|last=Mosley|first=Diana |author-link=Diana Mitford|title=A Life of Contrasts: The Autobiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyYMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA83|year=2008|publisher=Gibson Square|isbn=978-1-906142-14-8|page=83}}</ref> For the last decade of his life Betjeman suffered increasingly from [[Parkinson's disease]]. He died at his home in [[Trebetherick]], Cornwall, on 19 May 1984, aged 77, and is buried nearby at [[St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick|St Enodoc's Church]].<ref name="ODNB">{{cite ODNB|id=30815|title=Betjeman, Sir John|first=Kingsley|last=Amis|author-link=Kingsley Amis}}</ref>

==Poetry==
Betjeman's poems are often humorous, and in broadcasting he exploited his bumbling and fogeyish image. His wryly comic verse is accessible and has attracted a great following for its satirical and observant grace. Auden said in his introduction to ''Slick But Not Streamlined'', "so at home with the provincial gaslit towns, the seaside lodgings, the bicycle, the [[Pump organ|harmonium]]." His poetry is similarly redolent of time and place, continually seeking out intimations of the eternal in the manifestly ordinary. There are constant evocations of the physical chaff and clutter that accumulates in everyday life, the miscellanea of an England now gone but not beyond the reach of living memory.

He talks of [[Ovaltine]] and [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle gears. "Oh! Fuller's angel cake, [[Robertson's]] marmalade," he writes, "[[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] lampshades, come shine on us all."{{sfn|Betjeman|1940|p=50|loc=Myfanwy at Oxford}}

In a 1962 radio interview he told teenage questioners that he could not write about 'abstract things', preferring places, and faces.<ref name="bufvc.ac.uk">{{Cite web | title = John Betjeman: Recollections from the BBC Archives | work = British Universities Film & Video Council |year = 1998 | access-date = 31 July 2018 | url = http://bufvc.ac.uk/dvdfind/index.php/title/av35362 }}</ref> [[Philip Larkin]] wrote of his work, "how much more interesting & worth writing about Betjeman's subjects are than most other modern poets, I mean, whether so-and-so achieves some metaphysical inner unity is not really so interesting to us as the overbuilding of rural [[Middlesex]]".<ref name="Larkin2010">{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Philip |author-link=Philip Larkin|title=Letters to Monica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iMyGQAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0-571-23909-2|page=147}}</ref>

Betjeman was an [[Church of England|Anglican]] and his religious beliefs come through in some of his poems. In a letter written on Christmas Day 1947, he said: “Also my view of the world is that man is born to fulfil the purposes of his Creator i.e. to Praise his Creator, to stand in awe of Him and to dread Him. In this way I differ from most modern poets, who are agnostics and have an idea that Man is the centre of the Universe or is a helpless bubble blown about by uncontrolled forces."<ref name="patr_Angl">{{Cite web |title=Anglican spirituality and poetry: John Betjeman (1906–1984) |last=Comerford |first=Patrick |work=patrickcomerford.com |date=5 December 2015 |access-date=8 August 2019 |url= http://www.patrickcomerford.com/2015/12/anglican-spirituality-and-poetry-2-john.html }}</ref> He combined piety with a nagging uncertainty about the truth of Christianity. Unlike [[Thomas Hardy]], who disbelieved in the truth of the Christmas story while hoping it might be so, Betjeman affirms his belief even while fearing it might be false.<ref name="Gardner2006" /> In the poem "Christmas", one of his most openly religious pieces, the last three stanzas that proclaim the wonder of Christ's birth do so in the form of a question "And is it true...?" His views on Christianity were expressed in his poem "The Conversion of St. Paul", a response to a radio broadcast by humanist [[Margaret K. Knight|Margaret Knight]]:
{{bquote|<poem>
But most of us turn slow to see
The figure hanging on a tree
And stumble on and blindly grope
Upheld by intermittent hope,
God grant before we die we all
May see the light as did St. Paul.
</poem>}}

Betjeman became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]] in 1972, the first [[Knight Bachelor]] to be appointed (the only other, Sir [[William Davenant]], was knighted after his appointment). This role, combined with his popularity as a television performer, ensured that his poetry reached an audience enormous by the standards of the time. Similarly to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]], he appealed to a wide public and managed to voice the thoughts and aspirations of many ordinary people while retaining the respect of many of his fellow poets. This is partly because of the apparently simple traditional metrical structures and rhymes he uses.<ref name="poetryarchive.org">{{Cite web | title = John Betjeman  | work = The Poetry Archive |year = 2016 | access-date = 31 July 2018 | url = https://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/john-betjeman# }}</ref> In the early 1970s, he began a recording career of four albums on [[Charisma Records]] which included ''Betjeman's Banana Blush'' (1974) and ''Late Flowering Love'' (1974), where his poetry reading is set to music with overdubbing by leading musicians of the time.<ref>''Mojo'' No 187 pp122</ref> His recording catalogue extends to nine albums, four singles and two compilations.

Prompted by the rapid development of the [[Buckinghamshire]] town before [[World War II]], Betjeman wrote the ten-stanza poem "[[Slough (poem)|Slough]]" to express his dismay at the industrialisation of Britain. He later came to regret having written it. The poem was first included in his 1937 collection ''[[Continual Dew]]''.
{{bquote|<poem>
Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!

He fought a spirited but unsuccessful campaign to save the Propylaeum, known commonly as the [[Euston Arch]], London. He is considered instrumental in helping to save [[St Pancras railway station]], London, and was commemorated when it became an international terminus for [[Eurostar]] in November 2007. He called the plan to demolish St Pancras a "criminal folly".<ref name="Shukor2007" /> About it he wrote, "What [the Londoner] sees in his mind's eye is that cluster of towers and pinnacles seen from Pentonville Hill and outlined against a foggy sunset and the great arc of Barlow's train shed gaping to devour incoming engines and the sudden burst of exuberant [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] of the hotel seen from gloomy Judd Street".{{sfn |Betjeman|1972|p=11 }} On the reopening of St Pancras station in 2007, the [[Statue of John Betjeman]] was commissioned from curators Futurecity.

Graham's death in 1962.<ref name="Wilson2011">{{cite book|first=A. N.|last=Wilson | author-link = A. N.

Betjeman's lease included furniture from the house by Burges and Betjeman gave three pieces, the [[Zodiac settle]], the Narcissus washstand and the Philosophy cabinet, to [[Evelyn Waugh]].<ref name="ArtFund">{{cite web| url=http://www.artfund.org/what-we-do/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/11584/zodiac-settle|title=Zodiac Settle by William Burges|publisher=[[Art Fund]]| access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref>

He edited, and wrote large sections of, ''The Collins Guide to English Parish Churches'' (1958); his substantial editorial preface was described by [[The Times Literary Supplement]] as "pure gold".<ref>Quoted from the back cover of the 1968 reprint of ''The Collins Guide'' and subsequent editions</ref> The classic status of this book is acknowledged by Simon Jenkins in his ''England's Thousand Best Churches'': "Three ghosts inhabit all English churches ... They are those of John Betjeman, Alec Clifton-Taylor and Nikolaus Pevsner."<ref>{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Jenkins| author-link = Simon Jenkins|title=England's Thousand Best Churches|date=1999|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-0-713-99281-6|pages=xxxv}}</ref>

Betjeman responded to architecture as the visible manifestation of society's spiritual life as well as its political and economic structure. He attacked speculators and bureaucrats for what he saw as their rapacity and lack of imagination. In the preface of his collection of architectural essays ''First and Last Loves'' he wrote

{{quote|We accept the collapse of the fabrics of our old churches, the thieving of lead and objects from them, the commandeering and butchery of our scenery by the services, the despoiling of landscaped parks and the abandonment to a fate worse than the workhouse of our country houses, because we are convinced we must save money.}}

In a BBC film made in 1968 but not broadcast at that time, Betjeman described the sound of [[Leeds]] to be of "Victorian buildings crashing to the ground". He went on to lambast [[John Poulson]]'s British Railways House (now [[City House]]), saying how it blocked all the light out to [[Leeds City Square|City Square]] and was only a testament to money with no architectural merit. He also praised the architecture of [[Leeds Town Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsfilm.com/films.aspx?id=111|title=Leeds International Film Festival|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20081014031453/http://www.leedsfilm.com/films.aspx?id=111|archive-date=14 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/16/betjeman-film-bbc|title = BBC revives unaired Betjeman film forgotten for 40 years|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|date=16 February 2009|access-date=16 February 2009}}</ref> In 1969 Betjeman contributed the foreword to Derek Linstrum's ''Historic Architecture of Leeds''.<ref name="Linstrum1969">{{cite book|last=Linstrum | first=Derek |author2=foreword by John Betjeman | title=Historic Architecture of Leeds | publisher=Oriel Press | isbn=0-85362-056-3 | year =1969 }}</ref>

Betjeman was for over 20 years a trustee of the [[Bath Preservation Trust]] and was vice-president from 1965 to 1971, at a time when [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]—a city rich in [[Georgian architecture]]—was coming under increasing pressure from modern developers and a road had been proposed to cut across it.<ref name="Peterson2006" />{{rp|440}} He also created a short television documentary called ''Architecture of Bath'', in which he voiced his concerns about the way the city's architectural heritage was being mistreated. From 1946 to 1948 he had served as Secretary to the [[Oxford Preservation Trust]]. Betjeman was also instrumental in saving the [[Duke of Cornwall Hotel]] in [[Plymouth]].
