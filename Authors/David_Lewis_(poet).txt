'''David Lewis''' (1682 &ndash; April 1760) was an 18th-century British poet.

==Life==
Lewis was the son of Roger Lewis of [[Llanddewi Felffre]], in the county of [[Pembrokeshire]], and was probably born in Wales.  He studied at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], [[matriculating]] in 1698 and obtaining his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1702.  He was undermaster at [[Westminster School]] (1726&ndash;1732).  During this time, he started to publish poetry, beginning in 1726 with ''Miscellaneous Poems by Several Hands'', which mixed various styles of poetry from different London-based poets from Oxford and Cambridge.  Some unidentified poems were by Lewis himself.  The collection contained the final revision of [[John Dyer]]'s ''[[Grongar Hill]]'' as well as the first draft of [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Vital spark of heavenly flame'' (1712). Lewis and Pope were in contact thereafter, and Pope's support was acknowledged by Lewis in the introduction to ''[[Philip of Macedon (play)|Philip of Macedon]]'', a tragedy by Lewis performed in May 1727.  A second volume of poetry, by various people (including Lewis) was published in 1730.  Lewis died at Low [[Leyton]] in [[Essex]] in April 1760, and was buried at [[Leyton Parish Church]].  His wife, Mary, died in 1774 and was buried with him.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16578| title=Lewis, David (1682&ndash;1760) | last=Burns |first=F. D.
