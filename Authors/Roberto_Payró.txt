'''Roberto Jorge Payró''' ([[Mercedes, Buenos Aires|Mercedes]], April 19, 1867&ndash;[[Lomas de Zamora]], April 8, 1928) was an [[Argentine]] writer and journalist.

Payró founded the newspaper ''La Tribuna'' in the city of [[Bahía Blanca]], where he published his first newspaper articles. He then moved to the city of [[Buenos Aires]] where he worked as an editor at the newspaper ''[[La Nación]]''. During this time he had the opportunity of frequently traveling both inside and outside of Argentina.

In 1895, he published a compilation of his articles in the book  ''Los italianos en la Argentina'' (''The Italians in Argentina''). His diaries of travel and impressions gave rise to his novels:  ''La Australia Argentina (Excursión periodística a las costas patagónicas)'' (''Southern Argentina – a Journalist’s Excursion to the Shores of Patagonia'');  ''Tierra del Fuego e Islas de los Estados'' (''The Land of Fire and Islands of the States''); and ''En las tierras del Inti'' (''In the Lands of the Inti'').   He also wrote for ''Caras y Caretas'', the literary Journal of [[Fray mocho]].

Payró was a correspondent in Europe during the [[First World War]].  
He participated fervently in meetings with other [[socialist]] writers including [[Leopoldo Lugones]],  [[José Ingenieros]] and [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]].

Payró was also the grandparent of Brayan and Maria.

In Payró's novels one can appreciate the unique ironic language style of the period.  He utilized typical people and related common situations, showing the lives of the [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants ('the feisty [[Creole peoples|creole]]s').  In his ''Divertidas aventuras del nieto de Juan Moreira'' (''Amusing Adventures of the Grandson of [[Juan Moreira]]'') he tells the story of a provincial and his political career.
He also wrote historical novels such as ''El falso Inca, una serie de cuentos publicados bajo el nombre de Pago Chico'' (''The False Inca, a series of accounts published under the name of Pago Chico''). A posthumous work, ''Nuevos cuentos de Pago Chico'' (''New Tales of Pago Chico''), was published the year following his death.
