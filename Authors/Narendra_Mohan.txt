'''Narendra Mohan''' (10 October 1934 – 20 September 2002) was an Indian industrialist, chairman and managing director of the [[Dainik Jagran|Jagran]] Prakashan, the publisher of India's best-selling Hindi newspaper (सबसे बिका हुआ अखबार)''[[Dainik Jagran]]''.<ref>[http://www.istampgallery.com/narendra-mohan/ Narendra Mohan]. istampgallery.com</ref> The late Narendra Mohan was renowned for his dedicated journalism and deep simplicity and sincerity and for leading the newspaper to its unrivalled position today – 30 editions, a massive 19-odd million readers, apart from being one of the most influential newspapers in the country. Guptas have 59.2% family holding in [[Dainik Jagran|Jagran]] Group.The late Narendra Mohan's eldest son Sanjay Gupta is editor and CEO of ''[[Dainik Jagran|Jagran]]''.

==Journalist==
Mohan kept a low profile away from the public gaze. But he had tremendous influence both as a newspaper baron and at a personal level. He was drawn into politics as a [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] by his 'political mentor' Mr. [[Lal Krishna Advani]]. From his humble beginnings when in early 1940s, as a youngster in [[Kanpur]], he didn't have enough money to buy a bicycle and, therefore, had to rely on traditional public transport in the district&nbsp;– the bullock-cart, his determination, vision and foresight mixed with diligence and hard-work he took [[Dainik Jagran|Jagran]] group to a meteoric rise.

The group's founder was Mohan's father, the late Puran Chand Gupta, who never faltered in his determination to become a newspaper baron.

''[[Dainik Jagran|Jagran]]'', started from [[Jhansi]], was his third attempt at being a powerful news lord. But Mr Mohan, who took over the paper while his father was still alive, almost certainly deserves the credit for turning it into the potent force that it is today.

He made full use of the technological advances in the newspaper industry to boost the ''[[Dainik Jagran]]'''s circulation and clout. It was one of the first to switch to colour and printing satellite editions. The newspaper employs about 2,000 journalists and even introduced the concept of '[[mohalla]]' correspondents.

During his heyday, Mr. Mohan was an extremely hands-on editor and wrote editorials, a column and one poem each week in ''[[Dainik Jagran]]''. He could fluently dictate an editorial over the phone without notes&nbsp;– never pausing for a moment. {{citation needed|date=March 2007}}

He toured USA, and almost all countries of the world for getting first hand knowledge of working and other socio-economic conditions of newspapers and other industries;
