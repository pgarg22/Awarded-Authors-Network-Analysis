'''June Millicent Jordan''' (July 9, 1936 – June 14, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] poet, essayist, teacher, and activist. In her writing she explored issues of gender, race, immigration, and representation.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blackwomeninamer0000unse/page/170|title=Black Women in America|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Hine|first= Darlene Clark|author-link=Darlene Clark Hine| isbn=0195156773|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|page=[https://archive.org/details/blackwomeninamer0000unse/page/170 170]|oclc=57506600}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Keating |first=AnnLouise |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/jordan_j.html |title=Jordan, June |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |date=January 3, 2003 |access-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327172839/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/jordan_j.html |archive-date=March 27, 2014 }}</ref>

Jordan was passionate about using [[Black English]] in her writing and poetry, teaching others to treat it as its own language and an important outlet for expressing Black culture.<ref name=":4">{{cite book |last1=Jordan |first1=June |title=Nobody Mean More to Me Than You And the Future Life of Willie Jordan |date=August 8, 1985 |pages=12}}</ref>
 
Jordan was inducted on the [[National LGBTQ Wall of Honor]] within the [[Stonewall National Monument]] in 2019.

==Early life==
Jordan was born in 1936 in [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents, Granville Ivanhoe and Mildred Maud Jordan.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blackwomeninamer0000unse/page/169|title=Black Women in America|date=2005|author=Hine|edition=2nd|page=[https://archive.org/details/blackwomeninamer0000unse/page/169 169]}}</ref> Her father was a postal worker for the [[USPS]] and her mother was a part-time nurse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/18/arts/june-jordan-65-poet-and-political-activist.html|title=June Jordan, 65, Poet and Political Activist|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=June 18, 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 11, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When Jordan was five, the family moved to the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] area of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=":1" /> Jordan credits her father with passing on his love of literature, and she began writing her own poetry at the age of seven.

Jordan describes the complexities of her early childhood in her 2000 memoir, ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood''. She explores her complicated relationship with her father, who encouraged her to read broadly and memorize passages of classical texts, but who would also beat her for the slightest misstep and call her "damn black devil child".<ref name="Jordan, June 2000">Jordan, June.

After attending [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Midwood High School]] for a year,<ref name=":1" /> Jordan enrolled in [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]], an elite preparatory school in New England.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blackwomeninamer0000unse/page/169|title=Black Women in America|date=2005|author=Hine|edition=2nd|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackwomeninamer0000unse/page/169 169–70]}}</ref> Throughout her education, Jordan became "completely immersed in a white universe"<ref>[[Margaret Busby]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jun/20/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries "Obituary"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK), June 20, 2002.</ref> by attending predominantly white schools; however, she was also able to construct and develop her identity as a black American and a writer. In 1953, Jordan graduated from high school and enrolled at [[Barnard College]] in New York City.<ref name=":2" />

Jordan later expressed how she felt about [[Barnard College]] in her 1981 book ''Civil Wars'', writing:

<blockquote>No one ever presented me with a single Black author, poet, historian, personage, or idea for that matter. Nor was I ever assigned a single woman to study as a thinker, or writer, or poet, or life force. Nothing that I learned, here, lessened my feeling of pain or confusion and bitterness as related to my origins: my street, my family, my friends. Nothing showed me how I might try to alter the political and economic realities underlying our Black condition in white America.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=June|title=Civil Wars|date=1981|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=0807032328|page=[https://archive.org/details/civilwars00jord/page/100 100]|url=https://archive.org/details/civilwars00jord/page/100}}</ref></blockquote>

Due to this disconnect with the predominantly male, white curriculum, Jordan left Barnard without graduating. June Jordan emerged as a poet and political activist when black female authors were beginning to be heard.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/18/arts/june-jordan-65-poet-and-political-activist.html|title=June Jordan, 65, Poet and Political Activist|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=June 18, 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 3, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Personal life ==
At Barnard College, Jordan met [[Columbia University]] student Michael Meyer, whom she married in 1955.<ref name=":2" /> She subsequently followed her husband to the [[University of Chicago]],<ref name=":2" /> where she pursued graduate studies in anthropology. She also enrolled at the university but soon returned to Barnard, where she remained until 1957. In 1958, Jordan gave birth to the couple's only child, Christopher David Meyer.<ref name=":2" /> The couple divorced in 1965, and Jordan raised her son alone.<ref name=":2" />

After the [[Harlem riot of 1964|Harlem Riots of 1964]], Jordan found that she was, in her words, "filled with hatred for everything and everyone white."<ref>June Jordan, Civil Wars, ISBN 0807032328</ref> She wrote:<ref name=":2" />

{{blockquote|text=... it came to me that this condition, if it lasted, would mean that I had lost the point: not to resemble my enemies, not to dwarf my world, not to lose my willingness and ability to love.|sign=June Jordan|source={{ISBN|0195156773}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2018}}}}

From that time on, Jordan wrote with love.<ref name=":2" /> She also identified as bisexual in her writing, which she refused to deny, even when this status was stigmatized.<ref name=":2" /><ref>June Jordan, "On Bisexuality and Cultural Pluralism", in ''Affirmative Acts'' (1998), pp. 132, 138.</ref>

==Career==
Jordan's first published book, ''Who Look at Me'' (1969), was a collection of poems for children. It was followed by 27 more books in her lifetime, and one (''Some of Us Did Not Die: Collected and New Essays'') of which was in press when she died. Two more have been published posthumously: ''Directed By Desire: The Collected Poems of June Jordan'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2005), and the 1970 poetry collection ''SoulScript'', edited by Jordan, has been reissued.

She was also an essayist, columnist for ''[[The Progressive]]'', novelist, biographer, and librettist for the musical/opera ''[[I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky]]'', composed by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and produced by [[Peter Sellars]]. When asked about the writing process for the libretto of the opera, Jordan said:

<blockquote>The composer, John [Adams], said he needed to have the whole libretto before he could begin, so I just sat down last spring and wrote it in six weeks, I mean, that's all I did. I didn't do laundry, anything. I put myself into it 100 percent. What I gave to John and Peter [Sellars] is basically what Scribner's has published now.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ortega |first1=Julio |url=http://www.bombsite.com/issues/53/articles/1905 |title=June Jordan |last2=Kuhn |first2=Josh |work=[[BOMB Magazine]] |publisher=Bombsite.com |issue=53 |access-date=March 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620061655/http://bombsite.com/issues/53/articles/1905 |archive-date=June 20, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

Jordan began her teaching career in 1967 at the [[City College of New York]]. Between 1968 and 1978 she taught at [[Yale University]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], and [[Connecticut College]]. She became the director of The Poetry Center at [[SUNY at Stony Brook]] and was an English professor there from 1978 to 1989. From 1989 to 2002 she was a full professor in the departments of English, Women's Studies, and African American Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Jordan was known as "the Poet of the People".<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2002/06/17_jordan.html |title=June Jordan profile |publisher=Berkeley.edu |date=June 17, 2002 |access-date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> At Berkeley, she founded the "Poetry for the People" program in 1991. Its aim was to inspire and empower students to use poetry as a means of artistic expression. Reflecting on how she began with the concept of the program, Jordan said:

<blockquote>I did not wake up one morning ablaze with a coherent vision of Poetry for the People! The natural intermingling of my ideas and my observations as an educator, a poet, and the African-American daughter of poorly documented immigrants did not lead me to any limiting ideological perspectives or resolve. Poetry for the People is the arduous and happy outcome of practical, day-by-day, classroom failure and success.<ref name="poetryforthepeople.org">{{cite web|url=http://poetryforthepeople.org/history/ |title=History|publisher= June Jordan's Poetry For The People |date=November 19, 1998 |access-date=March 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319042524/http://poetryforthepeople.org/history |archive-date=March 19, 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>

Jordan composed three guideline points <!-- which were? Just three should be listed -->that embodied the program, which was published with a set of her students' writings in 1995, entitled ''June Jordan's Poetry for the People: A Revolutionary Blueprint''.<ref name="poetryforthepeople.org" /> She was not only a political activist and a poet, but she wrote children's books as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/june-jordan|title=June Jordan 1936–2002|date=February 4, 2014|website=poets.org|language=en|access-date=March 3, 2018}}</ref>

==Literary topics and influences==
Jordan felt strongly about using Black English as a legitimate expression of her culture, and she encouraged young black writers to use that idiom in their writing. She continued to influence young writers with her own published poetry, such as her collections, ''Dry Victories'' (1972), ''New Life'' (1975), and ''Kimako's Story'' (1981).<ref name="June Jordan">{{cite web|title=June Jordan 1936–2002|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/june-jordan|publisher=[[Poetry Foundation]]|access-date= October 29, 2017}}</ref>

Jordan was dedicated to respecting Black English [[African-American Vernacular English|(AAVE)]] and its usage (Jordan 1). In her piece "Nobody Mean More to Me Than You and the Future Life of Willie Jordan,"<ref name=":4"/> Jordan criticizes the world's quickness to degrade the usage of Black English, or any other form considered less than "standard". She denounced "white English" as standard English, saying that in stark contrast to other countries, where students are allowed to learn in their tribal language, "compulsory education in America compels accommodation to exclusively White forms of 'English.' White English, in America, is 'Standard English.'" "Nobody Mean More to Me Than You and the Future Life of Willie Jordan" opens ''On Call'' (1985), a collection of her essays.

Jordan tells the story of working with her students to see the structure that exists within Black English, and respect it as its own language rather than a broken version of another language. Black English was spoken by most of the African-American students in her classes but was never understood as its own language. She presented it to them for the first time in a professional setting where they ordinarily expected work in English to be structured by "white standards." From this lesson, the students created guidelines for Black English.

Jordan's commitment to preserve Black English was evident in her work. She wrote: "There are three qualities of Black English— the presence of life, voice, and clarity—that intensify to a distinctive Black value system that we became excited about and self-consciously tried to maintain."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=June |title=Nobody Mean More to Me Than You and the Future of Willie Jordan |date=August 8, 1985 |pages=12 |url=http://www.portville.wnyric.org/cms/lib/NY19000376/Centricity/Domain/83/jordan%20nobody.pdf |journal=Harvard Educational Review |access-date=December 11, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214071419/http://www.portville.wnyric.org/cms/lib/NY19000376/Centricity/Domain/83/jordan%20nobody.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>

In addition to her writing for young writers and children, Jordan dealt with complex issues in the political arena. She engaged topics "like race, class, sexuality, capitalism, single motherhood, and liberation struggles across the globe."<ref name="June Jordan"/> Passionate about feminist and Black issues, Jordan "spent her life stitching together the personal and political so the seams didn't show."<ref name="June Jordan"/> Her poetry, essays, plays, journalism, and children's literature integrated these issues with her own experience, offering commentary that was both insightful and instructive.

When asked about the role of the poet in society in an interview before her death, Jordan replied: "The role of the poet, beginning with my own childhood experience, is to deserve the trust of people who know that what you do is work with words."<ref name="June Jordan" />

==Contributions to feminist theory==

=== "Report from the Bahamas" ===
In her 1982 classic personal essay "Report from the Bahamas", Jordan reflects on her travel experiences, various interactions, and encounters while in [[The Bahamas]]. Writing in narrative form, she discusses both the possibilities and difficulties of coalition and self-identification on the basis of race, class, and gender identity. Although not widely recognized when first published in 1982, this essay has become central in the United States to women's and gender studies, sociology, and anthropology. Jordan reveals several issues as well as important terms regarding race, class, and gender identity.

==== Privilege ====
Jordan repeatedly grapples with the issue of privilege in both her poems and essays, emphasizing the term when discussing issues of race, class, and gender identity. She refuses to privilege oppressors who are similar to or more like certain people than other oppressors might be. She says that there should be no thought of privilege because all oppression and oppressors should be viewed at an equal standpoint.

==== Concepts of race, class, and gender ====
"[In 'Report from the Bahamas'] Jordan describes the challenges of translating languages of gender, sexuality, and blackness across diasporic space, through the story of a brief vacation in the Bahamas."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2016/03/words-stones-water-introduction-feminist-wire-forum-june-jordan/|title="These words/ they are stones in the water": Introduction to The Feminist Wire Forum on June Jordan|date=March 18, 2016|newspaper=The Feminist Wire|language=en-US|access-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref> Vacationing in the Bahamas, Jordan finds that the shared oppression under race, class, and/or gender is not a sufficient basis for solidarity. She notes:

<blockquote>"These factors of race and class and gender absolutely collapse.. .whenever you try to use them as automatic concepts of connection." They may serve well as indicators of commonly felt conflict, but as elements of connection they seem about as reliable as precipitation probability for the day after the night before the day.</blockquote>

As Jordan reflects on her interactions with a series of black Bahamian women, from the hotel maid "Olive" to the old women street sellers hawking trinkets, she writes:

<blockquote>I notice the fixed relations between these other Black women and myself. They sell and I buy or I don't. They risk not eating. I risk going broke on my first vacation afternoon. We are not particularly women anymore; we are parties to a transaction designed to set us against each other. (41)</blockquote>

Interspersing reflections of her trip with examples her role as a teacher advising students, Jordan details how her own expectations are constantly surprised. For instance, she recounts how an Irish woman graduate student with a [[Bobby Sands]] bumper sticker on her car provided much needed assistance to a South African student who was suffering from domestic violence. Such compassion was at odds with Jordan's experience in her neighborhood of being terrorized by ethnic Irish teenagers hurling racial epithets.

Jordan's concluding lines emphasize the imperative to forge connection actively rather than assuming it on the basis of shared histories:
<blockquote>I am saying that the ultimate connection cannot be the enemy. The ultimate connection must be the need that we find between us ... I must make the connection real between me and these strangers everywhere before those other clouds unify this ragged bunch of us, too late.<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

==== Common identity vs. individual identity ====
Jordan explores that, as human beings, we possess two very contrasting identities. The first identity is the common identity, which is the one that has been imposed on us<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|jstor=40338566|page=14|title=Report from the Bahamas, 1982|journal=Meridians|volume=3|issue=2|last1=Jordan|first1=June|year=2003|doi=10.1215/15366936-3.2.6|s2cid=141773974}}</ref> by a long history of societal standards, controlling images, pressure, a variety of stereotypes, and stratification. The second is the individual identity that we have chosen<ref name=":0" /> once we are given the chance and feel are ready to expose our true selves.

==Death and legacy==
Jordan died of [[breast cancer]] at her home in [[Berkeley, California]], on June 14, 2002, aged 65.<ref name=":2" /> Shortly before her death, she completed ''Some of Us Did Not Die'', her seventh collection of political essays (and 27th book). It was published posthumously. In it she describes how her early marriage to a white student while at Barnard College immersed her in the racial turmoil of America in the 1950s, and set her on the path of social activism.<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/june-jordan-9358043 June Jordan biography], biography.com. Retrieved August 4, 2015.</ref>

In 2004, the June Jordan School for Equity (formerly known as the Small School for Equity) in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] was named after her by its first ninth grade class. They selected her through a democratic process of research, debate, and voting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfusd.edu/assets/sfusd-staff/board-archive/memberreso/Supt%20-%20Renaming%20to%20June%20Jordan%202%20041.pdf|title=San Francisco Unified School District, Superintendent's Proposal|date=March 9, 2004|access-date=January 25, 2018}}</ref> A conference room was named for her in the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s Eshleman Hall, which is used by the [[Associated Students of the University of California]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In June 2019, Jordan was one of the inaugural fifty American "pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes" inducted on the [[National LGBTQ Wall of Honor]] within the [[Stonewall National Monument]] (SNM) in [[New York City]]’s [[Stonewall Inn]].<ref name=":23">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro.us/news/local-news/new-york/stonewall-inn-lgbtq-wall-honor|title=National LGBTQ Wall of Honor unveiled at Stonewall Inn|last=Glasses-Baker|first=Becca|date=June 27, 2019|website=www.metro.us|access-date=June 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="SDGLN">{{Cite web|url=https://sdgln.com/news/2019/06/19/national-lgbtq-wall-honor-be-unveiled-historic-stonewall-inn|title=National LGBTQ Wall of Honor to be unveiled at historic Stonewall Inn|last=SDGLN|first=Timothy Rawles-Community Editor for|date=June 19, 2019|website=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News|language=en|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> The SNM is the first [[National monument (United States)|U.S. national monument]] dedicated to [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBTQ rights]] and [[History of LGBT people|history]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebar.com/news/news//272833|first=Cynthia|last=Laird|title=Groups seek names for Stonewall 50 honor wall|website=The Bay Area Reporter / B.A.R.

==Honors and awards==
Jordan received numerous honors and awards, including a 1969–70 Rockefeller grant for creative writing, a Yaddo Fellowship in 1979, a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] fellowship in 1982, and the Achievement Award for International Reporting from the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] in 1984. She also won the [[Lila Wallace|Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Writers Award]] from 1995 to 1998, as well as the Ground Breakers-Dream Makers Award from The Woman's Foundation in 1994.

She was included in ''Who's Who in America'' from 1984 until her death. She received the Chancellor's Distinguished Lectureship from [[UC Berkeley]] and the PEN Center USA West Freedom to Write Award (1991).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csufresno.edu/peacegarden/nominees/jordan.htm |title=June Jordan |publisher=Csufresno.edu |access-date=March 19, 2011}}</ref>

In 2005, ''Directed by Desire: Collected Poems'', a posthumous collection of her work, had to compete (and won) in the category "Lesbian Poetry" at the [[Lambda Literary Awards]], even though Jordan identified as bisexual. However, [[BiNet USA]] led the bisexual community in a multi-year campaign eventually resulting in the addition of a Bisexual category, starting with the 2006 Awards.

==Reception==
Author [[Toni Morrison]] commented:

<blockquote>In political journalism that cuts like razors in essays that blast the darkness of confusion with relentless light; in poetry that looks as closely into lilac buds as into death's mouth ... [Jordan] has comforted, explained, described, wrestled with, taught and made us laugh out loud before we wept ... I am talking about a span of forty years of tireless activism coupled with and fueled by flawless art.<ref name="Junejordan.com">Junejordan.com</ref></blockquote>

Poet [[Adrienne Rich]] noted:

<blockquote>Whatever her theme or mode, June Jordan continually delineates the conditions of survival—of the body, and mind, and the heart.<ref name="Junejordan.com" /> </blockquote>

[[Alice Walker]] stated:

<blockquote>Jordan makes us think of [[Akhmatova]], of [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]]. She is among the bravest of us, the most outraged. She feels for all of us. She is the universal poet.<ref name="Junejordan.com" /> </blockquote>

[[Thulani Davis]] wrote:

<blockquote>In a borough that has landmarks for the writers [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[Henry Miller]], to name just three, there ought to be a street in Bed-Stuy called June Jordan Place, and maybe a plaque reading, 'A Poet and Soldier for Humanity Was Born Here.'<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Thulani|title=June Jordan, 1936–2002|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/06/25/june-jordan-19362002/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=June 25, 2002|access-date=April 3, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>
