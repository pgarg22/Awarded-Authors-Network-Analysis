'''John William Van Druten''' (1 June 1901{{spaced ndash}}19 December 1957) was an English playwright and theatre director, known professionally as '''John Van Druten'''. He began his career in London, and later moved to America, becoming a U.S. citizen. He was known for his plays of witty and urbane observations of contemporary life and society.

==Biography==
Van Druten was born in London in 1901, son of a Dutch father named Wilhelmus van Druten and his English wife Eva. He was educated at University College School and read law at the University of London. Before commencing his career as a writer, he practised law for a while as a solicitor and university lecturer in Wales.

He first came to prominence with ''[[Young Woodley (play)|Young Woodley]]'', a slight but charming study of adolescence, produced in New York in 1925. However, it was banned in London by the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s office owing to its then controversial portrayal of a schoolboy falling in love with his headmaster's wife. In Britain, it was first produced privately (by Phyllis Whitworth's Three Hundred Club) and then at the [[Arts Theatre]] in 1928. When the ban was lifted, it had a successful run at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the West End with a cast including [[Frank Lawton]], [[Derrick De Marney]], and [[Jack Hawkins]]. The play was filmed twice. It was revived at the [[Finborough Theatre]], London, in 2006.

He was one of the more successful playwrights of the early 1930s in London, with star-studded West End productions of his work, including ''[[Diversion (play)|Diversion]]'' (1927), ''[[After All (play)|After All]]'' (1929), ''[[London Wall (play)|London Wall]]'' (1931) with Frank Lawton and [[John Mills]], ''[[There's Always Juliet]]'' (1931), ''[[Somebody Knows]]'' (1932), ''[[Behold, We Live]]'' (1932) with [[Gertrude Lawrence]] and [[Gerald du Maurier]], ''[[The Distaff Side]]'' (1933), and ''[[Flowers of the Forest (play)|Flowers of the Forest]]'' (1934).

He later emigrated to America, where he wrote ''[[Leave Her to Heaven (play)|Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (February 1940), a drama set in London and [[Westcliff-on-Sea]] in Essex, which was shortly followed by major successes with ''Old Acquaintance'' (NY December 1940 – May 1941 and London with Edith Evans) and ''[[The Voice of the Turtle (play)|The Voice of the Turtle]]'' (1943), which ran for three seasons in New York and was filmed with [[Ronald Reagan]]. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. His play ''Make Way for Lucia'' (1948), based on the [[Mapp and Lucia (series)|Mapp and Lucia]] novels of [[E.F. Benson]], was premiered in New York and had its first professional British production in 1995.<ref>''Make Way for Lucia'', Samuel French edition 1999</ref>

His 1951 play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', together with [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s short stories, ''[[Goodbye to Berlin]]'' (1939), formed the basis of [[Joe Masteroff]]'s book for the [[Kander and Ebb]] musical ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' (1966). When ''[[I Am a Camera]]'' opened on Broadway in 1951, ''The New York Times'' drama critic [[Walter Kerr]] wrote a famous three-word review: "Me no Leica."

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was in a relationship with Carter Lodge (died 1995). Lodge was the manager of the AJC Ranch that van Druten, British actress [[Auriol Lee]] and Lodge bought together in Coachella Valley. When the relationship ended, Lodge continued to live on the ranch with his new partner, Dick Foote. When van Druten died in 1957, he left the entire property of the ranch to Lodge and the rights in his work, including "I Am a Camera", which entitled Lodge to earn a percentage from the movie ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Isherwood|first1=Christopher|title=The Sixties: Diaries Volume Two 1960-1969|date=2012|publisher=Random House|page=703|isbn=9781446419304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY8NwJqVd4C&pg=PA703|access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref>

He died at Indio, California on 19 December 1957 of undisclosed causes. He is buried in the [[Coachella Valley Public Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Patricia|title=Laid to Rest in California: a guide to the cemeteries and grave sites of the rich and famous |chapter=Chapter 8: East L.A. and the Desert |pages=247–8 |year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=978-0762741014|last2=Brooks |first2=Jonathan |oclc= 70284362}}</ref>
