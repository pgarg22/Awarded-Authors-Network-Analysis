Isaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1903<ref name=":0" /> to a Jewish family in [[Leoncin]] village near [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Isaac Bashevis Singer {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/hebrew-literature-biographies/isaac-bashevis-singer|access-date=May 4, 2021|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> The Polish form of his birth name was {{lang|pl|Icek Hersz Zynger}}.<ref name="Noiville2008">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Td7xGID0IhQC |author=Florence Noiville |title=Isaac B.

The often-quoted birth date, July 14, 1904 was made up by the author in his youth, possibly to make himself younger to avoid the draft.{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | pp = 18–19}}

His father was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[rabbi]] and his mother, Bathsheba, was the daughter of the rabbi of [[Biłgoraj]]. Singer later used her first name in an initial literary pseudonym, ''Izaak Baszewis'', which he later expanded.<ref>Several of his professional identification cards using localized spellings and further variants of these names are reproduced in: {{cite book |last=Wollitz |first=Seth L. |editor1-last=Staley |editor1-first=Thomas F. |title=The Hidden Isaac Bashevis Singer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CMeS2WOSWMC |access-date=July 28, 2012 |series=Literary Modernism Series |year=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-79147-3}}</ref> Both his older siblings, sister [[Esther Kreitman]] (1891–1954) and brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] (1893–1944), became writers as well. Esther was the first of the family to write stories.{{Sfn | Carr | 1992}}

The family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva. After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to Warsaw, a flat at Krochmalna Street 10. In the spring of 1914, the Singers moved to No. 12.<ref>{{Citation |first=J |last=Leociak |title=Spojrzenia na warszawskie getto.

The street where Singer grew up was located in the impoverished, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking Jewish quarter of Warsaw. There his father served as a rabbi, and was called on to be a judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader in the Jewish community.{{Sfn | Singer | 1967}} The unique atmosphere of pre-war Krochmalna Street can be found both in the collection of ''Varshavsky-stories'', which tell stories from Singer's childhood,<ref>Best known: ''My Father's Court'' 1966</ref> as well as in those novels and stories which take place in pre-war Warsaw.<ref>''Die familye Mushkat''/''The Family Moskat'' 1950, ''Shoym'' 1967/Scum 1991, etc.</ref>

===World War I===
In 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up. Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to his mother's hometown of Biłgoraj, a traditional ''[[shtetl]],'' where his mother's brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis.{{Sfn | Singer | 1967}} When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer returned to [[Warsaw]]. He entered the [[Tachkemoni]] Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him. He returned to Biłgoraj, where he tried to support himself by giving [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure. In 1923, his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Jewish magazine ''{{ill|Literarishe Bleter|he|ליטערארישע בלעטער}}'', of which the brother was an editor.{{Sfn | Singer | 1976}}

===United States===
In 1935, four years before the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]], Singer emigrated from [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] to the United States. He was fearful of the growing threat in neighboring Germany.<ref>{{Citation |first=Kristina |last=Maul |title=Communication and Society in Jewish American Short Stories |publisher=GRIN Verlag |year=2007 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl1jSXDV7nwC&pg=PA19 |isbn=9783638843201}}.</ref> The move separated the author from his common-law first wife Runia Pontsch and son Israel Zamir (1929–2014); they emigrated to [[Moscow]] and then [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The three met again twenty years later in 1955.

Singer settled in [[New York City]], where he took up work as a journalist and columnist for ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' ({{lang |yi|פֿאָרװערטס}}), a Yiddish-language newspaper. After a promising start, he became despondent and for some years felt "''Lost in America''" (title of his 1974 memoir published in Yiddish; published in English in 1981).

In 1938, he met Alma Wassermann [[née]] Haimann (1907–1996), a German-Jewish refugee from [[Munich]]. They married in 1940, and their union seemed to release energy in him; he returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the ''Forward''. In addition to his pen name of "Bashevis", he published under the pen names of "Warszawski" (pron. Varshavsky) during World War&nbsp;II,{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} and "D. Segal".<ref>See both bibliographies (given on this page).</ref> They lived for many years in the [[Belnord]] apartment building on Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]].<ref name=belnord>{{Citation |journal=The City Review |url=http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/belnord.html/ |title=The Belnord |first=Carter B |last=Horsley | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100330034105/http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/belnord.html/ | archive-date = March 30, 2010}}.</ref>

In 1981, Singer delivered a commencement address at the [[University at Albany]], and was presented with an honorary doctorate.<ref>{{Citation |title=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4liBfiEdEE |contribution=University at Albany's 137th Annual Commencement |date=May 24, 1981 |format=video}}.</ref>

Singer died on July 24, 1991, in [[Surfside, Florida]], after suffering a series of [[stroke]]s. He was buried in [[Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus]], New Jersey.<ref name=nyt1>{{Cite news |first=Robert |last=Strauss |title=Sometimes the Grave Is a Fine and Public Place |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD71230F93BA15750C0A9629C8B63 |quote=[[Cedar Park Cemetery, Emerson|Cedar Park Cemetery]] in Paramus {{sic}} tends toward performers.

==Literary career==
Singer's first published story  "Oyf der elter" ("In Old Age", 1925) won the literary competition of the ''Literarishe Bletter'', where he worked as a proofreader.<ref name= joshee>[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/singer_isaac_bashevis "Singer, Isaac Bashevis"], by Joseph Sherman, ''[[YIVO Encyclopedia]]''</ref> A reflection of his formative years in "the kitchen of literature"{{Sfn | Telushkin | 1997 | p = 123}} can be found in many of his later works. Singer published his first novel, ''[[Satan in Goray]]'', in installments in the literary magazine ''Globus'', which he had co-founded with his lifelong friend, the Yiddish poet [[Aaron Zeitlin]] in 1935. It is set in the years following 1648, when the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmelnicki massacres]], considered one of the greatest Jewish catastrophes, occurred. The story describes the Jewish messianic cult that arose in the village of [[Goraj, Lublin Voivodeship|Goraj]]. It explores the effects of the  faraway false messiah, [[Shabbatai Zvi]], on the local population. Its last chapter imitates the style of a medieval Yiddish chronicle. With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger. In his later work ''The Slave'' (1962), Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648 in a love story between a Jewish man and a [[gentile]] woman. He portrays the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding.

===''The Family Moskat''===
[[File:Dan Hadani collection (990044399900205171).jpg|alt=Isaac Bashevis Singer and his wife.|thumb|Isaac Bashevis Singer with his wife, Alma, in 1969]]
Singer became a literary contributor to ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' only after his older brother Israel died in 1945. That year, Singer published ''The Family Moskat'' in his brother's honor. His own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with double adultery during the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of [[Yom Kippur]] (despite being printed in a Jewish family newspaper in 1945). He was nearly forced to stop writing the novel by his editor-in-chief, [[Abraham Cahan]], but was saved by readers who wanted the story to continue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} After this, his stories—which he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before—were printed in the ''Forward'' as well. Throughout the 1940s, Singer's reputation grew.

Singer believed in the power of his native language and thought that there was still a large audience, including in New York, who longed to read in Yiddish. In an interview in ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' (February 1979), he said that although the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews of Poland]] had died, "something—call it spirit or whatever—is still somewhere in the universe. This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it."

Some of his colleagues and readers were shocked by his all-encompassing view of human nature. He wrote about female homosexuality ("Zeitl and Rickel",{{Sfn | Singer | 1968}} "Tseytl un Rikl"), published in ''The Seance and Other Stories''{{Sfn | Singer | 1968a}}), [[transvestism]] ("Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" in ''Short Friday''), and of rabbis corrupted by demons ("Zeidlus the Pope" in ''Short Friday''). In those novels and stories which refer to events in his own life, he portrays himself unflatteringly (with some degree of accuracy) as an artist who is self-centered yet has a keen eye for the sufferings and tribulations of others.

===Literary influences===
Singer had many literary influences. Besides the religious texts he studied, he grew up with a rich array of Jewish folktales and worldly Yiddish detective-stories about "[[Max Spitzkopf]]" and his assistant "Fuchs".{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 35}} He read Russian, including [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' at the age of fourteen.{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}} He wrote in memoirs about the importance of the Yiddish translations donated in book-crates from America, which he studied as a teenager in Bilgoraj: "I read everything: Stories, novels, plays, essays... I read [[Avrom Reyzen|Rajsen]], [[Strindberg]], Don Kaplanowitsch, [[Turgenev]], [[Tolstoy]], [[Maupassant]] and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]."{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}} He studied the philosophers [[Spinoza]],{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}} [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],{{Sfn | Carr | 1992}} and [[Otto Weininger]].{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 68}} Among his Yiddish contemporaries, Singer considered his elder brother to be his greatest artistic example. He was also a life-long friend and admirer of the author and poet [[Aaron Zeitlin]].

His short stories, which critics{{who|date=April 2021}} feel contain his most lasting contributions, were influenced by Russian [[Anton Chekhov]] and French [[Guy de Maupassant]]. From Maupassant, Singer developed a finely grained sense of drama. Like those of the French master, Singer's stories can pack enormous visceral excitement in the space of a few pages.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} From Chekhov, Singer developed his ability to draw characters of enormous complexity and dignity in the briefest of spaces.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the foreword to his personally selected volume of his finest short stories he describes the two aforementioned writers as the greatest masters of the short story form.

Of his non-Yiddish-contemporaries, he was strongly influenced by the writings of [[Knut Hamsun]], many of whose works he later translated, while he had a more critical attitude towards [[Thomas Mann]], whose approach to writing he considered opposed to his own.{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 88}} Contrary to Hamsun's approach, Singer shaped his world not only with the egos of his characters, but also from Jewish moral tradition embodied by his father in the stories about Singer's youth. There was a dichotomy between the life his heroes lead and the life they feel they should lead—which gives his art a modernity his predecessors did not express. His themes of witchcraft, mystery and legend draw on traditional sources, but they are contrasted with a modern and ironic consciousness. They are also concerned with the bizarre and the grotesque.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

An important strand of his art is intra-familial strife, which he experienced when taking refuge with his mother and younger brother at his uncle's home in Biłgoraj. This is the central theme in Singer's family chronicles such as ''The Family Moskat'' (1950), ''The Manor'' (1967), and ''The Estate'' (1969). Some critics believe these show the influence of [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]''; Singer had translated Mann's ''Der Zauberberg'' (''[[The Magic Mountain]]'') into Yiddish as a young writer.

===Language===
Singer always wrote and published in Yiddish. His novels were serialized in newspapers, which also published his short stories. He edited his novels and stories for publication in English, which was used as the basis for translation into other languages. He referred to his English versions as his "second original". This has led to an ongoing controversy whether the "real Singer" is the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American versions, where the language is usually simpler and more direct.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Many of Singer's stories and novels have not yet{{when|date=April 2021}} been translated.

===Illustrators===
The artists who have illustrated Singer's novels, short stories, and children's books, include [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Maurice Sendak]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Irene Lieblich]]. Singer personally selected Lieblich to illustrate two of his books for children, ''A Tale of Three Wishes'' and ''The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah,'' after seeing her paintings at an Artists Equity exhibition in New York City. A [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor, Lieblich was from Zamosc, Poland, a town adjacent to the area where Singer was raised. As their memories of ''shtetl'' life were so similar, Singer found Lieblich's images ideally suited to illustrate his texts. Of her style, Singer wrote that "her works are rooted in Jewish folklore and are faithful to Jewish life and the Jewish spirit."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Summary===
Singer published at least 18 novels, 14 children's books, a number of memoirs, essays and articles. He is best known as a writer of short stories, which have been published in more than a dozen collections. The first collection of Singer's short stories in English, ''[[Gimpel the Fool]]'', was published in 1957. The title story was translated by [[Saul Bellow]] and published in May 1953 in the ''[[Partisan Review]]''. Selections from Singer's "Varshavsky-stories" in the ''Daily Forward'' were later published in anthologies such as ''My Father's Court'' (1966). Later collections include ''A Crown of Feathers'' (1973), with notable masterpieces in between, such as ''The Spinoza of Market Street'' (1961) and ''A Friend of Kafka'' (1970). His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry in which he grew up. After his many years in America, his stories also portrayed the world of the immigrants and their pursuit of an elusive American dream, which seems always beyond reach.

Prior to Singer's winning the Nobel Prize, English translations of dozens of his stories were published in popular magazines such as ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' that published literary works.

Throughout the 1960s, Singer continued to write about questions of personal morality. Because of the controversial aspects of his plots, he was a target of scathing criticism from many quarters, some of it for not being "moral" enough, some for writing stories that no one wanted to hear. To his critics, he replied, "Literature must spring from the past, from the love of the uniform force that wrote it, and not from the uncertainty of the future." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.<ref name=nobellecture>{{Citation |year=1978 |last=Singer |first=Isaac Bashevis |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1978/singer-lecture.html |publisher=Nobel prize |title=Lecture}}.</ref>

Between 1981 and 1989, Singer contributed articles to [[Moment Magazine]], an independent magazine which focuses on the life of the American Jewish community.<ref>{{cite archive |first=Isaac |last=Bashevis Singer|item-url = http://search.opinionarchives.com/Moment_Web/digitalarchive.aspx |type=Textual Record |date=June 1981 to January 1989 |collection=Moment Magazine |institution=Opinion Archives |location=Digital Archives}}</ref>

===Film adaptations===
His novel ''Enemies, a Love Story'' was adapted as a [[Enemies, a Love Story (film)|film by the same name]] (1989) and was quite popular, bringing new readers to his work. It features a Holocaust survivor who deals with varying desires, complex family relationships, and a loss of faith.

Singer's story, "Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy" was adapted into [[Yentl|a stage version]] by Leah Napolin (with Singer), which was the basis for the film ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' (1983) starring and directed by [[Barbra Streisand]].

[[Alan Arkin]] starred as Yasha, the principal character in the film version of ''[[The Magician of Lublin (film)|The Magician of Lublin]]'' (1979), which also featured [[Shelley Winters]], [[Louise Fletcher]], [[Valerie Perrine]] and [[Lou Jacobi]]. In the final scene, Yasha achieves his lifelong ambition of being able to fly, though not as the magic trick he had originally planned.

Perhaps the most fascinating{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 161}} Singer-inspired film is ''Mr. Singer's Nightmare and Mrs. Pupkos Beard'' (1974) directed by [[Bruce Davidson (photographer)|Bruce Davidson]], a renowned photographer who became Singer's neighbor. This unique film is a half-hour mixture of documentary and fantasy for which Singer wrote the script and played the leading role.

The 2007 film ''[[Love Comes Lately]]'', starring [[Otto Tausig]], was adapted from several of Singer's stories.

==Beliefs==

===Judaism===
Singer's relationship to Judaism was complex and unconventional. He identified as a skeptic and a loner, though he felt a connection to his Orthodox roots. Ultimately, he developed a view of religion and philosophy which he called "private mysticism". As he put it, "Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, He could be endowed with whatever traits one elected to hang upon Him."<ref>Grace Farrell, ''Isaac Bashevis Singer: Conversations'', p. 236, University Press of Mississippi, 1992.</ref>{{Sfn | Singer | 1984 | p = 99}}

Singer was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew and learned Torah and Talmud. As he recounted in the autobiographical short story "In My Father's Court", he broke away from his parents in his early twenties. Influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, he began spending time with non-religious Bohemian artists in Warsaw. Although Singer believed in a God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holy Days. He struggled throughout his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the [[Holocaust]] deaths of so many of the Polish Jews from his childhood. In one interview with the photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, "I am angry at God because of what happened to my brothers": Singer's older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a [[thrombosis]]; his younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with his mother and wife to Southern [[Kazakhstan]] in Stalin's purges.

Despite the complexities of his religious outlook, Singer lived in the midst of the Jewish community throughout his life. He did not seem to be comfortable unless he was surrounded by Jews; particularly Jews born in Europe. Although he spoke English, [[Hebrew]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] fluently, he always considered [[Yiddish]] his natural tongue. He always wrote in Yiddish and he was the last notable American author to be writing in this language. After he had achieved success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending time during the winters in Miami with its Jewish community, many of them New Yorkers.

Eventually, as senior citizens, they moved to Miami. They identified closely with the [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish community. After his death, Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony in a Jewish cemetery in Paramus, New Jersey.

===Vegetarianism===
Singer was a prominent [[Jewish vegetarianism|Jewish vegetarian]]<ref>{{Citation |publisher=IVU |url=http://www.ivu.org/history/northam20b/singer.html |title=History of Vegetarianism |contribution=Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904–1991) |access-date=February 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222210007/http://www.ivu.org/history/northam20b/singer.html |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}.</ref> for the last 35 years of his life and often included vegetarian themes in his works. In his short story ''The Slaughterer'', he described the anguish of an appointed slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his job of killing them. He felt that the ingestion of meat was a denial of all ideals and all religions: "How can we speak of right and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?" When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: "I did it for the health of the chickens."

In ''The Letter Writer'', he wrote "In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]],"{{Sfn | Singer| 1982|p = 271}} which became a classic reference in the discussions about the legitimacy of the [[Animal rights and the Holocaust|comparison of animal exploitation with the Holocaust]].

In the preface to Steven Rosen's ''Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions'' (1986), Singer wrote, "When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why should man then expect mercy from God? It's unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give. It is inconsistent. I can never accept inconsistency or injustice. Even if it comes from God. If there would come a voice from God saying, "I'm against vegetarianism!" I would say, "Well, I am for it!" This is how strongly I feel in this regard."

===Politics===
Singer described himself as "[[conservative]]," adding that "I don't believe by flattering the masses all the time we really achieve much."<ref>{{Citation |jstor=25304019 |volume=31 |number=4 |date=Spring 1980 |page=57 |last1=Burgin |first1=Richard |title=A Conversation with Isaac Bashevis Singer |journal=Chicago Review |last2=Singer |first2=Isaac Bashevis |doi=10.2307/25304019}}</ref> His conservative side was most apparent in his Yiddish writing and journalism, where he was openly hostile to [[Marxist]] sociopolitical agendas. In ''[[Forverts]]'' he once wrote, "It may seem like terrible ''apikorses'' [heresy], but conservative governments in America, England, France, have handled Jews no worse than liberal governments.... The Jew's worst enemies were always those elements that the modern Jew convinced himself (really hypnotized himself) were his friends."{{Sfn | Hadda| 2003|pp = 137–38}}<ref name=yivo>{{Citation |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Singer_Isaac_Bashevis |contribution=Singer, Isaac Bashevis |title=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}.</ref>

===Zionism===
Issac Bashevis was ambivalent on the question of [[Zionism]], and he viewed the immigration of Jews to Palestine critically. As a Polish Jew from Warsaw, he was historically confronted with the question of the Jewish fate during Nazi persecution. He exercised social responsibility towards the immigration of European and American Jewish groups to Israel after [[World War II]]. Strictly based on Jewish family doctrine rather than politics and socialism, his former partner Runya Pontsch and his son Israel Zamir emigrated to Palestine in 1938, in order to live a typical [[kibbutz]] life there. In his story ''The Certificate'' (1967), which has autobiographical character, he fictionalizes this question from a time in the mid-1920s when he was himself considering moving to the [[British Mandate Palestine]]. The protagonist of the story decides to leave Palestine, however, to move back into his shtetl. For Singer then, Zionism becomes the "road not taken". However, through his journalistic assignments in late 1955, Singer made his first trip to Israel, accompanied by his wife Alma. Describing the trip to his Yiddish readers, he introduces the world for the first time to the young state of Israel. In a change of mind, he then describes the Land of Israel as a "reality, and part of everyday life." Interestingly enough, he notes the cultural tensions between [[Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish people during the boat trip from [[Naples]] to [[Haifa]] and during his stay in the new nation. With the description of Jewish immigration camps in the new land, he foresaw the difficulties and socio-economic tensions in Israel, and hence turned back to his critical views of Zionism. He scrutinized the ideology further, as he was advancing his thought of critical Zionism.<ref>David Stromberg (June 12, 2018 ).
