'''John Thompson''' (17 Mar 1938 – 26 Apr 1976) was an English-born, [[Canadians|Canadian]] poet, translator and university professor. He is noted for his mastery of poetic forms, which he  used to express the intensity and power of images in spare and precise language evoking beauty and wonder, anguish and despair.<ref name = "Sanger" /><ref name = "Atwood">Margaret Atwood.

Periodically throughout his short life, Thompson suffered from severe mental disorders including [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[mania]] and [[paranoia]]. He also struggled with the [[alcoholism]] that contributed to his early death. Other poets who influenced him, such as [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Theodore Roethke]] and [[John Berryman]], were afflicted in similar ways.<ref name = "Sanger">Peter Sanger.

In his introduction to ''Stilt Jack'' in which he writes briefly about ghazals (or "guzzles" as he called them),<ref name = "Sanger" /> Thompson could have been describing the essential elements of his own poetry when he asserted that the form allows the imagination to move in its own natural ways: "discovering an alien design, illogical and without sense &mdash; a chart of the disorderly, against false reason and the tacking together of poor narratives. It is the poem of contrasts, dreams, astonishing leaps. The ghazal has been called 'drunken and amatory' and I think it is."<ref>John Thompson. ''Stilt Jack''. Toronto: Anansi, 1978.</ref>

==Life==

John Thompson was born in [[Timperley]], England in 1938. Following the death of his father and abandonment by his mother,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.youngpoets.ca/im_a_stranger_here_myself | title = I'm a Stranger Here Myself: A Digital History of Canadian Poetry | author = Heather Pyrcz | publisher = youngpoets.ca | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117044743/http://www.youngpoets.ca/im_a_stranger_here_myself | archivedate = January 17, 2008 }}</ref> he was educated at various boarding schools and the [[Manchester Grammar School]]. He received his B.A. in honours psychology from the [[University of Sheffield]] in 1958. Following two years service in the British Army intelligence corps, he studied comparative literature at Michigan State University and received his Ph.D. He studied under [[A. J. M. Smith]] and his thesis entailed the translation of poems by the French poet [[René Char]]. In 1966 he moved to Canada and taught English literature at [[Mount Allison University]] in New Brunswick. His first collection of poetry, ''At the Edge of the Chopping there are no Secrets'' (1973), received mixed reviews. This was followed by a divorce and a fire that consumed his home and most of his manuscripts. He wrote the 38 poems in his second - and last - collection, ''Stilt Jack,'' while in Toronto on a sabbatical.

The cause of his death at the age of 38, immediately after ''Stilt Jack'' was completed, remains the subject of debate. In the fall of 1975, Thompson wrote his will. At Christmas, he broke down and ended up in the hospital. On his release three months later, instead of abiding by the doctor's orders not to mix drugs and alcohol, he continued to drink steadily. He finished ''Stilt Jack'' in April. On April 24, Thompson gave the manuscript to his friend and fellow poet, [[Douglas Lochhead]]. After he had returned home, the tenants in the apartment below heard muffled choking and cries. He was discovered comatose and pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. James Polk describes the cause of death as "a brutal mix of [[barbiturate]]s and liquor."<ref name = "Polk" /> The autopsy did not provide conclusive evidence that Thompson killed himself.<ref name = "Sanger" />

Thompson's poems, published and unpublished, including his translations of French and Québécois poets, ''John Thompson: Collected Poems and Translations,'' and a biographical essay by the editor, Peter Sanger, were published by Goose Lane Editions (Fredericton) in 1995.

In 2000, in ''The Danforth Review'', Dan Reve wrote, "[The [[ghazal]]] is a rarefied, peculiar and therefore powerful form... John Thompson is to be credited with the introduction and dissemination of the ghazal in Canada. His ''Stilt Jack'' is one of literature's odd, incommensurable works of genius."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/202/300/danforth/1999-2000/02n01/danforth2_1/reviews/steeves.html | title = Cutting the Devil's Throat by Andrew Steeves | author = Dan Reve | publisher = The Danforth Review, Vol. II No. I, September 2000 | accessdate = September 21, 2017}}</ref>
