==Association with in-yer-face theatre==

[[In-yer-face theatre]] is a label used to characterise a confrontational style and sensibility of drama that emerged in new plays (primarily written by young writers) that were performed in Great Britain during the 1990s. This label was popularised by critic Aleks Sierz in his 2001 book ''In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today'', where he analysed and celebrated this style of drama.<ref name=Sierz/> In the book Sierz wrote an entire chapter examining Neilson's work and three of his plays: ''[[Normal: The Düsseldorf Ripper|Normal]]'', ''[[Penetrator (play)|Penetrator]]'' and ''The Censor''.  

===Reputation===

Sierz has dubbed Neilson as one of "the big three" playwrights (along with [[Sarah Kane]] and [[Mark Ravenhill]]) associated with In-yer-face theatre,<ref>[http://www.inyerfacetheatre.com/what.html "WHO?" section of the "What is In-yer-face theatre?" page on Aleks Sierz's In-yer-face theatre website]</ref> whom Sierz has referred to as "the most provocative new writers of the [nineties]" who also "had an influence that far outweighed the number of plays they wrote at the time... What they did was transform the language of theatre, making it more direct, raw and explicit. They not only introduced a new dramatic vocabulary, they also pushed theatre into being more experiential, more aggressively aimed at making audiences feel and respond."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sierz |first1=Aleks |title=In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today |date=2001 |publisher=Faber and Faber Limited |pages=xii - xiii |location=London |isbn=978-0-571-20049-8 |chapter=Introduction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjcgBQAAQBAJ&q=in-yer-face%20theatre&pg=PT9 |accessdate=12 November 2020}}</ref> 

Sierz has highlighted Neilson as "one of the first to exploit the new freedoms of nineties drama"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sierz |first1=Aleks |title=In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today |date=2001 |publisher=Faber and Faber Limited |pages=88–89 |location=London |isbn=978-0-571-20049-8 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> and "one of the first writers of the decade to create an experiential theatre of extreme sensations", adding that "Although often underrated, Neilson's significance lies less in his skill as a writer than in his pioneering of a form of confrontational theatre that became central to the new aesthetic of British drama in the nineties."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sierz |first1=Aleks |title=In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today |date=2001 |publisher=Faber and Faber Limited |pages=86 |location=London |isbn=978-0-571-20049-8 |chapter=3.

===Coining "In-your-face theatre"===

Sierz has been mistakenly cited as coining the phrase “In-yer-face theatre”, writing that “Although I certainly was the first to describe, celebrate and theorise this kind of new writing, which emerged decisively in the mid-1990s, I certainly did not invent the phrase.” In his piece “[https://www.sierz.co.uk/writings/a-brief-history-of-in-yer-face-theatre/ A brief history of in-yer-face theatre]” Sierz cites an interview with ''[[The Financial Times]]'''s critic Sraha Hemming in November 1995, where Neilson remarked “I think that in-your-face theatre is coming back — and that is good.” Sierz has stated that “As far as I know, this seems to be the very first coinage of the term “in-your-face theatre”.”<ref name=history/>

==='Experiential Theatre' and rejection of the 'In-yer-face' label===

Although Sierz credits Neilson for coining the term "In-your-face theatre", Neilson has rejected the label to describe his own work and instead prefers to describe it as "experiential" theatre:{{cquote|<blockquote>I will presume that you know about the "In-yer-face" school of theatre, of which I am allegedly a proponent... I've never really liked the term because it implies an attempt to repel an audience, which was never my aim. In fact, the use of morally contentious elements was always intended to do the very opposite. Given that one's genuine morality (as distinctive from the morality that we choose for ourselves) tends to be instinctive rather than cerebral, engaging a receptive audience with such issues is a useful way of scrambling the intellectual response that inhibit/protect us from full involvement with what we're watching. Engage the morality of an audience and they are driven into themselves. They become, in some small way, participants rather than voyeurs. That's why I prefer the term "experiential" theatre. If I make anything, let it be that.<ref name=foreword/></blockquote>}} Neilson has also stated "As far as I can tell, In-Yer-Face was all about being horrid and writing about shit and buggery. I thought I was writing love stories."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/mar/21/features11.g2|title=Don't be so boring |first=Anthony |last=Neilson |date=March 21, 2007 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>
<br/>Sierz has defined 'experiential theatre' as describing: {{cquote|<blockquote>the kind of drama, usually put on in studio spaces, that aims to give audiences the experience of actually having lived through the actions depicted on stage. (But not literally!) Instead of allowing spectators to just sit back and contemplate the play, experiential theatre grabs its audiences and forces them to confront the reality of the feelings shown to them. Yes, it's in-yer-face.<ref>[http://www.inyerfacetheatre.com/az.html 'New Writing A - Z' page on Alek Sierz's In-yer-face theatre website]</ref></blockquote>}}

==Censorship of ''Stitching'' in Malta==
In 2009 Neilson's play ''Stitching'' was planned to be staged in Malta by Unifaun Theatre but was banned by the Maltese Board of Film and Stage Classification. Initially no reason for the ban was given to the Unifaun Theatre. After chasing up for an explanation for the board's decision Unifaun Theatre received a letter from the police commissioner outlining the reason for the ban:
 
<blockquote>“1. Blasphemy against the State Religion – pages 10 and 17

2. Obscene contempt for the victims of Auschwitz – page 29

3. An encyclopaedic review of dangerous sexual perversions leading to sexual servitude – pages 33, 34 and several others

4. Abby’s eulogy to the child murderers Fred and Rosemary West – page 3

5. Reference to the abduction, sexual assault and murder of children – page 36

In conclusion, the play is a sinister tapestry of violence and perversion where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. The Board feels that in this case the envelope has been pushed beyond the limits of public decency.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weenink |first1=Steffie |title=Stitching It Together: A Look At The Return Of A Play That's Been Banned For A Decade |url=https://lovinmalta.com/lifestyle/art/stitching-it-together-a-look-at-the-return-of-a-play-thats-been-banned-for-a-decade/ |website=Lovin Malta |accessdate=15 November 2020}}</ref></blockquote>  

Responding to the board's decision the play's producers stated that they planned to stage the play in defiance of the ban. At a press conference the production's director, Chris Gatt, explained that the creative team were looking for a suitable venue to stage the play but that the Maltese police could take action against them by "present[ing] the charges under the Film and Stage Classification legislation, then we would risk a fine of €11.65 for a first-time offence. However, if they prosecute us under the Criminal Code for violating obscenity and public decency, we risk a prison term of between 1 to 6 months." In response Friggiri issued a statement saying that “The play cannot be staged. The producers know they are breaking the law, but that’s their business. ... The play is an insult against human dignity from beginning to end ... The board’s remit is not to defend the law. Our obligation is to follow it.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zahra |first1=Charlot |title=Stitching to be staged 'no matter what' |url=http://archive.maltatoday.com.mt/2009/02/15/t8.html |website=Malta Today |accessdate=15 November 2020 |date=15 February 2009}}</ref> 

In response to the ban the British theatre critics Andrew Hayden<ref>{{cite web |last1=Haydon |first1=Andrew |title=Anthony Neilson's Stitching: don't ban this sick play |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/feb/20/anthony-neilson-stitching-ban-play#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20less%20attention%20has%20been,Yes%2C%20banned.&text=Malta%20has%20a%20board%20of,charge%20of%20providing%20age%20restrictions |website=The Guardian |accessdate=15 November 2020 |date=20 February 2009}}</ref> and [[Aleks Sierz]] condemned the board's decision.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sierz |first1=Aleks |title=Trust the people, not the censors |url=http://archive.maltatoday.com.mt/2009/04/05/alex.html |website=Malta Today |accessdate=15 November 2020 |date=5 April 2009}}</ref> 

It took a Court Case 9 years to finally reverse the decision. In May 2018, the ECHR ruled that the ban was unlawful. However, the outcry following the case led to the dismantling of Censorship Laws in Malta and to the new Labour Government proposing to remove Obscenity and Blasphemy laws for works of Art
