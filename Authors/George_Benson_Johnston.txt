'''George Benson Johnston''' (October 7, 1913 – August 2004) was a [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] (who published as '''George Johnston'''), translator, and academic "best known for lyric poetry that delineates with good-humoured wisdom the pleasures and pains of suburban family life."<ref name=steele>James Steele, "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004158 Johnston, George Benson]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1114.</ref> He also had an international reputation as a scholar and translator of the Icelandic [[Saga]]s.<ref name=jrank/>

==Life==
Johnston was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1913, the son of Margaret Black and Benson Johnston, an insurance agent.<ref name=new/> The family moved to the [[Toronto]] suburbs in 1923. Johnston knew in high school that he wanted to be a writer.<ref name=dlb>"[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/george-benson-johnston-dlb/ George (Benson) Johnston Biography]," ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', Bookrags.com, Web, May 4, 2011.</ref>

He studied at the [[University of Toronto]] under [[Pelham Edgar]] and [[E. J. Pratt]].<ref name=new>William H. New, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkh2vJ_9GpEC&pg=PA555&lpg=PA555#v=onepage&q&f=false Johnston, George Benson]," ''Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada'' (Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2002), 555-556. Google Books, Web, May 4, 2011.</ref> There he "read [[T.S. Eliot]], the early [[William Butler Yeats]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]], and added [[Alexander Pope]] as a personal favorite." In 1935 he published two poems, "Annabelle" and "The Life in August," in the college magazine, ''[[Acta Victoriana]]''.<ref name=dlb/>

Johnston received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1936, and went to Europe. He stayed in [[England]], continuing to write. He published a story in the ''London Mercury'' in 1937. He soon returned to Canada, but continued to send his work to British magazines.<ref name=dlb/>

Johnston served as a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot in [[World War II]],<ref name=steele/> serving in Canada, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[West Africa]].<ref name=dlb/> In 1944 he married Jeanne McCrae;<ref name=archive/> their family would include six children, five by birth and one by adoption.<ref name=dlb/>

After the war Johnston returned to the University of Toronto, receiving his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1946 under the direction of [[Northrop Frye]].<ref name=dlb/> He taught at [[Mount Allison University]] from 1947 to 1949.<ref name=archive>"[http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=1143825756048_206_191_57_199&l=-1&lvl=1&v=0&coll=1&itm=262623&rt=1&bill=1 HISTOIRE ADMINISTRATIVE/NOTICE BIOGRAPHIQUE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323050044/http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=1143825756048_206_191_57_199&l=-1&lvl=1&v=0&coll=1&itm=262623&rt=1&bill=1 |date=2012-03-23 }}", George Johnston fonds, ArchivesCanada.ca, Web, May 4, 2011.</ref>

In 1950 Johnston joined the English department at Carleton College in [[Ottawa]] (now [[Carleton University]]),<ref name=archive/> where he taught until retirement in 1979.<ref name=steele/>

Johnston learned [[Old Norse]] from [[Peter Foote]] of the [[University of London]], and in 1957 began translating Norse sagas. His first effort, ''The Saga of Gisli'', appeared in 1963; it is still in print. Seven of its poems were included in ''The Oxford Book of Verse in English Translation'', edited by [[Charles Tomlinson]].<ref name=dlb/>

Johnston has made a dozen translations from Old and Modern Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, and Faeroese.<ref name=new/> He has translated two books of poetry by Norwegian poet [[Knut Ødegård]].<ref name=jrank/>

In 1959 Johnston published his first book of his own poetry, ''The Cruising Auk'', which was favourably reviewed by [[Eric Nicol]] and Northrop Frye, and by the American magazine ''Alphabet''. ''Alphabet'', Chicago's ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, and Canada's ''[[Tamarack Review]]'', all became regular outlets for Johnson's new work.<ref name=dlb/>

He composed a biography of his friend, the painter [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0007195 Carl Fellman Schaefer].<ref name=new/>

After retiring, Johnston moved to Athelstan, in South-western Quebec
, to raise bees and continue to write.<ref name=archive/>

==Writing==
The ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' calls Johnston "best known for lyric poetry that delineates with good-humoured wisdom the pleasures and pains of suburban family life."<ref name=steele/> The ''Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada'' says that his books "contain witty and domestic satires" which "hint at uncertainty and vulnerability as well."<ref name=new/>

Northrop Frye called ''The Cruising Auk'' "a beautifully unified book, the apparently casual poems carrying the reader along from the first poem to the last in a voyage of self-discovery." He added :"Johnston is an irresistibly readable and quotable poet. His finest technical achievement, I think, apart from his faultless sense of timing, is his ability to incorporate the language of the suburbs into his own diction."<ref name=frye>Northrop Frye, "[http://northropfrye-thebushgarden.blogspot.com/2009/02/from-letters-in-canada-1959.html Letters in Canada - 1959]", ''The Bush Garden'' (Toronto: Anansi, 1971.), 108.</ref>

Johnston's work features a recurring persona, Edward, forever on the verge of drowning.<ref name=new/>

==Recognition==

Johnston has received honorary degrees from [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] and Carleton University.<ref name=archive/>

An issue of ''Malahat Review''  (78, March 1987) was devoted to him.<ref name=jrank>John Margeson / W.J. Keith, "[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/8078/George-Johnston.html George Benson Johnston Biography]," ''Encyclopedia of Literature'', 8078, JRank.org, Web, May 4, 2011.</ref>

Writing in ''Canadian Poetry'' in 1992, W.J. Keith called "attention to the unfortunate — one is tempted to say scandalous — neglect" of Johnston's poetry by critics and anthologists "in the last twenty years or so."<ref name=keith>W.J. Keith, "[http://uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/cpjrn/vol31/keith.htm The Later Poetry of George Johnston] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306222603/http://uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/cpjrn/vol31/keith.htm |date=2016-03-06 }}," ''Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews'' No. 31 (Fall/Winter 1992), UWO, Web, May 5, 2011.</ref>

A ''[[festschrift]]'', ''The Old Enchanter: A Portrait of George Johnston'', was published in 1999.<ref name=archive/>
