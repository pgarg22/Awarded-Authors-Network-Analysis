'''Sir Peter Levin Shaffer''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|æ|f|ər}}; 15 May 1926 – 6 June 2016) was an English playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. He wrote numerous award-winning plays, of which several were adapted into films.

==Early life==
Shaffer was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Liverpool]], the son of Reka (née Fredman) and estate agent Jack Shaffer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Peter-Shaffer.html|title=Peter Shaffer Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=1926-05-15|access-date=2010-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/14301|title=The Jewish Daily Forward|publisher=Forward.com|access-date=2010-09-14}}</ref> He was the identical twin brother of fellow playwright [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]].

He was educated at the [[The Hall School (Hampstead)|Hall School]], [[Hampstead]], and [[St Paul's School, London]], and subsequently he gained a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], to study history. Shaffer was a [[Bevin Boy]] coal miner during World War II, and took a number of jobs including bookstore clerk, and assistant at the [[New York Public Library]], before discovering his dramatic talents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/06/sir-peter-shaffer-obituary|title=Sir Peter Shaffer obituary|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2016-06-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-12-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==Theatrical career==
Shaffer's first play, ''The Salt Land'' (1955), was presented on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] on 8 November 1955. Encouraged by this success, Shaffer continued to write and established his reputation as a playwright in 1958, with the production of ''[[Five Finger Exercise]]'',<ref name="Stevens">{{cite book

}}</ref> which opened in London under the direction of [[John Gielgud]] and won the Evening Standard Drama Award. When ''Five Finger Exercise'' moved to [[New York City]] in 1959, it was equally well received and landed Shaffer the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award for Best Foreign Play.

Shaffer's next piece was a double bill, ''The Private Ear/The Public Eye'', two plays each containing three characters and concerning aspects of love. They were presented in May 1962 at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]], and both starred [[Maggie Smith]] and [[Kenneth Williams]]. Smith won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Leading Actress at the age of 27.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] was established in 1963, and virtually all of Shaffer's subsequent work was done in its service. His canon contains a unique mix of philosophical dramas and satirical comedies. ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'' (1964) presents the conquest and killing of the [[Inca]] ruler [[Atahuallpa]] by the [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Pizarro]] in [[Peru]], while ''[[Black Comedy (play)|Black Comedy]]'' (1965) takes a humorous look at the antics of a group of characters feeling their way around a pitch black room – although the stage is actually flooded with light.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.samuelfrench.co.uk/p/2990/black-comedy/| title = Black Comedy| access-date = 8 November 2019| publisher = samuelfrench.com}}</ref>

''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' (1973) won Shaffer the 1975 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play as well as the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. A journey into the mind of a seventeen-year-old stable-boy who had plunged a spike into the eyes of six horses, ''Equus'' ran for over 1,000 performances on Broadway. It was revived by [[Massachusetts]]' [[Berkshire Theatre Festival]] in the summers of 2005 and 2007, by director [[Thea Sharrock]] at London's [[Gielgud Theatre]] in February 2007, and on Broadway (in the Sharrock staging) in September 2008. The latter production, which ran in New York until February 2009, required the stableboy to appear naked; its star, [[Daniel Radcliffe]], was still associated with the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] intended for general audiences, and this led to mild controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5223520.stm|title=Naked stage role for Potter star|work=BBC News|access-date=2007-02-22|date=28 July 2006}}</ref>

Shaffer followed this success with ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' (1979) which won the Evening Standard Drama Award and the Theatre Critics' Award for the London production. This tells the story of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and court composer [[Antonio Salieri]] who, overcome with jealousy at hearing the "voice of God" coming from an "obscene child", sets out to destroy his rival. When the show moved to Broadway it won the 1981 Tony Award for Best Play and, like ''Equus'', ran for more than a thousand performances.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

After the success of ''Amadeus'', Shaffer wrote the play ''[[Lettice and Lovage]]'' specifically for [[Dame Maggie Smith]] in 1986, for which he was nominated for another Tony Award and [[Dame Maggie Smith]] eventually won the Tony Award for best actress after three nominations in 1990. ''Lettice and Lovage'' also enabled [[Margaret Tyzack]] to win the award for best featured actress, and the production was nominated for best direction of a play, at the 1990 Tony Awards.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Screen adaptations==
Several of Shaffer's plays have been adapted to film, including ''[[Five Finger Exercise (film)|Five Finger Exercise]]'' (1962), ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun (film)|The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'' (1969), ''The Public Eye'' (1962), from which he adapted the 1972 film ''[[Follow Me! (1972 film)|Follow Me!]]'' (1972), ''[[Equus (film)|Equus]]'' (1977), and ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984), which won eight [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

Shaffer received two Academy Award nominations for adapting his plays ''Equus'' and ''Amadeus'' for the big screen. For writing the screenplay for ''Equus'', he was nominated for the 1977 Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar but the award went to [[Alvin Sargent]], who wrote the screenplay for ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]''. For writing the screenplay for ''Amadeus'', Shaffer received both the 1984 Best Screenplay Golden Globe and the 1984 Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.
