== Biography ==

Ann Downer was born in Arlington, Virginia in 1960 and grew up in Manila and Bangkok and recalled avidly reading fantasy fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Ann-Downer/1682683/biography |title=Ann Downer: Biography |accessdate=3 March 2010 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223132613/http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Ann-Downer/1682683/biography |archivedate=23 December 2009 }}</ref>

Her first published work was a trilogy published in the late 1980s and early 1990s (''The Spellkey'', ''The Glass Salamander'', and ''The Books of the Keepers''), collected in a revised edition in 1995 as ''The Spellkey Trilogy''. A second series for middle-grade readers, begun in 2003 with the novel ''Hatching Magic'', continues with ''The Dragon of Never-Was'' (2006). The Spellkey series is high fantasy, taking place wholly in an invented world and chronicling a good-versus-evil story of two foundlings, a stableboy and an ostracized seer. ''Hatching Magic'' and its sequel, ''The Dragon of Never-Was'', are contemporary fantasies with elements of [[time travel in fiction|time travel]]. The series follows a young girl, Theodora Oglethorpe, as she discovers a world of wizardry and magic. While Downer's books are frequently compared to the work of [[Patricia A. McKillip]] and [[Diana Wynne Jones]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} she has cited the influence of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (book series)|Earthsea]] books and the [[Chronicles of Prydain]] by [[Lloyd Alexander]] in shaping her outlook and prose style.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
