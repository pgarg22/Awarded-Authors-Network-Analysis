== Biography ==
Sagara is the eldest child of Japanese immigrants. As a child, Sagara loved reading [[The Nancy Drew Mysteries|Nancy Drew mysteries]] as well as the works of [[Enid Blyton]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. She studied Physics, then English, at the [[University of Toronto]] before dropping out to pursue writing. After she married in 1990, she began publishing under Michelle West.<ref name=":1" /> Her debut book, ''Into the Dark Lands'' was published in 1991.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.challengingdestiny.com/interviews/sagara.htm|title=Interview with Michelle Sagara|journal=Challenging Destiny|first= James|last= Schellenberg |author2= David M. Switzer|number=24|date=August 7, 2007|access-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> She has said, in a 2008 interview: "I submitted the first novel to [[Del Ray Books|Del Rey books]] in 1987. It was rejected, but with a phone call, and in the end I revised the manuscript and sent it back. The revision was passed on to Lester del Rey, who was alive at the time. He rejected it with a 4 page single space letter which had all the trademark curmudgeonliness for which he was famed. But buried in that 4 page letter was a very definite 'This flashback of 94 pages needs to be its own damn book, and it should be book one.' So... I wrote that novel, and I submitted that novel, and that's the novel they bought."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldsandtime.blogspot.com/2007/06/interview-with-michelle-sagara.html|title=Interview With Michelle Sagara|author=Spherical Time|website=Worlds & Time|date=March 12, 2008|access-date=November 6, 2020}}</ref>
