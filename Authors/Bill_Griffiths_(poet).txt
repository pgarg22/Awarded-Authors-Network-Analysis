'''Brian William Bransom Griffiths''' (20 August 1948 – 13 September 2007), known as '''Bill Griffiths''', was a [[poet]] and [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] scholar associated with the [[British Poetry Revival]].

==Overview==
Griffiths was born in [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]], [[Middlesex]], England.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bill-griffiths-402904.html|title=Bill Griffiths - Obituaries, News - Independent.co.uk<!-- Bot generated title --> | location=London | work=The Independent|date=20 September 2007}}</ref> As a teenager, he became a [[Hells Angel]]; his experiences with bikers provided material for many early poems. From 1971, these poems were published in ''Poetry Review'', under the editorship of [[Eric Mottram]], and by [[Bob Cobbing]]'s [[Writers Forum]]. He also collaborated on a number of [[performance poetry]] pieces with Cobbing and others.

Griffiths soon started his own imprint, '''Pirate Press''', which published work by himself and other like-minded poets. In addition to Cobbing and other Writers Forum poets, Griffiths listed his early influences as [[Michael McClure]], [[Muriel Rukeyser]], [[John Keats]], [[George Crabbe]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], and [[Old English language|Old English]] poetry.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kears|first=Carl|date=2018-06-01|title=Eric Mottram and Old English: Revival and Re-Use in the 1970s|url=https://academic.oup.com/res/article/69/290/430/4797527|journal=The Review of English Studies|language=en|volume=69|issue=290|pages=430–454|doi=10.1093/res/hgx129|issn=0034-6551}}</ref>

In 1987, he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Old English language|Old English]] from [[King's College London]]. He published a number of editions and translations of Old English texts and authored ''[[Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic]]''.<ref name=":0" />

Griffiths was a prolific poet who published widely in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. In later years he lived in [[Seaham|Seaham, County Durham]], and ran '''Amra Press''', which published his poetry and books of local studies.

Griffiths' books of poetry from other publishers include ''A Tract Against The Giants'' (Coach House Press, Toronto, 1984), ''Rousseau and the Wicked'' (Invisible Books, London, 1996), ''Etruscan Reader 5'' (with [[Tom Raworth]] and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]]) (Etruscan Books, Buckfastleigh, 1997), ''Nomad Sense'' (Talus Editions, London, 1998), ''A Book of Spilt Cities'' (Etruscan Books, 1999), ''Ushabtis'' (Talus, 2001) and ''Durham and other sequences'' (West House Books, 2002). A substantial collection of his work was also published in ''Future Exiles'' (Paladin 1992). In 2010, Reality Street released ''Collected Earlier Poems (1966 – 80)''.

==Life, work, and scholarship==
Beginning in 1996 and up until his death, Griffiths worked with Bill Lancaster at the Centre for Northern Studies at [[Northumbria University]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. He became a highly active assistant editor to Lancaster's ''Northern Review, a Journal of Regional and Cultural Affairs'', which lasted ten years. This was a remarkably productive period for Griffiths which saw the publishing of a series of books on north east dialect, beginning with ''North East Dialect, Survey and Word list'' and "North East Dialect, the Texts" in 1998. Published by the Centre for Northern Studies, these ran to several editions before culminating in ''A Dictionary of North East Dialect'' by [[Northumbria University Press]] in 2004. The Dictionary attracted national attention and was hailed as a landmark in the history of English dialects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Griffiths was able to draw upon his vast scholarship of [[Old English literature|Saxon literature]] and [[Old English]], providing sophisticated [[etymologies]] that drew upon sources as far back as the eighth century.

The centre was awarded a major grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2005 to continue dialect research which facilitated the publication by Northumbria University Press of three more volumes of dialect studies: ''Stotties and Spicecake, the Story of North East Cooking'', ''Pitmatic: the talk of the North East Coalfield'' (a volume that was featured heavily in the media and is credited with capturing for posterity the rapidly disappearing yet distinctive dialect of the northern coalfields), and 'Fishing and Folk: Life and Dialect on the North Sea Coast', this last published posthumously in 2008.

Griffiths was working with Bill Lancaster at the time of his death to secure funding for another dialect project on children's games and pastimes. In 2003, the centre was commissioned by Sage/Music North to catalogue the archive of [[Northern Sinfonia]] and produce a history of the orchestra for the opening of the Sage music centre. A highly skilled archivist and talented classical musician,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Griffiths was considered the ideal person to do this work which was completed ahead of schedule. Subsequently, ''Northern Sinfonia, a Magic of its Own'', was published in 2004. His last work at the centre was the cataloguing of the [[T. Dan Smith]] archive of taped recordings.

Of tangential interest to these projects, it could be noted that Griffiths organised an exhibition in his adopted home of [[Seaham]] which was seen by [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on her Golden Jubilee Tour and he published numerous small books and pamphlets dealing with his adopted community.
