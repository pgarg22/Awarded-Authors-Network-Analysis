'''John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester''' (1 April 1647 – 26 July 1680) was an English poet and [[courtier]] of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] court. The Restoration reacted against the "spiritual authoritarianism" of the [[Puritan]] era.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> Rochester embodied this new era, and he became as well known for his [[rake (character)|rakish]] lifestyle as for his poetry, although the two were often interlinked.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> He died as a result of [[venereal disease]] at the age of 33.

Rochester was described by his contemporary [[Andrew Marvell]] as "the best English satirist," and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cerisia.cerosia.org/articles/251/Longman%20Anthology%20Instructors%20Manual/Restoration/76-JohnWilmot_IM.pdf|title = Cerisia Cerosia &#124; Anna Livia, that superfine pigtail to}}</ref> His poetry was widely censored during the [[Victorian era]], but enjoyed a revival from the 1920s onwards, with reappraisals from noted literary figures such as [[Graham Greene]] and [[Ezra Pound]].<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Martyr to Sin}}</ref> The critic [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]] linked Rochester's [[libertinism]] to [[Hobbesian]] [[materialism]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />

During his lifetime, Rochester was best known for ''[[A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind]]'', and it remains among his best-known works today.

==Life==

===Upbringing and teens===
John Wilmot was born at [[Ditchley House]] in [[Oxfordshire]] on 1 April 1647. His father, [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry, Viscount Wilmot]], was created [[Earl of Rochester]] in 1652 for his military service to Charles II during the King's exile under the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. Paul Davis describes Henry as "a [[Cavalier]] legend, a dashing bon vivant and war-hero who single-handedly engineered the future Charles II's escape to the Continent (including the famous concealment in an oak tree) after the disastrous [[battle of Worcester]] in 1651".<ref name=autogenerated11 /> His mother, [[Anne St. John, Countess of Rochester|Anne St. John]], was a strong-willed [[Puritan]] from a noble [[Wiltshire]] family.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

From the age of seven, Rochester was privately tutored, two years later attending the [[grammar school]] in nearby [[Burford]].<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite book|author=James William Johnson|title=A Profane Wit: The Life Of John Wilmot, Earl Of Rochester|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxrjd1kvZlQC|year=2004|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-170-2|page=19}}</ref> His father died in 1658, and John Wilmot inherited the title of the Earl of Rochester in April of that year.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> In January 1660, Rochester was admitted as a Fellow commoner to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], a new and comparatively poor college.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite book|author=James William Johnson|title=A Profane Wit: The Life Of John Wilmot, Earl Of Rochester|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxrjd1kvZlQC|year=2004|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-170-2|page=29}}</ref> Whilst there, it is said, the 13-year-old "grew debauched". In September 1661 he was awarded an honorary [[Master's degree|M.A.]] by the newly elected [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the university, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon]], a family friend.<ref name=autogenerated1>Frank H.

As an act of gratitude towards the son of Henry Wilmot, Charles II conferred on Rochester an annual pension of £500. In November 1661 Charles sent Rochester on a three year [[Grand Tour]] of France and Italy, and appointed the physician [[Andrew Balfour (botanist)|Andrew Balfour]] as his [[governor]].<ref name="Johnson56">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James William|title=A Profane Wit: The Life of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxrjd1kvZlQC|year=2004|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-170-2|page=56}}</ref> This exposed him to an unusual degree to European (especially French) writing and thought.<ref>Treglown, Jeremy.

It has been suggested by a number of scholars that the King took a paternal role in Rochester's life. Charles II suggested a marriage between Rochester and the wealthy heiress [[Elizabeth Wilmot, Countess of Rochester|Elizabeth Malet]]. Her wealth-hungry relatives opposed marriage to the impoverished Rochester, who conspired with his mother to abduct the young Countess. [[Samuel Pepys]] described the attempted abduction in his diary on 28 May 1665:
<blockquote>Thence to my Lady Sandwich's, where, to my shame, I had not been a great while before.  Here, [I told] her a story of my Lord Rochester's running away on Friday night last with Mrs. Mallett, the great beauty and fortune of the North, who had supped at White Hall with Mrs. Stewart, and was going home to her lodgings with her grandfather, my Lord Haly, by coach; and was at Charing Cross seized on by both horse and foot men, and forcibly taken from him, and put into a coach with six horses, and two women provided to receive her, and carried away.  Upon immediate pursuit, my Lord of Rochester (for whom the King had spoke to the lady often, but with no successe {{sic}}) was taken at Uxbridge; but the lady is not yet heard of, and the King mighty angry, and the Lord sent to the Tower.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=4162|name=Diary of Samuel Pepys — Complete 1665 N.S.}} Samuel Pepys, entry for 26 May 1665, ''Diary of Samuel Pepys May 28, 1665.''

18-year-old Rochester spent three weeks in [[The Tower of London|the Tower]], and was released only after he wrote a penitent apology to the King.<ref name=autogenerated11 />

Rochester attempted to redeem himself by volunteering for the navy in the [[Second Dutch War]] in the winter of 1665, serving under the [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich|Earl of Sandwich]].<ref name="BurnetJohnson1782">{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Burnet|author2=Samuel Johnson|author3=Robert Parsons|title=Some passages in the life and death of John Earl of Rochester, written by his own direction on his death-bed ...: with a sermon, preached, at the funeral of the said Earl, by the Rev.

In October 1667, the monarch granted Rochester special licence to enter the [[House of Lords]] early, despite being seven months underage.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> The act was an attempt by the King to bolster his number of supporters among the Lords.<ref name="Johnson98">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James William|title=A Profane Wit: The Life of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxrjd1kvZlQC|year=2004|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-170-2|page=98}}</ref>

===Twenties and last years===
Rochester's life was divided between domesticity in the country and a riotous existence at court, where he was renowned for drunkenness, vivacious conversation, and "extravagant frolics" as part of the ''Merry Gang'' (as Andrew Marvell described them).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zH5E68nMhn8C&pg=PA272 Google books] Charles Beauclerk, ''Nell Gwyn: Mistress to a King'' (New York: Grove, 2005), 272.</ref> The ''Merry Gang'' flourished for about 15 years after 1665 and included [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans|Henry Jermyn]]; [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset]]; [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave]]; [[Henry Killigrew (playwright)|Henry Killigrew]]; Sir [[Charles Sedley]]; the playwrights [[William Wycherley]] and [[George Etherege]]; and [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]. [[Gilbert Burnet]] wrote of him that, "For five years together he was continually Drunk… [and] not… perfectly Master of himself… [which] led him to… do many wild and unaccountable things."<ref name= autogenerated1 /> [[Samuel Pepys|Pepys's Diary]] records one such occasion on 16 February 1669 when Rochester was invited to dine with the King and the Dutch ambassador:
<blockquote>The King dining yesterday at the Dutch ambassador's, after dinner they drank and were pretty merry; and among the rest of the King's company there was that worthy fellow my Lord of Rochester, and [[Thomas Killigrew|Tom Killigrew]], whose mirth and raillery offended the former so much that he did give Tom Killigrew a box on the ear in the King's presence, which do give much offence to the people here at Court ...<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pepys|first=Samuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4199|title=Diary of Samuel Pepys — Complete 1669 N.S.|date=31 October 2004|editor-last=Braybrooke|editor-first=Richard Griffin|language=en|translator-last=Bright|translator-first=Mynors|editor-last2=Wheatley|editor-first2=Henry B. (Henry Benjamin)}}</ref></blockquote>

His actions were considered an offence against the King, or a [[lèse-majesté]], and he was banned from the court, although the King soon called for his return.<ref name=autogenerated11 />

In 1673, Rochester began to train [[Elizabeth Barry]] as an actress.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> She went on to become the most famous actress of her age.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> He took her as his mistress in 1675.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> The relationship lasted for around five years, and produced a daughter, before descending into acrimony after Rochester began to resent her success.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> Rochester wrote afterwards, "With what face can I incline/To damn you to be only mine?…  Live up to thy mighty mind/And be the mistress of mankind".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Suckling|first1=John|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t69312m4g&view=1up&seq=59|title=Ballads and other poems|last2=Rochester|first2=John Wilmot|last3=Sedley|first3=Charles|date=1906|publisher=J.R.

[[File:Jacob Huysmans - Portrait of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester 1.jpg|250px|thumb|Portrait of the poet by [[Jacob Huysmans]]]]
When the King's advisor and friend of Rochester, [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]], lost power in 1673, Rochester's standing fell as well.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> At the Christmas festivities at Whitehall of that year, Rochester delivered a satire to Charles II, "In the Isle of Britain" – which criticized the King for being obsessed with sex at the expense of his kingdom.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> Charles' reaction to this satirical portrayal resulted in Rochester's [[exile]] from the court until February.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> During this time Rochester dwelt at his estate in [[Adderbury]].<ref name= autogenerated11 /> Despite this, in February 1674, after much petitioning by Rochester, the King appointed him Ranger of Woodstock Park.<ref name=autogenerated11 />

In June 1675 "Lord Rochester in a frolick after a rant did ... beat downe the [[sundial|dyill]] (i.e. sundial) which stood in the middle of the Privie Garding, which was esteemed the rarest in Europ".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Great Britain.|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b5063269&view=1up&seq=435|title=Report on the Laing manuscripts, preserved in the University of Edinburgh.|last2=Paton|first2=Henry|last3=Laing|first3=David|last4=Edinburgh University Library.|date=1914–25|publisher=Printed under the authority of H.M.

Rochester fell into disfavour again in 1676. During a late-night scuffle with the night watch, one of Rochester's companions was killed by a pike-thrust. Rochester was reported to have fled the scene of the incident, and his standing with the monarch reached an all-time low.<ref>Johnson, ''Profane Wit'', 250-53</ref> Following this incident, Rochester briefly fled to [[Tower Hill]], where he impersonated a [[Charlatan|mountebank]] "Doctor Bendo". Under this persona, he claimed skill in treating "barrenness" (infertility), and other gynecological disorders. [[Gilbert Burnet]] wryly noted that Rochester's practice was "not without success", implying his intercession of himself as surreptitious sperm donor.<ref>Timbs, John.  ''Doctors and patients, or, Anecdotes of the Medical World and Curiosities of Medicine''.  London: Richard Bentley and Son (1876), p. 151.</ref> On occasion, Rochester also assumed the role of the grave and matronly Mrs. Bendo, presumably so that he could inspect young women privately without arousing their husbands' suspicions.<ref>Alcock, Thomas.

===Death===
By the age of 33, Rochester was dying from what is usually described as the effects of [[tertiary syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]], or other [[venereal disease]]s, combined with the effects of [[alcoholism]]. Carol Richards has disputed this, arguing that it is more likely that he died of [[renal failure]] due to chronic [[nephritis]] ([[Bright's disease]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Carol|title=Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness: the Life of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester|year=2011}}</ref> His mother had him attended in his final weeks by her religious associates, particularly [[Gilbert Burnet]], later [[Bishop of Salisbury]].

After hearing of Burnet's departure from his side, Rochester muttered his last words: "Has my friend left me? Then I shall die shortly." In the early morning of 26 July 1680, Rochester died "without a shudder or a sound".<ref>Johnson, ''Profane Wit'', 327–43</ref> He was buried at [[Spelsbury]] church in [[Oxfordshire]].

A [[deathbed conversion|deathbed renunciation]] of libertinism and conversion to Anglican Christianity, ''Some Passages of the Life and Death of the Honourable John Wilmot Earl of Rochester'', was published by Reverend Burnet.<ref>Norton, D. ''A History of the English Bible as Literature'' Cambridge 2000 pp. 172–3 {{ISBN|0-52177807-7}}</ref>  Because this account appears in Burnet's own writings, its accuracy has been disputed by some scholars, who accuse Burnet with having shaped the account of Rochester's denunciation of libertinism to enhance his own reputation. On the other hand Graham Greene, in his biography of Wilmot, calls Burnet's book "convincing".<ref>Greene, Graham (1974).  ''Lord Rochester's Monkey, being the Life of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester''.  New York: The Bodley Head. p. 208</ref>

[[File:Adderbury Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 818088.jpg|right|thumb|Rochester's manor house in [[Adderbury]], Oxfordshire]]
Rochester's poetic work varies widely in form, genre, and content. He was part of a "mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease",<ref>Alexander Pope, "First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace", line 108.</ref> who continued to produce their poetry in manuscripts, rather than in publication. As a consequence, some of Rochester's work deals with topical concerns, such as satires of courtly affairs in [[Libel (poetry)|libels]], to [[parodies]] of the styles of his contemporaries, such as Sir Carr Scroope. He is also notable for his impromptus,<ref>Rochester composed at least 10 versions of Impromptus on Charles II [http://www.luminarium.org/eightlit/rochester/wilmotbib.htm luminarium.org]</ref> one of which is a teasing epigram on [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]:<blockquote>We have a pretty witty king,

Whose word no man relies on.

He never said a foolish thing,

And never did a wise one<ref>Papers of [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]] (17 November 1706) quoted in Doble, C. E. (editor) (1885) ''Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne Volume 1'', Oxford: Clarendon Press for the Oxford Historical Society, p. 308</ref></blockquote>

To which Charles supposedly replied, "That's true, for my words are my own, but my actions are those of my ministers".<ref>A thorough discourse concerning this epigram and the king's response can be found from the 19th to 21st paragraph of the foreword of "The Tryal of William Penn and William Mead"
[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028831175#page/n17/mode/2up]</ref>

Rochester's poetry displays a range of learning and influences. These included imitations of [[François de Malherbe|Malherbe]], [[Ronsard]], and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. He also translated or adapted from classical authors such as [[Petronius]], [[Lucretius]], [[Ovid]], [[Anacreon]], [[Horace]], and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

Rochester's writings were at once admired and infamous. ''A Satyr Against Mankind'' (1675), one of the few poems he published (in a [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] in 1679), is a scathing denunciation of rationalism and optimism that contrasts human perfidy with animal wisdom.

The majority of his poetry was not published under his name until after his death. Because most of his poems circulated only in manuscript form during his lifetime, it is likely that much of his writing does not survive. Burnet claimed that Rochester's conversion experience led him to ask that "all his profane and lewd writings" be burned;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watts|first=Isaac|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3c026w5b&view=1up&seq=4|title=The Repentance and happy death of the celebrated Earl of Rochester: to which is added some suitable verses on the occurrence by .. Isaac Watts. 1674-1748.|publisher=Printed by Sutton and son, Review office|year=1814|location=Nottingham|page=4}}</ref> it is unclear how much, if any, of Rochester's writing was destroyed.

Rochester was also interested in the theatre. In addition to an interest in actresses, he wrote an adaptation of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[Valentinian (play)|Valentinian]]'' (1685), a scene for [[Robert Howard (playwright)|Sir Robert Howard's]] ''The Conquest of China'', a prologue to [[Elkanah Settle]]'s ''[[The Empress of Morocco]]'' (1673), and epilogues to Sir [[Francis Fane (dramatist)|Francis Fane's]] ''[[Love in the Dark (play)|Love in the Dark]]'' (1675), [[Charles Davenant]]'s ''Circe, a Tragedy'' (1677). The best-known dramatic work attributed to Rochester, ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]]'', has never been successfully proven to be written by him. Posthumous printings of ''Sodom'', however, gave rise to prosecutions for [[obscenity]], and were destroyed. On 16 December 2004 one of the few surviving copies of ''Sodom'' was sold by [[Sotheby's]] for £45,600.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/12/17/artsbriefs041217.html |work=CBC News |title=IN BRIEF: Trump picks new 'Apprentice'; Bawdy 17th century play auctioned |date=17 December 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222034741/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/12/17/artsbriefs041217.html |archive-date=22 December 2008 }}</ref>

Three major critical editions of Rochester in the twentieth century have taken very different approaches to authenticating and organising his canon. David Vieth’s 1968 edition adopts a heavily biographical organisation, modernising spellings and heading the sections of his book "Prentice Work", "Early Maturity", "Tragic Maturity", and "Disillusionment and Death". Keith Walker’s 1984 edition takes a genre-based approach, returning to the older spellings and accidentals in an effort to present documents closer to those a seventeenth-century audience would have received. Harold Love’s Oxford University Press edition of 1999, now the scholarly standard, notes the [[variorum]] history conscientiously, but arranges works in genre sections ordered from the private to the public.

==Reception and influence==
Rochester was the model for a number of rake heroes in plays of the period, such as Don John in [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''The Libertine'' (1675) and Dorimant in [[George Etherege]]'s ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676).<ref name=autogenerated11>{{cite book|editor=Paul Davis|title=Selected Poems: John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12nqhQYU-vwC|year= 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164580-8}}</ref> Meanwhile he was eulogised by his contemporaries such as [[Aphra Behn]] and Andrew Marvell, who described him as "the only man in England that had the true vein of satire".<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17388/17388-h/17388-h.htm The Project Gutenberg eBook of Andrew Marvell, by Augustine Birrell<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Daniel Defoe]] quoted him in ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', and discussed him in other works.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=370|name=Moll Flanders}} Daniel Defoe, ''The Life And Misfortunes of Moll Flanders''</ref> [[Voltaire]], who spoke of Rochester as "the man of genius, the great poet", admired his satire for its "energy and fire" and translated some lines into French to "display the shining imagination his lordship only could boast".<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/21.html/ Great Books Online], François Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694–1778).

By the 1750s, Rochester's reputation suffered as the liberality of the Restoration era subsided; [[Samuel Johnson]] characterised him as a worthless and dissolute rake.<ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite book|author=David Farley-Hills|title=Earl of Rochester: The Critical Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEkrEsLzjHcC&pg=PA8|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-13429-3|page=9}}</ref> [[Horace Walpole]] described him as "a man whom the muses were fond to inspire but ashamed to avow".<ref>Horace Walpole, ''A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England'', 1758.</ref> Despite this general disdain for Rochester, [[William Hazlitt]] commented that his "verses cut and sparkle like diamonds"<ref>William Hazlitt, ''Select British Poets'' (1824)</ref> while his "epigrams were the bitterest, the least laboured, and the truest, that ever were written".<ref name="hazlitt-l">William Hazlitt,
{{Gutenberg|no=16209|name=Lectures on the English Poets}}</ref> Referring to Rochester's perspective, Hazlitt wrote that "his contempt for everything that others respect almost amounts to sublimity".<ref name="hazlitt-l" /> Meanwhile, [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] quoted ''A Satyr against Reason and Mankind'' in English in his ''Autobiography''.<ref>{{Gutenberg||name=Notes and Queries, No.8, 22 December 1849}} Goethe quotes Rochester without attribution.</ref> Despite this, Rochester's work was largely ignored throughout the Victorian era.

Rochester's reputation would not begin to revive until the 1920s. [[Ezra Pound]], in his ''[[ABC of Reading]]'', compared Rochester's poetry favourably to better known figures such as [[Alexander Pope]] and [[John Milton]].<ref>Pound, Ezra. ''ABC of Reading'' (1934)  New Directions (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8112-1893-7}}</ref> Graham Greene characterised Rochester as a "spoiled Puritan".<ref>Lord Rochester's Monkey: Being the Life of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester by Graham Greene Review by: G. S. Avery The Modern Language Review, Vol. 70, No. 4 (October 1975), pp. 857-858</ref> Although [[F. R. Leavis]] argued that "Rochester is not a great poet of any kind", [[William Empson]] admired him. More recently, [[Germaine Greer]] has questioned the validity of the appraisal of Rochester as a drunken rake, and hailed the sensitivity of some of his lyrics.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n18/germaine-greer/doomed-to-sincerity Germaine Greer reviews ‘The Works of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester’ edited by Harold Love · LRB 16 September 1999]</ref>

Rochester was listed #6 in Time Out's "Top 30 chart of London's most erotic writers". Tom Morris, the associate director, of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] said ‘Rochester reminds me of an unhinged poacher, moving noiselessly through the night and shooting every convention that moves. Bishop Burnett, who coached him to an implausible death-bed repentance, said that he was unable to express any feeling without oaths and obscenities. He seemed like a punk in a frock coat. But once the straw dolls have been slain, Rochester celebrates in a sexual landscape all of his own.’<ref name=to>{{cite news|author1=John O‘Connell|title=Sex and books: London's most erotic writers|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/books/sex-and-books-londons-most-erotic-writers|access-date=26 November 2015|work=Time Out|date=28 February 2008}}</ref>

==In popular culture==

A play, ''The Libertine'' (1994), was written by [[Stephen Jeffreys]], and staged by the [[Royal Court Theatre]]. The 2004 film ''[[The Libertine (2004 film)|The Libertine]]'', based on Jeffreys' play, starred [[Johnny Depp]] as Rochester, [[Samantha Morton]] as Elizabeth Barry, [[John Malkovich]] as King Charles II and [[Rosamund Pike]] as Elizabeth Malet. [[Michael Nyman]] set to music an excerpt of Rochester's poem "Signor Dildo" for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/16673-Lord-John-Wilmot-Signor-Dildo |title=Signior Dildo by Lord John Wilmot - All Poetry |publisher=Oldpoetry.com |access-date=2011-06-12}}</ref>

The play ''The Ministry of Pleasure'' by Craig Baxter also dramatises Wilmot's life and was produced at the [[Latchmere Theatre]], London in 2004.

Rochester is the central character in Anna Lieff Saxby's 1996 erotic novella, ''No Paradise but Pleasure''.

[[Nick Cave]]'s 2004 song "There She Goes, My Beautiful World", from the album ''[[Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus]]'', includes the lines 'John Wilmot penned his poetry / Riddled with the pox'.

[[Germaine Greer]] published a piece called 'Doomed to Sincerity'<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v21/n18/germaine-greer/doomed-to-sincerity|title = Doomed to Sincerity|journal = London Review of Books|date = 16 September 1999|volume = 21|issue = 18|last1 = Greer|first1 = Germaine}}</ref> about the life of the Earl.
