== Themes ==
The main themes of  Dharker's poetry include home, freedom, journeys, geographical and cultural displacement, communal conflict and gender politics.<ref name="pwi">{{cite web |url=http://india.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=2720&x=1| title=Imtiaz Dharker| access-date=2006-11-20| work=Poetry International Web}}</ref>  All her books are published by the poetry publishing house [[Bloodaxe Books]]. Her poems, true to her experience, are moving testaments of global living, intercultural identities, itinerant existence, and human relationships. 'This mixed heritage and itinerant lifestyle is at the heart of her writing: questioning, imagistic and richly textured poems that span geographical and cultural displacement, conflict and gender politics, while also interrogating received ideas about home, freedom and faith. Yet for all the seriousness of her themes, Dharker is a truly global poet, whose work speaks plainly and with great emotional intelligence to anyone who has ever felt adrift in the increasingly complex, multicultural and shrinking world we inhabit. For a number of years now, her poems have been taught on the UK national curriculum. Right from 'Speech Balloon', charting the spread of a phrase from one culture to another, you experience Dharker's restless search for meaning and identity; what critic Arundhati Subramaniam describes as an "unabashed embrace of unsettlement as settlement" and "an exhilarating sense of life at the interstices". This is resonant in companion pieces 'Living Space' and 'One Breath', in which the fragility of homes in Mumbai, India becomes a wider metaphor for unstable personal and communal identities, as it is in the title poem from Leaving Fingerprints (2009), where the symbolism of those marks – immutable, personal and unique – merges with the stratigraphy of the living landscape...Those from her earliest books, Purdah (1988) and Postcards from god (1997), feature concise, atmospheric conjurings of place: one of Dharker's better-known poems, 'Blessing'...describes a slum neighbourhood in Mumbai where a mains water pipe bursts. But there are also poems with a philosophical edge, which ventriloquise the almighty so as to question the nature of belief and the tensions between the religious and secular. In 'Postcards from god I', for instance, the deity is a blank canvas, "nothing but a space / that someone has to fill", while in "Question 1" God becomes a TV channel-hopper, fast-forwarding, pausing and rewinding through our prayers, asking: "Am I there / when I can't hear your voice"? These poems harbour an obvious gravitas, but their accessibility, contemporaneity, and occasional levity lend them an inviting dynamism. Poems from a third collection, I speak for the devil (2001), explore the place of women in contemporary societies both East and West. 'Honour killing' is a defiant, subtly politicised piece, beginning with an identity strip-tease; "what happens when the self", as Dharker herself puts it, "squeezes past the easy cage of bone". The subjective nature of perspective and openness of interpretation are also at the crux of a fourth book, The terrorist at my table (2006), which revels in blurring the public and personal. 'The right word' is perhaps the most successful of these: describing the same scene in repeatedly differing terms, an anonymous figure is seen as a terrorist, freedom fighter, guerrilla warrior and martyr, before being cast as "a boy who looks like your son". 
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://poetryarchive.org/poet/imtiaz-dharker/ |title=Imtiaz Dharker |website=The Poetry Archive}}</ref> Of her book 'Over the Moon' the critic [[Muneeza Shamsie]] says,'Dharker's lyrical and poignant poems provide a nuanced quiet interplay with words but at the heart of the collection is a powerful and moving sequence which describes her husband's struggle against cancer and his last days. In 'Stab' her grief and anger emerges in the staccato words: "Stab the page. Stab it in the heart./Find the word that is not a word./Find the word that is a blade." 'You Said Something I did not Understand' tells of her husband in hospital, "the unfamiliar bed/a prison, your body behind bars/your bright spirit locked away". 'Vigil' describes him tied to a machine, as she watches over him until its signals stop: "I try to read its face./The machine is blinking back/its tears". She goes on to write of his funeral in 'After' and the sense of unreality. In 'The Other Side of Silence' images of grass, a broken eggshell and rain heighten the sadness and emptiness...In this spectacular collection — certainly Dharker's best — she encapsulates a myriad of intensely personal emotions with remarkable skill and control and gives her poems a further context by her black and white illustrations which accompany her words'.<ref>{{cite news |author=Muneeza Shamsie |date=August 23, 2015 |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1201907 |title=REVIEW: Song of love and loss: Over the Moon by Imtiaz Dharker |work=Dawn}}</ref>

== Film ==

Dharker is also a video film maker and has written and directed more than a hundred films and audio-visuals, centering on education, reproductive health and shelter for women and children. In 1980 she was awarded a [[Silver Lotus Award|Silver Lotus]] for a short film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imtiazdharker.com/films|title=Imtiaz Dharker|work=imtiazdharker.com|access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref>
 
== Art ==

An accomplished artist, she has had 11 solo exhibitions of pen-and-ink drawings in India, Hong Kong, USA, UK, and France. All her poetry collections contain her drawings. She was one of the poet/artists featured in the Poet Slash Artist exhibition curated by poet [[Lemn Sissay]] and the art guru [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]] for Manchester International Festival 2021, along with [[Tracy Emin]], [[Lubaina Himid]], [[Precious Okoyomon]], Julien Creuzet, [[Inua Ellams]], [[Jay Bernard (writer)|Jay Bernard]], [[Adonis]], [[Etel Adnan]], [[Anne Boyer]], [[Jimmie Durham]],  [[Ibrahim El-Salahi]], [[Renee Gladman]], Vivienne Griffin, [[Sky Hopinka]], Isaiah Hull, Tarek Lakhrissi, Lebogang Mashifane, [[Friederike Mayröcker]], Jota Mombaça, Heather Phillipson, Tiffany Sia, Cecilia Vicuña, [[Xu Bing]], [[Gozo Yoshimasu]]. 

'In classical Chinese, Arabic and Persian poetry, calligraphy connects the verbal and visual in ways that make poetry and art practically the same thing. That way of seeing words is remade for today by Imtiaz Dharker in her captivating drawing My Breath. Stripes flow magically out of her body into space. The lines continue their journey through a second picture, then in the third become words, lines of poetry repeated, repeated, repeated through entire blocks of text. It is a perfect illustration of the subtle and mysterious relationship between writing and drawing, seeing and reading. Poet Slash Artist, curated by the poet Lemn Sissay and the art guru Hans Ulrich Obrist, probes the mystery of that borderland, and finds what can only be called spirituality. The soul, even... This exhibition is a manifesto for a new culture, where the hubbub and hype are silenced, and at last we can hear one another think.'<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/02/poet-slash-artist-review-manchester-home |title=Poet Slash Artist review – if this show is art's future, it looks good to me |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 July 2021}}</ref>
