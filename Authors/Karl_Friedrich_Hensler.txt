[[Karl von Marinelli]], manager of the [[Theater in der Leopoldstadt]] in Vienna, staged his play ''Der Soldat von Cherson'', which opened on 1 May 1785. After its success, Hensler wrote many more plays for this theatre; his plays include ''Das Donauweibchen'', ''Die Nymphe der Donau'' and ''Die Teufelsmühle am Wienerberg''.<ref name=blko/><ref name=adb>{{cite wikisource |wslanguage=de |title=ADB:Hensler, Karl Friedrich |year=1880}}</ref><ref name=nettl>Paul Nettl (1956).

When Marinelli died in 1803, Hensler leased the Leopoldstadt Theatre and managed it until 1813. He took over the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna in 1817, and the following year theatres in Pressburg (present-day [[Bratislava]]) and Baden. In Vienna he rebuilt the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]]; it opened in 1822 with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s overture written for the occasion, ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]''.<ref name=blko/><ref name=nettl/>

Hensler died in Vienna in 1825. His daughter Josepha von Scheidlin took over the management of the Josefstadt Theatre.<ref name=blko/>
