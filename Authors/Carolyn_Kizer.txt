'''Carolyn Ashley Kizer''' (December 10, 1925 – October 9, 2014) was an American poet of the [[Pacific Northwest]] whose works reflect her feminism. She won the  [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1985.

According to an article at the Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest, "Kizer reach[ed] into mythology in poems like ''Semele Recycled''; into politics, into feminism, especially in her series of poems called "Pro Femina"; into science, the natural world, music, and translations and commentaries on Japanese and Chinese literatures".<ref name=center>[http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Reading%20the%20Region/Northwest%20Schools%20of%20Literature/Commentary/8.html].

==Life==
Kizer was born in [[Spokane, Washington]], the daughter of a socially prominent Spokane couple.<ref>Eastern Washington University Press Web site, Web page titled "Picking and Choosing: Essays on Prose by Carolyn Kiser"</ref>

Her father, Benjamin Hamilton Kizer (1878–1978),<ref>{{cite web|title=Kizer, Benjamin H. (Benjamin Hamilton), 1878-1978|website=Social Networks and Archival Context (snaccooperative.org)|url=https://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6n017tr}}</ref>  who was 45 when she was born, was a successful attorney. Her mother, Mabel Ashley Kizer, was a professor of biology who had received her doctorate from [[Stanford University]].

Kizer was once asked if she agreed with a description of her father as someone who "came across as supremely structured, intelligent, polite but always somewhat remote". Her reply: "Add 'authoritarian and severe', and you get a pretty good approximation of how he appeared to that stranger, his child". At times, she related, her father gave her the same "viscera-shriveling" voice she heard him use later on "members of the House Un-American Activities Committee and other villains of the 1950s, to even more devastating effect", and, she added, "I almost forgave him."<ref name=center/>

After graduating from [[Lewis and Clark High School]] in Spokane, she went on to get her bachelor's degree from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] (where she studied comparative mythologies with [[Joseph Campbell]]) in 1945 and study as a graduate at both [[Columbia University]] (1945–46) and the [[University of Washington]] (1946–47).<ref>{{cite web|title=Carolyn Kizer 1925–2014|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/carolyn-kizer|publisher=Poetry Foundation|access-date=11 October 2014}}</ref>

She then moved back to Washington state, and in 1946 married Charles Stimson Bullitt, an attorney from a wealthy and influential Seattle family, with whom she had three children; Fred Nemo, [[Jill Bullitt]], and Ashley Bullitt.<ref>http://www.legacy.com/ns/carolyn-kizer-obituary/172813740 {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref> Her husband was the son of [[Dorothy Bullitt]], who founded the [[Bullitt Foundation]] and the [[King Broadcasting Company]]. In 1954 she enrolled in a creative writing workshop run by poet [[Theodore Roethke]]. "Kizer had three small kids, a big house on North Capitol Hill, enough money to get by and more than enough talent and determination.  And although one of her poems had been published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' when she was 17, she remembers that she needed a nudge from Roethke to get serious."<ref name=zahler>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/engl/events/kizer.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920125341/http://depts.washington.edu/engl/events/kizer.html |archive-date=2006-09-20 }} Zahler, Richard, article from the ''Seattle Times'', (no specific date) 1985, as reprinted at the University of Washington English Department Web site, Web page titled: "Theodore Roethke Memorial Poetry Readings: Carolyn Kizer Interview (1985)"</ref>
Her marriage to Bullitt ended in divorce in 1954.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-carolyn-kizer-20141014-story.html|title = Carolyn Kizer dies at 89; Pulitzer winner's poems reflected her feminism|date = 13 October 2014}}</ref>
In 1959, she helped found ''Poetry Northwest'' and served as its editor until 1965.<ref name=zahler/>

She was a "Specialist in Literature" for the [[U.S. State Department]] in [[Pakistan]] 1965–1966, during which she taught for several months in that country. 
In 1966, she became the first director of Literary Programs for the newly created [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. She resigned that post in 1970, when the N.E.A. chairman, [[Roger L. Stevens]], was fired by President [[Richard Nixon]]. She was a consultant to the N.E.A. for the following year.<ref name=suny>{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/kizer.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915133505/http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/kizer.html |archive-date=2006-09-15 }} New York State Writers Institute of the State University of New York Web site, Web page titled "Carolyn Kizer: September 29, 1999 (Wednesday)". Retrieved November 1, 2006.</ref>

In the 1970s and 1980s, she held appointments as poet-in-residence or lecturer at universities across the country including [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[San Jose State University]] and [[the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. She has been a visiting writer at literary conferences and events across the country, as well as in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], and [[Paris]].<ref name=suny/>  Kizer was also a member of the faculty of the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]].

She was appointed to the post of Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1995, but resigned three years later to protest the absence of women and minorities on the governing board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/read/Carolyn-Kizer-101785417|title = Obituary of Carolyn Kizer}}</ref>

Kizer was married to the architect-historian, John Marshall Woodbridge. When she was not teaching and lecturing, she divided her time between their home in [[Sonoma, California]] and their apartment in Paris.<ref name=suny/>

She died on October 9, 2014 in Sonoma, California due to effects of dementia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Carolyn Kizer, Pulitzer-Winning Poet, Dies at 89|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/arts/artsspecial/carolyn-kizer-pulitzer-winning-poet-dies-at-89.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=nytimesarts&_r=1|access-date=11 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2014}}</ref>
