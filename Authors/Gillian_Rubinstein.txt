'''Gillian Rubinstein''' (born 29 August 1942) is an English-born children's author and playwright. Born in Potten End, [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name= potten>{{cite web |title= Potten End (A Guide to Old Hertfordshire) |publisher= hertfordshire-genealogy |url= http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/links/potten-end.htm}}</ref><ref name = austlit>{{cite web |title= Rubenstein, Gillian |publisher= Austlit |url= http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A$%2cj| access-date= 2008-03-24}}</ref> England, Rubinstein split her childhood between England and Nigeria, moving to Australia in 1973.<ref name= "bio">{{cite web |title= Gillian Rubinstein: About Me - Personal Biography |publisher= Gillian Rubinstein |url= http://www.gillianrubinstein.com/ |access-date= 2007-07-15}}</ref> As well as eight plays, numerous short stories and articles, she has written over 30 books. Her award-winning and hugely popular 1986 debut ''[[Space Demons]]'' introduced the themes of growing up and fantasy worlds which emerge often in her other writings. Books such as ''At Ardilla'', ''Foxspell'' and ''[[Galax-Arena]]'' all received critical acclaim and multiple awards.

In 2001, Rubinstein published ''[[Across the Nightingale Floor]]'', the first of the best-selling three-book series ''[[Tales of the Otori]]'' series under the pseudonym '''Lian Hearn'''. The series is set in a fictional island nation resembling [[feudalism|feudal]] Japan and is her first work to reach an adult audience.

The name  'Lian', comes from a childhood nickname and  'Hearn' apparently refers to herons which are a prominent theme in the series. It has also been suggested that the surname is most likely borrowed from [[Lafcadio Hearn]]; one of the first Western writers to tackle Japanese mythology.

Gillian Rubinstein currently resides in [[Goolwa, South Australia]].
