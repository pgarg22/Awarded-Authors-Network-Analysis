'''Terence Graham Parry Jones''' (1 February 1942 – 21 January 2020)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/terry-jones/ |work=BBC Wales |date=7 October 2009 |title=Terry Jones}}</ref><ref name="Guardian"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/terry-jones-death-monty-python-age-cause-a9296546.html|first=Jacob|last=Stolworthy |title=Terry Jones death: Monty Python star and Life of Brian director dies, aged 77|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> was a Welsh actor, author, comedian, director, historian, poet, presenter, writer, and member of the [[Monty Python]] comedy team.

After graduating from [[Oxford University]] with a degree in English, Jones and writing partner [[Michael Palin]] wrote and performed for several high-profile British comedy programmes, including ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' and ''[[The Frost Report]]'', before creating ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' with Cambridge graduates [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], and [[Eric Idle]] and American animator-filmmaker [[Terry Gilliam]]. Jones was largely responsible for the programme's innovative, surreal structure, in which sketches flowed from one to the next without the use of punch lines. He made his directorial debut with the Python film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'', which he co-directed with Gilliam, and also directed the subsequent Python films ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]''.

Jones co-created and co-wrote with Palin the anthology series ''[[Ripping Yarns]]''. He also wrote an early draft of [[Jim Henson]]'s film ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'', though little of his work remained in the final cut. Jones was a well-respected [[medieval]] historian, having written several books and presented television documentaries about the period, as well as a prolific children's book author. In 2016, Jones received a Lifetime Achievement award at the [[BAFTA Cymru]] Awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film. After living for several years with a degenerative [[aphasia]], he gradually lost the ability to speak and died in 2020 from [[frontotemporal dementia]].<ref name="Guardian"/>

Jones was born in the seaside town of [[Colwyn Bay]], on the north coast of [[Wales]], the son of homemaker Dilys Louisa (Newnes), and Alick George Parry-Jones, a bank clerk.<ref name="Guardian">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/22/terry-jones-monty-python-founder-and-life-of-brian-director-dies-aged-77|title=Terry Jones, Monty Python founder and Life of Brian director, dies aged 77|last=Pulver|first=Andrew|date=22 January 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=22 January 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GkYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Alick+George+Parry+(a+bank+clerk)+and+Dilys+Louisa+(a+homemaker;+maiden+name,+Newnes)+Jones;%22|title=Something about the Author|date=24 January 2002|publisher=Gale Research|via=Google Books|isbn=9780787647155}}</ref> The family home was named ''Bodchwil''.

Jones was a year ahead of Palin at Oxford, and on first meeting him Palin states, "The first thing that struck me was what a nice bloke he was. He had no airs and graces. We had a similar idea of what humour could do and where it should go, mainly because we both liked characters; we both appreciated that comedy wasn't just jokes."<ref>{{cite news |title=Michael Palin interview |url=https://thechap.co.uk/2018/09/19/michael-palin/ |access-date=28 August 2019 |work=Chap.co.uk}}</ref>

== Career history ==

=== Before Python and early Python ===
[[File:Flyingcircus 2.jpg|thumb|Jones (seated left) as a member of Monty Python in 1969]]
Jones appeared in ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with Michael Palin, [[Graeme Garden]], [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]], as well as the television series ''[[The Complete and Utter History of Britain]]'' (1969). He appeared in ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' (1967–69) with Palin, [[Eric Idle]] and [[David Jason]]. He wrote for ''[[The Frost Report]]'' and several other [[David Frost]] programmes on British television.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thefrostreport/|title=The Frost Report|publisher=BBC|access-date=9 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/07/08/jimmy-gilbert-bbc-producer-who-presided-over-a-golden-age-of-lig/|title=Jimmy Gilbert, BBC producer who presided over a golden age of light entertainment – obituary|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 June 2016|access-date=9 July 2016}}</ref> Of Jones' contributions as a performer to ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', his depictions of middle-aged women (or "ratbag old women" as termed by the BBC, also known as "pepper-pots" or "grannies from hell") are among the most memorable.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |access-date=24 August 2019 |work=BBC}}</ref>

=== Directorial work ===
Jones co-directed ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' with [[Terry Gilliam]], and was sole director on two further Monty Python movies, ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]''. As a film director, Jones finally gained fuller control of the projects and devised a visual style that complemented the humour. His later films include ''[[Erik the Viking]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1996 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' (1996). In 2008, Jones wrote the libretto for and directed the opera ''Evil Machines''.<ref>{{Cite news | first = Francesca |  last = Martin |url = https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/16/theatre3| title = Ex-Python's opera rings the changes | newspaper=The Guardian| location = London| date = 16 January 2008 |access-date = 11 September 2018}}</ref> In 2011, he was commissioned to direct and write the libretto for another opera, entitled ''The Doctor's Tale''.<ref>{{Cite news | first = Holly | last = Williams | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/features/heads-up-operashots-2226603.html | title = Heads Up: Operashots | newspaper = The Independent | location = London | date = 27 February 2011 | access-date = 11 September 2018 | archive-date = 17 August 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180817193515/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/features/heads-up-operashots-2226603.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Three of the films which Jones directed—''The Meaning of Life'', ''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' and ''[[Personal Services]]''—were banned in Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moralism: A Study of a Vice|first=Craig|last=Taylor|page=171|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-317-54771-6}}</ref>

Jones directed the 2015 comedy film ''[[Absolutely Anything]]'', about a disillusioned schoolteacher who is given the chance to do anything he wishes by a group of aliens watching from space.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Gioia|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/188150-Monty-Python-Members-Eddie-Izzard-Robin-Williams-and-More-Among-Cast-of-Absolutely-Anything-Film?tsrc=nx|title=Monty Python Members, Eddie Izzard, Robin Williams and More Among Cast of ''Absolutely Anything'' Film|magazine=Playbill|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=27 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302220515/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/188150-Monty-Python-Members-Eddie-Izzard-Robin-Williams-and-More-Among-Cast-of-Absolutely-Anything-Film?tsrc=nx |archive-date=2 March 2014 }}</ref> The film features [[Simon Pegg]], [[Kate Beckinsale]], [[Robin Williams]] and the voices of the five remaining members of Monty Python.

In 2016, Jones directed ''Jeepers Creepers'', a West End play about the life of comic [[Marty Feldman]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/marty-feldman-and-jeepers-creepers-why-terry-jones-is-celebrating-the-comic-on-stage-a6807896.html  |first=Terry|last=Jones |title=Marty Feldman and 'Jeepers Creepers': Why Terry Jones is celebrating the comic on stage|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> It would be Jones' last directing work before his death.

=== Writer and brewer ===
Jones wrote many books and screenplays, including comic works and more serious writing on medieval history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Terry Jones |url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Terry+Jones&dblist=638&fq=ap%3A%22jones%2C+terry%22&qt=facet_ap%3A#x0%253Abook-%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Aprintbook%2529%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Adigital%2529%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Athsis%2529%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Alargeprint%2529%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Amic%2529%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Abraille%2529%2C%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Amss%2529format |publisher=WorldCat |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="St Edmund Hall" />

A member of the [[Campaign for Real Ale]], Jones also had interest in real ale and in 1977 co-founded the Penrhos Brewery, a microbrewery at Penrhos Court at [[Penrhos, Herefordshire]], which ran until 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2008/09/11/A-pint-with-Terry-Jones|title=A pint with Terry Jones|website=morningadvertiser.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10906130/12-things-you-didnt-know-about-British-beer.html|title=12 things you didn't know about British beer|first=Jessica|last=Boak|date=19 June 2014|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

==== Comedy ====
Jones co-wrote ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' with Palin. They also wrote a play, ''Underwood's Finest Hour'', about an obstetrician distracted during a birth by the radio broadcast of a [[Test cricket|Test match]], which played at the [[Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith]], in 1981.<ref>[[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]], "Bookshelf", ''[[The Cricketer]]'', January 1982, p. 35.</ref> Jones also wrote numerous works for children, including ''Fantastic Stories'', ''The Beast with a Thousand Teeth'' and a collection of comic verse called ''The Curse of the Vampire's Socks''.<ref name="Writers of Wales">{{cite web |title=Terry Jones |url=http://welshwriters.co.uk/terry-jones/ |website=Writers of Wales |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="Fantastic Fiction">{{cite web |title=Terry Jones |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/j/terry-jones/ |website=Fantastic Fiction |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>

Jones was the co-creator (with [[Gavin Scott]]) of the [[animated]] TV series ''[[Blazing Dragons]]'' (1996–1998), which parodied the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends and [[Middle Ages]] periods. Reversing a common story convention, the series' [[protagonists]] are [[anthropomorphic]] [[dragons]] beset by evil humans.<ref name="Writers of Wales" /><ref name="Fantastic Fiction" />

==== Screenplays ====
Jones wrote the screenplay for ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), although his draft went through several rewrites and several other writers before being filmed; consequently, much of the finished film was not actually written by Jones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/la2/withinyourheart/monty.html|title=The Terry Jones Labyrinth Interview|website=angelfire.com}}</ref>

==== History ====
{{Quote box|width=29%|align=right|quote="[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as [[fossil fuel]]s, or [[Rupert Bear]], or mercenaries in the [[Middle Ages]] or Modern China&nbsp;... in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge."|source=—Python biographer George Perry on Jones.<ref>Perry, George (2007). ''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref>}}
Jones wrote books and presented television documentaries on [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Classical antiquity|ancient history]]. His first book was ''Chaucer's Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary'' (1980), which offers an alternative take on [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Knight's Tale]]''. Chaucer's knight is often interpreted as a paragon of Christian virtue, but Jones asserts that if one studies historical accounts of the battles the knight claims he was involved in, he can be interpreted as a typical [[mercenary]] and a potentially cold-blooded killer. He also co-wrote ''Who Murdered Chaucer?'' (2003) in which he argues that Chaucer was close to [[King Richard II]], and that after Richard was deposed, Chaucer was persecuted to death by [[Thomas Arundel]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Myerson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/classics.highereducation|title=Review: Who Murdered Chaucer?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 November 2003|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref>

Jones' TV series also frequently challenged popular views of history. For example, in ''[[Terry Jones' Medieval Lives]]'' (2004; for which he received a 2004 [[Emmy]] nomination for "Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/shows/terry-jones-medieval-lives|title=Terry Jones' Medieval Lives|website=emmys.com|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> he argues that the Middle Ages was a more sophisticated period than is popularly thought,<ref name=tjml>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3507439.stm|title=Python slams 'overrated' Renaissance|work=BBC News|date=23 February 2004|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> and ''[[Terry Jones' Barbarians]]'' (2006) presents the cultural achievements of peoples conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in a more positive light than Roman historians typically have, attributing the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] in 410 AD to propaganda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00791rm|title=BBC One – Terry Jones's Barbarians|website=BBC}}</ref>

==== Column writing ====
Jones wrote numerous columns for ''[[The Guardian]], [[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' condemning the [[Iraq War]]. Many of these editorials were published in a paperback collection titled ''Terry Jones's War on the War on Terror''.<ref name="St Edmund Hall">{{cite web |title=Terry Jones {{!}} Honorary Fellow |url=https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/people/terry-jones |website=St Edmund Hall |access-date=22 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013050910/https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/people/terry-jones |archive-date=13 October 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Python gets serious |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/books/04/12/terry.jones/ |access-date=22 January 2020 |agency=CNN}}</ref>

In November 2011, his book ''[[Evil Machines]]'' was launched by the online publishing house Unbound at the Adam Street Club in London. It was the first book to be published by a [[crowdfunding]] website dedicated solely to books.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Jones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/11/terry-jones-publishing-evil-machines|title=How a new online venture helped to publish Evil Machines|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 November 2011|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref> Jones provided significant support to Unbound as they developed their publishing concept.

=== Work with musicians ===
Jones performed with the [[The Carnival Band (folk group)|Carnival Band]] and appears on their 2007 CD ''Ringing the Changes''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/14/worldmusic.shopping2 |title=CD: Maddy Prior and the Carnival Band, Ringing the Changes |first=Robin|last=Denselow |date=14 December 2007 |website=theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Maddy-Prior-The-Carnival-Band-Ringing-The-Changes/release/1511924|title=Maddy Prior & The Carnival Band - Ringing The Changes|website=Discogs}}</ref>

In January 2008, the [[Teatro São Luiz]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, premiered ''Evil Machines'' – a musical play, written by Jones (based on his book), with original music by Portuguese composer Luis Tinoco. Jones was invited by the Teatro São Luiz to write and direct the play, after a successful run of ''Contos Fantásticos'', a short play based on Jones' ''Fantastic Stories'', also with music by Tinoco.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-Monty Python star Terry Jones blends machines, opera in new show |url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/jan/10/ex-monty-python-star-terry-jones-blends-machines/ |access-date=22 January 2020 |work=The Spokesman Review}}</ref>

Apart from a cameo in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]'' and a minor role as a drunken vicar in the BBC sitcom ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', Jones rarely appeared in work outside his own projects. From 2009 to 2011, however, he provided narration for ''[[The Legend of Dick and Dom]]'', a [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] fantasy series set in the Middle Ages.

=== Political views ===
Jones published a number of articles on political and social commentary, principally in newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]''. Many of these articles mocked the [[War on Terror]], belittling it as "declaring war on an abstract noun" and comparing it to attempting to "annihilate mockery".<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Jones|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1364012/Why-grammar-is-the-first-casualty-of-war.html|title=Why grammar is the first casualty of war|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 December 2001|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref>

In August 2014, Jones was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to ''The Guardian'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2014 |access-date=26 August 2014}}</ref>

=== Health and death ===

In 2015, Jones was diagnosed with [[primary progressive aphasia]], a form of [[frontotemporal dementia]] that impairs the ability to speak and communicate. He had first given cause for concern during the Monty Python reunion show ''Monty Python Live (Mostly)'' in July 2014 because of difficulties learning his lines.<ref name="absconded">{{cite news|first=Robin|last=McKie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/16/monty-python-terry-jones-learning-to-live-with-dementia?CMP=edit_2221|title=Terry Jones: 'I've got dementia.
