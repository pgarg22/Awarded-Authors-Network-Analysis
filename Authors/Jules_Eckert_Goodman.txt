==Life and career==
Jules Eckert Goodman was born November 2, 1876 in [[Gervais, Oregon]], one of six children<ref name=wpa>{{cite journal|journal=Oregon Inventory of Historic Properties|title= 210 Northwest 22nd Place|page=2|date=August 1991|publisher=State of Oregon}}</ref> born to S. Newman and Jenette Rothschild Goodman.<ref name=jewry>{{cite book|title=Who's Who in American Jewry|volume=1|page=222|author1=Schwartz, Julius|author2=Kaye, Solomon Aaron|author3=Simons, John|publisher=Jewish Biographical Bureau|year=1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWrXAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> His family was [[Jews|Jewish]], and his mother was a native of [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]].<ref name=jewry/> Prior to settling in Gervais and starting a family, Jeanette had resided in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]'s [[Multnomah Hotel]].<Ref name=wpa/>

Eckert received an undergraduate degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1899 and master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1901.  He was managing editor for four years of ''[[Current Literature]]'' and also wrote for ''Outing'' and the ''Dramatic Mirror''.<ref name="bookman1">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_T9xBJUMMy8C&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false Chronicle and Comment], ''[[The Bookman (New York)]]'', April 1911, p. 129</ref><ref name="vissy">[https://books.google.com/books?id=-wFEAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false Vicissitudes of a Playwright], ''Theatre Magazine'', January 1916, at p. 17</ref>  He had his first success on Broadway with 1910's ''[[Mother (1910 play)|Mother]]''.

The successful ''The Silent Voice'' (1914) (derived from a short story by [[Gouverneur Morris (novelist)|Gouverneur Morris]]<ref name="govstory">Morris, Gouverneur. [https://books.google.com/books?id=n8ExAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA278#v=onepage&q&f=false The Man Who Played God], in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)]]'', Vol. 52, No. 2, January 1912, at p. 278-89</ref>) was adapted to film four times; first in 1915, then again in 1922 under the title ''The Man Who Played God'' (the title of the original Morris story).   A talking-movie version also called ''[[The Man Who Played God (1932 film)|The Man Who Played God]]'' appeared in 1932, starring [[George Arliss]] (who was also in the 1922 silent film) and [[Bette Davis]], a role she credited as her big "break" in Hollywood.  Lastly, and least appealingly, it appeared as a campy 1955 star vehicle for [[Liberace]] called ''Sincerely Yours''.<ref name="lib2">Wilson, John.

Among other film adaptions of Goodman's work, ''[[The Man Who Came Back (1931 film)|The Man Who Came Back]]'' appeared in 1931.  Goodman's reported last play ''Many Mansions'' (1937) was written with his son Eckert Goodman.<ref name="ox1">Bordman, Gerald & Thomas S. Hischak.

Goodman died of pneumonia in [[Peekskill, New York]], where he had resided for forty years, on July 10, 1962.  His wife died in 1959, and he was survived by one son (Jules Eckert Goodman Jr.), and two daughters, Helen Goodman and Anna Freedgood.<ref name="nytobit">(11 July 1962).
