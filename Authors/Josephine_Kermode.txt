'''Josephine Kermode''' (1852–1937) was a [[Manx people|Manx]] poet and playwright better known by the pen name "Cushag".

==Early life==
Margaret Letitia Josephine Kermode was born on 18 September 1852, at 73 Parliament Street, [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]].<ref name="Radcliffe">'Cushag: An Appreciation’by Constance Radcliffe, in ''Them ‘Oul Times: Poems by Cushag'', Edited and Published by Constance Radcliffe, 1993, pp. i–iii (available on [https://www.flickr.com/photos/manxliterature/sets/72157633428959195/ ''Manx Literature'' on Flickr] (accessed 20 June 2013))</ref> She was one of seven children who lived beyond childhood to Rev William Kermode (1815–1890), and his second wife, Jane née Bishop (1818–1858), of Shelton Hall, [[Staffordshire]].<ref name="www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook">'Philip Moore Callow Kermode, 1855–1935', by Frances Coakley on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/antiqarn/pmck.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref><ref>'The Kermode Family of Ramsey' by [[William Cubbon]], in ''The Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society'', Vol 5 No 1, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/v051p109.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> As well as being Chaplain of [[St Paul's, Ramsey|St. Paul's Church, Ramsey]], Josephine Kermode's father was President of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society and he was to initiate a Parish Book for Ballaugh, in which he wrote a useful account of the antiquarian remains in the parish.<ref>Chapter 1 Manx Worthies, A.W.

Cushag, as she came to be known, and her sisters were educated at home by a governess, while her brothers went to public school.<ref name="Radcliffe" /> She and the family moved around the north of the island as her father changed jobs, moving from St. Paul's in Ramsey to become, first, Vicar at [[Maughold (parish)|Kirk Maughold]] (1871–77) and then [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Ballaugh]] (1877–1890).<ref name="Woolley">'Kermode, Josephine ('Cushag')’ by Sue Woolley, in ''New Manx Worthies'' ed. Dollin Kelly, Douglas, Manx National Heritage, 2006</ref><ref>'Clergyman had three wives and 14 children', published Tuesday 26 February 2008, [http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/clergyman-had-three-wives-and-14-children-1-1770468 IOM Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150341/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/clergyman-had-three-wives-and-14-children-1-1770468 |date=13 April 2014 }}</ref>

After her father's death in 1890, the family moved back to Ramsey, to Hillside on Vernon Road.<ref name="Radcliffe" /><ref name="Woolley" /> Here Cushag took up a voluntary role as a District Nurse, until her health was adversely affected and she was obliged to stop.<ref name="Radcliffe" /> Eventually the family moved to the former home of Cushag's grandparents' in Claughbane, on the outskirts of Ramsey.<ref name="Woolley" />

Cushag never married, and she acted as [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] for her brother [[P. M. C. Kermode|P.M.C. Kermode]] from 1908, the year after his seminal work on the [[Manx runestones|Manx Crosses]] was published.<ref name="Radcliffe" />

P.M.C., as he was known,<ref name="Cubbon" /> was an amateur archaeologist and historian at this time, whilst working full-time as Clerk to the Justices at Ramsey.<ref name="www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook"/> Cushag was described as sharing with her brother "the same gentle kindliness and old-fashioned courtesy; proud, yet modest; sensitive and yet lovable."<ref>'The Kermode Family of Ramsey' by William Cubbon, in ''The Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society'', Vol 5 Np 1, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/v051p109.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> She respected P.M.C with the "reverence for a genius."<ref name="Cubbon" />

They lived in a secluded house in Glen Auldyn, with the river running through its garden and a meadow next to it for the grazing of their horse, Brownie.<ref name="Cubbon" />

==''Poems by "Cushag"'', 1907==
[[File:Common Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea).jpg|thumb|The Cushag, the national flower of the Isle of Man]]
Kermode's first published work was 'A Lonan Legend', in 1899.<ref name="Radcliffe" /> Her first collection of poems, ''Poems by "Cushag"'', was published in August 1907.<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=RYC/1907/08/30&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ad00827&PageLabel=8 'Now Ready: Poems by Cushag'] advert in ''Ramsey Courier''. 30 Aug 1907 (available through the [[Manx National Heritage]] [http://www.imuseum.im/ iMuseum])</ref> It was at this time that she adopted the [[Pen name|nom de plume]], "Cushag", by which she then came to be universally known.<ref name="Radcliffe" /> The name comes from the [[Manx language|Manx]] word for [[Jacobaea vulgaris|ragwort]], the official flower of the Isle of Man.<ref>[http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flower www.gov.im] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510212828/http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml |date=10 May 2007 }}</ref> The collection featured a poem about the flower:

<blockquote>
:Now, the Cushag, we know,
:Must never grow,
:Where the farmer's work is done.
:But along the rills,
:In the heart of the hills,
:The Cushag may shine like the sun.
:Where the golden flowers,
:Have fairy powers,
:To gladden our hearts with their grace.
:And in Vannin Veg Veen,
:In the valleys green,
:The Cushags have still a place.
</blockquote>

The collection was well received on the island, which was at the time undergoing the blossoming of the Manx cultural revival, with much work on the island’s culture being done in the wake of the poet and [[Thomas Edward Brown|T. E. Brown]] and the novelist [[Hall Caine]]. The English press received Cushag's collection in a positive though reserved manner, as shown by a review in the Manchester City News:

<blockquote>
“a modest little volume of seventy-two pages, contains some forty short poems, mostly tales in verse, in all of which the introspective temperament so characteristic of the Manx people, with its resultant note of sadness, is well reflected. While not soaring to empyrean heights, “Cushag,” in pleasing rhyme and varied measure, sings of the love, the longing, the parting, and the griefs of the Islanders, heightened here and there with homely philosophy, or tinged with the superstition still lingering in the scattered hamlets or lonely farmhouses of [[isle of Man|Ellan Vannin]]. The [[Manx English|dialect]] verse, in which most of the poems are written, presents an almost insuperable obstacle to English readers, but if this difficulty can be surmounted, there is in the volume ample reward for the trouble involved"<ref>The Manchester City news quoted in 'Cushag's Poems: An English Paper’s Review’, in ''The Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society'', Vol 5 #1, 1908, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq04350.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref>
</blockquote>

==Theatre==
In 1908 Cushag published ''Peel Plays'',<ref>''Peel Plays'' by Cushag, Douglas: G & L Johnson, 1908, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/pp1908/index.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> a collection of three short plays: ‘Rosy Basins’, ‘The Lazy Wife’ and ‘Eunys (or the Dalby Maid)’. They were produced in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] by [[The Peel Players]] thanks to Sophia Morrison.<ref>'Miss Sophia Morrison: In Memoriam’ by P. W. Caine, in ''Mannin'', Vol V No. 9, May 1917, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v9p499.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> The plays show Cushag's deep interest in Manx folklore, as they are stage re-workings of various folk tales. Written in the [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]] dialect and with a realist tone, the plays are a clear defence of the Manx folk heritage against the encroachment of modern scientific rationalism. This is shown most clearly in 'Eunys (or the Dalby Maid)', where the foundling daughter returns to her fairy family to escape the unjust and destructive influence of the progressive English priest.<ref>'Eunys (Or The Dalby Maid)' by Cushag, in ''Peel Plays'', Douglas: G & L Johnson, 1908, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/pp1908/eunys.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> The plays focus on women, children and family and so stand out in Manx literature, which was, at that time, otherwise dominated by traditional male types.

She wrote other plays, including the collection, ''Glen Aldyn Plays'', which included the play, 'The Christmas Pudding', which was performed in 1915 in Glen Auldyn by the theatre group, the Glen people.<ref name="Radcliffe" /><ref>'Notices of Books' in ''Mannin'', Vol III No. 5, May 1915, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v5p309.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> Kermode's longer dramas include 'Mylecharaine' and 'The Quakers of Ballafayle'.<ref name="Radcliffe" />

==Folklore==
Cushag was also involved in the collection of Manx [[Folkloristics|folklore]]. This was particularly encouraged through her friendship with [[Sophia Morrison]]. Having first met in 1907, they soon became good friends and Cushag would accompany Morrison on field trips to collect folklore.<ref>

Letter from Sophia Morrison to J.J. Kneen, 10 August 1907, mnhl, ms 1086/18 c., quoted in [https://www.academia.edu/1503824/_On_the_Manx_Quest._Sophia_Morrison_and_Josephine_Kermode ''“On the Quest”: Sophia Morrison and Josephine Kermode''] by Stephen Miller</ref> Cushag was especially useful in this respect as she was a fluent [[Manx language|Manx]] speaker, having been brought up with the language from her childhood.<ref>Letter from Sophia Morrison to J.J. Kneen, 10 August 1907, quoted in [https://www.academia.edu/1503824/_On_the_Manx_Quest._Sophia_Morrison_and_Josephine_Kermode ''”On the Quest: Sophia Morrison and Josephine Kermode''] by Stephen Miller</ref> Her fluency in Manx also gave birth to at least one piece of literature, a folk story in Manx Gaelic entitled ''Harry-Crab as yn Mob-beg'', published in 1913.<ref>Published in ''Mannin'', Vol I. No. 2, November 1913, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p124.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref> Although her role with Morrison was mainly as a companion in her folklore collecting, Cushag also contributed a number of short folklore pieces as "Folklore Notes" in the publication, [[Mannin (journal)|''Mannin'']].<ref>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/vol5.htm ''Mannin'' Vol. III No. 4, May 1915] and [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/vol6.htm Vol. IV No. 6, November 1915]</ref> Upon Morrison's death at the age of 57 in January 1917, Cushag dedicated a poem to her memory in the final edition of ''Mannin'', which came out in May of that year.<ref>''Mannin'', Vol V No. 9, May 1917, available on [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v9p504.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref>

==''Ellan Vannin'' and ''Manx Melodies''==
In 1911 came Cushag's second collection of poems, ''Ellan Vannin''. In 1913 she had a large number of her poems collected in ''A Book of Manx Poetry'', edited by [[William Cubbon]], an anthology covering the entire history of poetry from the Isle of Man.<ref>''A Book of Manx Poetry'' by William Cubbon, Douglas: Manx Language Society, 1913, available from [https://archive.org/details/bookofmanxpoetry00cubb www.archive.org]</ref> She had various individual other poems published in places such as the ''[[Isle of Man Courier|Ramsey Courier]]'', [[Mannin (journal)|''Mannin'']] (the journal of the [[Manx Gaelic Society|Manx Language Society]], edited by Sophia Morrison) and ''Ellan Vannin'' (the magazine of the World Manx Association). Some of these poems were collected together with those of her prior two publications and some original pieces to make the 1922 book, ''Manx Melodies''. One of her most notable poems from this collection is ''Traa-dy-Liooar''. The title of the poem is a common Manx phase which translates into English as "time enough":

<blockquote>
'''Traa-dy-Liooar'''<br />
<br />
There's a wickad little falla that goes among us here,<br />
An' the wickadness thass at him is tellin' far an' near;<br />
He's prowlin' in the haggart an' in at every dhure,<br />
An' coaxin' an' persuadin', an' his name is Traa-dy-Liooar.<br />
<br />
The house is all through others, the childher's late for school,<br />
The man is spendin' all his time in lookin' for a tool,<br />
The wumman's tired thremendjus with clearin' up the flure,<br />
An' the wan that's doin' all the jeel is wickad Traa-dy-Liooar.<br />
<br />
The fields is full of cushag, the gates is darned with gorse,<br />
You'll hardly see the harness for the mire upon the horse;<br />
The cows is shoutin' shockin', an' puzzlin' them for sure,<br />
Is the waitin' doin' on them at that tejus Traa-dy-Liooar.<br />
<br />
There's a power of foes within us, and enemies without,<br />
But the wan that houls the candle is that little lazy lout;<br />
So just you take an' scutch him, an' put him to the dhure,<br />
An' navar let him in again, that tejus Traa-dy-Liooar.<ref>''Manx Melodies'', Douglas: G & L Johnson, 1922, available from [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/mm1922/p27.htm www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook]</ref>
</blockquote>

==Later life==
It was in 1922, the year in which ''Manx Melodies'' was published, that Cushag moved with her brother to [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], the island's capital, when P.M.C. was appointed the first Curator of the newly formed [[Manx National Heritage#Museums|Manx Museum]].<ref name="Radcliffe" /> They first lived at Clifton House on Finch Road<ref>''The Manx Year Book, 1925'', Douglas: The Norris Modern Press, 1925, pp.124–5</ref> and then 6 Primrose Avenue.<ref>''The Manx Year Book, 1927'', Douglas: The Norris Modern Press, 1927, pp.147</ref> She remained in Douglas for the next ten years, until her brothers’ sudden death in 1932.<ref name="Woolley" /> Now aged 80, Cushag moved to live with her sister, Cherill, in [[Bournemouth]] where she died five years later on 15 February 1937.<ref name="Radcliffe" /> She is buried in Maughold Parish Churchyard, Isle of Man.<ref>Grave details available at: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199287110/margaret-letitia_josephine-kermode</ref>
