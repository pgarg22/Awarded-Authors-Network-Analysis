началось то что можно называть нормальным издательским путём и издательской историей на этой схеме видно что то что устроила цру с одной стороны было благом потому что книжка была напечатана и возможно из за выхода этого цру шного русского издания пастернак получил нобелевскую премию подчёркиваю возможно этих документов нет я предполагаю что он все таки получил из за цру шного издания но я оговариваю это очень тщательно в каком смысле из за этого мог ли получить без этого почему нобелевский комитет как гласит легенда дважды подчёркиваю легенда я этого не утверждаю пусть мне этого никто не приписывает что необходимо было русское издание для того чтобы нобелевский комитет смог присудить свою премию пастернаку в 1958 году это положительная сторона дела что книга была выпущена а

издательским путём и издательской историей на этой схеме видно что то что устроила цру с одной стороны было благом потому что книжка была напечатана и возможно из за выхода этого цру шного русского издания пастернак получил нобелевскую премию подчёркиваю возможно этих документов нет я предполагаю что он все таки получил из за цру шного издания но я оговариваю это очень тщательно в каком смысле из за этого мог ли получить без этого почему нобелевский комитет как гласит легенда дважды подчёркиваю легенда я этого не утверждаю пусть мне этого никто не приписывает что необходимо было русское издание для того чтобы нобелевский комитет смог присудить свою премию пастернаку в 1958 году это положительная сторона дела что книга была выпущена а отрицательная это то что рынок был испорчен access
